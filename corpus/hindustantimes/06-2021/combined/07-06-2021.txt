As the two national parties set up committees or sent observers, there was a striking difference is in the method used by both — with each claiming that their mechanism was more democratic and more representative.Also Read | Will resign if high command asks: YediyurappaBut is the effective handling of dissent related to just the measures that the party bosses take? Or could it be a deeper reflection of how strong the individual party is, in terms of electoral strength at a particular moment? Hindustan Times spoke to leaders in both parties and dissident camps to understand how the tools may be different in both camps, but the fallout could often end up being the same.For the Congress, trouble in the north The most visible trouble at present for a CM can be seen in Punjab. Till just six weeks ago, Amarinder Singh, the 79-year-old army veteran turned politician, looked invincible. The farm agitation after the Centre brought in the three farm laws eroded the standing of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) due to their association with their former allies, the BJP, even though the party walked out of the government last year. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was not displaying the same energy or appeared to command the same appeal as they had in 2017, and was witnessing an exodus of leaders and activists to the Congress.And yet, in just a matter of weeks, there is a three-member committee headed by Rajya Sabha member of Parliament (MP) and leader of the opposition in the upper house, Mallikarjun Kharge, sitting in Delhi, listening to state legislators talk about why they are unhappy. Casual observers put it down to Singh’s squabble with former cricketer-turned television personality-turned politician Navjot Singh Sidhu.But HT has learnt that many of the 77 Congress members of legislative assembly (MLAs) in the state have a different problem — they don’t get enough facetime with their Captain. While one person told the committee that the CM wasn’t even available in his official residence, preferring to spend time in a farmhouse outside Chandigarh, others complained that the CM had left everything to bureaucrats.“The Captain not being accessible is an old problem,” said a senior Punjab Congress leader. “What’s new is that a lot of work has been delegated to the bureaucrats. This then leaves the MLAs at their mercy and that’s what the MLAs resent.” The particular bureaucrat who is seen as the CM’s right hand is Punjab principal secretary Suresh Kumar. Kumar and his team, if the CM’s critics are to be believed, take most of the decisions and the politicians resent asking them for help.Congress MLAs have also spoken of more generic issues — why there wasn’t any incremental movement in the 2015 sacrilege case which involved desecration of the holy Sikh text and led to police firing and was attributed as one of the factors why the Akalis lost? Why wasn’t Punjab’s drug problem solved? Why weren’t all the 2017 poll promises delivered? Even loyal Congressmen such as Rahul Gandhi favourite Ravneet Singh Bittu echo high-profile dissenters like Sidhu in voicing concern about these issues.“This happens before an election in every party. It’s a very good thing to hear everyone and I can promise you that Punjab will the springboard for the Congress’s revival in the rest of the country,” said state finance minister Manpreet Badal.For the BJP, trouble in the southThe problem in Karnataka is similar for the BJP, with an important caveat — elections are still two years away. BS Yeddyurappa at 78 may be younger than the Captain, but in BJP, he is far beyond their unsaid retirement age of 75.Yeddyurappa is the tallest Lingayat leader in the state and he was also the man who opened up the south for the BJP. But when municipal election results came out at the end of April, revealing losses in his own area, it started off a quiet bout of rebellion in the ranks. Just like in Punjab, MLAs in Karnataka started talking about the CM’s unilateral style of taking decisions.“A BJP MP is called for a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi every year. He is called at about 7pm to his home along with other MPs of the state and for the next couple of hours, we get to give him honest feedback — for instance, which schemes are working, which aren’t. We feel heard. There is no such mechanism to give feedback to the CM, to ask him to help with our development works,’’ said one of the BJP MPs.In fact, development is the underlying thread in all of the complaints. MPs or MLAs need to constantly work with CMs if they want to look good for their constituents, and if they want to ensure that some development work such as a railway line extension or any other constituency-specific project is to be completed. If the CM doesn’t give local clearances or if that’s delayed, MLAs or MPs of any state look inefficient.Of course, for Yeddyurappa, what has become a major problem was the decision to sell 3,667 acres of land to Jindal Steel in Ballari. As four MLAs pointed out to the CM in a letter, how could Yeddyurappa’s cabinet clear a decision which the party had opposed when it was in the opposition during the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government?Yeddyurappa’s critics point out that there are five-term MLAs in his cabinet and this kind of miscalculation can be avoided.“Our high command has taken a serious view of giving away 3,666 acres of land at ₹1.2 lakh per acre. Also, the Centre is not happy with the Covid-19 management,’’ said Yeddyurappa’s detractor in chief and MLA, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal.But the CM’s son and party MP BY Raghavendra says that these critics have never spoken openly, and these current problems were minor glitches.“The Jindal issue is a state government land issue,” he said. “There has been a show of support for the CM from the Centre, and 30-40 MLAs have come out openly for him. And if you ask about his age, then anyone will tell you that he continues to be very active. Apart from that one exception (loss in civic polls), he has won all other elections.’’The distinct management stylesRaghavendra’s brother, Vijayendra, hit the headlines last month when he accompanied the state home minister, Basavaraj Bommai, for a meeting with Amit Shah on the rising Covid cases, instead of the CM. The CM’s critics said that the central leadership was coming around to replacing Yeddyurappa, and the CM was willing to play along if his son was accommodated. This was all denied by the CM’s spokespersons but the key difference in the BJP and the Congress’s dealings lay with what was visible in both camps.When Yeddyurappa’s detractors — tourism minister CP Yogeshwar and MLA Arvind Bellad — came to Delhi ostensibly with their list of complaints against the CM, they did not manage to get an appointment with either Amit Shah or PM Modi. There were no photo-ops with Delhi leaders, which meant that there was not going to be any dirty laundry washing in public. They both went back and while the detractors in Delhi and in Bengaluru didn’t stop their plotting, the issue failed to get traction and gave the liberty to the high command to take a call when the time was right.Contrast that with what’s happening in Punjab. Just like the Karnataka CM is central to BJP’s fortunes, the Punjab CM is indispensable to the Congress’s future plans, but the central leadership chose to make a very public show of listening to his critics. Instead of sending an observer to Chandigarh to speak to individual MLAs, they summoned all, including the CM to Delhi. His bete noire, Navjot Sidhu’s timeline is full of his pictures with Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi to drive home the point that he drew his strength from them instead of the CM. This, even when his critics like Partap Singh Bajwa don’t demand his removal but ask for a change in his style of functioning.The BJP says that it’s not like the party refuses to listen to dissenters but instead of only hearing from the disgruntled MLA, it also relies on different channels. They start getting feedback from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and other sister organisations to understand if grievances against the CM are valid or not.“The difference between us and the Congress is trust,” said BJP’s national general secretary Arun Singh, in charge of Karnataka. “People trust what the central leadership has to say because they listen to people on the ground and understand them. The Congress, meanwhile, is far removed from the ground and doesn’t understand regional leaders.’’Not surprisingly, the Congress disagrees. The party says that the BJP only has a veneer of control and Congress’s processes are far more democratic. For instance, party leaders point out, instead of someone deciding and passing orders in Delhi, wasn’t the party doing the right thing by listening to all through the committee for Punjab?“BJP is an expert at resort politics and Operation Kamal (a reference to efforts to install BJP-led governments even in states where it may not have a majority through defections). The Congress leadership listens to its elected representatives and party office bearers and takes decisions democratically. On the other hand, the BJP high command has no clue on how to solve the factionalism in Karnataka BJP,’’ said Karnataka Congress member, Srivatsa YB.The role of troubleshooters and crisis managers There are two views on these approaches to dealing with infighting, which as every politician knows, exists in every party and every state in varying degrees.The first is the view that the Congress, by its very nature, is more fluid and encompasses varying and sometimes widely differing points of view. There is a severe erosion of the ideological bind that kept the party united, with a common purpose, despite differing views, at different moments in Indian history. In contrast, the BJP is peopled by cadres schooled in a common pro-Hindutva ideology and the culture of cadres has an inbuilt discipline which stays with BJP leaders for life.“However much there may be rumblings and discontent within, there is the discipline that comes from a culture of totalitarianism,” said Sunil Jakhar, the Congress’s chief in Punjab about the BJP. “We believe in conciliation but yes, I agree, some amount of discipline may be good for the party in the long run.”This may be a philosophical view of the problem but there is also a more real challenge that the Congress is facing in recent times — the lack of experienced crisis managers. Leaders such as Pranab Mukherjee, Ahmed Patel, Margaret Alva and Ambika Soni were usually deployed to broker truce when those in states were at loggerheads. They had the heft and authority that regional leaders found difficult to ignore.“They appointed Ajay Maken to deal with the fight between Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan but do you think Gehlot will listen to him?’’ said one party leader.The BJP may like to believe that they are better equipped to deal with dissent but just a decade ago, things were totally different. Then, just like now, Yeddyurappa was CM, and he faced corruption charges and the rebellion against him lingered for three long years from 2008 to 2011 till he stepped down. The only difference was that the BJP was not in power at the Centre then.“It’s simple- if you come from a position of strength at the Centre, then you can deal with dissenters in the state. But when Delhi is weak for either party, then it is the regional satraps who rule,’’ said Rasheed Kidwai, author and fellow at the Observer Research Foundation.The BJP’s challenge The BJP may be all powerful in Delhi, but Karnataka isn’t their only problem. Next door in Uttar Pradesh, a range of MLAs, Union Minister Santosh Gangwar and other party functionaries criticising the state’s Covid-19 management in public letters to CM Yogi Adityanath. This has the leadership worried about what it means for the elections next year — elections that may well define the contours of the next national battle in 2024. The party and the RSS had extensive meetings in the state, and for now, the central leadership has decided to back Adityanath as the CM face — but is keen on ensuring correctives. This may well result in some enhanced rifts both within the state unit, and between the CM and the central leadership as elections draw closer — though, to be sure, all leaders have kept up an appearance of cordiality.The Congress also has a problem in Rajasthan where they brokered peace between CM Ashok Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot ten months ago, but that was contingent upon certain promises being fulfilled. Pilot is now reminding the party of these promises.Pilot said, “I was given to understand that there would be swift action by the committee, but now half of the term is done, and those issues haven’t been resolved. It is unfortunate that so many of the party workers who worked and gave their all for getting us the mandate are not being heard.” One of his supporters (an MLA) has already resigned, and Delhi is aware that the issue could blow up any time soon.But back to the immediate crises in the north and the south for the two national parties, the problems are not resolved for either.Yeddyurappa may have bought some time but senior BJP leaders know that they must address atleast some of the concerns — if the Congress’s former CM Siddarammaiah, and powerful state leader, DK Shivakumar, bury the hatchet, the BJP is aware it will be a formidable combine for Yeddyurappa to tackle on his own. But the time the next elections come around, the CM will also be 81. If the high command wants to effect a change, it will need to do so with enough time before polls so that a new CM has some time to adjust. Could there be a transition like in Gujarat where Vijay Rupani took over from Anandiben Patel midway? Observers don’t rule it out — except for one crucial caveat. Patel faded quietly into gubernatorial positions; Yeddyurappa may not play along as quietly.As for the Captain and the Congress, the Congress’s internal assessment has concluded that Singh is their best bet as the CM face but he also needs to do more. Sidhu, according to the party’s calculation, draws in crowds and attracts a certain set of voters which the Congress cannot afford to lose. And this will require the leadership to keep them both happy. Given the acrimony, this is not going to be an easy task.On paper, both the BJP and the Congress now say the situation vis a vis intra party dissent, in all states, is under control and things are going according to plan. That is, till they don’t.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/managing-intra-party-dissent-the-contrasting-tale-of-the-bjp-and-the-congress-101623058773966.html

Addressing the party office-bearers in a meeting held in Gorakhpur, Bansal said the people across the state were aware of the achievements of the Modi government as party workers had enlightened them about the development and welfare schemes launched by the Centre. With eight months left for the UP assembly elections, the workers should now propagate the development and welfare schemes launched by the Yogi government in rural and urban areas, he said. Bansal was in Gorakhpur to review the preparations for the 2022 assembly election as well as to discuss the strategy for the zila panchayat chairman and block pramukh elections. The office-bearers of BJP Gorakhpur region unit, district presidents and in-charges of 12 districts were present in the meeting. A BJP leader familiar with the developments in the meeting said Bansal directed the party leaders and office-bearers to take the achievements of the Yogi Adityanath government to each household. The people should be made aware of the schemes launched by the state government for their welfare and development, he said. Bansal collected feedback about the zila panchayat chairman and block pramukh elections, saying the office-bearers should focus on shortcomings in the election strategy and try to fill the gaps. Due to surge in the Covid cases during the panchayat election, the BJP failed to get the desired result as the BJP voters did not come out to vote. To give a message to the voters before the 2022 assembly election, the BJP should win maximum zila panchayat chairman and block pramukh posts, he said. To enlighten the people about the achievements of the central and state governments, the social media teams should be strengthened at district and division level, he said.

As the restrictions are now being lifted in part, we have decided to observe the case tally for a week’s time to see if they continue to drop or at least don’t increase. After that only will we open both the OBS and the Surajpur sanctuary by next week,” said the divisional forest officer (DFO), GB Nagar, PK Srivastava.He added that the infrastructure work, including the construction of six huts at OBS, will continue.The OBS and Surajpur reserve forests were shut in March 2020 when the district experienced first Covid-19 cases and a nationwide lockdown was imposed. Both the habitats were reopened on September 15, 2020 with advisories.The sanctuary, which is home to about 350 species of birds, is spread over an area of 400 hectares of which about 60% is water bodies and attracts a number of migratory birds during winters and passage migrants during summers. The migratory birds start arriving in the sanctuary by October, while their strength reaches the peak by December.According to the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC)-2021 by Wetlands International South Asia and the divisional forest department of Gautam Budh Nagar in January 2021, a total of 8,068 birds of a total of 73 species of water birds were counted. Of these, 27 were resident and local migratory species and 46 were migratory species. Among the main attractions were Black-headed Ibis (Indian resident), Black-tailed Godwit (Winter migratory from Central Asia), Common Pochard (Winter migratory from Central Asia), Painted Stork (Indian resident species), Greater Spotted Eagle (Winter migratory migrates from Central Asia), Oriental Darter (Resident), River Lapwing (Resident), Ferruginous Duck (Winter migratory from Central Asia).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/okhla-bird-sanctuary-surajpur-wetland-to-open-next-week-101623089317092.html
07-06-2021||Kolkata||Guv, Moitra continue to trade barbs||The war of words over the alleged appointment of his relatives at Raj Bhavan escalated on Monday after West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar termed the charges by Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra as “factually wrong” and called it a “distraction strategy” from the “deteriorating law and order situation in the state”.The TMC lawmaker, however, refused to withdraw her remarks and urged the governor to explain the appointments of six officers on special duty (OSDs), who she alleged are related either to him or other Raj Bhawan officers.On Sunday, Moitra claimed that three of Dhankhar’s own relatives, two relatives of a former aide-de-camp (EDC) and one relative of his present EDC were appointed as OSDs at the governor’s house. She added that the law and order situation in Bengal would improve if the governor left with his “extended family”.Responding to the allegations through a series of tweets, the governor on Monday said that none of the six appointees were part of his close family and that four of them belonged to another caste. “Assertion @MahuaMoitra in tweet & Media that six coterminous appointee OSDs in personal staff are relatives is FACTUALLY WRONG. OSDs are from three states and belong to four different castes. None of them is part of close family. Four of them are not from my caste or state,” he posted on Twitter.The governor added that the TMC legislator’s tweets were a part of the “distraction strategy to divert attention from the deteriorating law and order situation in the state”.“This is unfolding of ‘distraction strategy’ to divert attention from alarming law and order scenario @MamataOfficial. Would continue undeterred and with zeal to serve the people of state and vindicate my oath of office under Article 159 of the Constitution,” Dhankhar tweeted.Taking note of one of his tweets, Moitra tweeted: “Asking Uncleji to lay out right here what antecedents of the appointees are & how each one got into Raj Bhavan. Do it NOW. BJP IT Cell can’t get you out of this one Uncleji.. And I don’t think Vice President of India also happening for you.”BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said, “Raj Bhawan officials are appointed by the state government, not the governor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/guv-moitra-continue-to-trade-barbs-101623089161658.html
07-06-2021||Noida||Metro services on Aqua Line to resume from June 9||Noida: The Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) on Monday said that it will resume operations on its Aqua Line from June 9 as the partial Covid curfew has been lifted. However, the metro services will be available only on weekdays from 7am to 8pm, officials said.The officials said the NMRC is making necessary preparations at all of its stations and on trains as well, so as to ensure that passengers follow social distancing norms and other Covid-19 protocols. The services were suspended on May 1 after the second wave of the pandemic had ravaged the Guatam Budh Nagar district.“As the weekend curfew is still in place, train service will not be operated on weekends,” said Ritu Maheshwari, managing director, NMRC. The officials said that passenger screening teams will be deployed at each station to check the temperature of commuters and to ensure that they follow Covid guidelines such as wearing a mask and maintaining social distance. The parking facility will be available at Sector 51 station only, they said.Maheshwari said that the social distancing norms will be strictly followed on NMRC premises and inside the trains. The NMRC has also tweaked the frequency of trains during peak and non-peak hours. During peak hours (8am to 11am and 5pm to 8pm), the trains will be available at 15 minutes interval (as against 7.30 minutes on normal days) and during non-peak hours the frequency will be 30 minutes (earlier 10 minutes). Notably, on normal days, the train services are available from 6am to 10pm. The NMRC in a statement said it would continue to run fast trains once the service resumes on Wednesday. Of the 21 stations on the Aqua Line, trains during peak hours skip a total of 10 stations which usually have lower ridership. This move is aimed at reducing travel time between Noida and Greater Noida by nine minutes.Meanwhile, NMRC on Monday also issued a fresh tender to hire a developer for the Aqua Line’s extension to Greater Noida West -- 9.6km route from Sector 51 station to Sector 2 in Greater Noida West. VV Reddy, deputy general manager, NMRC, said that the elevated extension will have five metro stations – Sector 122 and Sector 123 in Noida, and Sector 4, Ecotech 12 and Sector 2 in Greater Noida West. “NMRC had issued three tenders earlier, but we did not get suitable applicants. We have made some changes in the tender documents to attract more applicants/developers,” Reddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/metro-services-on-aqua-line-to-resume-from-june-9-101623089256619.html

The process to acquire land from farmers had been stalled on April 22, due to the rise in Covid-19 cases. The authority was supposed to acquire 600 hectares of land through camps in villages, where all formalities related with acquisition were to be completed.“As restrictions have been eased, we have resumed the camps to complete the process. The land is to be acquired to be sold to domestic and foreign firms to set up industrial units,” said Deep Chand, additional chief executive officer of the authority.The authority has started with setting up a camp in Ladpura village.“There will be a total of 12 camps in as many villages organised from June 7 to July 2. One camp has been organised in Ladpura village,” said Chand.The remaining 11 villages include Powari, Sunpura, Bhola Rawal, Jon Samana, Kheri, Bhanauta, Imaliya, Vaidpura, Dhoom Manikpur, Muradpur and Dadupur.The camps will be organised from 10:30am to 4:30pm. Officials said farmers need to bring and sign a consent letter, land title documents such as Khasra-Khatauni, and a no-dues document. Once these are signed, the authority will process the applications and acquire the land. These camps will be organised in primary schools in all villages of Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/as-covid-curfew-restrictions-ease-land-acquisition-process-resumes-in-greater-noida-101623089196545.html
07-06-2021||Noida||Noida unlocks after 37 days||Noida: It was unlock 2.0 in Gautam Budh Nagar on Monday as curbs imposed in lieu of the partial Corona curfew were lifted after a gap of 37 days. Markets, government offices, religious places and public transport were allowed to resume operations.The relaxations have come into place outside containment zones between 7am and 7pm, while weekend as well as night curfews will continue to be in place.According to Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), there was a 30% increase in traffic in the district compared to earlier.“Even when the partial curfew was in place over the last month, there was no restriction on movement of vehicles during the day, hence there has only been a 30% increase in traffic on the road on Monday. Most of the increase in traffic was of vehicles going to Delhi as government offices have reopened,” he said.He added that public transport drivers were sensitised regarding the guidelines. “Since it was the first day on Monday, traffic police sensitised and raised awareness among auto-rickshaw and e-rickshaw drivers regarding social distancing guidelines,” said Saha.Lal Babu, an auto-rickshaw driver in Noida and union leader of the Noida Auto Rickshaw Chalak Association, said auto drivers hoped for business near Metro stations in the city on Monday. “We have anyway been running with social distancing guidelines and do not take more than two passengers aboard. On Monday morning, there was a slight improvement in our daily earnings as Delhi Metro’s Blue and Pink lines re-started and there were a number of passengers who required transportation to go towards the Sector 15 area, where some government offices are located,” he said.Meanwhile, shop owners said that while shops opened up after more than a month, there was no uptick in sales. “Barely any customers visited the market on Monday. However, shop owners are hoping that by next week, sales will increase as auspicious dates for weddings are closing in,” said SK Jain, president of the Sector 18 Market Association.While most industries and factories were operational during the last one month of the corona curfew, Vishard Gautam, president of the Indian Industries Association, said that manufacturing units of domestic appliances such as refregerators, washing machines, etc., and light electronics such as computers, televisions, etc., had been shut as their operations only run when the markets are open.“Such factories started functioning from Monday but most of them are experiencing issues with labour resources, since a majority of the workers returned to their hometowns when the partial corona curfew was imposed. Now, factory owners have called them and they will be back by Friday only, after which operations will commence in full force,” he said.On the other hand, district magistrate Suhas LY said that as active cases in the district have gone down to 400, the curfew will remain suspended between 7am and 7pm. “The first day of the unlocking went on smoothly. Our enforcement teams have ensured that Covid protocols and guidelines issued by the administration are followed,” he said.The district on Monday reported 34 new cases of Covid-19 and discharged 216 people in the last 24 hours. The active cases in the district stand at 400. The death toll in the district is at 460, with one more fatality in the past 24 hours.As per a statement from the state government, Uttar Pradesh recorded its test positivity rate at lower than 0.3% on Monday.

07-06-2021||Noida||Low turnout in Ghaziabad markets after curfew restrictions lifted||Ghaziabad: Markets in trans-Hindon and city areas in Ghaziabad witnessed a low turnout on Monday as the city opened up for the first time since April 30 after the partial Corona curfew was relaxed. The district police said that the crowd remained low at about 30-40% of the usual strength. The major markets of the city, including those in Turab Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Vasundhara’s Sector 15, Vaishali’s Sector 4, Indirapuram, and in Sahibabad witnessed low footfall as majority of shoppers were those who had come for urgent tasks.“I came to get my mobile phone repaired and also took my car to the mechanic. These things had been pending in light of the curfew,” said Lagan Gupta, a resident of Abhay Khand in Indirapuram.The partial Corona curfew was imposed from the night of April 30 and continued in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar till June 7. It was relaxed as the number of active cases in each of the districts fell below the 600-mark, which was a condition set by the state government. According to the state control room figures of Monday, active cases in Ghaziabad stood at 480 while it was 400 for GB Nagar.“The curfew went on for over a month, and people could not go out to markets, etc. I went to the market on Monday to purchase daily wear clothes and slippers, and also got some gadgets repaired which were lying defunct. It was a visit only for essential works,” said Seema Malhotra, a visitor at Vaishali Sector 4 market.As per government directions, the markets can remain open from 7am to 7pm while weekly closure would be on weekends which have been reserved, for cleaning and sanitisation of public areas.“Most people who came to markets were wearing masks and were visiting only for essential things, such as purchases for weddings or getting a haircut, besides others who came to buy daily-wear and daily-use items. The footfall was also affected due to the weather being on Monday. We have also asked our association members to observe all Covid protocols and request customers to observe the same,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of the Vyapari Ekta Samiti – Indirapuram in Ghaziabad. Markets in city areas also saw sparse footfall.“There was no rush in markets, and this is helpful in a way to maintain social distancing. After having suffered during the second wave, people are still fearful of Covid and are avoiding going out, unless necessary. The footfall at Turab Nagar market was about 30%-40% on Monday, in comparison to normal days. Since the duration of opening markets has increased, there will be less rush now,” said Rajneesh Bansal, chairperson of the Turab Nagar Vyapar Mandal.“On the first day of re-opening, the traders and shop owners also took up cleaning activities for hours before the shops were opened for business,” he added. During the curfew, the shops of essential commodities were allowed to open up from 7am to 11am only. Police officers said checks are being conducted in markets. “We estimate the crowd strength was about 30%-40% or even less on Monday. Our teams conducted checks regularly and there were many who were found not wearing masks and were penalised. We will continue checking for erring persons; night checking will also continue,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2).The police in May issued 86,249 penalties for not wearing masks while 19,579 were issued in the first six days of June.The district health department, meanwhile, said that the daily number of new Covid cases has come down.“The number of daily cases has come down and for the past eight days (since May 31) the fresh cases are below 50 each day. Even though the partial Corona curfew has been relaxed, we will continue with about 8,000 tests per day. The testing will be able to detect if the virus is spreading more after relaxations,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.According to the official figures of the district health department, Ghaziabad had a recovery rate of 98.29% on Monday, with a sample positivity rate at 0.44% so far in the month. The sample positivity rate in May was 7.65% while it was 8.84% in April this year. Sample positivity rate refers to the number of samples testing positive per 100 samples tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/low-turnout-in-ghaziabad-markets-after-curfew-restrictions-lifted-101623089077231.html
07-06-2021||Noida||Capacity enhancement proposed for new oxygen plants in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: The construction work of 10 new oxygen plants in the district is likely to get complete by the end of this month. However, two of them need capacity enhancement as per the state government’s new direction that the new plants should be a minimum capacity of generating 150 litres gas per minute (LPM), officials said. The two plants -- one at Sanjay Nagar district hospital and another at the MMG district hospital -- will have a capacity of about 140 LPM each. The MMG district hospital will have two oxygen plants, the officials said. The other plants are being developed at ESIC Hospital at Sahibabad , district women hospital, one each at four community health centres at Loni, Muradnagar, Modinagar and Dasna, besides one at Bhojpur primary health centre. These government facilities have a provision of 521 beds at present, said the officials. The decision to set up new plants was taken up after acute oxygen shortage hampered health-care services during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. “All the proposed plants have a capacity of 240 LPM each, except the one at Sanjay Nagar and one of the two at MMG district hospital. When the plants were proposed, there were no specific directions about their capacities. So, we will get one additional plant each installed at MMG hospital and at Sanjay Nagar hospital,” said Virendra Kumar, general manager of district industries department. Another official familiar with the development said that eight of the 10 oxygen plants were sanctioned through CSR funds. “If capacity enhancement is done, it would require roping in more CSR funds. So, it will be difficult to get more funds than already sanctioned by private organisations. Further, oxygen plants should ideally be built at district hospitals and not at the CHCs or the PHC. It would be better if through CSR funds, high capacity oxygen plants are installed at all district hospitals,” said the officer while requesting not to be identified.The health department officials explained that one oxygen bed requires 10 LPM of oxygen supply while one bed (with ventilator) requires 24 LPM of oxygen supply. “So, a plant of 140LPM capacity will be able to supply oxygen to only 14 oxygen beds. So, the capacity enhancement is required. Initial works like surveys and tenders are complete. It is expected that the plants will get complete by June 30,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. Meanwhile, at Sanjay Nagar hospital, an old oxygen plant lying defunct since last year was made operational. HT on April 24 had highlighted the issue. “The old plant is made operational with one-third of its capacity, as it still requires some equipment which is expected to arrive in another 3-4 weeks,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/capacity-enhancement-proposed-for-new-oxygen-plants-in-ghaziabad-101623089076553.html

07-06-2021||Kolkata||Nurse saves newborns, mothers from fire at Chennai’s govt hospital||It was May 26, past 8.30 pm. 35-year-old, P Jayakumar, who finished his duty as a scrub nurse in a couple of C-section surgeries at the Government Kasturba Gandhi Hospital for Women and Children, was busy writing charts outside the operation theatre when he heard insistent screams.Jayakumar rushed to the spot and found a huge plume of smoke emerging outside the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the hospital. A fire had broken out from the AC in the duty doctor’s room adjacent to the NICU where there were more than 40 neonates, including three newborns on a ventilator. Initially, Jayakumar couldn’t see the source of the fire though he had entered the room of the fire.“I couldn’t even see the fire nor the person next to me,” he recalled. “But, I was only thinking of the babies because if it entered the NICU, it would have created a big disaster because neonates can’t tolerate that type of hazardous fog. They will collapse in ten seconds.”Having been trained for fire emergencies seven years ago, Jayakumar ran the operation solely before fire and rescue teams could arrive. When he found the source of the fire, his anxiety gripped him more. The floor below the source of the fire was also the manifold room where additional oxygen cylinders were stored due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This was a second potential disaster. The NICU staff had locked themselves from the inside, switched off all power and oxygen lines and began manual hyperinflation or ventilation for the babies.Jayakumar is asthmatic. “But, at that time I didn’t know from where I got the energy,” he said. “There was no time to give instructions to someone else. My mind was only thinking I’ve to stop the fire.” In half an hour he had emptied 12 fire extinguishers to put out the fire and reduce the thick smog. After bringing the situation under control, Jayakumar collapsed.He was treated in the ICU for five days for multiple problems after he had inhaled large amounts of carbon dioxide and toxic fumes. “My peripheral controls were low and I couldn’t even hold a cup to drink water for the first three days,” he said. He still has breathing difficulties due to his asthmatic condition and has reddish eyes. Despite wearing a PPE, his whole body has been covered with chemicals from the extinguisher. “It was unbearably hot and my skin turned into hash colour but it is getting better,” Jayakumar said.He lives in Ponneri, a town in adjoining Thiruvallur district with his wife and two daughters aged 5 and 3 respectively from where he commutes to Chennai every day.On Friday evening, Jayakumar received a call from state minister for Hindu religious and charitable endowments Sekar Babu, asking him to come with his family to chief minister MK Stalin’s home on the following day. Stalin honoured him for his bravery. “36 infants, 11 children, who were kept in incubators and their mothers were saved due to Mr Jayakumar’s actions,” an official statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/nurse-saves-newborns-mothers-from-fire-at-chennai-s-govt-hospital-101623086979040.html
07-06-2021||Gurugram||Five held for cyber theft of ₹1 crore from 45 Palwal residents||Five persons, including a record keeper from the revenue office of Palwal, were arrested on Sunday for allegedly defrauding over 45 Palwal residents of ₹1 crore in the past 10 days by using their Aadhaar numbers and cloning their fingerprints from records to withdraw money from their bank accounts.The police said the masterminds had prior call centre experience and allegedly bribed officials of the revenue department to gain access to the registry documents which would also contain the Aadhaar details and the fingerprints of those executing the registry. The fraudsters would use the records to shortlist persons whose bank accounts were linked to their Aadhaar numbers and then use cloning machines to duplicate their fingerprints from the records. Armed with this, the gang would carry out Aadhaar enabled transactions and siphon off money from bank accounts without the knowledge of the account holder, police said.The suspects told the police that they had learned the process by watching videos on the internet. The arrested men were identified as Rohit Tyagi (33) of Ghaziabad, Chitranjan (28) of Aurangabad in Bihar, Aamir Hussain (27) of Chapra in Bihar, Kiran (28) of Bihar and Tularam of Palwal. The police received over 45 complaints from Palwal residents between May 24 and June 2, wherein complainants alleged that money was fraudulently withdrawn from their accounts, using their Aadhaar details. Deepak Gehlawat, superintendent of police, Palwal, said, “We started investigations and a team of cyber police was formed on June 2. In all 45 cases, suspects withdrew money from customer accounts using their Aadhaar details. When the team started visiting banks, they were apprised that customers had lodged complaints with them as well,” he said. Gehlawat said they zeroed in June 3on a bank account to which some money was transferred recently and had a balance of ₹10 lakh. “We immediately got the account freezed and got the local address and contact details of the account holder. Meanwhile, we contacted all banks to check the exact amount of money siphoned off from each one of them,” he said. The police said that the account, registered to one of the relatives or acquaintances of the gang members, was being operated by Rohit Tyagi as his phone number was provided as the contact number. The police tracked Tyagiusing his call records, who, after being arrested, shared the whereabouts of his associates in Delhi and Palwal. During questioning, the gang members revealed that they had managed to get registry documents of more than 250 people from the revenue records office. Gehlawat said the suspects bribed a record keeper at the revenue office in Palwal to get hold of the registry documents. They used a machine to create a rubber clone of the fingerprints they lifted from the documents. They also created accounts with electronic transaction processing platforms (e-wallets etc) to facilitate the money transfer, he said.“The suspects checked which Aadhaar card numbers were linked to bank accounts, following which they used Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AePS) to carry out transactions. As soon as the transaction is completed, the money is credited to the e-wallet from where the amount is transferred to their bank accounts,” Gehlawat said. The police said that Tyagi and Chitranjan were the masterminds and had previously worked in illegal call centres to dupe foreign citizens of money on the pretext of providing them technical support for software and appliances. According to the police, Kiran used to transfer the money from the wallets to the bank account that was operated by the masterminds. Gehlawat said Tularam worked as clerks in the revenue office and provided them property-related documents. The police recovered one biometric machine, debit and credit cards, rubber stamps, cloning machines, photo polymer gels, laptops, printer, scanner, lamination machine, 220 cloned fingerprints, passbooks, cheque books and electronic gadgets from their possession. Gehlawat said they have recovered the data of more than 500 people from the arrested men. “They recently bought a Hyundai Venue car for ₹12 lakh. They were planning to target Gurugram residents next and were trying to get hold of a person from the revenue department there,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/five-held-for-cyber-theft-of-1-crore-from-45-palwal-residents-101623086919694.html
07-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls 2022: Hoardings backing Captain surface on Sidhu’s home turf||Hoardings backing Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s leadership in the state elections scheduled early next year have surfaced in Amritsar, which is the home turf of dissident Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu.This has come when Amritsar East MLA Sidhu and a section of Congress ministers and legislators are questioning Amarinder’s performance as the chief minister and cornering him for “lack of action” in the sacrilege cases, prompting the party high command to intervene.To counter this campaign against Amarinder’s leadership, his supporters in Amritsar have put up hoardings declaring “Punjab Da Ik Hi Captain” (Punjab has only one captain), while pitching “#Captainfor2022”. The hoardings were first put up by a Congress student wing leader, and now more and bigger ones have come up at all key points in the city, backed by Amritsar mayor and Captain loyalist Karamjit Singh Rintu.“As Congress workers are saying the situation is ambiguous in terms of the party leadership in the state, I have taken this step, just to clear it in the interest of the party,” said Rintu.The mayor said the Congress government has met the expectations of Punjabis in all aspects, and the opposition is left with no issue to corner it. “You cannot say that Captain Amarinder Singh has committed any kind of corruption. There is no charge against him. Second, he has left no stone unturned in terms of development in our city,” he said.Another local leader and Captain loyalist, who did not wish to be named, said: “One person (Sidhu) has vitiated the atmosphere, and following him, some more ministers and MLAs have opened a front against Captain. Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar has already announced that the next polls will be contested under Captain. Punjab affairs in-charge Harish Rawat has also endorsed him. To not let the rival parties and other detractors exploit this situation, installation of these hoardings is the need of the hour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-2022-hoardings-backing-captain-surface-on-sidhu-s-home-turf-101623086919173.html
07-06-2021||Gurugram||Residents of sectors 50-66 complain about open waste burning||Residents of sectors 50 to 66 complained to the authorities that open waste burning has increased in the city in the past few weeks of the lockdown.On Sunday, residents, under the banner of Citizens for Clean Air, wrote to the authorities about three different waste burning sites within a one-kilometre radius. The sites were identified near South City 2, a group of housing societies in the vicinity and Golf Course Extension Road. Sonali Venkatesh, a resident of Sector 66, said, “Despite several complaints to authorities, open burning of mixed waste in our sector around a nearby condominium happens very often. At least once a week, the collected waste is dumped in open areas and burnt.” Ruchika Sethi Takkar, another resident working for proper waste management in the city who complained about waste burning, said, “Within a one-kilometre radius of my house, waste was being burnt openly at three places on Sunday and what is shocking is that this happens in broad daylight as contractor-based waste collectors have made it a practice of handling waste.” The residents are now planning to write to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram for a systematic approach to end the problems. “Open waste burning is rampantly practised here, so we are asking authorities to conduct a waste mapping exercise of vendors and scrap dealers who burn different types of waste, and exploring if they can be reimbursed for the residue (like copper from wires of electrical waste) that they try to collect from the waste burning process. Another need of the hour is an integrated solid waste management plan for the city so that waste can be scientifically managed,” said Takkar. Meanwhile, teams from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram conducted ground surveys on Monday and said that rigorous awareness campaigns will be conducted against open waste burning. “We have been able to reduce open burning of waste in the city, but controlling it completely is difficult. We have been issuing challans regularly to the offenders and will be conducting sessions with different waste collectors in the city to make them understand the consequences of waste burning to the environment and health,” said a senior MCG official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-of-sectors-50-66-complain-about-open-waste-burning-101623086917767.html

DTCP officials said that farmhouses were being developed in around 60 acres in Kiranki village under Sohna. DTCP officials said that action was taken on Monday by a team of the enforcement wing at Kiranki village, near Vatika resort in Sohna. RS Bhath, district town planner, Gurugram, said the two new farmhouse colonies were being developed in Kiranki and notices were earlier issued to landowners. “Around 60 acres of land was being converted into farmhouse colonies without any permission or licence from the department. We had issued notices to the landowners but they continued to lay road networks, construct plinths and boundary wall, but this is against all rules,” he said. These two colonies were at initial stages of development and a large road network, plinths and boundary walls were demolished on Monday by the team with the help of five earth moving machines. “The offenders were planning to carve out an illegal farmhouse colony in violation of rules. We want to inform the landowners that instead of developing illegal colonies, they should take advantage of the recently announced farmhouse policy and develop property legally,” said Bhath. DTCP officials said that camps will be organised in rural areas to make the landowners aware about the various schemes of the DTCP for development of land and real estate. “We are going to hold camps and also take action against more such colonies in and around Bhondsi where farmhouses are being developed illegally,” said Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-razes-under-construction-farmhouses-in-sohna-101623086917051.html

However, even before I could raise an alarm, two of them went inside the counter area and took away the ₹2,500 kept inside the drawer.”They allegedly assaulted Sikdel and Bahadur when they tried to raise an alarm and pushed both of them on the floor and threatened to kill them. “When they could not find anything else from the shop, they took away my cellphone and left. They closed the door and pulled down the iron shutter of the shop from outside,” Sikdel added.Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (Sadar), said that the victims called their employer 10 minutes after the incident, and informed him about everything. “The owner informed the police control room, and, meanwhile, reached the shop and opened the shutter,” Yadav said, adding that police have collected and scanned CCTV footage from several spots, and are trying to nab the robbers.A case under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 392 (robbery) and 34 (common intention), and relevant sections of the Arms Act was registered at the Sector 50 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/3-men-attack-sapphire-mall-salesman-rob-2-500-at-gunpoint-101623086916297.html

However, the elective surgeries shall still be kept on hold till further orders,” read the order issued by Dr Veena Singh, the DGHS.Gurugram chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Virender Yadav had suspended the OPD services in April, amidst a spike in cases during the second wave of Covid-19. “The order will be implemented with immediate effect. It will take at least a week to start elective surgeries, only after the state issues the guidelines,” said CMO Yadav, adding that private hospitals can also make OPDs fully operational in the next few days.Dr Ritu Garg, zonal director, Fortis Memorial Research Institute (FMRI), said that, at present, they are treating most of the OPD patients through tele-consultancy. “Patients are asked to visit the hospital only if there’s an emergency, to conduct a physical follow up.

07-06-2021||Gurugram||Vaccinations for 18-45 age group remain halted at govt centres||The vaccination for people in the 18-45 age group will continue to remain suspended on Tuesday due to the shortage of Covid-19 vaccine. It has been almost a week now that the inoculation for people above 18 years has been halted at all government facilities.Health officials, however, said that the shortage of vaccine will now be resolved as Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Monday that the Centre will take back full responsibility of vaccination from states, and from June 21, the jab will be given to everyone above 18 years for free.“The Gurugram health department did not receive any vaccine stock from the Haryana health department, for people in the 18-45 age group, for the past one week. However, private hospitals have started vaccination drives and are providing over 10,000 jabs to people above 18 years on a daily basis. Over 30,000 doses are available with the health department for people above 45, which is being inoculated at 37 government healthcare facilities,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer (DIO).Drive likely to resume from June 10According to senior health officials in Haryana, vaccination for people above 18 years is likely to resume from June 10, as the state is likely to get a vaccine stock.Until now, state and private hospitals could procure almost 50% of the vaccine stock directly from the manufacturers, while 50% was supplied by the Centre. State-level data as of June 4 showed that 5,898,869 out of the 6,632,380 doses, allocated by the Centre and state governments, have been administered.According to the health department data, 7,66,263 doses have been administered in Gurugram till now, of which, 12,482 doses were administered on Monday.

07-06-2021||Gurugram||Majority of restaurants to start operations by weekend||After the state government on Sunday allowed resumption of restaurants, hotels, and other hospitality services with 50% capacity, a majority of restaurant associations in Gurugram said on Monday that they will start operations by the upcoming weekend.Popular hubs of Cyber Hub, Sector 29, Horizon One, and Sohna Road continued to wear a deserted look on Monday even as they were allowed to open between 10am and 8pm. Restaurant owners said that the guidelines change often, and restarting operations require investment and logistical planning, with regard to the number of staffers to be recalled. They said that the industry is facing issues in terms of staffing, as most staff members have returned to their hometowns.Rohit Mann, director, Raise the Bar brewery at Clarens Hotel in Sector 29, said that they will keep a watch on the situation for a week before reopening their outlets. “The operation timings are odd as people will only visit during lunch hours. People are now working from home and going out for lunch is a task. People get free late evenings, but by then, the establishments will close and running costs also won’t be recovered,” he said.The footfall will increase in some time as the people won’t step out for dining facilities right now, said restaurateurs in the district.Varun Duggal, head, Alliances at Massive Restaurants Private Limited, said that they are planning to open this weekend. “We will start the operations, with limited staff, and their prime focus is to get the staff vaccinated first. With a limited eight-hour shift, we can only keep a limited staff in one shift. Will increase the same as the footfall increases.”The owners said they are working on the reopening strategy and rentals, to ensure that they do not suffer losses. There are hardly 10% stewards, waiters, and chefs available in Gurugram, the rest have left the district before the lockdown was announced this year. There are about 300 pubs, bars and restaurants, and 25 hotels, wherein liquor is available as part of dine-in services. All these establishments are facing challenges in terms of reopening and closing since March 2020, since the Covid-imposed lockdown.Pushpender Yadav, director, Quaff Microbrewery, said that they need at least 25 days to start operating. “We will have to call back our staff, especially the brewmaster. The cycle of brewing beer takes 25 to 30 days. It’s still easier for restaurants to start operating, but breweries need about a month to clean, set up, and other arrangements. We will resume operating in the first week of July.”Restaurant owners also said that most of the people will step out after they get both the vaccine doses, and they would also expect the restaurant staff to be vaccinated. According to them, it is not possible for the industry to resume business within a day’s notice. They will have to maintain arrangements for social distancing and new hygiene norms and make preparations accordingly, and this requires time.Mayank Bhatt, brand head of Social, said, “With businesses suffering and relying only on delivery, we’re finally starting, hoping all the markets open up and the timings are normalised. Only then does it makes business sense to us. We are also hoping the vaccination drive picks up and things open up properly for F&B establishments to thrive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/majority-of-restaurants-to-start-operations-by-weekend-101623086316931.html
07-06-2021||Gurugram||Aravalli encroachment in Faridabad: Residents seek rehabilitation, action against those responsible||After the Supreme Court on Monday ordered the eviction of thousands of slum dwellers encroaching on the Aravalli forest area in Faridabad district, residents are demanding temporary rehabilitation and action against those who sold land to them decades ago. As many as 10,000 houses are set to be demolished following the order, said residents.Biram Kumar, a resident of the village, said, “The authorities conducted demolition drives in September last year and April this year too, but the people living here are mostly those who used to work in mines and have nowhere else to go. After mining was stopped, they started working as daily wage labourers and construction workers, bought small plots here and built houses.” “If the whole process was illegal, then the land should not have been sold to them. Now, these residents do not have any savings and will soon be rendered homeless. The authorities should take action against those who were involved in duping the slum dwellers,” said Kumar. After the demolition of 300 houses in April, the dwellers of Khori village had approached the Supreme Court for protection, seeking rehabilitation before the demolition of their houses. On April 6, the Khori Gaon Residents’ Welfare Association had also organised a one-day peaceful protest outside the office of the commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad and the deputy commissioner. The land in question is notified under special sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA), which extends protection against land-use change to certain specified Aravalli areas, forests and trees. According to directives of the Supreme Court, the PLPA attracts protection under the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, which states that “no state government or other authority shall make, except with the prior approval of the central government, any order directing that any forest land or any portion thereof may be used for any non-forest purpose.” Nirmal Gorana, the general secretary of Bandhu Mukti Morcha, an organisation that is taking up the cause of the residents, said, “The orders of the Supreme Court must be complied with by the state government, but they should first understand its responsibility and provide temporary rehabilitation within two weeks, before demolishing their (villagers’) houses.” “These people are already facing the brunt of Covid-19 second wave with many losing their jobs and now, with this order, they will have no place to live. We appeal to the state government to provide rehabilitation to all families from Khori village,” said Gorana. When asked about whether rehabilitation will be provided to the dwellers, Garima Mittal, commissioner of Municipal Corporation of Faridabad said, “We will be following the orders of the Supreme Court. We are going through the details of it and take action accordingly.” The official did not clearly state if the authorities are planning to rehabilitate the residents. Meanwhile, environmentalists welcomed the decision and said that even if on small scale, encroachments from the Aravallis must be removed. Sunil Harsana, a wildlife researcher and resident of Faridabad, said, “All encroachments from the Aravalli should be removed as they are harming the ecology. We cannot look into whether this will affect the poor or the rich, as the degradation of the environment is the cost that we are paying here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/aravalli-encroachment-in-faridabad-residents-seek-rehabilitation-action-against-those-responsible-101623086316284.html

The PM's advisors seem to have given him wrong information," he wrote on Twitter.Gehlot congratulated the Congress workers for the Prime Minister's announcement that the Centre will provide free coronavirus vaccines to the states for the inoculation of all above the age of 18 years."I am glad that looking at public sentiments, the PM had to reverse his old decision," he said in another tweet.Congratulating the MPs, MLAs, workers of the Congress and the general public who participated in the party's #SpeakUpForFreeUniversalVaccination online campaign, Gehlot said due to their spirit, the prime minister had to make the announcement, which is a victory of the public sentiment.In another tweet, he said free Covid vaccination by the Centre was the demand since the beginning and he too had requested the Prime Minister in a video-conference on April 23 that vaccination for all beneficiaries above 18 years of age should be conducted by the government of India for free.He said Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other leaders of the opposition have raised their voices against the wrong vaccination policies of the Centre and several states, including Rajasthan, had to approach the Supreme Court over this issue."As a result of this, the PM had to withdraw his wrong decision. However, he unsuccessfully tried to blame the states for his wrong decisions, whereas no state raised the demand or suggested to the Centre for the vaccination of beneficiaries of 18-44 years with their own budget. Better late than never," he said.Modi on Monday announced that the Centre will provide free coronavirus vaccines to the states for the inoculation of all above the age of 18 from June 21, and asserted that the vaccine supply would be increased significantly in the country in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/pm-modi-should-clarify-which-states-demanded-to-buy-vaccines-ashok-gehlot-101623084480669.html

07-06-2021||Chandigarh||Kotkapura firing: SIT questions retired Punjab DIG Khatra||The Punjab Police’s new special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 Kotkapura firing incident quizzed retired deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Ranbir Singh Khatra, then DIG Amar Singh Chahal and then Faridkot senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sukhmandar Singh Mann on Monday. Led by additional director general of police (vigilance) LK Yadav, the SIT is probing into the policing firing on protesters seeking action into sacrilege incidents, which left two men dead on October 14, 2015. It was constituted after the Punjab and Haryana high court on April 9 quashed all reports filed by the previous SIT headed by inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh.Retired SSP Charanjit Singh and inspector Pritpal Singh also faced the SIT members. After suspended Indian Police Service officer Paramraj Singh Umranangal showed inability to appear before the probing team by sending an application through his lawyer, he was allowed to appear on Tuesday. A fortnight back, the SIT was in Faridkot to quiz senior police officials who were present on the spot during the firing incident. Former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini, who was grilled for at least four hours last week, has not been called in the current round of questioning. Other top officers who have been questioned include IPS Sahota and Rohit Chaudhary, who holds the charge of special director general of police.

The SIT had claimed that Brar exchanged 157 calls with the chief minister’s office, the DGP office and senior police and local administration officials on the night before the firing and directed the local authorities to disperse the protesters by using force. He was also accused of influencing the local police to not record the statements of complainants in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-sit-questions-retired-punjab-dig-khatra-101623082836453.html

The authorities, for the first time, have implemented a 26-point dos and don’ts for cage keepers or animal handlers with immediate effect. Animal handlers might lose their jobs if carelessness was found on their part, officials said. “We have drafted dos and don’ts for cage keepers or animal handlers to fix their responsibilities for the first time. Earlier, only verbal order was in practice. Every staff member of the zoo should have a clear idea of his or her job, that was earlier missing,” Birsa zoo director YK Das said.The initiative was taken after a 10-year-old tiger, suffering from fever, kidney and liver infection, died on Friday last. The animal was reportedly sick for four days before its death. On the very next day on Saturday, a sloth bear died following a fight with another bear in the zoo, officials said.In the case of tiger’s death, the zoo management, however, sent the swab, blood and few of its organs to Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly to find found out if the animal died of coronavirus-like disease, even though a rapid antigen test of the animal returned negative. Samples of 11 more carnivores were sent to IVRI, Bareilly for testing, officials said. Wildlife activists attributed the reason behind the deaths the two animals, which come under Schedule 1 (endangered species that need rigorous protection) of the Wildlife Protection Act, to carelessness on the part of the zoo authority. However, zoo officials denied the allegation.Meanwhile, the Ranchi zoo was taking measures to strengthen its health monitoring system. Its director said, “In a bid to strengthen the health monitoring system, we have decided to conduct two kinds of health check-up of animals that will take place monthly and annually. The monthly practice will be an external check up of the animals, while animals will go under thorough check-up annually. We have fixed the month of June for annual check-up for scanning health parameters, including blood pressure and diabetes.”Das further said cage keepers have been asked to treat animals like guests. “The cage should be neat and clean; besides their places must be disinfected. The food should be served properly, keeping animals’ interests in mind, and kitchen and utensils must be clean and washed properly,” he said.The keepers will be responsible for monitoring animal behaviour. “When an animal is taken into a squeezer cage, the keeper will clean and groom them, and observe if the animal has any wound or parasites on its body,” Das said.The zoo is currently closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the zoo staff will keep an eye on visitors’ behaviour too once it reopens, Das said. “If any visitor is found harassing any animal, he/ she will be booked under Wildlife Act,” he said.Besides, forest guards will keep an eye on cage keepers and animal handlers. “Three opportunities will be given if negligence is found on part of keepers. On first fault, warning will be given. Second time, his family members will be informed, and the third time he or she will be removed from the job,” the zoo director said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/ranchis-birsa-zoo-on-high-alert-to-conduct-regular-health-checkup-101623080435695.html
07-06-2021||Ranchi||HC quashes JPSC’s 6th civil services examination merit list||In a major embarrassment to the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC), the high court (HC) on Monday quashed merit list of the 6th civil services examination, through which 326 successful candidates were appointed against different cadre positions, due to erroneous addition of marks.The bench of justice SK Dwivedi declared the final list of successful candidates as null and void, and directed the commission to issue a fresh merit list after making the required corrections within eight weeks. It also directed the state government to make cadre allocation of the successful candidates as per the new revised list within next four weeks.The bench found that the JPSC committed grave error by adding the marks obtained by candidates in mains qualifying papers (Hindi and English) to prepare the final merit list. “This was done against the prevailing rules,” the bench observed.The JPSC, in October, 2016, floated an advertisement to hold 6th civil services examination to recruit 326 candidates for different cadre jobs in the state government. The examination was conducted in three stages--preliminary, mains and viva voce. Based on the marks obtained by the candidates in mains and viva voce examinations, it published a final merit list of 326 successful candidates on April 23 last year. These candidates have joined service in different cadre posts.“The judgment is likely to impact the fate of candidates who have already joined the service. The new merit list will change the result, as there are chances that some candidates, who earlier qualified the exams, may not get through this time. There are also chances that cadres of some successful candidates may change after the new merit list is published,” said senior advocate Ajit Kumar, who pleaded the case on behalf of some petitioners.The matter came before the court in the form of 16 different petitions filed by many unsuccessful candidates, challenging the results on different grounds. The court, however, dismissed all these petitions, except the one filed by one Dilip Kumar Singh, pointing out the aforesaid error committed in preparation of the merit list.Earlier in February this year, the bench heard all the petitions at length and kept its order reserved.Pronouncing the judgment on Monday, the bench said the JPSC should fix responsibility on officials responsible for commission of this grave mistake. “Action should be taken against these officials to pre-empt recurrence of such flaws in future,” the bench said.EOMBOXES/POINTERSTotal number of vacancies in different cadres--326Jharkhand Administrative Service: 143Jharkhand Finance Service: 104Jharkhand Education Service: 36Jharkhand Planning Service: 18Jharkhand Cooperative Service: 09 Jharkhand Information Service: 07Jharkhand Police Service: 06Jharkhand Social Security Service: 03Events related to the examinationOctober 4, 2016: JPSC published advertisement for 6th civil services examinationDecember 18, 2016: PT exam heldFebruary 23, 2017: PT result declared in which 5138 candidates qualified for mains examinationAugust 11, 2017: Following high court’s order a revised PT result came in which 6103 candidates qualifiedJanuary 23, 2018: Controversy surrounding the JPSC result was raised in Jharkhand assemblyJanuary 25, 2018: Govt asked JPSC to postpone the mains exam scheduled from January 29, 2018January 27, 2018: JPSC postponed mains examinationFebruary 7, 2018: State cabinet granted approval for publication of a revised PT result after reducing the cut-off marksAugust 6, 2018: JPSC published a revised PT result in which 34,634 candidates qualified for mains examinationFebruary 28, 2019: Mains examination commencedFebruary 15, 2020: Mains result announced, 990 candidates qualified for interviewFebruary 24-March 6, 2020: Viva-voce heldApril 21, 2020: Final merit list published in which 326 selected||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/hc-quashes-jpsc-s-6th-civil-services-examination-merit-list-101623080255621.html

This decision was mainly taken to reduce the cheating practices done by students in the online exams. As per the timetable declared by DTE the practical exams would start from June 22 to July 3, while the written online exams would be held from July 13 to August 3. According to the timetable given by the DTE, the practical exams for the AICTE approved engineering and pharmacy colleges will be held between June 22 to July 3 and for the regular and backlog students online written exams will start from July 13 to August 3. In the online written examination, there would be 40 questions out of which students need to solve at least 35 questions, and the duration of the exam will be one hour. “Through the supervisors of the DTE monitoring of the exams will be kept on the students appearing for the exams through proctored method. The complete responsibility to hold the exams smoothly will be of the institution’s director.” said DTE secretary Dr Mahendra Chitlange. Through this proctored method, students can appear for the exams from anywhere by using smartphones, tablet, laptop or desktop computers and even from the internet cyber cafes. Due to Covid-19 pandemic as students would not be able to come physically to college or institute campus to give the written exams, this decision was taken to conduct exams through this method which is prominently used by IIT’s in the country. With this method, when a student logs in to give the exam through smartphone, laptop or tablet, all the digital movements of the student are captured and monitored by the system. If a student is cheating or found doing any suspicious activity, he/she is given warning three times after which the student will be disqualified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dte-to-use-digital-proctor-for-summer-exams-101623080196590.html

In a his Facebook post on Sunday, Jaiswal mentioned several cases in which people of weaker sections were allegedly assaulted by the members of minority community in East Champaran’s Dhaka block and one in Ramgarhwa that falls under his Lok Sabha constituency of West Champaran, besides cases in Kishanganj and Purnia districts of the state. “In three separate incidents, people belonging to Paswan, Sahani and Noniya communities were assaulted while they were taking out wedding processions in Dhaka. But instead of acting tough on culprits, the police victimised the victims and sent them to jail along with culprits,” said Jaiswal, a three-time MP from West Champaran. Referring to another incident under Palanwa police station in East Champaran, he said, “On June 5, information was received from Ramgarhwa’s Dhangarhwa village that Dalits were denied their right of passage where a brick wall has been built. The issue was resolved when the local station house officer and circle officer visited the spot.”“The administration needs to be vigilant everywhere. Situation does not spin out of control if public representatives take cognizance of the issue. But when the district administration stands aside and starts punishing the innocent, it sends out a very wrong message in the society,” he wrote.East Champaran superintendent of police Navin Chand Jha could not be contacted for comment. However, Dhaka police said a case was registered after two group clashed and offended religious sentiments of each other on May 15. “As many as 23 people were arrested in this connection,” said a police officer, refusing to be identified.Meanwhile, RJD termed the ruling JD(U)-BJP alliance as an unholy one to stay in power. “MLC Tunna Pandey was shown the door after he pointed a finger at CM. This time, your ally BJP’s state president has directly questioned the Bihar Police, which is directly under the control of chief minister. Will the party cut his hands now?” RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-bjp-chief-puts-police-in-dock-101623080136319.html

07-06-2021||Other||Proposed flyover plant bent to stay clear of Khuda Bakhsh library||PATNAThe heritage portion of Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library (KBOPL) will not be bulldozed to pave the way for construction of a 2.20-km-long double-decker road from Kargil Chowk to National Institute of Technology (NIT) More over the congested Ashok Rajpath. The width of the proposed road would be slightly reduced near the library to save one of its heritage structures, George Curzon reading hall, from demolition. A portion of the reading hall of KBOPL, which a repository of ancient manuscripts, books and paintings, was earlier planned to be razed for the unique double-decker road being built by the Bihar Rajya Pul Nirmal Nigam Limited (BRPNNL). Amrit Lal Meena, additional chief secretary at the road construction department, said the BRPNNL had abandoned the plan of demolishing the part of KBOPL as of now. “However, this will have a bearing on width of the elevated road in a certain stretch,” said Meena, who is also chairman of the BRPNNL. Officials of the KBOPL, archaeologists and members of the civil society were up in arms against the BRPNNL ever since it disclosed its plans to build the double-decker road by razing parts of heritage buildings of Patna University and KBOPL and had staged protests and organised campaign against it. They had also written letters to the governor, chief minister and the Union ministry of culture to save the heritage structure. The reading hall of the library was named after then Viceroy of India George Curzon, who visited the library in 1905. The Central government has given library a tag of national importance and Unesco has granted it a heritage status. Meanwhile, the BRPNNL has shortlisted eight construction companies to evaluate their financial bids for the award of work. The proposed road would have three exists for the PMCH via their multi-level parking before terminating at NIT More. Up on its termination at NIT more, the road will connect to the upcoming Ganga Path via Krishna Ghat. The project is likely to cost around ₹369 crore. The PMCH will also have a four-lane connectivity with Ganga Pathway, which is coming up on the southern bank of river Ganga. Meena said ground work for the project would start in July, after the monsoon, and take around three years to complete.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/proposed-flyover-plant-bent-to-stay-clear-of-khuda-bakhsh-library-101623080075601.html
07-06-2021||Other||Patna to have drive-in facility at two vaccination centres||PATNAThe Patliputra Sports Complex at Kankerbagh and the Patliputra Ashok Hotel on Beer Chand Patel Path have been identified for launching drive-in Covid-19 vaccination facility in Patna. These centres, to be operational from Tuesday, would offer 24x7 vaccination facilities to those above 18 years of age. Additionally, they would have the drive-in vaccination facility. “We are trying to introduce the drive-in vaccination facility at these two inoculation centres most probably from tomorrow,” said Chandrashekhar Singh, Patna’s district magistrate (DM). “Those who pre-register for vaccination on the Co-WIN portal, can drive in at the designated parking slots at any of the two vaccination centres, take their shots, wait for some time in their vehicles and drive away. The facility will be available 24x7,” the DM said. “Our idea is to speed up the vaccination process and at the same time extend as much convenience as possible to the people, while also offering them a safe environment, so that they feel encouraged to take the vaccine. Many people believe they may contract the SARS-CoV-2 virus at vaccination centres, where many people come to take their shots. As such, we decided to have the drive-in vaccination facility for them,” said Singh. The two centres would cater to the vaccination of 18-45 years as well as 45 years and above, said Dr Vibha Kumari Singh, Patna’s civil surgeon. The morning slot of 9 am to 5 pm would ideally be to inoculate the 18-45 years age group, having booked slots after prior online registration. The evening slot from 5pm to 9am will offer walk-in vaccination facility. It will be open to all above 18 years of age, said officials. The idea behind keeping the morning slot for those who pre-register on Co-WIN is to not keep them waiting in queues for long under the scorching sun. Those who opt for walk-in vaccination through on-spot registration can come after sunset, said the official. The Patna district offers 61 Covid-19 vaccination sites for those in the 18-45 years age group. Additionally, the four medical colleges in Patna, besides the New Gardiner Road Hospital, the Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan Hospital, Shastrinagar and the Rajendranagar eye hospital are among some other government centres, which offer vaccination facility to the elders. Having administered 11,55,199 doses till Sunday, Patna is the leading among Bihar’s 38 districts in terms of Covid-19 vaccination. Of these, 8,45,805 have been given the first dose and 3,09,394 the second shot of the vaccine. These also include 1,17,321 healthcare workers and 1,06,850 frontline workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patna-to-have-drive-in-facility-at-two-vaccination-centres-101623080016996.html
07-06-2021||Pune||Minor fire breaks out at NCL on Monday, no injuries||Fire broke out at laboratory number 180 of the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), in Pune at 1.45pm on Monday afternoon. The moment the fire broke out, NCL employees used their in-house fire extinguishers and brought it under control along with firefighters from Pune fire brigade who arrived later and jointly exhausted the flames. The NCL authorities claimed that fire incident was ‘minor’ and have ordered an internal probe into the outbreak of the incident. No casualties were reported in the incident, both fire brigade and police officials said. According to the fire brigade officials, the fire broke out around 1.45 pm in the laboratory no. 180 of the main building of NCL which is located on Pashan road in Pune. At the time of the fire, the employees were out of the lab for lunch. The laboratory contained storage of highly flammable organic solvents, fire officials said. PMC fire chief Prashant Ranpise said that quick steps were taken to bring the fire under control. “The NCL fire was brought under control in five minutes. NCL has its own fire department, and its fire safety audit is done by the Institute from time to time.” Fire station duty officer Shivaji Memane said, “The NCL staff which had stepped out of the lab for lunch saw the fire from a distance and smoke billowing out in the afternoon. They immediately alerted the fire brigade control room at 1.50 pm. The fire brigade vehicles including water tenders reached the spot in five minutes. When we reached the spot, the NCL staffers had started removing the highly inflammable organic solvent containers to safer places and were also using fire extinguishers available on the premises to douse the flames. Together, we brought the fire under control within five minutes. Our team members also removed the solvent containers from the spot. A major damage was prevented because the flammable solvents were promptly removed to safety and fire could not reach them. Our team conducted cooling of wooden furniture that had caught fire by spraying cold water to ensure that there was no repeat fire. Both the NCL and fire brigade staffers displayed professional co-ordination.” Ganesh Rane, public relations officer, NCL said, “The fire safety committee is carrying out an assessment and trying to ascertain the cause behind the fire. Due to COVID 19 restrictions, the laboratory was functioning within limited capacity. Only students who are in need of laboratory work strictly for their research are presently being permitted to remain in the lab in small batches.” The NCL ‘Modular, Agile, Intensified and Continuous’ (MAGIC) lab had caught fire on the night of March 27, 2017. The fire destroyed the then 13-month-old lab, located in the pilot Plant III of the NCL campus. The NCL has witnessed many fire incidents in the past. The National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL), Pune, established in 1950, is a constituent laboratory of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). CSIR-NCL as it is popularly known as a science and knowledge-based research, development and consulting organization.

I have taken the jab.”Purnia district JD-U president Sriprasad Mahto agreed the video clip was helping.Purnia district BJP president Rakesh Kumar said vans reaching rural areas had photographs of Muslim leaders taking vaccines and people had now started showing interest.In Seemanchal, about 10 lakh people have been vaccinated so far, with Purnia on the top with 3.94 lakh, followed by Katihar (3.04 lakh), Araria (2.44 lakh) and Kishanganj over 1 lakh.In Bihar 1.11 crore people had been vaccinated till June 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/owaisi-video-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-vaccination-in-seemanchal-101623079955642.html

07-06-2021||Bangalore||Will decide on unlocking after district-wise Covid-19 review: K’taka minister||Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Monday a decision on whether to begin the unlocking process in the state will be taken only after the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation is reviewed in all districts. He added the above decision will be taken after a meeting of senior ministers and officials headed by chief minister B S Yediyurappa.Speaking to reporters on Monday, Bommai said the state government received several suggestions for relaxation in the ongoing lockdown and they will be considered. “We have to take into account where the rate of positivity is low, which district has the lowest rates. There have been many suggestions from the industrial sector that there should be relaxation measures in such districts,” the Karnataka home minister was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Karnataka is currently placed under a lockdown till June 14. Hotels, shops, restaurants, cinema halls, schools, colleges etc continue to remain shut. All kinds of public gatherings are banned. Movement of people is restricted apart from emergencies and vaccination. Only shops selling essential items are allowed to open from 6am to 10am. The state government on Monday allowed district registrar and Sub-registrar offices to function in strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour.Chief minister Yediyurappa said on June 3 the decision to extend the lockdown was taken following the recommendations of experts, and urged all residents to follow Covid related protocol. He also announced a second relief package of ₹500 crore which would benefit over 62.50 lakh state residents.Karnataka on Monday recorded 12,209 new cases and 320 more deaths, taking the caseload to 2,695,523, according to the health department’s bulletin. Over 31,000 people have succumbed to the viral disease so far while 2,409,417 have recovered and the active cases have come down to 254,505. As Karnataka has still not gained full control over the second wave of the pandemic, Dr HM Prasanna, a member of the state’s Covid-19 task force told ANI on Sunday the state government needs more infrastructure development, including human resource appointments and an increase in oxygen beds and vaccination drive to curb the spread of the viral disease.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/will-decide-on-unlocking-after-district-wise-covid-19-review-k-taka-minister-101623076563084.html
07-06-2021||Kolkata||‘TMC will expand to other states, take BJP head-on’: Abhishek Banerjee||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) will expand its base in other states to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and win elections, Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee said on Monday afternoon at his first press conference after being elected the party’s new national general secretary on June 5.Banerjee said the TMC will come up with a national plan within a month and it would be different from what the party tried in the past.Thwarting the BJP’s allegation that his rise in the hierarchy established dynastic rule in the TMC, the young Lok Sabha MP said he will not become a minister in 20 years and dared the BJP to pass a bill in Parliament to prohibit a second member from a family from joining politics or any office. “You (BJP) do it and I will be the first to resign,” he quipped.On the expansion plan, Banerjee said, “Whichever state we start our unit in, be it a big state, a southern India, a northern India or one in the Northeast, we will take the BJP head-on and we will start our unit to win the state. Let me put this across to all of you.”Though he avoided questions on whether Mamata Banerjee will emerge as a candidate for the post of chairman of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), which is held by Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, Banerjee said, “We have received more than one than 1,00,000 emails till now. There is no state from where people have not congratulated us. Bengal has set an example. It did not surrender to the outsiders. Our target is not to defeat BJP. We want to save India. People from all states are saying Mamata Banerjee can save the values of the Constitution and she is the only one who can protect national institutions.”“This was an election between Mamata Banerjee and the BJP but it was a fight for people of Bengal and rest in India, be it Rajasthan or the Northeast. All were looking at Bengal. Now there is hope. Within a month, we will come up with a concrete plan on what TMC wants to do, which are the states where we want to start our units and what is our expansion plan,” said Banerjee.“This attempt of Trinamool to go national is going to be different from what it attempted in the past. If we go to any state, no matter how small or big, we will not go only to take part in elections, not to win one or two seats and not to increase vote share. We will do so to win that state. We want to be the platform of choice for people of that particular state. We don’t want to exist in the form of opposition,” he added.Banerjee said till the TMC works on its expansion plans he would not say whether it would forge an alliance with the Congress. Asked whether the TMC will contest polls in Gujarat, he said, “Till we formalize our plans, I will leave the speculation alive.”Amit Malviya, head of the BJP’s national information technology cell, had tweeted that Banerjee’s elevation in the TMC established dynastic politics.Banerjee said, “On one hand, the BJP says TMC does not exist outside West Bengal while on the other hand, it is perplexed that Abhishek Banerjee has been made national general secretary. I have said this earlier also. I request Malviya to drive to his bosses in Lutyen’s Delhi and make a bill that every family will have one representative and nobody else from that family will be allowed to enter politics or any public office for that matter.”“What is stopping them from executing this? They are running the Central government. Why can’t they pass a bill on the floor of the House? You do it. I will be the first one to resign. Preach what you practice. You induct even turncoats from dynasties. You should stop talking,” said Banerjee in an indirect reference to the Bengal assembly’s leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari who switched sides in December last year and defeated Mamata Banerjee in the state polls. Adhikari’s father and brother are TMC Lok Sabha MPs from East Midnapore district.“You are exposing your own hypocrisy. First, you should remove leaders of your own party whose sons are MLAs and ministers. Amit Malviya does not need to teach me what is right and what is wrong. You split parties and take people who come from dynasties. You have the Union home minister and honorary secretary of the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) from the same family. Can Amit Malviya shoot the question to the home minister? I am saying on record that I don’t want to be in the state government or hold any ministerial berth in the next 20 years. Can Jay Shah come up and say he doesn’t want to be BCCI president in the next 20 years?” said Banerjee, referring to Amit Shah and his son.“Trinamool is the only party attempting to implement the one-man-one-post policy. Which other party has attempted this? We are at least trying to move in the right direction and you are talking about dynasty. Your entire campaign was on dynasty and you got the answer from people. Sometimes dynasty is better than being nasty. Take it that way,” Banerjee quipped.Reacting to his statements, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “Amit Shah’s son is not in the race for chief minister. Banerjee cited an irrelevant example. People of India know what dynastic politics means.”Bhattacharya also described the TMC’s expansion plan as unrealistic.“It is overambitious adventurism. It may sound nice in India’s pluralistic society but nonviable,” he said.Banerjee also took on Adhikari for the latter’s recent statement that if post-poll violence does not stop then migrant workers from Bengal run the risk of losing jobs in other states. “I saw what he said about the four million Bengalis who work outside the state. People do not like this sort of statements. I advise him to refrain from such a campaign and do his work as an opposition leader. Banerjee did not utter Adhikari’s name.Banerjee said many BJP leaders, including some who won the recent polls, were willing to join the TMC. “Many BJP MLAs have contacted us, expressing their wish to return. Our working committee will discuss this at its next meeting,” he said.Without commenting on Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s reply to TMC MP Mahua Moitra’s allegation that the former has employed his relatives at Raj Bhawan, Banerjee said, “He should behave like a governor instead of working at the instruction of a political party. Why doesn’t he give names and details of the BJP workers who are alleged to be under attack? I request the media to help us fight the menace of fake news. There have been some incidents of post-poll violence but not a single incident took place after Mamata Banerjee took over as chief ministers. Our leaders are reaching out to people.”Banerjee met senior TMC MPs and party veterans on Sunday and Monday to seek their blessings and advice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-will-expand-in-other-states-to-win-polls-take-bjp-head-on-abhishek-banerjee-101623076716288.html

At least 21,000 people recovered on Monday and the cumulative recoveries have climbed to 5,564,348.Monday’s case count in the western state is 2,338 less than that of Sunday’s, when 12,557 people tested positive for the viral disease.The state capital Mumbai also continued to see a downfall in its daily Covid-19 disease tally with 730 cases recorded on Monday, taking the caseload to 711,373. The toll has climbed to 14,999 after 28 people died on Monday.From today, Maharashtra has started easing Covid-19 related restrictions and has come up with a five-level unlock plan on the basis of positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds in cities and districts.Areas with less than 5% positivity rate and 25% occupancy of oxygen beds are under level one. There will be no restrictions in these areas and several relaxations are being given. Markets and shopping malls can function as pre-lockdown timings. Restaurants, offices (both private and government), weddings, funerals, salons, spas, gymnasiums can also operate.However, those areas with more than 20% positivity rate and over 75% occupancy of oxygen beds are under level five. No public movement is allowed and shops selling essential items can operate till 4pm. Restaurants can only provide home delivery and cinema halls, malls and non-essential shops will be shut. Only family members are allowed to attend weddings while 20 can attend funerals.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Sunday the state government took a calculated risk by easing the lockdown-like restrictions and urged residents to take care of themselves and all Covid related rules should be followed.“Neither a lockdown is required nor do we want to get knocked down by the virus. So all health related rules have to be followed,” Thackeray said while addressing a virtual meeting with top industrialists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-adds-10-219-new-covid-cases-730-fresh-infections-in-mumbai-101623074764095.html
07-06-2021||City||Tamil Nadu's seroprevalence down from 31% in first Covid-19 wave to 23% in April||(The second serosurvey was conducted in Tamil Nadu in April this year which showed that 23% of people had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which is a decline from the first survey which showed 31% in October-November last year.“The first survey was initiated around four weeks following the peak cases reported in August 2020 during the first wave,” the report stated, adding that this time it was conducted close to the beginning of the second wave.“Waning of IgG antibodies during the time gap of five months between 1st and 2nd survey (November 2020 to March 2021) could be one of the valid reasons for low seroprevalence as reported by several studies published in international journals,” it said.The study was carried out by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine across all districts except Chennai. Out of 22,904 samples that were tested, 5,316 people had IgG antibodies against the novel coronavirus disease. The report also said various coronavirus variants, including the B.1.617.2 (Delta) of Indian origin, were detected in Tamil Nadu.The highest seropositivity was found in the Tiruvallur district at 49% and the lowest in Nagapattinam at 9%. About 756 clusters were picked and each cluster consisted of roughly 30 participants who were randomly picked from a village, rural areas, a street and an urban area.A similar survey was conducted for the first time. About 22,690 blood samples were drawn and 6,995 were found reactive to the antibodies. The report attributed the "sharp decline" from 31% last year to 23% now in the second survey to four factors - the timing of the serosurvey, waning of antibodies, vaccination coverage and the emergence of SARS CoV-2 variants.A third serosurvey is being planned for July-August. The department said it would be an appropriate time considering the current decline trend of Covid-19 cases combined with increased vaccinations for those above 18 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tamil-nadu-s-seroprevalence-down-from-31-in-first-covid-19-wave-to-23-in-april-101623074576805.html
07-06-2021||Chandigarh||Vax row: Akalis protest near Punjab health minister’s house||The Shiromani Akali Dal on Monday warned to lay siege to Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s residence if health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu is not dismissed by June 15. Led by president Sukhbir Singh Badal, the opposition party on Monday staged a two-hour dharna near the health minister’s house in Mohali, demanding his immediate removal for alleged irregularities in the sale of Covid-19 vaccines and purchase of medical kits. “Instead of giving free vaccines to the people, the Congress government sold vaccines at a hefty profit to private institutions and also allowed the latter to fleece the people further. This amounts to playing with lives and is reprehensible,” said Sukhbir while addressing the protesters.The SAD chief said that Balbir Singh Sidhu was directly responsible for this “corrupt act” and in case he is not dismissed from the government, “we will approach the governor as well as the courts for justice”. “It is also shocking that the chief minister refused to listen to our requests to open Covid care centres in all blocks and purchase vaccines worth ₹1,000 crore directly from the manufacturers to vaccinate the entire population within a period of six months,” he said. Claiming that the health minister was indulging in one scam after another, Sukhbir also alleged irregularities in the purchase of Fateh kits for Covid-19 patients. He said the price of medical kits was jacked up repeatedly by inviting one tender after the other despite the first tender being valid for six months. The SAD chief alleged the firm that was allotted the third tender didn’t even fulfil the criterion of having a medical licence. “We demand an impartial inquiry into this scam and exemplary punishment to the guilty,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vax-row-akalis-protest-near-punjab-health-minister-s-house-101623074496187.html

Covid-19 nodal officer and pulmonologist at Government Doon Hospital in Dehradun, Dr Anurag Agrawal said that it is not a new fungus and is known to the medical world for the last 30-40 years. “People who are old patients of tuberculosis (TB) or are suffering from Asthma are more susceptible to this fungus. In the case of TB, sometimes there is a cavity in the lungs of the patients in which this fungus starts developing in the form of a ball. Similarly, for those suffering from Asthma, this fungus causes allergy,” said Dr Agrawal, adding that “about 15 days ago, a patient with the fungal infection had come to him in at Government Doon Hospital.” He informed that Aspergillus fungus becomes invasive in the lungs when the immune system of a person is weak.Also read: Centre to shoulder remaining 25% of vaccine work done by states, says PM Modi“Amid this Covid-19 pandemic, this fungus is becoming invasive because of certain factors like a prolonged stay in the ICU, high dosage of steroids or immuno-suppressants which lower the immunity. In a serious condition, it causes a disease named Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) which is treated with a drug named Voriconazole,” said Dr Agrawal. Informing on its mortality rate, he said that if not treated on time, the fungus can cause death as it has a mortality rate of about 20%. “It majorly affects the lungs,” he said. Another Dehradun-based pulmonologist and Covid-19 nodal officer, Dr Jagdish Rawat, while speaking on the Aspergillus infection, said that out of about 100 Covid-19 patients admitted in his hospital’s ICU, at least 10 have been detected with it. “This fungus is affecting the lungs of those Covid-19 patients who have high blood sugar level like in the case of black fungus. However, those Covid-19 patients who have recovered, are also vulnerable to it as their immune system is weakened,” he said. Dr Rawat said, “Covid-19 patients who have recovered but feel something unusual in the chest or during breathing should immediately consult the doctors and undergo proper tests to detect this fungal infection. Timely treatment is the key to contain the infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/after-black-fungus-aspergillus-fungus-reported-in-covid-19-patients-in-uttarakhand-101623071255355.html

Night curfew will remain in force from 7pm to 6am on weekdays, including Saturday, but regular weekend curfew will continue on Sunday, the chief minister said. Also read: Centre to provide free Covid vaccines to states from June 21: PM ModiWith case positivity declining to 3.2% and active cases also coming down, the chief minister allowed gatherings up to 20 people, including weddings and cremations. Entry restrictions (negative Covid test/vaccination) for arrivals in the state have also been done away with. Recruitment exams will be allowed to be held subject to adherence to social distancing and other Covid-appropriate norms, though the chief minister said online mode should be preferred. Sports training for national and international events has been permitted and the department of sports and youth affairs will issue guidelines. Gyms, restaurants can be opened after a week Reviewing the Covid situation virtually, with ministers, senior police and administrative officials and health experts, the chief minister said the district administration may determine opening of non-essential shops, including on the weekends, on the basis of local situation, while ensuring that crowding is avoided. On government offices, he said that attendance can be decided by the head of the concerned office but co-morbid/disabled employees at risk may be exempted. Gyms and restaurants can be opened after a week with 50% attendance if the situation improves further. Owners and workers of the gyms and restaurants should get themselves vaccinated before the reopening, he said.Referring to the spread of black fungus (mucormycosis), the chief minister said there are 381 cases of mucormycosis in the state at present, of which 38 have already been cured and 265 are undergoing treatment. There is an adequate supply of drugs for treatment, he assured people. 30% patients have post-Covid complications Post-Covid complications should be studied carefully for better preparation to handle those, he said, citing the example of Flying Sikh Milkha Singh, who was discharged after Covid recovery but had to be again hospitalised. He said he had been informed that 20% of patients in hospitals in Patiala are similar cases of recovered patients being readmitted. Punjab’s covid expert group head Dr KK Talwar said that almost 30% Covid patients are having post-Covid complications and continue to be symptomatic. Patients are taking almost three months to get back to normal, and thus need to be strictly monitored, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-extends-covid-curbs-till-june-15-goes-for-graded-unlock-101623068554093.html

Police have denied these allegations, calling them baseless.They also said that autopsy confirmed the woman had not been raped.In the June 6 letter to the police, Payke’s family has alleged that she was picked up from her home in the middle of the night by personnel of District Reserve Guards (DRG) of the Dantewada district and killed after being raped. Her mother, Sukki Veko, said in the letter that the DRG personnel took the woman forcibly into the jungles where she was raped before being killed and branded a Maoist cadre. “There were bruises all over her body...marks of physical abuse,” said the letter. The family also identified seven DRG personals who allegedly barged into the house and took Payke with them.Refuting the charges, Inspector General of Police, Bastar range, Sunderaj P, said Payke was not picked up from her house. “On May 31, based on a tip-off about the presence of Maoist cadres from PLGA Platoon no 16, an operation was launched in Gumalnar area. An exchange of fire took place between Dantewada DRG and Maoists at around 6.30am. During a search operation later, a woman Maoist’s body was recovered which was identified as that of Peyko’s who carried a reward of ₹2 lakh. Two country-made weapons and improvised explosive devices IEDs were also recovered from the site,” he said. He added that Peyko was a member of platoon no 16 since 2013 and her name was in the interrogation records of all surrendered Maoists of Indrawati Area Committee of CPI ( Maoist) and her platoon. “As per National Human Rights Commission and Supreme Court guidelines, an autopsy has been done by team of doctors. Such allegations are being made against security forces only to defame and demoralize them,” he said. Sarpanch of the Chingi village, where the alleged encounter took place, claimed that no such operation took place and Peyko was picked up from her house. “Police came to village and picked her up when she was asleep with her mother. She was getting married on June 10. There were no arms and police planted them to brand her a Maoist...She was ealier with Maoists for two months but left the movement and was living with her family for the past seven years,” said village head Ram Lal Netam. Dantewada superintendent of police Abhishek Pallava said, “These allegations have come under pressure of Maoists. They held a meeting after the encounter on June 4 and forced the family to submit a complaint . All allegations are baseless.” Earlier also, in February this year, tribal activist Soni Sori and a group of villagers in Dantewada had claimed that a 20-year-old woman, who allegedly died by suicide a few days after her purported surrender, was not a Maoist and was forced to surrender, raising questions over the police’s claim. The police, however, dismissed the allegations as a campaign to discredit the special surrender drive launched in the Maoist-infested district. In March , arrest of suspected Maoist, Madkam Hidme, in Dantewada led to a conflict, with some locals claiming she was an activist who was booked in some old cases and arrested without any warrant. The police refuted the allegations and said Hidme was involved in serious cases of Maoist violence in the recent past.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chhattisgarh-kin-allege-woman-killed-in-fake-encounter-cops-call-her-maoist-101623067654298.html

In the past six days, private hospitals have vaccinated 98,000 beneficiaries, most from the age group of 18-45 years, at 256 sites.Government centres have vaccinated 54,000 beneficiaries at 871 sites. Almost all major hospitals in the city have started inoculation drives not just for those who have booked prior slots, but also in tie-ups with major industries who want to vaccinate staff. On one hand, when the government centres have to shut down, private hospitals are leading the drive with full force. On Sunday, while the PMC vaccination centres were shut due to a shortage of vaccines, vaccination at private sites continued. At the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute campus, the first session was held to vaccinate staff of a private company.Dr Sanjay Lalwani, medical director at Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital, said, “The private hospitals have got its first batch of vaccines only as it comes once a month; and it was less than what we had demanded.

However, the state administration granted certain relaxations, including opening of shops till 6pm and functioning of private offices with 50% strength."Night curfew will remain in force from 7pm to 6am on weekdays, including Saturdays, but regular weekend curfew will continue on Sundays, the chief minister announced," a press release issued by the Punjab government said.Noting the fact that the case positivity rate in Punjab has come down to 3.2% and the active cases are also declining, the state government has allowed public gatherings up to 20 people including marriages and funerals.Recruitment examinations will be allowed in adherence to social distancing and other Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, the release said adding CM Singh suggested that online mode should be preferred.The Congress-led state government has also allowed sports training for national and global events and the sports department has been ordered to issue necessary guidelines which will have to be strictly followed.The chief minister said that district administrations may determine opening of non-essential shops, including on weekends, on the basis of the Covid situation in their respective areas. However, they will have to ensure that there is no crowding in such shops."On government offices, he (the chief minister) said that attendance can be decided by the head of the concerned office but co-morbid/disabled employees at risk may be exempted," the release further stated.Gymnasiums and restaurants remain closed in Punjab for now and if cases continue to decline, they might open after a week with 50% capacity.

There should be a probe to bring facts in the public domain," Puri said.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal, meanwhile, on Saturday said the Congress government in Punjab is trying to make money at the cost of people amid the Covid-19 crisis and demanded its dismissal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-extends-covid-curbs-till-june-15-orders-graded-relaxations-101623064316784.html
07-06-2021||Patna||Project Dolphin steering panel member laments Bihar’s lost opportunity||Dolphin expert from Bihar, Dr RK Sinha, who was awarded Padma Shri in 2016 for extensive research on the mammal, was made a member of the Steering Committee for implementation of Project Dolphin, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15, 2020. The 15-member steering committee, to be headed by additional director general of forests (wild life) and director, wildlife preservation, government of India, will oversee the implementation of the Project and advise the government on strategies and modalities for its effective implementation.Sinha is one of the only three members, included in the steering panel in their individual capacity in recognition of their research on Dolphins. Presently the vice chancellor of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University in Jammu & Kashmir, Sinha studied the mammal during his working days with Patna University.“I am happy that I will get the opportunity to work for Project Dolphin, but I would have been even happier had my native state Bihar, which has half the population of all the river Dolphins in the world, been ready to take advantage of it. Unfortunately, the long-awaited National Dolphin Research Centre (NDRC) in Patna remains stuck for years for reasons best known to the authorities,” he said.Last year, chief minister Nitish Kumar laid the foundation stone of the centre ahead of assembly elections after a long wait and even sanctioned funds to the building construction department (BCD), but things could not move beyond that.“River dolphin is a highly endangered species under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and it was also declared the National Aquatic Animal in 2009. The NDRC would have been a big step forward for the mammal’s conservation, including in Bihar, which accounts for 50% of its global population,” Sinha added.With the Prime Minister announcing Project Dolphin on the lines of Project Tiger to focus on both river and sea dolphins, there was hope that the setting up of the proposed centre in Bihar will get greater attention.The erstwhile Planning Commission had sanctioned ₹28.06 crore for the Centre in 2013 and a year later in 2014, Bihar too released ₹19.16 crore to Infrastructure Development Authority (IDA) for its development. However, no development has taken place.Sinha said he felt sorry for Bihar. “Had the National Dolphin Research Centre been ready, Bihar could have become the centre of activity [under Centre’s Project Dolphin]. Now, the condition of Ganga in Patna, which has a 25-km long bank with the river, is also bad. The river is drifting away and ongoing constructions in the river bed may permanently block the river flow near the city. It has badly affected Dolphin habitat in and around Patna,” he added.In 2018-19, around 1,500 Dolphins were sighted in Ganga during a survey by experts. This also prompted the government to build India’s first Dolphin observatory, Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary, for the mammals in Bhagalpur. Another such observatory in Patna is in the pipeline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/project-dolphin-steering-panel-member-laments-bihar-s-lost-opportunity-101623063693665.html
07-06-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Unlocking Pune... State government takes a risk, links incentives with responsibilities||The wise men in the state have taken a call to bring normalcy back to Maharashtra. As part of the unlock plan, Pune is set to reopen today in a big way, that will bring back livelihoods to some degree, even as the economy will take time to regain momentum. As wheels of the city set to restart again, the challenge before the authorities at the local and state level, is to prevent another wave, or minimise its impact. This is the second unlock exercise Maharashtra has undertaken, after last year. There is, however, a difference this time. The government in its order has passed the responsibilities on to people, if they want to avail incentives by way of restarting activities. The original order, released by state government late on Friday evening and followed by local authorities in Pune and many other cities the next day, is open for a weekly review. This means if the positivity rate or bed occupancy of a city or district goes up, local authorities will downgrade it to another level, between 1 and 5, depending on the spread of infection. The higher the level, the lower will be the incentives. The new system risks leading to confusion as it is a departure from the previous method, when the state government used to wait till the infection spread, and then would ask local bodies to tighten restrictions. In Pune district for example, authorities have considered Pune city, Pimpri-Chinchwad and rural parts as three separate units. The city, with a weekly positivity rate of 6.11% and oxygen bed occupancy at 27.47%, has been allowed to enjoy relaxations, along with Pimpri-Chinchwad. In the rural parts, curbs largely continue the way they were during previous weeks. As per the state order signed by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, administrative units with a positivity rate between 5%-10%, or oxygen bed-occupancy of more than 40% will have level-3 restrictions. By restarting most services in one go, the government has taken a major risk barely a few days after the second wave has started ebbing. In Thackeray’s own words: “The government is taking a ‘calculated risk’ by relaxing Coronavirus-induced restrictions in the state.” Among the things the government has relaxed in cities like Pune and Mumbai, are gatherings. This was in contradiction to what the chief minister had said in his address on May 30, when Thackeray stressed going ahead cautiously. Social, religious and cultural gatherings with a cap of 50 attendees could have been avoided given that it was neither a demand from any quarter nor being helpful in anyway. With no strong mechanism to check each and every gathering, such programmes can become super- spreader events. With civic polls lined up in 10 major cities of Maharashtra early next year, these gatherings can turn into political events too. The state has already paid a heavy price during the second wave, the trigger for which, according to experts, was political events ahead of local elections in parts of Maharashtra early this year. Already, political parties and community outfits have started agitations on various issues in the run-up to polls. Taking away e-pass inter-district travel, allowing public transport buses to ply with limited capacity in cities like Pune and Mumbai and reopening of restaurants and hotels for dine-in, is also bound to result in crowding, though livelihoods too are important here. The unlocking is necessary and should be rolled out. However at the same time, government and local bodies like Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) should take a cue from previous experience and build a stockpile of medicines, while building new oxygen producing units. At the same time, it should aim for higher vaccination numbers. With the wave ebbing, fear among people, too, is on the wane. The government, however, can’t afford to be lax this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-unlocking-pune-state-government-takes-a-risk-links-incentives-with-responsibilities-101623062194153.html

This is the highest ever procurement of wheat in the state with a little less than a month to go before the procurement season ends. Also read: IMA writes to PM Modi, seeks ‘personal intervention’ on assault on doctorsState agriculture minister Virender Kanwar said the state government has set a target of procuring 12,500 MT of wheat for the FCI. “As on May 31, a total of 10,065 MT of wheat has been procured as against last year’s 3,129 MT, which is 3.2 times higher, he said. Eight procurement centres set up The minister said eight procurement centres had been set up in five major wheat-growing districts of the state. These centres were opened at Paonta Sahib and Kala Amb in Sirmour district; Haroli and Takarala in Una district; Fatehpur and Thakurdwara in Kangra district; Patta Ghumarwin in Bilaspur district and Nalagarh in Solan district. Kanwar said: “So far, 30,520 quintals in Una district; 29,839 quintals of wheat have been procured in Sirmour district; 27,270.50 quintals in Kangra district; 427.50 quintals in Bilaspur; and 12599.50 quintals in Solan district. State-owned FCI is the nodal agency for procurement and distribution of foodgrains in Himachal Pradesh. Local traders also purchase the crop. The bulk of the procurement that starts in April gets completed by June-end. More than 2,000 farmers benefited So far, 2,447 farmers have benefited this season. Farmers are being provided minimum support price (MSP) at the rate of ₹1,975 a quintal. A maximum of 785 farmers benefited in Sirmour; 721 in Una district; 545 farmers in Kangra district; 380 in Solan; and 16 farmers in Bilaspur. Wheat procurement started in Sirmour and Una districts on April 15 and April 29, respectively, while the process began in Kangra and Bilaspur on May 3 and in Solan on May 2. “At this rate, the state government is likely to cross its procurement target for this year,” Kanwar added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-buys-record-10-065mt-of-wheat-101623061294865.html

"They have ended their strike unconditionally," Sarang told news agency PTI.Vishwas Sarang said on Sunday the government has already agreed to give a hike of 17 per cent in stipend to them. "We have ended our protest after meeting Sarangji," Arvind Meena, the president of the Junior Doctors Association (JUDA), told PTI.Around 3000 junior doctors from six medical colleges across MP were demanding a hike in their stipends and reserved beds for them and their family members in cases of a Covid-19 emergency. Nearly 3000 doctors resigned from their respective duties on June 4 after the Madhya Pradesh High Court called the agitation "illegal" and directed the protesters to resume their duties. The state government also sent eviction notices on Saturday asking them to vacate their hostels.The development came ahead of a hearing in the Madhya Pradesh High Court on Monday over a petition regarding the junior doctors' strike.The junior doctors struck work on May 6 but resumed their duties a few hours later after the state government assured them that their demands would be met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-junior-doctors-end-week-long-strike-as-govt-assures-17-hike-in-stipend-101623060305243.html

07-06-2021||Chandigarh||More women judges needed in judiciary||Former chief justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and incumbent NV Ramana recently said that the nation may soon have its first woman CJI. This is a welcome step and has raised the larger issue of more representation of women in the judiciary. The appointment of high court judges is made under Article 217 and those of the Supreme Court under Article 124 of the Constitution of India. These Articles do not provide any reservation for any caste, class or person, including women. But from time to time, the Government of India and the Supreme Court itself have been insisting on giving weightage and consideration to deserving candidates among women also, while making recommendations for the appointment as judges. In spite of that, the representation of women in higher judiciary is poor. Also read: On live-in relationship, not for us to judge couple’s decision: High CourtIn the Supreme Court, right from 1950, of the total 247 judges appointed so far, there have been only eight women judges. In 1980, Justice M Fathima Beevi became the first woman judge to be appointed to the apex court, 40 years after its establishment. Today, of the 27 judges in the Supreme Court, there is only one woman judge, Justice Indira Banerjee, with a total of seven vacancies. The situation is no better in the high courts. Of the total sanctioned strength of 1,079 high court judges, there are 426 vacancies with 653 sitting judges. Going by the figures available, at present, there are only 78 women judges in different courts, with 13 in the Madras high court, eight in the Bombay high court, seven in the Punjab and Haryana high court, six each in the Delhi and Karnataka high courts and five each in the Gujarat and Kerala high courts. Interestingly, there is no woman judge in the Patna, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura and Uttarakhand high courts. As far as the question of the CJI is concerned, going by the present incumbents, the position regarding the chief justices up to 2027 is clear. According to seniority, after CJI NV Ramana, Justice Uday Umesh Lalit is likely succeed him till November 8, 2022, Justice DY Chandrachud up to November 10, 2024, Justice Sanjiv Khanna up to May 13, 2025, Justice BR Gawai up to November 23, 2025, and Justice Surya Kant up to February 9, 2027. Therefore, at least in six years, there is no chance of any woman judge becoming the CJI. Unless there are certain appointment of women judges made against the seven vacancies of the Supreme Court, who are supposed to retire after 2027, there may not be any women CJI even after that also. Correct the patriarchal mindset Unfortunately, no serious attempt has been made during the past 70 years to give adequate representation to women either in the high courts or in the Supreme Court. In India, women constitute 50% of the total population and a large number of women are available in the Bar and in the judicial services for elevation but, in spite of that, the number of women judges is small. One can very well acknowledge the fact that India basically has been a male-dominated society and has not allowed women to play a role that they can play in different walks of life, including the judiciary. The Bill for giving 33% reservation to women in Parliament and state legislatives has not been passed till date, despite all major political parties publicly supporting it. The need of the hour is to correct the patriarchal mindset in recommending and approving the names of those who are to be elevated as high court judges and come out with more representation to worthy women lawyers and district judges for elevation. Unless women are empowered, justice cannot be done to them. It is high time that all those who matter in the appointment of judges to the high court and the Supreme Court, realise the need of giving adequate representation to women in the judiciary. In fact, the superior judiciary should also have horizontal reservation for women such as subordinate judiciary without diluting merit. Moreover, simply appointing a woman CJI in itself may not make much difference unless we have sufficient number of women judges in different courts. As of today, there are a total of seven vacancies in the Supreme Court and 426 vacancies in the high courts. If we really want to give due representation to women in the judiciary, it is high time that while making appointments against these vacancies, reasonable and adequate representation is given to them. Vacancies are an opportunity The vacancies of about 426 judges out of 1,079 (42%) and seven out of 34 judges in the Supreme Court (20%) is high. But it gives an opportunity to make up for the deficiency in the matter of representation to women in higher judiciary. The cause of the first woman CJI, in the present scenario, cannot be achieved for six years. However, during this period an attempt can be, and should be, made to give due and adequate representation to women both in the high courts and in the Supreme Court. That will be a step in the right direction of removing gender discrimination, which ultimately may lead to more social and gender harmony in the judiciary.

A portion of the reading hall of the library, a repository of ancient manuscripts, books and paintings, was earlier planned to be razed for the unique double-decker road being built by the Bihar Rajya Pul Nirman Nigam Limited (BRPNNL).Additional chief secretary, road construction department (RCD), Amrit Lal Meena confirmed the change in plan. “As of now, we have decided not to touch any portion of Khuda Bakhsh library for building the double-decker road. However, this will have its bearing on [the] width of the elevated road at [a] certain stretch,” said Meena, who is also chairman of BRPNNL.Khuda Bakhsh library officials, archaeologists and members of the civil society were protesting ever since the state construction authority unveiled plans to build the double-decker road by razing parts of heritage buildings of Patna University and Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library. They had written letters to the governor, chief minister and the Union ministry of culture to save the heritage structures.The Patna chapter of the Indian National Trust of Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) had planned to seek legal remedy to avert the planned partial demolition of Curzon reading hall, named after then Viceroy of India, George Curzon, who visited the library in 1905. The library has the tag of national importance given by the Centre and Unesco has granted it a heritage status.The bid to construct the double-decker road over Ashok Rajpath for providing easy access to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) from Gandhi Maidan side gained momentum on Saturday with the BRPNNL shortlisting eight construction companies for evaluation of financial bids for the award of work. The eight firms—Apco Infratech, Nagarjuna Construction, Rachna construction, Roya RCPL JV, SP Singla Construction, Gawar construction, Jandu Niraj JV and Welspun Enterprise—have been selected for the opening of financial bids.The proposed elevated road would have three exits for the PMCH via their multi-level parking before terminating at NIT More. The road will also connect to the upcoming Ganga Path via Krishna Ghat. The project is likely to cost around ₹369 crore. The PMCH will also get four-lane connectivity with Ganga Pathway, which is coming up on the southern bank of river Ganga.Meena said the groundwork for the project will start in July, after the monsoon, and take around three years to complete.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patnas-double-decker-road-project-to-spare-khuda-bakhsh-library-s-heritage-structure-101623056193295.html

07-06-2021||Kolkata||Bengal guv hits out at TMC MP who accused him of hiring relatives at Raj Bhavan||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday morning refuted the allegations of employing his relatives at Raj Bhavan in Kolkata, levelled against him by Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mahua Moitra . Dhankhar tweeted that the allegations were factually wrong, saying that none of them was a part of his close family, while four of them were not from his caste. Also Read | Dhankhar’s office is his ‘extended family’, Mahua Moitra shares document“Assertion @MahuaMoitra in tweet & Media that six coterminous appointee OSDs in personal staff are relatives is FACTUALLY WRONG. OSDs are from three states and belong to four different castes. None of them is part of close family. Four of them are not from my caste or state,” Dhankhar tweeted on Monday morning. In a scathing attack against Dhankhar, Moitra had on Sunday alleged that the former employed three of his relatives, two relatives of a former aide-de-camp (ADC) and one relative of his present ADC as officers on special duty (OSD) at Raj Bhavan. The governor said that the TMC MP’s tweets were a part of the “distraction strategy to divert attention from the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.”“This is unfolding of ‘distraction strategy’ to divert attention from alarming law and order scenario @MamataOfficial. Would continue undeterred and with zeal to serve the people of state and vindicate my oath of office under Article 159 of the Constitution,” he tweeted. Moitra said in successive tweets that the situation in Bengal will improve if the governor leaves with his “extended family”. Dhankhar assumed charge in July 2019. The acrimonious relationship between the governor and the TMC-ruled West Bengal government has been in the news since September that year. TMC leaders have time and again accused Dhankhar of being “an agent” of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and accused him of partisan behaviour. Moitra had tweeted the list (of six OSDs) on Sunday, shortly after Dhankhar accused the administration of inaction in the post-poll scenario and asked the chief secretary to meet him on Monday to discuss political violence. Moitra replied to Dhankhar’s Monday morning tweet within 20 minutes and asked him to declare the antecedents of the appointees. Addressing the governor as “Uncle Ji”, she demanded a prompt reply. “Asking Uncleji to lay out right here what antecedents of the appointees are & how each one got into Raj Bhavan. Do it NOW. BJP IT Cell can’t get you out of this one Uncleji.. And I don’t think Vice President of India also happening for you,” tweeted Moitra.Dhankhar did not reply to this tweet till 3.20pm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-guv-hits-out-at-tmc-mp-who-accused-him-of-hiring-relatives-at-raj-bhavan-101623053313237.html

The number of trains in service will be increased in a graded manner, DMRC officials said.“Entry at stations will continue to be regulated through identified gates as was the practice earlier.

Amphotericin-B is used for treating patients suffering from severe mucormycosis or black fungus infections.The injections in question were supplied to two government hospitals in Sagar and Jabalpur district on Friday. Adverse reactions were first reported among 27 patients at Bundelkhand Medical College on Saturday night and among 50 patients at Netaji Subhash Chandra (NSC) Medical College in Jabalpur on Sunday. Hospital staff said patients fell ill a few minutes after Amphotericin B injection was administered to them, said the official, who didn’t wish to be named. He confirmed that all these injections were manufactured by the same company and belonged to one batch.“The patients showing adverse reaction to the injection complained of fever, vomiting, chills and fluctuation in blood pressure and were finally stabilised through symptomatic treatment,” said Dr Umesh Patel, public relation officer of Bundelkhand Medical College.Head of ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat) department at the NSC Medical College in Jabalpur, Kavita Sachdeva said, “We came to know that patients at BMC Sagar fell ill after an injection was given to them on Sunday. We immediately stopped the use of the antifungal injections, but [by then] about 60 patients had already [been] given the dose. Out of them, 50 complained of chills, fever, breathlessness and nausea. We started their timely treatment and all are in stable condition.”The state government provided new injection vials to both medical colleges on Sunday night and ordered an inquiry into the reasons behind the adverse reactions, said medical education minister Vishwas Sarang.With the rise in black fungus cases in the country, the demand for Amphotericin-B injections has shot up considerably. Several states have already started to witness its shortages. As per data available on Saturday, MP had 1,005 active patients of black fungus disease. CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan had also stated that there was no shortage of the injection, considered critical in saving lives of patients suffering from severe infection. Earlier last week on Tuesday, the Centre imposed curbs on its export to meet the domestic demand.(with inputs from Anupam Pateriya)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/black-fungus-treating-injections-led-to-adverse-reactions-in-mp-stopped-101623052113181.html

In the trial, the vaccine will be given by intramuscular route in two doses at day 0 and day 28. "The screening of children for conducting trial of Covaxin has started. Participants would be given the vaccine after their screening reports come," Dr Sanjay Rai, Professor at the Centre for Community Medicine at AIIMS, said.India's drug regulator had granted permission for conducting the phase 2/3 clinical trial of Covaxin in the age group 2 to 18 years on May 12Covaxin is being used on adults in India's ongoing COVID-19 vaccination drive. The government last week cautioned that even though COVID-19 has not taken a serious shape among children till now, its impact can increase among them if there is a change in virus behaviour or epidemiology dynamics, and said preparations are being strengthened to deal with any such situation.A national expert group has been formed to review COVID-19 infections in children and approach the pandemic in a renewed way to strengthen the nation's preparedness, NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul had said at a press conference.The group has examined signs which were not available four-five months before, he said.It has also considered available data, clinical profile, the country's experience, disease dynamics, nature of the virus and the pandemic and has come up with guidelines, which will be publicly released soon.“While we have been systematically reviewing scientific developments in this area, the group has been formed to take an updated view of the situation," Paul said.Asked if the Pfizer vaccine, if it comes to India, will it be considered for children between the age of 12 and 15 years as being approved by the UK, Paul had said that the country has its own vaccines which are being readied for children."Child cohort is not a small cohort. My rough guess is that if it is between 12 to 18 years, this itself is about 13 to 14 crore population and for which we will need about 25-26 crore doses."We cannot have some people getting and others not getting. So we will have to take this into account when we strategise and make a decision based on how many doses of which vaccines are available. he said.He further shared that Zydus Cadila's vaccine is already being tested in children."So when Zydus comes for licensure, hopefully in the next two weeks, may be we have enough data to take a view on whether the vaccine can be given to children," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aiims-delhi-starts-screening-of-children-for-covaxin-trials-101623047599658.html

Not a single patient admitted at either IGIMS or AIIMS got Amphotericin B doses at the hospitals due to non-supply of the drug from the state health department, Dr Mandal told the publication while speaking of the dire situation.‘Black fungus’, also known as mucormycosis, is considered to have deadly effects. The central government in an advisory stated that the fungal infection affects people who are on medication as it reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens.Amphotericin B injection is being used in black fungus treatment. Dr. Mandal said that while around 585 vials of the medicine are needed per day, only 200 such vials arrived on Saturday, while not a single vial arrived till 9pm on Sunday. AIIMS' Dr. Kranti Bhavana also said that the patients did not get a single dose of Amphotericin B due to the non-availability of medicines. Some of the medicines already present in PMCH were given to more serious patients.Diabetes, prolonged consumption of steroids, and prolonged ICU stay are the major risk factors for this disease. Some of the symptoms of this rare disease include pain, swelling/redness around the eyes and nose, fever, headache, cough, shortness of breath, and bloody vomit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/black-fungus-rages-in-bihar-doctors-complain-of-dire-shortage-of-drugs-101623043979336.html

Tikait will discuss the strategy with Mamata Banerjee to further intensify the ongoing farmers' protest against the new central farm laws, the sources said."Rakesh Tikait will meet chief minister Mamata Banerjee on June 9. He will congratulate her on the massive electoral victory. They will discuss the farmers' protest," sources told ANI.Notably, Tikait had visited West Bengal before the state assembly elections and campaigned for Trinamool Congress (TMC).West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been very much vocal against the new farm laws and gave her support to farmers' protests. Several TMC MPs had visited the Delhi borders where farmers have been protesting since November last year.Since the Covid-19 situation is improving, the farmer leaders are planning to intensify the protest.Meanwhile, a large number of farmers led by farmer leaders Rakesh Tikait, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, and United Kisan Morcha leader Yogendra Yadav have been staging a dharna in front of Tohana Sadar police station in Fatehabad district of Haryana since Saturday night demanding the release of the arrested farmers.Farmers protesting against the Centre's farm laws have been protesting for the last six months. Many have camped at the borders of the national capital. Despite several rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmer leaders last year, the deadlock remains.Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/rakesh-tikait-to-meet-mamata-banerjee-on-wednesday-to-talk-over-farmers-protest-101623041798928.html

The analysis has been done by Delhi-based think tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).The CSE said that these 14 hot spots recorded higher concentration of air pollutants than the mean of recognised hot spots - 197 micrograms per cubic metre. These locations are Alipur, DTU, ITO, Nehru Nagar, Patparganj, Sonia Vihar and Vivek Vihar in Delhi, Sector 1 and 116 in Noida, Loni, Sanjay Vihar and Indirapuram in Ghaziabad, Knowledge Park V in Greater Noida and Bulandshahr, according to the CSE study.The think tank said this points towards impact of local pollution.The CSE also said that lockdowns improved the air quality in Delhi-NCR this year as well but not as effectively as last year due to the 2021 curbs being shorter and lesser stringent."In 2020, partial lockdown started on March 12 with hard lockdown kicking in on March 25, which was lifted in phase-wise manner from May 18. Then the partial lockdown also brought PM2.5 levels down by 20 per cent, but the hard lockdown reduced it by another 35 per cent," the CSE said.Lifting of restrictions from May 18 had led to 28 per cent rise in PM2.5 levels, it said.Meteorology would be partly responsible for this trend, but it could also be a reflection of weakening of pollution control-measures and efforts in the city and region, it said.Traffic intensity was also comparatively higher in 2021, it added.The CSE analysis also showed that there were 27 "very poor" days in terms of air quality this February-March compared to 17 in 2020 and 12 in 2019.Days meeting the air quality standard also plummeted this spring to just two. The year 2020 had 16 and 2019 had six days when the standard was met, it said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cse-study-identifies-14-new-pollution-hot-spots-in-delhincr-101623031991452.html

07-06-2021||Delhi||Political fight escalates on ration delivery plan||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow the Capital’s government to launch doorstep ration delivery, citing how crowded shops could potentially turn into Covid-19 “superspreader” zones and adding that the CM’s name had already been dropped from the scheme.On Saturday, Kejriwal’s office said the Centre again “blocked” the Delhi government’s ambitious scheme days ahead of its launch, with Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal rejecting the scheme. The L-G’s office, however, said Baijal did not “reject” the scheme and only “advised for the constitutional scheme of things to be followed in letter and spirit”.“If pizza, burgers, smartphones and garments can be delivered to doorsteps of people, then why not ration?” Kejriwal said in a digital news briefing on the contentious issue on Sunday. He said the scheme should be implemented across the country in view of Covid-19.“In Delhi, a doorstep delivery of ration scheme was ready to be launched next week. All necessary tenders were completed, and arrangements were in place. It would have relieved millions of people in Delhi from crowds and long queues outside ration shops. For the last 75 years, the ration distribution system across the country has been looted by the ration mafia, leading to leakages in the system that deprive poor people of the food grains they are entitled to. Doorstep delivery would have been a revolutionary initiative,” said Kejriwal, citing his own days as a social activist and being allegedly attacked by people for his fight against “ration mafia”.Delhi currently has around 1.78 million ration card holder households which, according to government records, translate to 7.2 million beneficiaries. Ration to them is currently distributed through a network of 2,000-odd fair price shops.“The proposal has been turned down citing no approval from the central government. It is untrue. We have written to the central government five times, seeking their approval in this regard. Going by the law, we do not need any approval from the central government in this regard. State governments are capable of implementing such schemes. In March, you asked us to remove mukhyamantri (chief minister) from the name of the scheme, we obliged. We followed all your conditions,” said Kejriwal.A senior official in the central government said: “The Government of India has not asked the Delhi government to not distribute the ration the way they want to. They can do so under any other scheme. The Government of India can also provide additional food grains for that, as per notified||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/political-fight-escalates-on-ration-delivery-plan-101623013695809.html
07-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi hospital revokes directive on language use||A Delhi government-run hospital on Sunday withdrew a controversial order that barred its nursing staff from communicating in any language other than Hindi and English after backlash from political parties and health care workers, who alleged that the directive was “discriminatory” and “unconstitutional”.The Govind Ballabh Pant Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research in central Delhi issued a circular to the nursing staff of the facility on June 5, saying that a “complaint has been received regarding Malayalam language being used for communication”.“... maximum patient(s) and colleagues do not know this language and feel helpless, causing a lot of inconvenience. So it is directed to all Nursing Personnel to use only Hindi and English for communication, otherwise serious action will be taken,” the order issued by GIPMER’s nursing superintendent Veena Verma said.Under fire over the circular, GIPMER released a statement saying it was pulling back the directive that had been issued “without any instructions or knowledge” of the hospital administration and the Delhi government.“This circular dated June 5, 2021 which was issued by Nursing Superintendent, GB Pant Hospital, without any instructions or knowledge of the Hospital Administration and Delhi Government stands withdrawn with immediate effect,” the statement said on Sunday.Congress MP from Wayanad, Rahul Gandhi, criticised the incident and wrote on Twitter: “Malayalam is as Indian as any other Indian language. Stop language discrimination!”Gandhi’s colleague and Congress lawmaker KC Venugopal on Saturday said in a letter addressed to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan that the hospital’s directive was “unbelievable” and “atrocious”. “I appeal the honourable health minister Harsh Vardhan to order an immediate withdrawal of the bizarre and unconstitutional circular...” he wrote on Twitter before the hospital overturned its decision.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Tom Vadakkan blamed the directive on the Aam Aadmi Party-led government in Delhi. “The order and it’s withdrawal in haste clearly indicates we have an anarchist Delhi Government for whom the Constitution of India and its recognised languages do not matter,” he said on Sunday.Delhi government officials did not respond to requests for comment.Nurses from the Malayali community condemned the order and said the circular showed complete “disregard for our mother tongue” despite health care workers working round-the-clock to fight the pandemic. “In the times of Covid, the hospital should be fostering a conducive environment for the nurses. Instead, the administration is bringing forth such unnecessary circulars. This would have affected the morale and harmony among nurses. Segregating people on the basis of language is not right. The administration has shown complete disregard for our mother tongue and this is not tolerable,” said Fameer CK, representative of the Delhi Action Committee of Malayali Nurses. He added that the hospital administration should not have taken such a decision without consulting the government first.The hospital has a staff of around 1,000 nurses. “The order did not make sense and has rightly been withdrawn. Why single out a particular language like this? ...this was an irrational order and was rightly highlighted, but there are other critical issues plaguing the nursing profession...” said Liladhar Ramchandani, president, GB Pant nurses association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hospital-revokes-directive-on-language-use-101623013385004.html
07-06-2021||Delhi||Markets, malls, districts in sync as precautions take centre stage||As Delhi prepares for its second phase of reopening after seven weeks in lockdown, market welfare associations in the city said they are trying to vaccinate as many shop owners and employees as possible. While shopping malls will be investing on managing footfall in real-time, officials of district administrations said they will ensure stricter enforcement of distancing and mask norms.On Monday, around 250 enforcement teams of the Delhi revenue department will be deployed in markets and public spaces that are likely to see large crowds, said a senior government official.“Liquor stores will be under watch. They are likely to witness huge crowds for the next few days. If things go out of control, officers in sub-divisions have been directed to close the shops immediately for the day,” said the government official.Dharmendra Kumar, west Delhi’s additional district magistrate, said, “Enforcement will be scaled up. We have to ensure social distancing and high mask compliance at any cost. We cannot let Covid-19 cases go up again.”Pushpa Bector, executive director, DLF Shopping Malls and director of Shopping Centres Association of India, said the mall industry has been readied to reopen for some time.“Apart from the guidelines recommended by local authorities, we have got stringent measures now like live footfall trackers, apart from getting all mall employees vaccinated. It is important that we give an environment of safety to consumers and build staff confidence during these testing times. We hope that business will soon come back to normal,” said Bector.Yogeshwar Sharma, executive director and CEO, Select Citywalk, said the reopening has been mapped out, with extensive standard operating procedures in place, including temperature checks at entry points, sanitization across all public areas and retail outlets, and air-conditioning practices in accordance with government guidelines.“We will also work in tandem with our occupants to ensure best practices [are in place] for the safety of our visitors,” said Sharma.Atul Bhargava, owner of a store at Connaught Place and president of New Delhi Traders’ Association, said the body conducted a vaccination drive on Saturday for their staff and family members ahead of Monday’s reopening. “Our members paid for the vaccination of their staff,” said Bhargava.The Khan Market traders body also said the association is in touch with a private hospital to vaccinate staff.Sanjeev Mehra, president of Khan Market Traders’ association, said, “It will take another two or three days for us to streamline the vaccination process. We have taken care of other precautionary measures,” said Mehra. He said that crowding might not be a problem initially since people were unlikely to throng the markets in the first few days.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday announced that restrictions, including those on markets and transport, were being eased starting Monday, after a seven-week lockdown necessitated by a devastating fourth wave of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/markets-malls-districts-in-sync-as-precautions-take-centre-stage-101623012788548.html

07-06-2021||Delhi||4th Covid-19 wave forced more to seek state help||After losing her livelihood following the imposition of the lockdown announced by the Delhi government in April to contain the fourth wave of Covid-19 in the city, Uma Singh, a domestic help, was left with no means to arrange nutritious food for her two children until she managed to enrol them in an anganwadi centre last month with the help of a civil society organisation.The resident of northeast Delhi’s Yamuna Vihar said, “My son is three and my daughter is just one. None of them are enrolled in a school yet; otherwise they would have got dry ration from there. Some NGO people visited our locality last month to distribute food. When I told them about my issue, they put me in touch with an anganwadi worker who later helped me enrol my kids in a centre.” Singh, 28, is a single mother and lives with her parents.Like Uma, several thousand people have enrolled their kids in the city’s anganwadis after losing their source of income amid the pandemic. According to a recent survey conducted by the Delhi government, 247,293 children and pregnant/lactating women have enrolled in anganwadi centres across the Capital amid the lockdown enforced by the Delhi government in April. The trend, experts said, shows that the income of families has been more severely hit this time compared to the last lockdown.These anganwadi centres, part of the central government’s Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), provide supplementary nutritious meals to children up to age six as well as pregnant and lactating women. They also provide pre-school education, health education, immunisation and medical check-ups for the children.While the city’s 10,755 anganwadi centres have been shut since March, the Delhi government’s department of women and child development (WCD) has been providing children and pregnant/lactating women supplementary nutrition through door-to-door services each fortnight.Government data seen by HT showed that in March last year, 534,741 children and women were enrolled in the ICDS programme, which increased to 782,034 (46.24%) by April this year. The latest survey report also stated that the coverage of supplementary nutritional diets also increased by 68% from the last lockdown.“As per the latest round of survey results from the DCPCR, 91% of the beneficiaries reported that they are receiving nutritional supplements whereas in May 2020 only 23% of the beneficiaries surveyed had reported that they received the ration,” the document stated.Dilshad, who lost his job at a garment store in Lakshmi Nagar in April last year, had initially registered his two children in a local anganwadi and recently enrolled his four-month pregnant wife as well. “My children — a four-year-old son and a five-year-old daughter — were enrolled in a private school in Seelampur. I had to pull out my children from there as I was unable to pay the fees in July. I am still out of work.”“I enrolled my children in an anganwadi in August. In March, I got to know that my wife is expecting again. I am still hardly earning anything by cleaning cars in Dilshad Garden... Therefore, I had to enrol her at the same centre,” he said.Senior officials said the increased enrolment in the programme was also because of the enhanced efforts of officials and workers engaged in these projects. “During the pandemic, maximum efforts have been taken to enhance the outreach services and make the workers serve the needs of vulnerable children in a holistic manner,” said a woman and child development department official.According to the latest data collected by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), at least 1,436 children lost either one or both their parents to Covid-19. Of them, 59 children lost both parents. The anganwadi workers were also asked to call on helpline number 1098 to report about children in distress. Officials said the number receives around 500 calls every day.The Delhi government, in its budget 2021-22 presented in March, announced setting up of 500 Saheli Samanvay Kendras (SSKs) for better outreach to vulnerable women and children. About 101 such SSKs have been made operational as of now. Dr Rashmi Singh, director of the women and child development department, said SSKs have emerged as emergency response centres for women whose livelihood and socio-economic condition have been hit by the pandemic and the lockdown.Meanwhile, civil society organisations in Delhi, said the number of enrolment in the ICDS scheme is still low.Amrita Johri of Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan said, “More effort needs to be taken to enrol every child and woman in distress under the scheme,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/4th-covid-19-wave-forced-more-to-seek-state-help-101623011106487.html
07-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A place for the invisibles||Quietness is the reigning monarch here. Greenery is entwined with solitude. Squirrels are frolicking about. Marooned in isolation, this secretive tree-filled place feels detached from all the news of the world.But gradually you notice them, the people, looking like an extension of the patchy grass they’re lying on, here and there.This expanse runs for a brief distance along the Outer Ring Road, just outside the Vir Bhoomi memorial of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, here in central Delhi. It is arguably among the most surreal garden-spaces in the capital. This afternoon at least the place is shedding vibes of utter remoteness—although it is right in the city’s heart, close to the Yamuna river.A bare chested man is dozing off on the grass, his shirt heaped up beside him. Some men are lying towards the pavement (see photo), maybe because much of the ground is still wet due to yesterday’s showers. Not far away another man is covered in a muddy-white chaadar. There are quite a few other folks too. All are men, and all are still, like statues. Only one man seems to be awake. He is lying flat with his hand under his head, his eyes open. None of these loners is holding onto any possession—no bag or briefcase, let alone a lunch packet.Sone minutes later, one of the men gets up and walks towards the road. Looking passively at the traffic, he informs that most folks here, including himself, are without a home. “I walk around looking for work and money and food, and when I get tired I sometimes come to this ghaas-phoos (greenery) to pass the samay (time).” Nobody sleeps here at night, he says.Later, the man walks back and sits on the grass. And again freezes into motionlessness.The setting is filled with a sense of despair, but as these lonesome souls lie here in rest, the garden appears cloaked in empathy. Here one senses a kinder aspect of our huge city where it appears to be welcoming to our fellow citizens who otherwise tend to be hidden from plain sight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-place-for-the-invisibles-101623010492020.html

Farmers from four districts– Hisar, Jind, Sirsa and Fatehabad – will be staging the sit-in at Tohana while station while farmers from the remaining 18 districts will gherao police stations in their respective areas from 11am to 3pm.Farm activists Ravi Azad of Bhiwani and Vikas Sisar of Hisar were arrested on the night of June 2 when they were protesting outside the MLA’s residence over a spat with him that took place a day before. On Saturday, however, the MLA had apologised to the farmers and even promised to take back the cases.The farmer leaders and administration also went into a huddle on Sunday, however, the talks were inconclusive. Activist Yogendra Yadav, who along with Bhartiya Kisan Union leaders Rakesh Tikait, Yudhvir Singh and others farmers, have been staging a sit-in at Tohana Sadar police station since Saturday night, said, “The administration had agreed to withdraw cases but they later took u-turn after which we left the meeting.”“MLA Babli agreed to withdraw two cases filed by his staff but the problem was with the third FIR in which police itself is the complainant. Police officials refused to take back the FIR so we left the meeting. The Samyukta Kisan morcha leaders and family members of the jailed activists have decided that they will not move the bail application until police withdraws the cases,” Yadav added. Rakesh Tikait, who has now emerged as the face of the farmers’ agitation, said Babli had decided to withdraw the cases and apologised for the incident. “We thought the matter was over and the administration would release the protesters but they did not agree even in today’s meeting. We will continue our dharna at Tohana Sadar police station until our activists are released. Farmers from four districts will join us while those from other districts will gherao local police stations,” he added.A senior administrative official, who attended the meeting, said two FIRs against farmers were registered by the MLA’s staff while the third FIR for surrounding the MLA’s house was registered on a police personnel’s complaint.“We will take legal action before deciding on the further course of action. We have told the same to the delegation of farm leaders in the meeting,” the official added.Gurnam Singh Charuni was also sitting on dharna on Sunday morning but had to leave to flag-off farmers’ groups headed to Singhu border from Ambala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-to-gherao-tohana-police-station-today-101623009271246.html

The farmers’ vehicles left around 11:30am with the union’s state president Gurnam Singh Charuni leading it. He claimed that more than 2,500-3,000 vehicles were part of the contingent.This even as another group of farmers were staging a sit-in outside the Tohana Sadar police station demanding the release of two of their activists who were jailed for protesting outside a Jannayak Janta Party legislator’s house. Farmers from Patiala and Mohali in Punjab also joined their Haryana counterparts in their march towards Delhi. Among them was a 11-year-old boy, Amanjot, who came with his father Harpreet from Mohali. When asked, he said he is aware of the gravity of the situation and hence came to support the farmers. “The government wants to suppress the protests in the name of Covid but no farmer will leave any protest site till the laws are taken back,” he said.Another agitator, an 81-year-old former Air Force officer, said he has been registering his protest by wearing black clothes since August 15 last year. “I have been wearing black clothes and a turban of the same colour as a mark of protest against these black laws,” he said.Will start mission UP soon: Charuni When asked about the possibility of talks with the Modi government, Charuni told reporters that even if there is no discussion with the government on a solution, laws have to be taken back.“They are more scared than us. Just look at their situation. Bharatiya Janata Party is losing everywhere. We showed them what we can do in West Bengal, now we are preparing for mission UP against them,” he said referring to the state polls scheduled next year. On the Tohana controversy, he said the matter had almost ended after an apology by JJP MLA Devinder Babli but farmers will agitate till their fellow activists are released.In November last year, farmers from most of the north-Haryana and Punjab region had gathered in Ambala to move towards Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dilli-kooch-2-0-charuni-leads-farmers-contingent-from-ambala-to-delhi-101623008551097.html
07-06-2021||Other||Work on checking waste discharge into Yamuna, Ghaggar still unchecked||Putting a complete check on industrial and domestic waste discharge into the Yamuna and Ghaggar rivers remains a tough task for authorities as work on these projects was found to be below expectation by the River Rejuvenation Committee (RRC) during its latest monthly meeting.It was found that out of 100.5 MLD (millions of liter a day) being discharged into the Yamuna catchment area from 155 locations, authorities were able to divert only 48.15 MLD from 90 locations. Besides, work is yet to be started at around 18 locations. Similarly, in the Ghaggar catchment area, out of the total 42.25 MLD being discharged from 56 locations, only 21.08 MLD from 28 locations has been diverted so far and work has not been started at 14 locations.Moreover, out of the 145 MLD to be diverted from Leg-I, Leg-II and Leg-III of the Najafgarh drain or Badshahpur drain in Gurugram, only 104 MLD has been diverted so far.It was also observed that out of the 126 sources of pollution identified along Yamuna, the action plan for 34 locations is pending. Along the Ghaggar, 69 out of the total 255 identified locations are yet to start taking corrective measures.The committee also took cognisance of the slow progress on laying of sewerage network at Ambala City, Ambala Sadar, Kaithal, Jakhal Mandi, Hisar, Jagadhari-Yamuna Nagar, Palwal, Rohtak, Faridabad, Karnal and Bahadurgarh.It was decided that the industries department will take a survey on shifting industries from several cities of Yamunanagar, Panipat, Sonepat, Rohtak and Faridabad.During the meeting, additional director, industries, also raised the issue of constructing a separate common effluent treatment plant (CETP) and carrying the effluent through tankers for treatment on the pattern of Ludhiana.But a top functionary of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) informed that transport through tankers is not a scientifically accepted method as the effluent is highly dangerous and toxic. HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan told Hindustan Times that the sewer network progress is regularly monitored by RRC as well as the chief secretary in the review meetings.“The progress has been delayed to a certain extent by the pandemic. But the RRC has advised the departments concerned to expedite the same to meet the timeline,” he added.Over the shifting of the industries, he said the Industries department will hold a survey to get the real picture of the number of units in non-conforming areas and work out a plan of action accordingly.It is pertinent to mention here that HSPCB had found groundwater at 38 out of 78 locations in Ghaggar catchment area was unfit while in Yamuna catchment areas, 10 out of 50 locations were not complying to the norms..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/work-on-checking-waste-discharge-into-yamuna-ghaggar-still-unchecked-101623008251340.html
07-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh slips to second position in 2019-2020 Performance Grade Index||After coming in first for two consecutive years, Chandigarh has slipped to the second position, behind Punjab, in the Performance Grade Index (PGI) rankings for 2019-20 released by the Union ministry of education on Sunday.As per the report, Chandigarh has scored 912 out of a possible 1,000 across five major domains with 70 parameters in total.The city has scored 160 out of 180 in “learning outcomes”, which deals with the scores of students in language and mathematics in Classes 3, 5 and 8 of government and aided schools. This is the only category in which Chandigarh is placed first, having been beaten by Punjab in the other four.Chandigarh has scored 77 out of 80 for “access”, which is related to net enrolment ratio, retention rate of students and transition rate from the lower to the higher classes.In “infrastructure and facilities”, Chandigarh has scored 147 out of 150. The parameter includes infrastructure in schools to enable adequate facilities for teaching and learning like functional toilets, availability of clean drinking water, science and computer laboratories.In “equity”, Chandigarh has scored 223 out of 230, which is based on comparative performance of learning outcomes of various categories of students (general category as compared to the other categories) and it also covers children with special needs.Chandigarh scored 305 out of 360 for “governance processes”, which covers management and administration of school education. The gap between Chandigarh and Punjab was highest here with Punjab scoring 346.Lowest score-wise improvement from 2018-19While Chandigarh was able to improve its score from 887 in 2018-19 to 912, this is the lowest score-wise improvement out of the other states and UTs that are placed in the first ten positions. An improvement of 76 points from the score published in 2019 to this year’s is also the lowest among the top ten.Speaking about this, former education secretary of Chandigarh BL Sharma said, “To continue to improve the score, the various domains of the rankings need to be studied and the system improved on those lines. School principals are especially important and they must adopt a leadership role and facilitate the teachers. The department must ensure that teachers can teach and students can learn without any distractions, which will solve most problems.”Former vice-chancellor of Panjab University Arun Kumar Grover added, “Chandigarh needs a committed bureaucracy. One of the reasons why Punjab has fared so well is because of the efforts of Punjab education Secretary Krishan Kumar. Officers here must treat education as something more than a department assigned to them.” Grover added that the city’s government schools also needed to be improved so more residents would send their kids there.Meanwhile, UT education secretary SS Gill said, “Chandigarh has performed really well, even in the recently released Sustainable Development Goals Index report by Niti Aayog. Rather than rote learning we want children to develop an analytical mind. This is why Chandigarh was chosen for Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and why Chandigarh education department is directly being represented at CBSE’s panel for developing the criteria to mark Class 12 children. We improved our score compared to last year and we will continue to improve.”The Performance Grade Index for states and union territories was first published in 2019 with reference to the year 2017-18. As per the ministry of education, the index would propel states and UTs, bringing about optimal education outcomes by helping them pinpoint the gaps and accordingly prioritise areas for intervention to ensure that the school education system is robust at every level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-slips-to-second-position-in-2019-2020-performance-grade-index-101623007891822.html
07-06-2021||Chandigarh||Residents, MC, NGO join hands to make Chandigarh’s Sector 5 ‘puppy-free’ zone||To prevent the surge in dog bite cases during summer, NGO Peedu’s People with the cooperation of the residents of Sector 5 and some other parts of the city, along with the municipal corporation (MC), has made the areas puppy-free zones.District animal welfare officer Inder Sandhu, who runs the NGO and is heading the project, said, “By puppy-free, we mean that all adult dogs in the particular area have been spayed. In Sector 5, we started around September 2020 and counted 27 dogs. Each dog was individually rounded up and spayed and cared for, which took us till December. We have been monitoring the sector ever since to see if any new dogs have come. One female dog had come recently and was spayed as per procedure.”Sandhu said he was helped by the MC authorities in catching the dogs: “Some of the dogs can recognise the MC vehicles from afar and were hard to catch. We were able to spay up to 3-4 dogs in a day.”Sector 5 residents had collectively agreed to hire them. Sanjana Sehgal, a resident and animal lover, who was volunteering with them, said, “We had done our research and by this method, the dogs were treated more humanely. It is better for the dog’s health as well and residents in other bigger sectors can also come forward and tackle the stray dog problem through a step-by-step process.” She added that the residents had contributed around ₹2,000 per house for this.Project was undertaken at golf club last yearSandhu had also worked at Chandigarh Golf Club earlier on a similar project. They had spayed 52 stray dogs there from January to June 2020. Course manager of the club, Amritinder Singh said, “The project was successful and we still keep a count of the stray dogs here. A pregnant dog had come into the premises recently and was spayed later. Dogs have a lifespan of 5-10 years so the results will be visible after some time.”While the project has been successful in smaller areas, senior deputy mayor and local area councillor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu feels that implementing it in bigger sectors will present some problems. “Sector 5 has 79 houses and all members remain in touch on WhatsApp groups. This will be hard to emulate in bigger sectors. However, other resident welfare bodies can learn from citizen participation here.”Dr Kanwarjit Singh, joint director of the Chandigarh animal husbandry and fisheries department, said, “People’s participation can help the authorities identify dogs that need spaying. These people can also monitor the dogs after the operation and they can inform the authorities if their health deteriorates.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/residents-mc-ngo-join-hands-to-make-chandigarh-s-sector-5-puppy-free-zone-101623007231120.html

07-06-2021||Bangalore||Will not review transfer order of Sindhuri, Nag, says Yediyurappa||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday said that there is no question of reviewing the transfer of the two senior officials in Mysuru district after one of them threatened to resign from the administrative services alleging harassment from the other.“Because she (Rohini Sindhuri Dasari) has been transferred, she came. Once a transfer is done, there is no question of reviewing it and I have asked her to report (to her new role),” Yediyurappa said on Sunday.The statements come a day after the Karnataka government decided to transfer both Sindhuri and Shilpa Nag from their respective positions.Nag who was Commissioner of Mysuru City Corporation was transferred as director (e-governance) at the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj department. Sindhuri, who was serving as deputy commissioner, Mysuru, was transferred as commissioner for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments.Nag on Thursday announced her resignation in front of TV news cameras from the Indian Administrative Services, stating that she cannot work in a “suffocating environment”.“With deep sorrow and regret, I am hereby submitting my resignation to the Indian Administrative Service . I humbly ask your kind self to accept this and relieve me of my moral dilemma, pain and sorrow for the sacrilege of the sacred service we have taken oath to serve and protect,” Nag said in a press conference on Thursday in Mysuru, about 125 kms from Bengaluru.Nag made an apparent reference to Sindhuri, and has been at the receiving end of criticism from other political leaders including the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Several political leaders have made scathing personal remarks against Sindhuri since Thursday and before, over earlier encounters with the officer.Sindhuri has been the target of several such attacks, which people aware of the developments said, was because she refuses to cave into demands by politicians trying to get contracts allocated to people related to them or usurp government land.The near public spat between the two officials gave opposition political parties more ammunition to target Yediyurappa over losing control of his own administration.“There is no coordination between ministers, there are differences between ministers, between officials. Administration has collapsed,” DK Shivakumar, the state president of the Congress said on Sunday.Sindhuri was also accused of ignoring desperate calls for help by her colleague from Chamarajanagar where 24 persons died due to shortage of oxygen. On Sunday, a purported voice call between Sindhuri and one of the district officials incharge of oxygen was played on loop by TV channels. In the call, a person believed to be Sindhuri is heard threatening to dismiss the official for supplying oxygen cylinders to neighbouring Chamrajanagar district.The veracity of the audio call recording could not be independently verified.The person believed to be Sindhuri is heard stating that oxygen supplies to all hospitals in Mysuru should be fulfilled at the earliest. It remains unclear when this purported call took place and the context of the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/will-not-review-transfer-order-of-sindhuri-nag-says-yediyurappa-101623006930365.html
07-06-2021||Bangalore||New-age Kannada comedy clubs take flight online||Bengaluru In a Kannada stand-up comedy show, uploaded on 24 May last year, Niroop Mohan, a young performer stands before a live audience. Known for his middle-class observational comedy references, Mohan recites a joke that features him and a friend. Mohan: I called a friend and told him to come for my stand-up comedy show. Friend: Can I get my girlfriend as well? Mohan: I said, of course bring her along, it is an extra ticket for me. Friend (slyly): Please get me two corner seat tickets. Mohan sighs: Is my show an old unsuccessful Kannada cinema? The audience, no more than 50 people, bursts into laughter at the joke, which he built up with a generous mix of the slangs and a colloquial version of Bengaluru Kannada, an anglicized version of the native language of Karnataka. The 9.25 min clip has 2.2 million views on YouTube and is one of the highest viewed for the company that handles Mohan, Multibox entertainment, which took flight months before the lockdown. New-age Kannada comedy has been taking wings for sometime now. With the booming smartphone market and cheap data costs, online video consumption was already seeing a sharp surge, which was further fueled by the Covid-19 pandemic that forced people to remain indoors and spend more time on their electronic devices. A report by E&Y, ‘Playing by new rules: India’s Media & Entertainment sector reboots in 2020’, published in March this year, shows that Indians spent 26.4 hrs on an average per month on YouTube in 2020 from 21.4 hours in 2019, the first time the entire planet went into pandemic-induced lockdown. Kannada comedy content, though not still in competition with English and Hindi content in the same genre, did still account for a sizable chunk of the traffic, people aware of the developments said. TharleBox, Namdu K and several other YouTube channels now operate in the online space, in which every artiste tries to bring in their own unique flavour to capture the diversity of Karnataka, where each of the 30 districts have distinct cultural features which these performers use to entertain a live audience. TharleBox has 315,000 subscribers while Namdu K has 160,000 subscribers. Charan and Lohit, the two people who founded Multibox entertainment, started with open mic’s a few years ago to identify new artistes and test the waters for new ventures. “We have 20 million views, 300,000 subscribers, 60,000 followers on and 10 million views on Instagram,” Geeth Jason Vaz, one of the directors of the company, told Hindustan Times, rattling off statistics which now acts as a stand-in for success of any online content. The company hosted a 12-hour marathon live show in which it got 60 artistes from various fields to be part of the event which was aimed at raising funds for Covid-19 relief. The show has raised around ₹1.3 lakhs and the donation link remains open for those who missed out. But like most other stand-up, Kannada content too depends on live audiences, tours to other cities and other forms of physical presence to perform and familiarise themselves with the masses. Covid-19 has rendered this option almost redundant for the time being, forcing the uploading of online content or re-plugging old ones. Demand has fueled the market and content in India. India’s online video market is estimated to grow to around $4.5 billion in the five years between 2020 and 2025, according to a report by India Online Video and Broadband Distribution by Media Partners Asia. But does online pay? People in the business say that there is a big market but money is hard to come by since views and ads among other parameters determine payouts unlike a live show which goes by just ticket sales, priced anywhere between ₹200 to ₹350. “Covid crisis has definitely taken the live shows away from our hands which has directly affected our livelihood, but we are positively taking this time to ideate and write content that will be produced once the opportunities come back,” Charan said. These companies also maintain strict vigil on uploading of content from these shows, as there is money to be made online as well. Having no control over uploading of content can seriously hamper income prospects, Gangavathi Pranesh, one of Karnataka’s most well-known comics said. “Most of my videos on YouTube have millions of views but I get nothing since it is uploaded by someone who recorded my live performance without my knowledge or consent,” Pranesh said. He said that when he questions this, there are times when people hit back saying that it was a public programme and that the comedian has no right on that content. Pranesh, who craftily blends his north-Karnataka dialect and uses it in almost everyday life references, is a huge crowd puller in most events, religious festivals and other shows across the southern state and has so far toured 415 regions and nine countries. Pranesh has now started to slowly take control over online content featuring his shows and has given only one Kannada TV channel permission to air his shows when they have a low news cycle for which he gets paid. His children have now set up an official YouTube channel, Pranesh Paryatne, which has over 80,000 subscribers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/newage-kannada-comedy-clubs-take-flight-online-101623006870382.html
07-06-2021||Bangalore||As cases dip, questions remain on Covid testing in Karnataka||Bengaluru With a steady decline in new infections, Karnataka’s Covid-19 positivity rate dropped further down to 7.71% on Sunday, an indication that the ongoing second wave is waning. But the visible decline has also come under question on more than one occasion which points towards the possibility of a smaller range of targeted testing for more desirable results. On Sunday, there were 158,274 tests conducted in the state, including 115,041 RT-PCR, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. “With 1,58,274 tests and 12,209 new cases in the last 24 hours Karnataka’s positivity rate falls to 7.71%. 25,659 recoveries were reported in the state today including 10,224 in Bengaluru taking the total recoveries to 24,09,417,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said on Sunday. In comparison, neighbouring Kerala continues to see a higher number of cases despite testing lower numbers, indicating the possibility if Karnataka’s testing strategy requires a re-look. Kerala reported a positivity rate of 14.27% with 1,02,792 tests on Sunday.Karnataka is currently focusing on targeted testing that include groups like primary and secondary contacts as well as symptomatic persons. However, there is little focus on random testing, raising concerns since the majority of all Covid-19 infected persons are asymptomatic and could be carriers of the virus. “Random testing has to be continued. No question about it. People who are reporting for duty from other places, that (testing) has to be made compulsory,” Dr CN Manjunath, cardiologist and director of Sri Jayadeva. Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research said. He added that people who work in Bengaluru but have since returned home due to the lockdown, should be tested as they could be “asymptomatic carriers.” The Congress party in Karnataka maintains that the decline in cases is “artificial” and does not represent the true picture on the ground. Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on June 3 had said that the government will consider the lifting of the lockdown if the positivity rate comes down to below 5%. The average positivity rate over the last seven days in Bengaluru (as on June 5) is 5.20% but a majority of the districts have a significantly higher average, data from the state Covid-19 war room shows. The seven day average positivity rate (until 5 pm on June 5) in Mysuru is 25.16%, 22.77% in Chikmagalur, 19.94% in Davangere, 17.37% in Dakshina Kannada, 17.07% in Chamarajanagar, 16.85% in Chitradurga and 16.74% in Uttara Kannada, data shows. Like most urban centres globally, Bengaluru was among the first to witness a surge in Karnataka. But the infection spread to other districts since there is significant movement between large cities like Bengaluru, Mysuru and other places and small towns for various reasons including employment or business. Similarly, Bengaluru, which peaked early is also expected to decline faster than the others. But in a state like Karnataka, where a significant number of people from across the state travel to Bengaluru, experts worry about a reversal of the process. “Although the numbers are coming down, it has to be sustained for another week,” Dr Manjunath said. “Suppose if you uniformly lift the lockdown, then there is a chance that people will start coming from these districts to Benglauru and again cycle can be repeated,” Manjunath, who is also a member of Karnataka’s taskforce on Covid-19, said. He said, in his personal opinion, it would be better to extend the lockdown period beyond June 14 in some districts. Yediyurappa is expected to hold a significant meeting with the technical advisory committee (TAC), ministers and other senior officials in Bengaluru on Monday on the Covid situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/as-cases-dip-questions-remain-on-covid-testing-in-karnataka-101623006811488.html
07-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC set to spend ₹4 crore on house number boards||Even as the municipal corporation continues to face acute financial crunch, it plans to spend more than ₹4 crore to install stainless-steel house number boards. The civic body is tapping into the councillors’ ward development fund (WDF) to carry out the project and already floated tenders for some areas where the boards are to be installed. A tender worth ₹25 lakh has been floated for Sectors 39 and 40 and another for worth ₹8 lakh for Sector 29. A time of two months has been given for the installation. MC chief engineer Shailender Singh, said, “The boards are being installed in all the wards, as councillors have demanded it. For each ward, the estimated cost is around ₹25 lakh.” The current MC has 26 wards. The ward development funds are allocated to each councilor for development activity in his ward. MC has earmarked ₹80 lakh for each ward for the financial year 2021-2022. The floating of these tenders closely follows the MC general House’s refusal to fund the installation of new speed limit boards on roads under its jurisdiction. Citing fund issues, the House though had agreed to undertake the work, but only if the UT administration funds the project. The civic body had prepared a ₹2-crore tender for installing the sign boards on the roads under its jurisdiction after new speed limits were finalised. The agenda for it was tabled before the House on May 31, but wasn’t approved. The MC’s move to spend on number boards has also elicited some criticism. Baljinder Singh Bittu, chairman of FOSWAC, said, “At a time when boosting health infrastructure and facilities related to it should be the priority, the MC is spending funds here. The MC has been in the habit of wasting precious funds even though it is said to be struggling to meet even its routine expenses.” Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations (CFORWO), said, “It seems that the MC has misplaced priorities. Though the boards are required and we have been demanding it, but at present the priority should be to spend on the city’s poor sanitation. For instance, the waste processing plant has been shut for the last one year and MC should use the funds to restart it.” Notably, MC had earlier installed boards in Sectors 16 and 35, but in other sectors it was stopped. Councillors of other sectors are also demanding the installation of the boards. Stating that the approval for installation of the boards in the rest of the wards has now come from the administration, Singh, said, “The UT chief architect has also approved the installation of the boards.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-set-to-spend-4-crore-on-house-number-boards-101623006811015.html

Noticing the increased demand for medicines, they found an opportunity to make easy money and learnt the modus operandi from the internet,” said Gurjot Singh Kaler, senior superintendent of police (cyber), while addressing the media on Sunday.An alert about the fraud from Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand Police led to the arrests. Amit was the first to be arrested from Zirakpur, while Kulwinder was arrested from Kaithal, Haryana. “ ₹14 lakh in cash and five debit cards of different banks have been recovered from the accused,” the SSP said. Cash totalling ₹3 lakh and four debit cards were found in Mandeep’s possession, ₹6.5 lakh and one debit card was recovered from Kulwinder. Another ₹3.5 lakh was found in his bank account, which has been frozen, while ₹1 lakh was found in Amit’s account. “Most of the victims were duped through online transactions. We will try to reach them by tracing their bank accounts so that the money can be returned,” Kaler said. Posted advts on social media to lure peopleThe SSP said the accused circulated fake advertisements on social media, mainly on groups about selling injections at lower rates, even though they were not in contact with any medicine supplier to procure the injections or any other drug. “They used different mobile numbers on the advertisements and even formed a WhatApp group to widen their reach. The gang had been active for past couple of months when the Covid cases were peaking and demand for these drugs was high,” said Kaler. “After taking orders from relatives and patients, they would ask them to deposit the money in their bank accounts and would stop taking calls by blocking the mobile numbers,” he added.They mostly targeted people staying in remote areas of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. Mastermind used English skills to convince victims According to investigators, Kulwinder is the mastermind of the gang. Among the trio, Kulwinder is the most fluent in English and would talk to the victims over the phone. Amit was tasked with opening new bank accounts to receive the unwary victims’ money and Mandeep used to withdraw the cash. Used PoS machines to withdraw money To avoid being caught, they would visit various petrol pumps and use the point of sale (PoS) machines to swipe their debit cards and take cash in return. They were operating multiple bank accounts with different names in various branches of HDFC and IndusInd banks to manage the racket, the SSP said. The accused have been booked under Sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 5 of the Disaster Management Act at the Zirakpur police station. They were produced before a court on Sunday and sent to four-day police remand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gang-that-duped-patients-in-search-of-covid-drugs-busted-in-mohali-101623006751004.html

The majority of them said that they miss outings with their friends and parents and have picked up bicycling, cooking, gardening, photography, and baking as hobbies amid the break. To relax, several students have incorporated yoga, warm-up exercises in their routine. They shared that they miss physical summer camps and watching movies in a cinema hall during vacations.Suhavi Sharma, a Class 9 student of Sacred Heart Convent International, Sarabha Nagar, said, “I miss attending weekly physical education classes and fine arts period as it was an escape from our monotonous schedule. Now, I have involved myself in various activities such as bicycling, playing the harmonium and baking, etc. Furthermore, I have also developed an interest in photography and am keen to learn more about it. This summer, my friends and I are planning to learn a new language by ourselves via platforms like Zoom.”Anuradha, a Class 11 student of Malwa Khalsa Senior Secondary School, said that her school had declared summer break from June 1 and she has been helping her mother with gardening and planting new saplings since then.She said, “Due to the fear of getting infected, I am staying at home during the vacation. I have involved myself in indoor activities. I do morning exercise, walk for 30 minutes, and then water the plants in our garden. I help my mother in the kitchen and learn to cook new dishes from her.” Harshpreet Singh Alg, Class 11 student of Sacred Heart School, Sector 39, Chandigarh Road, said, “I miss my practice sessions as I have been playing basketball for the last many years. I used to go to Guru Nanak Stadium for practice but the pandemic has ruined everything. Now to channelize my energy amid the summer break, I have set up a ring at my home and practice every morning. I have been helping my mother in gardening and have learned to make pizza, French fries, and burgers.”Schools divided on the need for summer vacationSeveral private school principals have stated that there is no need for summer break as the students are already attending classes from home. Rajesh Rudra, director of Green Land schools, “Online classes are going on and exams will start for all classes from June 26.

07-06-2021||Bangalore||Will resign if high command asks: Yediyurappa||Bengaluru Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday said that he would forgo the chief ministerial post if the central leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) asks him to step down. “Till I have the confidence of the Delhi high command, I will continue as chief minister till then. The day they say that we do not want you, I will step down that day and continue to work day and night for the development of the state. I am in no confusion over this,” Yediyurappa told reporters on Sunday. His statements indicate either a softening of his hard stance or the possibility that the BJP is likely to have agreed to continue with the 78-year-old helming affairs at least till the end of his current term in office. The statements come at a time when several ministers from his own government and legislators from the BJP continue to mobilize support for Yediyurappa’s immediate ouster. Yediyurappa has been sworn in as chief minister a record four times and has had to forgo the top chair well before completion of his term.The chief minister is trying to negotiate with the central leadership of the party to retain him at least till the 2023 assembly elections. With no credible alternative yet, the BJP at the centre has been patient in its handling of the simmering political crisis in Karnataka to avoid a repeat of the backlash they faced in 2013 assembly polls. A disgruntled Yediyurappa left the BJP in 2012 which reduced the saffron outfit to 50 out of the 224 seats in 2013 from 110 in 2010. R Ashok, Karnataka’s minister for revenue on Sunday said that the debate over a possible leadership change in the state should end since senior leaders from the party have clarified that Yediyurappa will continue as the chief minister. “We need his leadership today as well as in the future as well,” Ashok, considered to be part of Yediyurappa’s close circles, said. He said that the party will now work toward building its image and that any speculation of a leadership change should end now. Yediyurappa has seen his own ministers and legislators take turns to rush to Delhi and meet the senior leadership to request for a change in leadership over the mishandling of the Covid-19 situation, corruption, poor performance in the bypolls and allegations that the chief minister’s son, BY Vijayendra is running a parallel administration in the state. People aware of the developments said that Yediyurappa is negotiating to remain in power till at least the next assembly elections and to placate his son within the government. Vijayendra is the state BJP vice president and enjoys significant clout in the government and party. Vijayendra had met BJP national president JP Nadda on Thursday. Several other BJP leaders also aired similar opinions backing Yediyurappa. “There is no proposal for change of leadership before the party,” Pralhad Joshi, the union minister of parliamentary affairs, coal and mines said on Sunday. Nalin Kumar Kateel, the state BJP president, gave an identical statement to reporters in Mangaluru. He said that there are no “rebels” within the party and the BJP will hold meetings with all legislators to hear their grievances this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/will-resign-if-high-command-asksyediyurappa-101623006631053.html

The food stall employee, Ramakant Muniji Yadav, was arrested for molesting the corporator and threatening her. After came out on bail, he filed a complaint of assault against her. According to the police, the incident took place on May 5, when Yadav was working at the stall in Malad (West). Yadav in his complaint said that he was handing out parcels of fast food by adhering to the lockdown guidelines, when around 5pm, a customer ordered a take-away but ate the food outside the shop. He then rinsed his mouth in the area, when the corporator arrived at the spot in her two-wheeler.“She first abused the customer and then assaulted him. He managed to flee from there. The corporator then entered the stall and started beating me,” said Yadav in his statement.He added that when his nose started to bleed, he tried to stop the corporator from assaulting him further but she had called some men by then, who allegedly assaulted Yadav and allegedly took ₹28,000 from his cash drawer and left.After the incident, Bangur Nagar police took him to the police station. He claimed he knew that the woman is a corporator only then. Yadav was arrested and remanded in judicial custody for seven days. “We had arrested Yadav for molestation. However, we also recorded his complaint as we are obliged to and are verifying it. No arrests have been made so far in the case,” said Vishal Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (zone 11).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stall-staff-says-mumbai-corporator-assaulted-him-101623006630409.html
07-06-2021||Other||Bombay HC to state: Pay kin of cop who drowned during duty||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state to accord the benefits that a family of a head constable who lost their lives during an operation are entitled to. Ganesh Chavan, a head constable with the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF), was on duty at the Maoist-hit Gadchiroli district when he and three of his colleagues were asked to help take out a state transport bus stuck in mud near the Border Road Organisation camp at Medapalli. The four personnel reached the spot with a tipper truck to pull out the bus and successfully completed the rescue operation. However, while returning to the camp, the truck swept away in river Pamulgautam and all the four personnel died by drowning. As per a November 28, 2008, government resolution (GR), Chavan’s family received salary from SRPF, which he was earning while on duty. However, following an order of the state government in July 2019, the salary was discontinued. Aggrieved by the loss of the income, Chavan’s wife approached the Bombay high court (HC) seeking directions for the continuation of the salary and other compensatory benefits which Chavan was eligible to get. A division bench of justice KK Tated and justice NR Borkar, while hearing her petition was informed by advocate Vishwasrao Deokar that Chavan was the sole bread winner of the family and after his untimely death they had survived on his salary from the past decade. Deokar further informed the court that Chavan’s family was still awaiting the other compensatory benefits which have remained pending since his death. The state in its affidavit, filed through additional government pleader Karan Thorat, submitted that the director general of police (DGP), Maharashtra, had written a letter to the state on May 12, 2010, seeking appropriate orders over sanctioning compensation and other benefits to Chavan’s family. The state had sought details regarding help given to the families of the four personnel, the status of compassionate appointment to them and the status of a first information report (FIR) registered at Lahiri police station against the driver. The affidavit further stated that a magistrate court had found that the driver of the truck had been guilty of rash and negligent driving, which resulted in the vehicle getting swept away in the river and the four deaths, and hence, he was convicted. In light of this conviction, the state rejected the proposal of the DGP, and hence, the payment of the salary to Chavan’s family was stopped from August 2019. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that the driver’s conviction had nothing to do with the payment of salary and other compensatory benefits to the families of the four police personnel and the only question which arose was if Chavan had died during an anti-Maoist, anti-terrorist or rescue operation. As Chavan had died after carrying out the rescue operation, his family was eligible for compensation as per the 2008 GR and hence, the state was bound to pay the family. The court then set aside the July 2019 order of the government and directed the state to accord within two months the benefits that Chavan’s family are entitled to in the 2008 GR as also the arrears, and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-to-state-pay-kin-of-cop-who-drowned-during-duty-101623006570341.html

07-06-2021||Other||No HSC exams: Mumbai Colleges brainstorm over admissions||After the Maharashtra education department on June 3 announced to scrap the Class 12 state board or Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exams for the 2020-21 academic year, colleges affiliated to the University of Mumbai (MU) are busy planning the next few months. While reopening of colleges for the current batches is their priority, many colleges are brainstorming on suggestions to the government on how admissions to undergraduate (UG) degree courses across higher educational institutes could be conducted for the upcoming academic year.“Every year, around 80% fresh Class 12 students and less than 40% repeaters clear HSC exam. But this year, there’ll be 100% pass percentage, which means that the government would have to ensure that all these students are accommodated in colleges,” said the principal of a suburban college. She added that like every year, the race to the top colleges will be a challenge and possibly more chaotic than to the rest of the colleges. With no clarity yet on whether admissions to UG courses will depend on Class 12 internal exam marks or a fresh common entrance test, colleges are trying to fill in the gaps at their own level. “We are waiting for the government to give better clarity on how admissions can be conducted for UG courses, but we too have been planning brainstorming sessions with our staff and officials,” said Naresh Chandra, principal, BK Birla College, Kalyan. He added that degree admissions are more tedious as compared to junior colleges admissions because of a barrage of courses available for the students, including vanilla courses as well as professional courses under the unaided sections of various colleges. “Admissions criterion will have to be well-defined by the state to know how scores will be calculated for students in open and reserved categories, for aided, unaided courses, professional as well as vocational courses, so that chaos can be avoided during admissions and every student gets an equal chance to admissions,” said Chandra and added that autonomous colleges are still unsure if they will be allowed to conduct admissions on an individual level.Some colleges, aware of the ambiguity surrounding exams, had ensured a series of internal exams for their Class 12 batches before the second lockdown was implemented this year. “We made sure that students attended the unit tests and preliminary exams. If future admissions depend on their internal test marks, we have them ready. We are also prepared for an entrance exam to confirm admissions,” said Ancy Jose, principal, Nagindas Khandwala Autonomous College, Malad.On June 2, the state cabinet had taken an in-principle decision to scrap the exams after most of the ministers supported the idea considering serious concerns over the health and safety of the students. The school education department then moved a proposal to the state disaster management authority headed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to take the final decision, which came through a day later. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad also welcomed the Centre’s decision to cancel the CBSE Class 12 exams last week.Around 1.5 million students appear for Class 12 exams in the state every year.The state had also cancelled the Class 10 board exams, and students will be promoted on the basis of their performance in Class 9 and Class 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-hsc-exams-mumbai-colleges-brainstorm-over-admissions-101623006391350.html

07-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab floriculturists hoping for post-Covid bloom||After facing losses in the last two harvesting seasons to Covid restrictions, floriculturists are worried about the future market prospects. Sowing for winter flower crops will commence in August-September.As a number of coronavirus infections have started showing a downward trend, floriculturists hope of improved market conditions in the religious and marriage season from October onwards, followed by state assembly elections early next year.Since the Covid-19 outbreak in March last year, the demand for flowers has almost dried up. Several farmers had to plough the standing crop of flowers twice in the last one-and-a-half years because of dearth of buyers in Punjab and other states.Gurvinder Singh of Khamano in Fatehgarh district cultivates gladiolus, marigold gerbera and other varieties on 20 acres. But as marriages turned into a low-key affair and there were restrictions on religious functions, Gurvinder suffered a loss of around ₹25 lakh.“I was sowing gladiolus on 12 acres but I had to plough a field on two occasions without harvesting flowers. As sowing will commence in August, I am planning to reduce area under floriculture by 60%,” he said.In Punjab, the area under floriculture remains between 2,100-2,400 hectares. Marigold, gerbera, gladiolus, carnation, rose, chrysanthemum and lilium are among main varieties of flowers.Jalandhar-based progressive farmer Karanvir Singh Sandhu said sowing and maintaining flowers on one acre involves an investment of ₹2.5 lakh. But there was hardly any sale from his seven-acre farm. To reduce loss, he used cultivated flowers to store seeds for the next season.Sandhu foresees a challenging time ahead as the market is now flooded with artificial flowers as a replacement for most varieties. “I had about 7 acres area under different flower varieties. This year, I avoided the summer sowing of marigolds, which is mainly used in marriages and religious events. In the last few months, I managed to supply some stock to the Delhi market but payments did not materialise,” said Sandhu.Another floriculturist Gurpreet Shergill from Patiala’s Majhal Khurd feels uncertainty in the market but plans to go ahead with preparing fields for the next crop.“Farmers are planning to decrease farming area to minimise losses in case of pandemic relapses later this year,” he said.Floriculture expert at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Dr Manjit Singh said: “Some units have started using dried marigold for manufacturing poultry feed. Farmers are being guided about this opportunity too. We hope that the flower industry will bloom again this season after Covid caseload has started witnessing a dip in the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-floriculturists-hoping-for-post-covid-bloom-101623006272056.html

But Ajit had died by the time he was rushed to a hospital. Satnam was nabbed on Sunday evening and was found in an inebriated condition, said assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Raj Kumar.Brothers lost jobs amid pandemic: MotherIn her statement to the police, Kaur said she had two sons and a daughter who is married. Both her sons were single and had lost their jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic, which had led to discord at home. Satnam used to be a bank security guard earlier and had a licensed gun.“Around 9pm on Saturday, Satnam came home with his friend and sat in his room. After a while Ajit also returned home. Suspecting that Satnam was drinking with his friend he requested him not to, as their father disapproved of it,” the mother said.Ajit then left to meet his father in the next house, while Satnam, feeling insulted, also walked out with the friend. “Satnam returned after an hour and locked his room from the inside. As he is quite aggressive, I bolted his door from the outside, but let him out on his request, as his cousin was arriving soon,” the mother said.After returning home, Ajit had dinner and lied down on a cot around 12am, when Satnam suddenly brought out his gun and shot Ajit twice in the head.The shocked mother ran to the next house to fetch her husband who alerted the police. The couple took Ajit to a hospital where doctors declared him dead.Satnam is facing a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 25 of the Arms Act, registered at the Chandimandir police station on his mother’s complaint.‘Don’t want to live’In the video shared by Satnam on his Facebook account, corroborated by police, he confessed that he had shot his brother. Appearing to be in an inebriated condition, he moved the camera from his face towards Ajit, writhing in pain on a cot next to him, with bullet wounds on his forehead. Turning the camera back towards him, he said, “The government can hang me, I don’t care. I don’t want to live. Had I had more bullets I would have shot myself as well.”“This is a digital piece of evidence and will be investigated. Whether it was a Facebook live or an uploaded video, only further investigation will reveal,” said ACP Raj Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/stopped-from-drinking-jobless-man-shoots-brother-dead-in-chandimandir-101623006270858.html

She was 35. We got her admitted in a hospital. She was responding well to medicines. But the next day, there was an acute shortage of oxygen and she succumbed. Who knew then it was just the beginning of a series of tragedies to follow,” he says.“When we returned home after cremating her, my younger son also fell sick. He, too, was admitted in hospital and succumbed to Covid-19 on April 16. He was 40. He was running a general merchant shop from our house at Rajajipuram,” he says.The elder son, a private driver, also died due to Covid-19 on April 23.The retired UPSRTC driver is looking for help from the state government for the survival of his grandchildren.“I will now have to look after the four grandchildren as I lost my two sons and a daughter-in-law to Covid-19. The younger son and daughter-in-law have a daughter aged six years and a son aged 13 years. The elder son has a 14-year-old daughter and a 17-year-old son,” he says.His 65-year-old wife is afflicted with paralysis. Their eldest daughter-in-law is now looking after the entire family.He claims the grandchildren have not been covered by the Uttar Pradesh government scheme meant for such orphaned children as they could not move the papers with government officials on time. Nevertheless, he wants the state government to help the family.Only recently, three of the children got admission at the St Joseph College as the manager of the school assured 100% fee waiver for the orphaned children and 50% concession to those kids who lost either of the parents to Covid-19.The Uttar Pradesh government on May 29 announced a welfare scheme for children who have either lost both of their parents to Covid-19 or the earning parent. Under the Uttar Pradesh Mukhyamantri Bal Seva Yojana, the government will provide a monthly financial assistance of ₹4,000 to a child’s guardian or caretaker till he or she attains adulthood, a spokesperson had said.Elaborating on the scheme, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had said, “Children who have lost both of their parents to Covid-19, a surviving parent, legal guardian in case the parents have already died earlier, will be included in this scheme. Children, who have lost the earning parent of their family, will also be included in the scheme. The state government is committed to better health, better education and for the bright future of the children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lucknow-family-faces-grim-battle-for-survival-after-covid-19-causes-triple-tragedy-101623006030350.html
07-06-2021||Chandigarh||Black fungus also maiming asymptomatic Covid patients: Study||With thousands of people successfully beating the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), only to be maimed by the “deadlier” mucormycosis or black fungus, Dayanand Medical College and Hospital is looking into the causes behind spurt in cases of this formerly rare fungal infection. The study, which is being conducted by the hospital’s medicine department, has so far revealed that even asymptomatic Covid patients, who required neither hospitalisation nor oxygen support, had been afflicted. DMCH medicine professor and member of Punjab’s Covid task force Dr Rajesh Mahajan, who is heading the study, says, “It was found that repeatedly reusing old masks that are often teeming with bacteria and moisture is responsible for rising black fungus cases among recovering Covid patients whose immunity has taken a hit.” Industrial oxygen not to blame “Excessive steam inhalation at home and injuries sustained while being put on oxygen support were also found to be contributing factors,” Mahajan said, adding that study had found that use of industrial oxygen was not responsible for the rise in cases. On why a formerly rare infection had suddenly started afflicting so many people, Mahajan said, “Mucormycosis is not an unknown phenomenon as the fungus is found in the environment. Earlier, too, we were receiving cases of the disease. However, its prevalence has increased amid the pandemic, especially among patients suffering from uncontrolled diabetes.” The virus causes weakness and lowers the immunity level, which is responsible for the greater prevalence of mucormycosis, he said. “It is an ongoing study. So far, we have studied nearly 100 cases,” said Dr Mahajan.Civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia says overuse of immunosuppressants, especially when taken without consulting a specialist, were responsible for rising cases amid Covid patients. 48 active cases Two more black fungus cases were reported in the district on Sunday, which has taken the case count to 94. There are now 48 active cases in the district. Twelve patients — four from Ludhiana and eight from other districts — have succumbed to the fungal infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/black-fungus-also-maiming-asymptomatic-covid-patients-study-101623005972042.html
07-06-2021||Chandigarh||Roof collapse: Patiala MC to tighten noose around builders||Four days after four labourers were injured after a roof of an illegal under-construction building collapsed, the Patiala municipal corporation has decided to tighten noose around builders.The civic body has planned to hold special drive to identify such units in commercial areas so that stringent action, including demolition drives, could be undertaken. On June 3, roof of a 500 square yard building, being constructed illegally, collapsed near the Sanauri Adda area. Of every 10 complaints received by the MC, seven pertain to building bylaws violation. The corporation has issued notices to at least 700 defaulters since 2014.Patiala MC commissioner Punamdeep Kaur said a special team of the building department has been constituted, which has been tasked to carry out a survey to identify illegal buildings so that action can be taken against builders.Building bylaws prove ineffectiveTo check the mushrooming of unauthorised buildings under urban local bodies (ULB) limits, the Punjab local government department had introduced new building bylaws in December 2018. But these by-laws have turned out to be ineffective with rampant violations being reported. The new rules state that in the case of unauthorised development, the authority shall take suitable action, which may include demolition of unauthorised works, sealing of premises, prosecution and criminal proceedings against the offender. OTS scheme on holdWith the Punjab local government department putting the implementation of one-time settlement (OTS) of non-compoundable violations in unauthorised construction on hold for over a year-and-half now, violations continue unabated. Under the policy, illegal buildings that sprung up in the state before June 30, 2018, were to be regularised. The policy was conceptualised during the tenure of former local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, but was put in cold storage after Brahm Mohindra took charge in June 2019. Mohindra then termed the policy faulty and asked officials to revise it before re-implementing it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roof-collapse-patiala-mc-to-tighten-noose-around-builders-101623005911022.html
07-06-2021||Mumbai||Societies in Mumbai get flu shots for children||After holding Covid-19 vaccination drives for adults, societies in Mumbai have now started organising vaccination drive for influenza, also called flu shots, for children on their premises. This may help boost immunity among children to fight influenza, which has similar symptoms similar to Covid-19, said experts. Doctors have welcomed the move. Recently, several major private hospitals, including Bombay Hospital, Hiranandani and Lilavati, are receiving requests from societies to hold camps for flu shots. “We received two types of calls from societies – one to hold Covid-19 vaccination camps for adults and the other, to organise camps for flu shots for children. On a daily basis, we are getting around three-four queries regarding flu shots,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, consultant physician at Bombay Hospital and in-charge of Covid-19 beds in private hospitals. Dr V Ravishankar, CEO of Lilavati Hospital, said, “Many anxious parents want to give the shot to their children as at present, due to age restriction, children aren’t allowed for Covid-19 vaccination.” On Saturday, Atmosphere Society, Mulund held a camp for flu shots on their premises, where around 70 children got the jab. Talking to HT, Sanjay Nair, 53, the resident and organiser of the camp, said, “Covid-19 and flu have similar symptoms. So, even if a child contracts the flu, it makes parents anxious, which unnecessarily leads to chaos. Beds get filled with suspected paediatric patients. To stop such instances, we decided to give the flu shots to children.” Data shared by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shows that the Covid-19 infection among children doubled in April, compared to February when the second wave started. As of February 21, as many as 5,397 children between the age group of 0-9 years contracted the infection, which rose to 10,883 on April 30, the month when the pandemic curve was at its peak. In May, the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) recommended giving annual flu shots to all children below 5 years. In fact, Maharashtra’s paediatric task force made a similar recommendation to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray which may be fruitful in the fight against Covid-19 in a possible third wave. Dr Subhas Prabhu, who heads the paediatric task force, said the symptoms of Covid-19 and seasonal flu are similar. So, taking the shot might help control the mental anguish of parents if their children develop a flu. “There is no scientific evidence that the third wave would hit the children more. So, I can’t comment on it. But if taking the shot may help control development of influenza, it would decrease the unnecessary burden on the hospitals. This is just a precautionary measure,” he said. Dr Meenakshi Girish, head of the paediatric department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Nagpur, said that the shot will not provide any protection against Covid-19, but may help in boosting immunity among children. “Every year, during monsoon, we witness a heavy load of paediatric patients with influenza. The jab helps strengthen their immunity which may help control such infections.” The cost of the shot varies between ₹1,200 and ₹1,400 which makes it unaffordable for many. State task force expert Dr Sanjay Oke has suggested the state make the flu shot free for children coming from poor economic backgrounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/societies-in-mumbai-get-flu-shots-for-children-101623005790341.html

07-06-2021||Chandigarh||School education: Punjab tops performance grading index||Punjab topped the national performance grading index of school education for 2019-20 released by the Centre on Sunday. Punjab, which has improved its showing from 13th position it attained in 2018-19, topped the charts this time among all the states and union territories with a score of 929 out of 1,000, followed by Chandigarh (912) and Tamil Nadu (906). The performance grading index ranks the states on a set of 70 parameters relating to learning outcomes and quality, access, infrastructure and facilities, equity and governance processes to catalyse transformational change in the field of school education, according to a school education department official. “Happy to share that Punjab has been ranked as top performer among all States and UTs in school education in the Performance Grading Index 2019-20. This is the result of focus, hard work and commitment of all our teachers and administrators,” chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh tweeted after the rankings were released by the Union ministry of education. Neighbouring Haryana and Himachal Pradesh are at 11th and 13th positions. Shot in the arm in poll yearThe national school education grading comes as a much-needed boost for the Amarinder Singh government ahead of the state elections, as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the principal opposition party, is trying to corner the ruling Congress on school education. The AAP has been repeatedly comparing the state of government schools and their performance in Punjab with that in Delhi, where its national convener Arvind Kejriwal heads the government, telling Amarinder to learn from him. Punjab is the top performer whereas Delhi is at number six in theses rankings, giving the former an upper hand. The assembly elections in Punjab are due early next year. Stands out in school infra, accessThe state has done well in infrastructure and facilities in schools, access and governance processes as compared to previous years, the ministry report showed. The school education department has given a facelift to many of its schools across the state, improving the available infrastructure and facilities, and has scored the maximum 150 points. Similarly, it is on top in access to school education, governance reforms and providing equal opportunities to disadvantaged sections, including girls and differently abled children. Education quality a concernDespite its enormous leap in rankings, Punjab remains a laggard in learning outcomes and quality of education. The state has ranked 27 in this category with a score of 126 out of 180, according to the report. It lags behind Rajasthan (169), Chandigarh (160), Karnataka (160), Jharkhand (156), Gujarat (152), Andhra Pradesh (154), Himachal Pradesh (140) and Haryana (134). However, the state has done better than Delhi, which has a score of 124. The scores are based on annual assessments and National Achievement Survey, which was last carried out two years ago. Result of sustained efforts: MinisterPunjab school education minister Vijay Inder Singla said the state’s top ranking in the performance grading index was the result of sustained and concentrated efforts of the state government. “The government has not only taken new initiatives but also introduced several reforms which brought the much-desired optimal education outcomes at every level,” he said in a statement. Among these initiatives, he listed the smart school policy, online teacher transfer policy, introduction of pre-primary classes, teacher recruitment, online education and distribution of free smartphones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/school-education-punjab-tops-performance-grading-index-101623005251437.html
07-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM virtually meets corporate honchos over economic revival||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday held discussions with leading corporate honchos and film and TV producers, following the unlocking rules set by the state government, to be imposed from Monday. He asked the business leaders to develop health facilities for the employees, on the lines of field hospitals developed by the state government. CM said that even in the case of a third wave and a subsequent lockdown, the daily activities of industries should not be impacted. In a separate meeting, he asked the film and TV producers to be more careful while restarting shooting activities and extra precaution while filming mob scenes as they require a large number of people.“I want to set an example of running the industries, by taking all the necessary precautions amid the Covid-19 pandemic. We neither want lockdown nor knockdown, thus everyone is expected to follow Covid rules. We have taken a calculated risk and will have to be careful while unlocking. We want to kill the snake without breaking the stick,” the chief minister said in a virtual meeting with the corporate leaders, on Sunday.The state government has decided to relax lockdown restrictions in cities and districts by imposing a five-level unlock plan which is based on positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy in hospitals. The areas coming under level 1 and 2 will be allowed to restart all the regular activities and will be free from most of the restrictions. However, experts have also predicted third wave in the state by August.“Even if a third wave hits the state and lockdown has to be imposed, there should be no impact on the industrial production. Industries need to develop health and residential facilities, the way the state government has developed field hospitals. Those employees travelling from other states should be tested and isolated. Staggering of duty hours, multiple shifts and lunch breaks should also be staggered to ensure a large number of employees will not be gathered,” suggested the chief minister.The corporate honchos expressed happiness with the state government’s decision on unlocking. However, they want the general public to be allowed to travel through local trains as it is the most convenient mode of transport in Mumbai and surrounding cities. They were also of the view that the IT sector should continue with the work from home (WFH) model,” said a senior official, wishing not to be named.Harsh Goenka, chairman, RPG Enterprises said that the Maharashtra model is worth emulating by all the states across the country. After meeting with the chief minister, Goenka tweeted, “The very sensible and scientific graded opening of lockdown from tomorrow ‘Maharashtra Model’ is worth emulating by all states. CM Thackeray very well put today ‘It’s a balance between lockdown and knockdown — the disease has to be contained and the economy has also to prosper.”The industry leaders who attended the meeting comprised Uday Kotak, former president Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Sanjiv Bajaj president-designate CII, Dr Naushad Forbes, Amit Kalyani, Ashok Hinduja, Dr Anish Shah, Ajay Piramal, Banmali Agrawala, Sunil Mathur, Ujjwal Mathur, Sanjeev Singh, Boman Irani, Niranjan Hiranandani, Asim Charania, Sulajja Firodia Motwani etc. State industries minister Subhash Desai was also present along with senior officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-virtually-meets-corporate-honchos-over-economic-revival-101623004950427.html

07-06-2021||Noida||GB Nagar, Ghaziabad get respite from Covid curfew||/Ghaziabad: With the number of new and active Covid-19 cases declining, the Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad administrations announced relaxations in partial Covid curfew in the districts from Monday, after a gap of 37 days.The restrictions had been put in place in the two districts on April 30. On May 30, however, the state government had said that districts which had less than 600 cases may lift restrictions. So far, 71 of the 75 districts in the state, including Ghaziabad and GB Nagar, have managed to bring down the number of active cases to below 600-mark.If the number of active cases breaches the mark, the partial curfew will come automatically into place, state officials had said.The joy of lifting of restrictions, however, comes with riders and might be a short-lived affair. With 91 fresh cases detected on Sunday in GB Nagar, and 30 new cases detected in Ghaziabad, the tally of active cases reached 583 – only 17 short to come under the partial curfew bracket once again – in GB Nagar, and 496 – only four short of the 600-mark – in Ghaziabad.“Due to this rider, we will keep enforcement at a heightened level and will also conduct checks in high case-load areas like Indirapuram, Vaishali and Sahibabad, among others. From now on, efforts will be directed towards keeping the tally of active cases below 600. Discussions were held with residents, transporters, market associations and other stakeholders and they were told that it is the collective responsibility of all to check the spread of the virus,” said Shailendra Kumar Singh, additional district magistrate (city), Ghaziabad. Despite the relaxations coming into place, weekend as well as night curfews will continue to be in place in both districts, officials said.“All directions issued by the UP government on May 30 regarding the curfew relaxation will apply to the district. The weekends will be observed as days of closure while night restrictions will remain in place from 7pm to 7am (next day) every day,” the ADM added. “During the weekend, cleanliness, sanitisation and fogging will be conducted. A maximum of two passengers will be allowed in three-wheelers, three in e-rickshaws, and four in four-wheelers, with proper masking and social distancing,” said GB Nagar DM Suhas LY. Shops and markets outside containment zones are allowed to remain open from 7 am to 7 pm, while vegetable markets located in densely populated areas have been told to function in open places. “All cinemas, gyms, swimming pools, clubs and shopping malls will also remain closed during this particular relaxation span,” Suhas said.Besides, eateries cannot allow in-house dining. “Restaurants can only offer home delivery,” Suhas said. Suhas said that while it is mandatory for all frontline workers to be present in their offices, the remaining government offices will function with 50% attendance on a rotational basis. “It is mandatory for all offices to have their own Covid-19 helpdesks. Industrial units can also operate, following Covid-appropriate guidelines. Private sector firms, meanwhile, have been asked to encourage their employees to work from home. None of the offices can allow any employee who had Covid-19 symptoms to come to office. Setting up of a Covid helpdesk has been made mandatory for all of units,” he said.All private and government schools, colleges and other educational institutes will remain closed till further notice. “These institutions can continue with online classes for their students, including coaching centres,” Suhas said. Suhas also said that only five devotees will be allowed inside a place of worship at a time. “A maximum of 20 people will be allowed for funeral processions, while only 25 members will be allowed at wedding. However, in any case, the attendants will have to follow standard Covid-19 protocols of social distancing and sanitisation,” the DM said.“The traders have decided that they will not deal with customers who come without face masks. On our part, we will provide masks to such customers. If they still do not wear it, we will not entertain them. Since markets are opening after a long time, there will be a huge crowd but authorities must ensure strict enforcement. We do not want that active cases go up and we have to shut shops once again,” said Rajneesh Bansal, chairperson of Turab Nagar Vyapar Mandal, a traders’ association.The Ghaziabad industries’ federation said it has already set up Covid help desks and isolation rooms for workers. “The arrangements will continue as the virus has not gone away and we must observe all precautions. Further, we want that vaccination for workers in industrial units should also take place,” said Anil Gupta, general secretary of the federation.The overall tally GB Nagar was 62,734 by Sunday. With two more fatalities the death toll has reached 459. It is fifth in UP in most number of active cases. Only Meerut, Lucknow, Saharanpur and Gorakhpur have over 600 active cases now.Ghaziabad’s tally reached 55,248. The district saw three new fatalities, its toll now at 451. “We are conducting about 8,000 tests per day, and will continue this trend even during relaxation days. Our focus is now on testing and at present about 30% testing is done daily in rural areas,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad.“Since restrictions will be relaxed, utmost precaution and enforcement will be needed to keep active cases below 600.

The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has also been at 1.2 percent in Uttar Pradesh, while on the contrary, CFR of Maharashtra stands at 1.71 percent and Delhi’s CFR is 1.7 percent, he said.Deaths per million have been the highest in Delhi (313), followed by Maharashtra (127) as compared to Uttar Pradesh (26), he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-min-slams-oppn-for-criticising-yogi-s-covid-control-model-101623004651510.html

07-06-2021||Mumbai||Leaders got new homes, what about people, asks Sena||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Central Vista project, in his weekly column RokhThok in Saamana, saying “the PM calls himself a fakir, but the action to move into a 15-acre residence doesn’t fit one”. The Sena MP asked what people got amid the pandemic, even as leaders are getting homes. The party has been critical of the Central Vista project that envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the Prime Minister and the vice-president. “A new Parliament House, a new home on 15-acre plot for Prime Minister and a new residence for the vice-president are being built in Delhi in times of Covid-19. The Centre must clarify if these homes are corona-proof. Currently, our prime minister resides on 7, Lok Kalyan Marg, a residence spread across 13 acres. As per the new plan, he will reside in a 15-acre home. The Prime Minister considers himself a fakir, but all this does not fit into fakiri, such criticism has started now... Our leaders got new homes. What did the people get,” Raut asked in his column. He further said that crores of people have lost their jobs and are staring at poverty due to the pandemic. “Because of Covid-19, 97% of the people are on the threshold of poverty. In April 2020, 13 crore people lost their jobs. People have lost the jobs that were considered safe. Everything is shut; only crematorium and burial grounds are open 24 hours,” he added. Reacting to the column, Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said the project is not for Narendra Modi but for India as well as the Prime Minister of India. “It has become a habit of people who are against Modi to criticise him without gathering all facts. This has been going on since [alleged] Rafale [jet scam] to GST [rollout] and now the Central Vista project. The idea is to have a bigger Parliament, considering the future. He is not building a home for himself, it is the PM’s residence,” Upadhye said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/leaders-got-new-homes-what-about-people-asks-sena-101623004590930.html
07-06-2021||Mumbai||Maratha quota: BJP MP to start stir in Maharashtra from Jun 16||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Parliament (MP) Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, also a descendent of Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, will begin from June 16 an agitation in Kolhapur for reservation to the Maratha community in education and government jobs. He made the announcement at a function at Raigad Fort in Mahad, on the occasion of the coronation day anniversary of the Maratha king on Sunday. On May 5, the Supreme Court quashed the 12% and 13% reservation given in education and jobs to the Maratha community under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018. The state then appointed a committee of retired high court judge Dilip Bhosale to study the ruling and suggest a way forward. In its report submitted on Friday, the committee has recommended the government move a review petition in the SC challenging its verdict. The BJP MP had given an ultimatum till June 6 to the state to decide on the demands. The demands include review and curative petitions in the Supreme Court against its order to scrap the quota, as well as a petition to the Centre for the reservation. Besides, he had also demanded other benefits such as hostel facilities and scholarships for the community’s students and revival of Sarthi — a Pune based institute — to ensure educational and social well-being of the Maratha youth. Chhatrapati said the agitation will start from Shahu Samadhi Sthal, resting place of social reformer Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj, who is also a descendant of King Shivaji. He will also organise a long march from Pune to Mumbai, if the demands for reservation to the community and other ancillary benefits are not met. “I have decided not to stay silent until the Maratha community gets its reservation. The state government has done nothing since the ultimatum was issued. The agitation is now certain. Our first rally (morcha) will be organised at Shahu Samadhi Sthal, (resting place of Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj) in Kolhapur,” Chhatrapati said, in his address to the community from the fort, after paying homage to Shivaji Maharaj on the anniversary of his coronation as Chhatrapati in 1674. “I will then visit all 36 districts of the state, along with leaders from Sakal Maratha Samaj, an umbrella body of various Maratha organisations, and all public representatives right from ministers, MLAs and MPs will have to tell us how they are going to get justice for the community. If the state does not accept our five-six demands even after Covid-19 is over, the entire Maratha community will long march from Pune towards Mumbai. You still have time, do not force us to bring that situation,” he warned. The Rajya Sabha MP said he was not interested in the political blame game started by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government as well as his own party — BJP — after the Supreme Court struck down the quota in jobs and admissions to Marathas last month. “We are interested in the options and want to know the roadmap on how to restore the quota for the community in education and jobs,” he said. On Sunday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said the state government was making all possible efforts to grant reservation to the Maratha community without disturbing the existing quotas of other communities. “I would like to assure people, especially from the Maratha community, that the MVA government is making efforts to ensure they get reservation without disturbing the quotas of other communities,” Pawar told reporters in Pune on the sidelines of Shiv Swarajya Divas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-quota-bjp-mp-to-start-stir-in-maharashtra-from-jun-16-101623004590290.html

The other four districts, Solapur, Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli, have only one, or no private hospitals offering vaccinations. Since the vaccination drive for the age group 18-45 years began, the state government has stopped supplying vaccines to private hospitals and has instead empowered them to get vaccine stock directly from manufacturers. However, while major districts like Pune, Mumbai and Thane have seen almost all big hospitals begin the Covid-19 vaccination drive, smaller districts are still awaiting their quota. On Saturday, Pune district saw 30,000 vaccinations, of which, 22,000 got the jab at private hospitals. However, in the neighbouring district of Kolhapur, only one private hospital has been able to start the vaccination drive. Dr Farukh Desai, district immunisation officer at Kolhapur said, “Although we have been granted permission to start Covid-19 vaccinations at 70 private hospitals, only one private hospital, Aster Aadhar hospital, within the corporation area has started the drive. It has a capacity to vaccinate 250 people daily.”Similarly, in Satara too, only one private hospital has begun the drive. Uday Shelar, officer from the district immunisation department said, “Only one private hospital, Sahyadri hospital, has begun the vaccination drive in the entire district. Although we have permitted 48 hospitals to begin, due to no stock available hospitals have not started the drive.” While Kolhapur and Satara have at least one private hospital where the drive has begun, the districts of Solapur and Sangli do not have any private hospital offering vaccinations for the 18-45-year age group. District health officer Shital Jadhav said, “We have permitted 63 private vaccination centres, including two within the corporation areas. Of these, 47 are private hospitals while others are the workplace tie-ups between hospitals and industries. However, as there is no vaccine available to these hospitals, they have not been able to start the drive. Many have already placed orders, but are yet to get any stock.”In Sangli the situation is the same as none of the private hospitals have begun vaccinations. Dr Vivek Patil, district immunisation officer said, “We have granted permission to four hospitals and we have more hospitals in the queue, whose permissions are under process. However, as there is no vaccine available, they have not yet begun the drive. Of the four, two have MoU’s with major industries and two would probably open for the general public with slot booking.”BJP MLA Ram Satpute from Solapur alleged that there has been discrimination by the MVA government with regards to smaller districts. He said, “Only metropolitan cities like Pune, Mumbai and Thane are getting stock while in smaller districts and in rural areas the younger population is not getting any vaccines. This is the working population which needs to be vaccinated. At least in rural areas the government can provide free vaccination for the younger age group.”As of Saturday, the cumulative vaccination in these districts is much lower than that of Pune (31,05,186). In Kolhapur it is 12,05,469, in Solapur it is 5,89,174). In Sangli it is 7,48,794 and in Satara it is 7,82,662.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pvt-hosps-in-districts-other-than-pune-offer-no-vax-for-18-45-year-age-group-due-to-stock-shortage-101623004531949.html

07-06-2021||Mumbai||Kalyan gets shelter for transgenders||Urmila Kamble, 58, a transgender person from Ambernath, was in search of a shelter after her retirement as a sweeper at Ambernath Municipal Council (AMC). She used to live with her relatives and family members, but was not supported by them. The newly opened dedicated shelter home for members of the transgender community at Kalyan’s Dawrli Naka came as a relief to her. The shelter home named Garima Greh is the first one for transgender persons in Maharashtra, of the three sanctioned so far. The shelter has been set up by the National Institute of Social Defence (NISD).“My family members neglected me after the retirement. I used to stay with them but somehow I wanted to leave and be independent. I retired four years ago, and since then it was a struggle on a daily basis. The shelter home comes as a major blessing to me. Now I don’t have to worry about being asked to move out,” said Kamble, who now has a steady roof over her head. “We had been planning to open a shelter home for transgender persons since the last four-five years. A year ago, a proposal was made for the same to NISD, and now the shelter home is ready and we are running it,” said Neeta Kene, 43, president of NGO Kinnar Asmita. The shelter home presently has 25 residents who came from different cities like Nashik, Ambernath as well as states such as Uttar Pradesh. “There are several transgender who end up either begging or doing sex work. They do it due to the situations they face. We are trying to find out such people and bring them to the shelter,” added Kene. The shelter home will have learning activities for residents such as candle making, baking, beautician course, paper bag making. The products will then be promoted it in the market for sale. “This is just a start. More such shelter homes should come up in different cities so that not a single transgender is left out. They should get equal opportunity to learn and earn. We want more transgender persons to come and take shelter here,” said Tamanna Kene, 32, a resident of the shelter home. NGO Vanya Foundation has decided to provide computers to the shelter home and start a training programme for the residents. “The shelter home was their dream. Now that it is available, we have decided to make sure each resident from it and also create job opportunities for themselves,” said Rekha Thakur, secretary of the foundation. An official from NISD, who did not wish to be named, said, “A total of three shelter homes have been sanctioned, of which the one in Kalyan is inaugurated. Another one in Raigad is yet to be built as the finalisation of location is underway. It was delayed due to the lockdown. And the one in Goregaon is ready and is expected to be opened soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kalyan-gets-shelter-for-transgenders-101623004530797.html

Maharashtra, which added 618 deaths (including 385 as part of reconciliation of figures) to its tally on Sunday, contributes nearly 29% (28.87%) to the country’s Covid-19 fatality count .If Maharashtra were a country, it would have ranked 10th in the world, just after France (109,973 deaths) and before Colombia (91,422), in terms of Covid-19 deaths, according to data collated by worldometer. The United States of America (612,209) tops the list of fatalities, followed by Brazil (472,629). India ranks third (346,784).In India, the gap between the state with the most fatalities and the second-most affected state is 68,800 fatalities. Karnataka, as per the data of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, ranks second with 31,260 fatalities.The state breached the 10,000-mark in Covid-19 fatalities on July 11, 2020 (see box), and went on to cross an additional 10,000 every month till it crossed the 40,000-mark on October 10, 2020. As the first wave receded, the deaths were fewer between October and January.It took 91 days to go from 40,000 to 50,000 deaths, which happened on January 9, 2021. Subsequently, it took 99 days to cross the 60,000 mark. In the past 50 days alone, the state had added nearly 40,000 deaths. On April 18, the state breached the 60,000 mark in Covid deaths. Since then, it has added 39,657 fatalities. State bureaucrats, officials and experts attributed the high number of deaths to more Covid-19 cases and transparent reporting of data.Officials added that lack of treatment protocol, logistics issues have also contributed to some of the deaths in both the waves.Dr Avinash Supe, chairman of the state’s death audit committee, said that in the first 10 months (between March and December 2020) of the pandemic, Maharashtra saw nearly 50,000 deaths. In the next five months, the state added over 50,000 deaths due to Covid-19. Between March 8, 2020, when the first case was reported, and December 31, 2020, the state saw 49,521 deaths. Since January 1, the state has added 50,609 deaths.“If you see the pattern of the deaths, it was really high, percentage-wise, in April, May, June [2020], as we were not very prepared. Patients were dying on arrival. In the second wave, we have seen double the patients we saw in the first wave,” he said.“In 2020, we had 19 lakh cases, now (this year) we have nearly 40 lakh cases. Nearly 50,000 deaths happened in the first year. Among the 40 lakh cases, we had an equal number of deaths. So, it is important to see that even after cases doubled, the fatalities remained the same. However, the deaths in this year have come in a shorter time,” Dr Supe added.A senior bureaucrat, who did not wish to be named, added, “Initially, many patients died of comorbidities in the hospital on arrival or in 24-48 hours. When they were tested, they were found to be positive [for coronavirus]. We have included such cases in our tally as well. We have remained transparent in reporting deaths and cases.” N Ramaswami, commissioner of health services (Maharashtra), said one cannot look at the absolute numbers. “Definitely we have a high number of deaths, but one can’t see the absolute numbers. We have higher deaths because we have more cases. However, our CFR is very much under control,” he said.Despite having a set treatment protocol, acceptability among people about the disease, and medical infrastructure, the state saw over 50,000 deaths in 2021. Health experts attributed it to virus mutation, late arrival at the hospital and logistical issues. “Mainly patients have died after being admitted to ICUs. Of course, logistics issues, including people not getting beds [at the hospital], delay in medicines and oxygen, could have contributed to the deaths. However, the overall mortality rate has gone down. This year, the CFR is 1.2%, which was 2.3% in 2020,” Dr Supe said.The second Covid-19 wave hit the rural and semi-urban districts in Maharashtra the hardest with a sharp increase in the number of deaths as compared to the first wave. Sindhudurg, Nandurbar, Beed, Parbhani, Nanded, Amravati, Yavatmal, Chandrapur, Washim and Gadchiroli saw the number of deaths double from the first to the second wave. In contrast, in Mumbai, Pune, Thane, the number of deaths has reduced by half despite a massive surge in infections in the second wave.The senior bureaucrat further added that the state administration has worked to supplement the primary and secondary infrastructure in the tier two cities and rural areas. “While most of our cities and other major towns are prepared for the possible third wave. These areas have been looked into to strengthen its medical infrastructure, training people, etc,” he said.Meanwhile, as Maharashtra is moving towards gradual unlocking from Monday depending on set parameters, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a virtual meeting with district collectors and municipal commissioners and directed them not to relax any restriction by buckling under pressure from anybody. Thackeray during the meeting reiterated that the state is not fully lifting its lockdown-like restrictions and the parameters set for allowing activities must be followed by the administration.Thackeray directed the administration that there should not be any crowding in places where restrictions would be relaxed as it would be an invitation to the third wave. Thackeray, while cautioning them, said that the district and city administration should consider and review all the factors before allowing relaxations. Thackeray pointed out that last year had witnessed an increase in cases after the festive season. “Secondly, mutation of viruses led to spreading of more infection. Hence, we should take more care this time, else the third wave of Covid would be challenging for us,” said Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-breaches-grim-mark-of-100-000-covid-19-deaths-101623004472636.html

07-06-2021||Chandigarh||Akal Takht head priest justifies pro-Khalistan slogans at Op Bluestar anniversary||The 37th anniversary of Operation Bluestar at the Golden Temple passed off peacefully on Sunday even as Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh justified pro-Khalistan slogans raised on the occasion by a section of Sikh hardliners, saying that the Sikhs mitigate their pain by uttering the secessionist slogan.“This is a deep wound on Sikhs, which gives pain throughout the year. On its anniversary, we reduce this pain by uttering ‘Khalistan Zindabad’. It can never be forgotten. It will be part of our memory forever,” said the acting jathedar, amid echoes of slogans during his customary address from the highest temporal seat of Sikhs on the anniversary of the military action at Golden Temple in Amritsar.Even during his address last year, the jathedar had stated that every Sikh wanted Khalistan and if the government offers them the formation of a separate nation, “they will accept it happily”.“The Indian Army attacked Akal Takht just like it battled against China and Pakistan during wars. However, the treatment given to Sikhs was more oppressive and brutal than one given by the winning side to the losing side in a battle,” said Giani Harpreet Singh on Sunday.The acting jathedar claimed that he had received a lot of emails seeking June 6 be declared as “Amritsar Genocide”. “However, we should remember that the Indian Army not only attacked the Sikh shrine in Amritsar, but also 37 other gurdwaras,” he said, while adding that the term genocide should rather be used for the killing of Sikhs in Delhi and other cities after Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s assassination in November 1984. “The community has already recognised the Operation Bluestar as another ‘ghallughara’ (holocaust),” he said, adding: “We know how this deep wound is to be treated, and where its medicine lies, but how this medicine is to be arranged, we never tried to think over it by sitting together.”This ‘josh’ keeps community alive: SGPC chiefReplying to a query on the sidelines of the function, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Bibi Jagir Kaur endorsed the jathedar’s views on pro-Khalistan slogans. “This is an expression of the Sikh youth’s ‘josh’ (vehemence). As Singh Sahib (jathedar) stated the youngsters demonstrated their sentiments and healed their pain on the occasion,” she said. “This ‘josh’ suggests that the Sikh community is alive and acts independently. A community losing ‘josh’ is considered dead. When the youths raise these slogans, they demonstrate that they are competent to fight the enemy. So, we have no objection to it,” said the head of the apex Sikh body.The same leniency was also shown by the SGPC while imposing no restrictions on the Sikh hardline and splinter Akali groups, such as Simranjit Singh Mann-led SAD (Amritsar), and allowing them to carry on with their activities on the anniversary, including displaying of placards with separatist demands and portraits of militants killed during the operation.Event passes off peacefully amid huge gatheringDespite Covid-19 weekend lockdown imposed in the city, the gathering was much bigger than that seen in recent years. However, no untoward incident was reported. “The anniversary passed off peacefully as we had made unprecedented arrangements across the city,” said Parminder Singh Bhandal, deputy commissioner of police (law and order). Sarbat Khalsa-appointed parallel acting jathedar Dhian Singh Mand also read out his message outside the Akal Takht. In a goodwill gesture, Giani Harpreet Singh presented “siropas” (robe of honour) to Dal Khalsa leaders inside the Akal Takht, though they accepted it reluctantly. Names of the rival Sikh leaders were also mentioned in the press note released by the SGPC.While kin of militant leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and Amrik Singh were honoured, names of other prominent militants were left out. The Sikh hardliners termed it a “fiasco” on the part of the SGPC. Actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu, the prime accused in the Red Fort violence case who is out on bail, also made his presence felt along with his supporters. A book authored by Malkit Singh Bhawanigarh on the army action at 37 other gurdwaras in Punjab was released. A function was also organised at Damdami Taksal’s headquarter Gurdwara Gurdarshan Parkash at Chowk Mehta in Amritsar.SGPC to reprint white paper on Op BluestarSGPC chief Bibi Jagir Kaur said the apex Sikh body will reprint the white paper on Operation Bluestar, which has been out of print for decades, to tell the people “truth” behind the army action at Golden Temple in 1984. Speaking about the Sikh soldiers who left the barracks in protest against the operation, she said the SGPC has provided aid to these “Dharmi Faujis”. In case, any soldier was left out, they should contact us, she said. “The SGPC will also provide free education to children who have lost their parents due to Covid-19 pandemic and children of farmers who died during the ongoing protests against the central laws,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akal-takht-head-priest-justifies-pro-khalistan-slogans-at-op-bluestar-anniversary-101623004471365.html

Between March 2020 and May 2021, gyms and salons have been closed for a total of nine months.The new “break the chain” order states that gym, salons, beauty parlours, spas and wellness centres can operate till 4pm at 50% capacity and only on an appointment basis, with no air-conditioner operating.“It’s a welcome move and we will restart operations from Monday. However, many trainers will re-join in two-three days. Getting clients is also a task. The few who are fitness freak have already confirmed their time slots,” said Ayesha Nagargoje, RC Fitness club, Wagholi.The fitness and wellness industries have pegged their total losses in the nine months of closure at Rs500 crore.“Government should give us concessions on taxes, and electricity bills. Big gym owners manage to survive, but the smaller ones are in bad shape and have already started other part-time jobs for survival,” said Nilesh Kale, president of Pune the Fitness Club Association.Hairstylist Hiral Shah said, “The decision is welcome, but now many have got used to home service and they feel more secure instead of coming to salons.

The incident took place in Tikri village under Mandhata police station of Pratapgarh district on Saturday night where the groom and all the guests from the groom’s side were held hostage by bride’s kin. They were released after the groom’s side paid ₹5 lakh as compensation for the expenses incurred on marriage function. According to the locals, problem started soon after the ‘baraat’ (marriage procession), arrived at one Samar Bahadur Verma’s house, where the ‘baratis’ (guests from groom’s side) clashed with kin of bride including bride’s brother twice before the ‘jaimal’ (garland ceremony). Elders had intervened to sort out things then but around 11.30 pm the groom caught the hand of the bride and forced her to dance, a gesture that the bride disapproved of and refused to marry claiming that the groom was in an inebriated state. Subsequently, bride’s kin held the groom and ‘baratis’ (guests) hostage. The guests were released later but the groom and family were allowed to leave after they paid ₹5 lakh to compensate for the expenses by the brides’ family. Police also reached the spot and attempted to pacify the angry bride who however stuck to her decision to not marry a youth who arrived for the wedding in an inebriated state. SHO Mandhata Shravan Kumar Singh said no police complaint was registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/forced-to-dance-by-drunk-groom-woman-calls-off-marriage-in-pratapgarh-101623004350278.html
07-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab power regulator pulls up PSPCL||The state power regulator has pulled up Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) for failing to control transmission and distribution losses, in line with the trajectory suggested in the tariff orders in previous years.The Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) in its tariff order, dated May 28, for the 2021-22 financial year said: “PSPCL has failed to bring down losses to the desired level despite huge capital investments allowed by the commission. PSPCL is again directed to identify high-loss feeders and areas and take corrective measures to achieve distribution loss trajectory.”For example, against the target of 11.54% transmission and distribution (T&D) losses in 2019-20, PSPCL recorded 14.35% losses (see box). In the current fiscal, the commission has asked it to bring down the loses to 10%.‘12 subdivisions can cut overall losses by 2%’ In the tariff order, PSERC noted that though the number of feeders with more than 15% T&D losses has come down from 2,697 (in 2019- 20) to 1,526 (in 2020-21, up to December 2020), the number of high-loss feeders (with losses more than 50%) have gone up from 180 to 230 and those with losses more than 90% have increased from four to nine.Referring to 12 power subdivisions, which recorded maximum T&D losses in the state, PSERC said if the losses here are brought down to 15%, an overall reduction of 2% will be achieved. These subdivisions are: Amritsar West (50.49%), Amritsar South (38.18%), Ajnala (49.42%), Tarn Taran City (41.26%), Patti, Bhikhiwind (76.66%), Patran (45.65%), Lehragaga (44.64%), Zira (51.15%), Bhagtabhaika (48.36%), Baghapurana (45.86%) and Malout (35%). ‘Act against officials for failure to curb theft’“It is a matter of great concern that rampant theft is being allowed in these areas, which is not possible without the connivance of PSPCL officials and officers. Disciplinary action should be taken against delinquent officers and officials for failure to control power theft under intimation to the commission,” said the order.PSPCL clarified that to curb thefts, surprise raids are conducted despite the fact that employees are gheraoed and manhandled. As many as 1,13,470 connections have been checked and 8,823 theft cases have been detected in these divisions, and revenue losses worth ₹19.02 crore have been detected till December 2020. ‘Expedite shifting of meters outside premises’ According to the tariff order, there were 5.47 lakh meters waiting to be shifted outside consumers’ premises by December 2019, and the number stood at 4.51 lakh in December 2020, pointing to the fact that only 96,000 meters were shifted in one year. “PSPCL is directed to complete shifting of meters outside consumer premises to cut losses,” said the regulator. The commission also observed that not much progress has been made by PSPCL to achieve 100% metering and directed it to resubmit a plan. The project for shifting meters has been on for at least 15 years. PSPCL said that 1.04 lakh meters in the high-loss divisions are yet to be shifted outside the premises, mainly in view of stiff resistance faced from farmer unions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-power-regulator-pulls-up-pspcl-101623004231778.html

Around 16 buses that were converted into temporary Covid care centres with oxygen beds have now been kept at the depot and will be used if needed during the upcoming wave, according to the officials.Rajeev Nagpal, general manager, Haryana Roadways Engineering Corporation (HREC), said, “As we know, that a third wave might hit us in the near future, we are not dismantling the temporary Covid care centres set up inside the 16 buses. These buses were equipped with six beds each, oxygen supply, AC and other medical facilities for Covid-19 patients. If required, we will set up more such buses.”The HREC had converted old buses into temporary Covid care facilities to be used at government hospitals, and five minibuses were converted into ambulances, during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19. Last week, the district administration decided that temporary Covid-19 hospitals with oxygen supply in Gurugram will also be used treating non-Covid patients.On May 17, 2021, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar inaugurated a 300-bed facility in the city to aid in the fight the coronavirus at the Tau Devi Lal stadium. Officials said that the government facility in the stadium was launched with an aim to treat patients in rural areas that were witnessing a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases.Meanwhile, the Gurugram administration is working on increasing the number of beds and healthcare professionals at these centres, to cater to the demands of non-Covid patients, too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ggm-won-t-dismantle-temporary-health-infra-101623001050727.html
07-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi: New Covid-19 cases drop below 400 for first time since mid-March||In a positive sign for Delhi a day before several lockdown restrictions are lifted, the daily Covid-19 case count in the Capital on Sunday dropped below 400 for the first time since mid-March as Delhi continued to recover after a devastating surge of infection between April and May.The city added 381 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday after conducting 76,857 tests, which means that just 0.5% of all people tested had contracted the infection. This number — known as the test positivity rate — is crucial to understand the degree of infection spread in a region.Daily deaths of the viral infection also fell to their lowest in nearly two months. On Sunday, 34 more people died of the infection, the lowest daily toll since April 8, when 24 people succumbed to the infection. Over the past week, on average, 63 people died in Delhi died of Covid-19 a day. Just a week ago, this number was more than double. In the week ending May 30, data from the state health bulletin showed that an average of 136 people died of the infection in the city.The Capital has added an average of 522 infections each day over the past week, less than half of the 1,246 average cases it added seven days ago. At the height of the fourth wave, the seven-day average peaked at 25,294 cases on April 23.Tracking a region’s positivity rate can serve as a good indicator for whether infections are likely to increase or decrease in the coming days.Delhi’s test positivity rate has dropped nearly every day since early-May, though the fall built momentum in the second week of that month. Sunday’s test positivity rate is the lowest in 90 days, going back to early March, in clear signs that the fourth wave of infections is now well and truly ever, which experts attested to.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-new-cases-drop-below-400-for-first-time-since-midmarch-101623000930106.html
07-06-2021||Delhi||75-year-old woman strangled to death in Delhi’s Hari Nagar during robbery bid||A 75-year-old woman was assaulted and strangled to death allegedly by three men, including her husband’s caretaker who was employed two days before the incident, during a robbery at her home in west Delhi’s Hari Nagar last week. The police on Sunday said they arrested all three suspects and recovered the stolen items — a pair of earrings and ₹2,000 cash.The elderly woman’s husband, who is a cancer patient and has been diagnosed with mental health illnesses, was in the flat when the murder and robbery took place. However, due to the severity of his mental illness, the man is aware of neither the robbery nor his wife’s murder, said deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel.The incident came to light when on the afternoon of June 1, the couple’s neighbour went to check on them and found the woman unconscious and the caretaker, identified as Monu, missing. Upon being informed, the police took the woman, Savitri Sharma, to a hospital, even as Monu returned to the house. The woman died during treatment and doctors informed the police about strangulation marks around her neck.“Monu was questioned, but kept changing his statements, which made us suspect his involvement in the incident. Investigations revealed that two other people were in the house when the incident took place,” said Goel. Monu later confessed that they killed her during the robbery, she said.Monu’s interrogation led to the arrests of the other two suspects — Vishal and Naveen Kumar — who told the police that Monu began working at the couple’s house on May 30 to take care of the man, identified as Jaipal Sharma. He was hired through a placement agency.The police said that on May 31, Monu called Vishal and told him his employers had received a large payment. They chalked out a robbery plan and included Naveen in it. On the same night, Monu and Vishal went to the flat, assaulted Savitri and asked her about the cash and other valuables. Naveen kept watch outside.“When she resisted, the duo strangled her to death. They stole ₹2,000 and a pair of earrings and fled. Apart from the stolen items, we have also recovered a motorcycle they used in the crime,” Goel added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/75yearold-woman-strangled-to-death-in-delhi-s-hari-nagar-during-robbery-bid-three-arrested-101623000870160.html
07-06-2021||Delhi||Aid dries up, baba back at his dhaba||On a hot May afternoon, Kanta Prasad and his wife Badaami Devi make for a picture of despair as they wait for customers at Baba ka Dhaba, a nondescript roadside eatery in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar. The sight is a far cry from just a few months ago when a social media campaign, which saw help pouring in from across the country, seemed poised to end their troubles.Prasad and his dhaba had become famous overnight last year after a city YouTuber shared a video showing the octogenarian Prasad in tears, telling him how he struggled to make ends meet as business dried up. The viral video led to thousands of people making a beeline to the couple’s eatery for food, selfies and donating money.Soon, he opened a new restaurant, added a new floor to his house, settled his old debts and bought smartphones for himself and his children. However, life has since come a full circle, as the new restaurant closed in February and Prasad and his wife are now back at their old dabha where the sales, which saw a 10-fold jump after the initial YouTube video in October, have slumped drastically over the past few months.Also Watch | Viral video prompts people to help elderly couple running roadside eateryPrasad said the fourth Covid-19 wave in Delhi, which forced the closure of their old dhaba for 17 days and further affected the sales, have led them to penury -- again. “The daily footfalls at our dhaba have declined because of the ongoing Covid lockdown, and our daily sales have come down from ₹3,500 before the lockdown to ₹1,000 now. The income is not sufficient for our family of eight,” said a dejected Prasad, as he waited for customers.There are some signs from his glory days. The old dhaba, that looked like a portacabin, now has three CCTV cameras and the live footage can be accessed on Prasad’s smartphone. And a fancy board atop displays the dhaba’s name, the year it was established, photographs of the elderly couple, two mobile numbers, and proclaims Indian and Chinese menu for lunch and dinner. However, the dhaba currently serves only Indian food such as rice, pulses, and two types of vegetables – the same menu that the couple had at their dhaba before the viral video earned them fame – for lunch and it closes before dinner.Prasad had opened his new restaurant with much fanfare on a cold December morning and for the first few days, it was a roaring success. Unlike at the dhaba where Prasad rolled out rotis for his customers, he and his wife and their two sons sat behind a new gleaming counter, collecting payments as his employees — two cooks and waiters — flitted about serving customers. For a while, it seemed the octogenarian’s pains were a thing of the past.After the initial frenzy, customers, however, started disappearing slowly and soon, the expenses were more than the income.Prasad said he invested ₹5 lakh in the restaurant and hired three workers. The monthly expenditure was around ₹1 lakh -- ₹35,000 towards rent; ₹36,000 to pay salaries of three employees; and ₹15,000 for electricity and water bills, and to procure food ingredients. “But the average monthly sales never crossed ₹40,000. I had to bear all the losses. In hindsight, I feel we were wrongly advised to open a new restaurant,” he said.The new enterprise collapsed in three months. “Of the total investment of ₹5 lakh, we managed to recover only ₹36,000 from the sale of chairs, utensils, and cooking machines, after the restaurant shut down,” said Prasad, blaming Tushant Adlakha, a social worker who, he said, had encouraged and helped him to open the new restaurant at a rented place.“Essentially it was he (Adlakha) and his team who managed and supervised everything, including the investment and sales. He said he would make it a success, but he never gave enough time for the restaurant,” said Prasad.But Adlakha denied the allegations and blames Prasad and his two sons for the new restaurant’s failure. “From setting up the restaurant to bringing customers and orders for home delivery of food, we did everything. What else could we do? Prasad’s two sons took charge of the restaurant, but they hardly ever stayed at the counter. There were enough orders for home delivery, but the two failed to deliver them,” he said.In November, Prasad had filed a cheating case against YouTuber Gaurav Wasan, who had shot the viral video of the octogenarian’s plight. Prasad alleged that Wasan had collected large sums of money from good Samaritans, but handed him only a small part of it.Wasan denied the allegations and claimed that he gave to Prasad all the donations -- ₹4.20 lakh -- he had received. Prasad’s allegations against the YouTuber polarised opinion on social media, with many saying that he was unfairly targeting his benefactor.Wasan said he held no grudge but was hurt by Prasad’s allegation questioning his selfless motive. “I was heartbroken and was mentally stressed for a couple of months, as the allegations had affected my reputation. Baba has since called me a few times on my mobile phone but I never responded. I have moved on,” said Wasan.Prasad and his wife, on the other hand, claimed that they still do not know how much money was collected from the people by Wasan. A senior police officer, who did not want to be named, said, “The investigation into the case is still on.”Prasad’s wife Badaami Devi said they are back to square one. “All our money is gone. Our children are unemployed and we are old and cannot run the dabha anymore. We hope the government will help us in some way,” she said, as Prasad nodded in agreement.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) senior leader Somnath Bharti, who is also the MLA from Malviya Nagar, attributed Prasad’s failure to multiple reasons, including his inexperience in handling fame and success, and managing the financial assistance and resources he got through various channels.“I personally believe that there should be a proper system in place when it comes to helping people like Prasad. Expecting an old man like him to start a new business is always risky as there will be people who would try to get benefits out of their situation and circumstances. That’s why I feel that help should come through a proper channel and the objective is to help such people grow. I had also offered to help Prasad and I am still available -- both in my personal capacity and through the Delhi government,” said Bharti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/youtube-star-customers-help-dry-up-baba-returns-to-his-old-dhaba-101623000812135.html
07-06-2021||Delhi||If malls can open, why not us?: Delhi’s weekly markets||With Delhi bracing for a wider unlock starting from Monday, associations of weekly markets in the capital, which were not exempted from curbs in the latest Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) orders, have pressed the government for permission to operate.Market associations said the government was ignoring small vendors who were more severely affected even as bigger markets are allowed to reopen. Market associations have also lodged a petition seeking compensation from the government.As per the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) order outlining curfew relaxations, shops in markets and malls can reopen on an odd-even basis from Monday while weekly markets will continue to remain closed.Ramesh Kumar, head of the South Delhi Weekly Market Association, said the new restrictions will adversely impact the already dwindling incomes of small traders, many of whom are now unemployed. Kumar pointed out that most vendors of weekly markets lived a hand-to-mouth existence and were yet to receive any financial support. “Nearly 2,700 weekly markets operate in the city routinely. So many families are dependent on these markets for their survival. The government should have opened our markets as well with staggered timings,” said Kumar.Pointing out the number of fresh cases have dropped below 500, Kumar said, “Delhi was completely open when it was recording thousands of cases last year. The caseload has reduced but weekly markets continue to remain closed.”Kumar claimed said the government was depriving weekly markets run by small traders of a chance to get back on their feet. “We follow all SOPs. Our shops are also organised in open areas. It doesn’t make any sense to open malls while weekly markets are ignored,” said Kumar.Weekly market associations have also lodged a petition in the Delhi high court seeking financial support from the government in view of the losses incurred over the last year. The court has given Delhi government 10 days to respond to the petition.“Before all our weekly markets could bounce back from the loss incurred last year, the lockdown was imposed again. In the past 15 months, our situation has gone from bad to worse. We urge the government to open the markets for us since so many families are going through a crisis,” said Kumar.Sunil Kumar Shah, head of Delhi Pradesh Weekly Market Association, said nearly 95% weekly market vendors led a hand-to-mouth existence.Delhi government spokesperson did not comment on matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/if-malls-can-open-why-not-us-delhi-s-weekly-markets-want-exemption-from-lockdown-curbs-101623000810777.html
07-06-2021||Delhi||Unlocking Capital: Delhi Police help shops implement new guidelines||From assisting shopkeepers and volunteers in marking shops on an odd-even basis and chalking out circles for social distancing, from holding meetings with representatives of the market and resident welfare associations (RWA) to educating people about the new rules, the Delhi Police personnel were spotted on the streets throughout Sunday as part of their preparedness to implement the new guidelines of unlocking Delhi and the night curfew that will continue till June 14.The city police have decided to use non-coercive methods while implementing the new guidelines issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Saturday. As per the new guidelines, restrictions on stand-alone shops, markets and shopping malls have been eased and private and government offices have been permitted to open with half their strength. Police officers said that their primary focus will be on ensuring normalcy and ensuring the public adheres to Covid appropriate behaviour, such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, sanitizing and washing hands.“We (police staff) spent our day (Sunday) distributing free masks among people not wearing one, greeting violators with flowers as a token to remind them about Covid-19 guidelines, and holding meetings with market associations and RWAs. Some individuals and shopkeepers also took a pledge to observe Covid appropriate behaviour,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parminder Singh.As there is no clarity on whether people visiting shops or markets need e-passes like shopkeepers and their employees, many police officers said those giving valid reasons will not be prosecuted while action may be taken against those found unnecessarily stepping out of their homes.In a meeting with senior police officers, Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava directed them to devise non-coercive methods and involve traders associations for ensuring Covid appropriate behaviour through their volunteers. Accordingly, meetings between the police and traders associations were held on Saturday and Sunday where the shopkeepers were told to open their units on “odd and even formula”, place sanitiser dispensers and chalk out markings for social distancing outside their shops.DCP (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said all station house officers (SHOs) and beat police staff have been briefed about the new guidelines and the steps that they should be taking while implementing the rules on the ground.“We are marking the shops with numbers 1 and 2, meaning the number 2 shop will remain closed on the day number 1 is open. The shops will remain open only between 10am and 8pm and those in shopping malls and market complexes will be allowed to operate with 50% strength. No encroachment or subletting of shops in the premises of the authorised shops will be allowed. Bamboo barricading and fencing has been done in vegetable markets for social distancing,” he said.Officers said they are also encouraging shopkeepers to get themselves and their employees vaccinated and always remain properly masked up while dealing with customers. Regular announcements through patrol vans and motorcycles are also being done to educate people about the new norms, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unlocking-capital-delhi-police-help-shops-implement-new-guidelines-101623000810126.html
07-06-2021||Delhi||Longer wait for residents as Delhi’s slum rehabilitation hits policy roadblock||For Abdul Hameed, 42, a daily wager, the possibility of owning a house in the national capital became a reality when he deposited Rs1.42 lakh with the Delhi government’s Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) in 2019, for allotment of a house under the rehabilitation policy.Today, while the bank has started deducting instalments against the loan he took, his dream is still far from turning into a reality. “For the past three months, a monthly instalment of ₹2,1,65 is deducted from my account. But there is no clarity on when we will get the possession of the flat,” said Hameed, who is struggling to feed his family of six due to the coronavirus pandemic.“Due to the lockdown, I didn’t have any work. I don’t know how I’ll pay the installments,” said Hameed.Hameed’s family is among 69 that were rendered homeless after the slum cluster they lived in near RML hospital in central Delhi was demolished in 2009. The families moved court and, on court’s intervention, were relocated temporarily to Delhi government’s Punjabi Academy building in Paharganj. After a decade-long battle, the Delhi high court ordered in April 2019 that the displaced families be rehabilitated.“What was meant to be a temporary shelter, for around six months, has been our home for over a decade,” said Kafeel Ahmed, 48, who works in a private firm.Advocate Jayashree Satpate, who represented families evicted from near RML hospital in the high court, said, “It’s been over a decade now and they are yet to get rehabilitated. They are living in a precarious conditions, facing problems related to safety, water, electricity and other socio-economic rights.”Like these 69 families, there are 287 families living along the Barapullah drain near East Kidwai Nagar who had made the payments two years back, but are awaiting relocation. DUSIB had planned to relocate these families to its housing complex in Dwarka’s sector 16-B.The roadblockWhile the pandemic delayed the rehabilitation process last year, DUSIB officials said it has now hit a roadblock due to the Centre’s new scheme to provide houses on rent.DUSIB officials said that the plan to rehabilitate these two clusters was stalled due to the Centre’s Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHC) scheme, which was approved by the Cabinet in July last year. Under the ARHC scheme, houses constructed under the UPA-era schemes such as Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) and Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) are to be provided to migrant workers on rent.As per the information available on housing and urban affairs (HUA) ministry’s website, of the 88,099 flats constructed under JNNURM and RAY, 29,245 are in Delhi.DUSIB member Bipin Rai said, “We had to put the rehabilitation process on hold due to the Centre’s rental housing scheme. As the flats where these people were to be rehabilitated were constructed under JNNURM, in which part payment was done by the Centre, we were told to give these flats under the new rental scheme. But we are against the rental scheme as it will not work in Delhi. We had written to the Centre in this regard earlier, but they refused to allow allotment of these flats under our rehabilitation policy.”In a letter dated March 22, 2021, DUSIB has given a list of slum clusters from where relocation charges from land-owning agencies and slum dwellers have been collected as per the rehabilitation policy. There are around 13 clusters where a large number of eligible beneficiaries have made the payments.Rai said, “We have written to the Centre to allow us to allot flats to those who have already deposited the money under the rehabilitation policy. So far there is no response on it.”When contacted, a senior HUA ministry official confirmed that they have received the communication from DUSIB. “We are in touch with DUSIB officials and the matter is under consideration,” said the official.Pandemic make matters worseCurtains divide the two halls on the ground floor of the building into small spaces for each family at the Punjabi Academy centre. Sudesh, 45, who worked as a private security guard till last year, said, “We don’t have enough space and proper facilities here. The situation was really bad during the lockdown, as everybody was staying inside all day long.”Mathura Prasad, 52, a mason, who lives along the Barapullah drain near East Kidwai Nagar, said there has been no work for months now. “I had no option but to stay at home, as construction activity was closed during the lockdown. Even now, it is difficult to find work. We are using our savings to feed the family,” said Prasad.There are many who lost their livelihood during the pandemic and were hoping for a fresh start near their new homes. Raj Kumar, 50, who had a small shop which he had to shut last year, said he is jobless for the past one year. “I was hoping to start something near our new house in Dwarka, as we were told that we will be shifted soon. But then the pandemic happened and now there is no clarity on when the process will start.”Social worker Shakeel Abdul, convenor of Basti Suraksha Manch, said, “These people have waited for so long and completed all the formalities, including payments. Most of these people have taken loans from banks or relatives. During the lockdown due to the pandemic, so many of them were rendered jobless or are struggling to make ends meet. The government should start the rehabilitation process at the earliest.”The families at these two clusters, social activists say, are in such dire need for a proper accommodation that they have agreed to go to the outskirts of the city. Tripti Poddar, another advocate who represented families evicted from near RML hospital said, “Their conditions have been so dire for the past decade that many of them are willing to shift to Baprola despite having worked and lived in the heart of the city. The families themselves have approached all possible avenues of advocacy but despite that, multiple court orders, and complying with all prerequisites, including payment, they are still being made to wait, even through this deadly pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/longer-wait-for-residents-as-delhi-s-slum-rehabilitation-hits-policy-roadblock-101623000752962.html
07-06-2021||Delhi||BJP wants India’s ration beneficiaries to suffer, says Sisodia||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of favouring large-scale theft of food grains meant to be distributed under the public distribution system (PDS) across states, turning the political heat on the Centre for “blocking” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme.Hours after a press conference by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra on the issue — which came soon after a press briefing by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal — Sisodia took on the BJP for attacking the AAP government on the scheme, which has become yet another point of contention between the Delhi government and the Centre.In his briefing on Sunday morning, Kejriwal urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow the state government to launch the doorstep ration delivery scheme, a day after Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal rejected the scheme. Baijal’s office has, however, disputed this claim and said the L-G did not “reject” the scheme, but only “advised for the constitutional scheme of things to be followed in letter and spirit”.Sisodia refuted Patra’s allegations that Kejriwal was “misleading people” on the matter.“Patra made two large points on doorstep delivery of ration. He said the current system is efficient enough. So, he means the BJP is fine with theft and pilferage in the PDS system. So, the BJP will resist any proposed change. They want 80 crore ration beneficiaries across the country to suffer because of large-scale theft of ration,” Sisodia said in a video briefing.“Then he (Patra) alleged that we (the AAP) are trying to make money out of the scheme by levying additional charges on ration beneficiaries. He does not know that the central government orders allow states to charge ₹3 per kg for processing wheat under PDS schemes. In Haryana, the BJP government charges ₹3 for providing flour to PDS beneficiaries. In Delhi, we proposed a charge of ₹2 for processing wheat as well as ensuring doorstep delivery. Patra hardly said anything about such things and chose to invest his time on misleading people and ranting against Arvind Kejriwal,” Sisodia said.This is the second time this year that the long-pending scheme has been stalled due to differences between the Delhi government and the Centre. The scheme was to be launched on March 25, but the Union food and consumers affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 raising two objections to the scheme — the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and that any change in the delivery mechanism in the NFSA requires an amendment that can be done only by Parliament.Patra said no state government has the right to tweak central government schemes.“If Arvind Kejriwal wants to distribute ration outside the national programmes under the central government, he can purchase grains at notified rates and do it. But no state has the right to tweak a central scheme being implemented uniformly across the country.”Referring to Kejriwal’s statement that ration shops may turn “super-spreaders”, Patra said, “Arvind Kejriwal does not see potential super-spreaders when it comes to supporting large gathering of farmers in Delhi’s borders and misleading them against the central government, but he sees potential super-spreaders in ration shops.”He also said that by not implementing the “one nation, one ration card” scheme, the Delhi government has deprived millions of migrant workers of subsidised food grains.Patra further claimed that the Aadhaar authentication record fared poorly in Delhi when compared to the national average of 80% and that the Kejriwal government also stopped the operation of electronic point-of-sales (e-PoS) machines that allow biometric verification. “We will never know whom Arvind Kejriwal is giving ration to. He wanted to launch a ration diverting system. He wanted to start a big scam as the ration would not reach the right person and nobody knows where it might have gone. The Centre has prevented a big scam from taking place,” said Patra.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and other senior leaders of the party on Sunday criticised the Delhi chief minister for accusing the Centre for stalling the doorstep delivery of ration.“The Centre has said that the ration given under the central government schemes, which is applicable in the entire country, can’t be used for doorstep delivery. The CM should tell people why the ration given by the Centre under PMGKAY has not been distributed completely,” said GuptaOn Saturday, Delhi food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain labelled efforts to stall the scheme “politically motivated”.“The L-G has rejected the scheme on two grounds – that it is not approved by the central government, and that there’s an ongoing court case on the scheme. No approval to launch such a scheme is required as per existing law. Nevertheless, we have written six letters to the Centre since 2018 apprising them of this scheme at every stage. We also changed the name of the scheme according to their letter dated May 19. What further approval is required? It makes even less sense to stop the roll out of this revolutionary scheme due to an ongoing court case. There have already been two hearings on this case and no stay has been ordered by the Court. Moreover, Central government is a party to the same case and in their affidavit too, they haven’t objected to rollout of the scheme,” the Delhi minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-wants-india-s-ration-beneficiaries-to-suffer-says-sisodia-as-war-of-words-over-ration-delivery-escalates-101623000752308.html
07-06-2021||Delhi||Amid shortage, all jab centres in Delhi told to give only 2nd dose of Covaxin||The Delhi government on Sunday issued an order making it mandatory for all vaccine centres -- both government facilities and private sector -- offering Covaxin to beneficiaries in the 18-45 years age group to only administer second doses of the vaccine till the end of June. HT has seen a copy of the order.“Directions have been issued to all government Covid-19 vaccination centres to administer Covaxin only to those people who are eligible for receiving the second dose of vaccination in respect of the age group of 18-44 years during the month of June 2021, or until further orders,” said the government order.It further said, “The Delhi High Court in an order dated June 4, 2021... has instructed the Government of NCT of Delhi to consider issuing an order by exercising its power under Disaster Management Act, 2005, for mandating the private hospitals and nursing homes which are vaccinating using Covaxin, to strictly reserve vaccination for the purpose of second dose in respect of people of age group 18-44 years in the month of June 2021”“...the state executive committee of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority in exercise of powers conferred under Section 22 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, hereby directs that all private hospitals and nursing homes functioning as Covid-19 vaccination centres...shall ensure that the Covaxin shall be used for vaccination to only those people (of age group 18-44 years) who are eligible for receiving second dose of vaccination during the month of June 2021 or until further orders, whichever is earlier,” read the order.The decision, said senior government officials, was taken in the light of a severe shortage of vaccines for the 18-45 age group, which has already led to temporary suspension of 368 vaccine sites for more than two weeks now. A limited consignment of Covaxin -- comprising around 92,000 doses -- is likely to arrive for the 18-45 age group at the state government-run centres in June, even though the private ones have independent stock.Government data said around 150,000 doses of Covaxin have been administered to people in the 18-45 age group, all of whom have their second doses due in June. “It shows that there is a demand supply gap. The government has to ensure people do not miss out on their second dose of Covaxin. Hence, this step was necessary. The gap can widen if the vaccine centres in the city continue administering first doses of Covaxin without assurances of future supplies,” said a senior government officials who did wish to be identified.On Friday, the Delhi government was pulled up by the Delhi high court for letting government centres administer such high number of first doses of Covaxin, despite there being a shortage of the particular vaccine and no assurances of supply.“For the first two weeks in May, the vaccination for 18-45 years mostly happened in the government sector. Now, if the private sector keeps all the doses for the second shot, who will get it? Around 30% of the people are unlikely to get the vaccine even if given for free, another 30% who might have got the first shot at a government centre will not be able to pay ₹1400 for a dose in the private sector. And, this will slow down vaccination. Till the time doses are unavailable in the govt sector, the govt should subsidise the doses for at least those who are from the economically weaker sections,” said Girdhar Gyani, director general of Association of Healthcare Providers (India).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-shortage-all-jab-centres-in-delhi-told-to-give-only-2nd-dose-of-covaxin-101623000751556.html
07-06-2021||Delhi||With schools shut, bus service providers in Delhi struggle to make ends meet||Sixteen months after the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country forcing schools and colleges into shutting down, several thousands of buses plying to these institutes across the national capital still continue to remain off the roads. This has put hundreds of bus service providers in dire financial straits as they are struggling to make ends meet and also pay their employees.All the schools in the national capital are physically shut for students since last March. Even as the Delhi government allowed schools to partially reopen for classes 9 to 12 between January and February, transportation services did not resume.The Delhi Contract Bus Association, an umbrella organisation of over 1,700 contractors who ply 45,000 to 50,000 small and big buses for schools in Delhi and NCR, on Friday wrote an open letter to the Central government requesting a “relief package”. “Schools and colleges all over India are closed from 22 March 2020 till date... Thousands of operators have been rendered unemployed and thousands of buses, on which bank loans are still outstanding, are getting rusted for one and a half years...As per the Supreme Court guidelines, the design of the buses which are under contract with any education institution is completely different and cannot be used for any other purpose,” they said in the open letter addressed to Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari.The association has warned the government that they will surrender the keys of their vehicles to the office of the Union transport ministry if it doesn’t come out with a “relief package” for them in the next 30 days.In February, the association moved the Delhi high court seeking exemptions from payment of road tax and levy of penalty post-December 2020, in view of the losses suffered due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The court, in March, directed the petition be treated as a representation by the respondent.Members of the association are scheduled to have a virtual meeting with the Delhi transport department officials on Monday regarding the matter. “The matter is sub-judice. Delhi government will provide every possible help to those affected by the pandemic,” said a senior government official.Harish Sabharwal, general secretary of the association and owner of Sabharwal transport, said his company owns 168 school buses and employs over 300 people. “Service providers like us could still manage to pay the salaries to our drivers, conductors, and helpers despite zero earnings till now; the smaller ones are struggling to even make their ends meet. Many of them have started selling their vehicles, and in some cases, banks have confiscated the buses after they failed to pay the EMIs. Now, we do not have money to pay our employees,” he said.Sabharwal said that the insurance of all these buses have expired though they did not ply on the roads in the last 16 months. “The rubber parts of the buses need to be lubricated every four months. Now, all these parts and batteries have been destroyed in the last one and a half years. Whenever the schools reopen and transport services are allowed, the operators will have to spend at least ₹1.5-2 lakh per bus, including ₹70,000-80,000 as insurance renewal fees,” he said.Vimal Wahi, owner of Jupiter travels, said he has to repay a loan of ₹1.6 crore he took for running his bus service. His agency owns 65 school buses and employs around 200 staffers. “We had been provided a loan moratorium till last September and after that, we had to pay everything. We have no money to pay instalments now.”Some service providers said they have been receiving notices from banks after failing to pay the EMIs. Manik Chawla, the owner of Chetan travels, said he has to pay ₹40 lakh as monthly instalment to banks for his 110 buses operating for some prominent schools in Delhi. “I have not been able to pay the instalments since April last year. I have my family responsibilities and also have to pay something to my staff also. Right now, I do not have money to even pay the fees of my own child. The schools have also not provided us anything,” he said.Several private schools said the government order barring them from collecting anything other than tuition fees have put them in a difficult situation. “At a time when we are struggling to pay the salaries of our teachers who have been working continuously , how can we pay transport service providers whose services we have not taken since last year? Our hands are tied,” said a principal of a private school requesting anonymity.The Delhi High court earlier this week quashed the Delhi government’s fee order, yet schools are not allowed to charge transport fees from students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-schools-shut-bus-service-providers-in-delhi-struggle-to-make-ends-meet-101623000750220.html

At least 400 buses are scheduled to run on 300 routes, on Monday in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. Accordingly, arrangements have been made at all major bus stands and depots. Looking at the response, we will increase the fleet this week,” said Rajendra Jagtap, PMPML chairman and managing director (CMD). Since strict restrictions began in the state in the first week of April, public transport buses were only allowed for emergency services. Prior to that, PMPML was earning revenue of ₹1 crore per day. “Last year, after the countrywide lockdown ended, we had to suffer major losses and after that we were somehow coming on track in terms of revenue generation. When we started getting good revenue in the March and April, suddenly this state lockdown started. Till now we have had losses of ₹80 crore,” added Jagtap.While passengers are happy about public transport restarting, Archana Jadhav, who works in a private firm said, “I am working in a private logistics office in Yerawada and I stay on Sinhgad road. For the last two months my husband was dropping me to work. It was becoming very difficult to travel. Now it will be a relief as public transport buses are starting again.”Pune to Lonavla local trains on standbyAs the state government has not given any clear guidelines about the starting of local trains in the state, the locals from Pune to Lonavla will not be operational on Monday. Currently, local trains are making four trips between Pune and Lonavla, but only for emergency service staff. “We have not yet got any guidelines or instructions from the state government to start local trains for public. Once we get it we will immediately start.

07-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab inks pact to launch emissions trading||The Punjab government has announced partnership with Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), South Asia, and Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), India, to launch the use of an emissions trading scheme to design and establish pollution markets in the state. The collaboration was announced by the departments of industry and commerce and science, technology and environment on World Environment Day on Saturday.Emissions trading scheme (ETS) is a market-based approach to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for reducing the emissions of pollutants. A central authority allocates or sells a limited number of permits that allow a discharge of a specific quantity of a specific pollutant over a set time period. Polluters are required to hold permits in amount equal to their emissions. Those who want to increase their emissions must buy permits from others willing to sell them.According to a government press release, the partnership includes providing technical assistance and capacity building to public officials to effectively use data and research evidence from established and functioning emissions trading market at Surat.First: Scheme for 200 dyeing units in LudhianaAs a first step in the partnership, the state government and Punjab Pollution Control Board will launch an ETS to regulate emissions from 200 dyeing industries in Ludhiana besides reducing particulate and greenhouse gas emissions in the state.“Pollution reductions can be delivered. The world’s first ETS for particulate pollution in Gujarat has already shown this. Punjab is now becoming the second Indian state to adopt this pioneering vision. For various other Indian cities battling polluted air and expensive regulations, ETS has the potential to improve air quality and health, reduce the regulatory burden on industries, and decrease government enforcement expenditures,” said Michael Greenstone, the director of EPIC and co-chair of energy, environment and climate change at J-PAL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-inks-pact-to-launch-emissions-trading-101622901624754.html

But New Delhi hasn’t yet approved any China-made vaccine in India. So the group of Indians went to countries such as Nepal, UAE, Maldives and Malaysia where Chinese vaccines are available to get the jabs.Moderna seeks nod for teens in Europe, CanadaUS firm Moderna is seeking conditional approval for use of its Covid-19 vaccine on teens in the European Union and Canada, in a boost for inoculation campaigns as the summer begins.

Two weeks after we extended the invite to all over 30s, we are now extending the offer to everyone aged 25 and over,” he said.The National Health Service (NHS) has dubbed the latest expansion of its vaccination programme as the “Home Straight” phase, as around 3 million people aged between 25 and 29 will begin being invited to book their first vaccine dose.The move comes as NHS data shows that more than half of all adults in the country are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19.“We have one of the highest uptake rates in the world with over half of the UK population having the fullest possible protection from two doses, and over three quarters receiving at least one dose. The vaccine is our way out of this pandemic so when you get the call, get the jab,” said Hancock.According to previously released expert advice, both doses of the Covid-19 vaccines are needed for strong protection against the Delta variant – which is now feared to be the dominant variant of concern (VOC) behind infections in the UK."It is too early to make decisions on step four, the road map has always been guided by the data and as before, we need four weeks between steps to see the latest data and a further week to give notice of our decision. So we'll assess the data and announce the outcome a week today," Hancock told the Commons, in reference to the June 21 timeline for an end to all lockdown restrictions.Hancock also informed Parliament that he has asked the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to provide clinical advice on the vaccination of 12-17-year-olds after the Pfizer/BioNTech jabs received regulatory approval for children last week.Meanwhile, NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, hailed the “watershed moment” of a further extension of the vaccination programme six months since 90-year-old Maggie Keenan became the first person anywhere in the world to receive her first dose on December 8, 2020.“The NHS vaccination programme is a real team effort and it is a testament to NHS teams across the country, that we are able to open up to people in their twenties just six months on from delivering that world first jab to Maggie Keenan,” said Stevens.“Getting the lifesaving Covid-19 jab is the most important thing you can do, with NHS staff vaccinating at over 1,600 sites including vaccine buses, places of worship, sport stadiums and other convenient locations,” he added.The latest Covid-19 statistics released on Monday recorded one more death from the deadly virus in the UK and 5,683 cases of coronavirus infections within the community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-expands-covid-vaccination-drive-to-inoculate-people-above-25-yrs-101623084652412.html
07-06-2021||World||Kamala Harris says leaders need to restore hope in Guatemala||Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday emphasized the need to restore hope for residents of Northern Triangle countries in order to address the increase in migration from the region as she faced the first major test of her diplomatic skills on a three day foreign trip meant to stem migration to the US from those countries.Her comments came at the start of her bilateral meeting with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei Monday morning. She plans to address everything from vaccine sharing to corruption in the region. But in her opening remarks, she emphasized the need for both leaders to act to improve the situation on the ground for Guatemalans, whom she said don’t want to leave their homeland but are forced to by poor living conditions.“Hope does not exist by itself, it must be coupled with relationships and trust, it must be coupled with tangible outcomes in terms of what we do as leaders to convince people that there is a reason to be hopeful about their future and the future of their children,” she said.Harris also said the fact she chose Guatemala and Mexico for her first overseas trip was a “reflection of the priority President Biden placed on this region.” She said the two nations are “interconnected and interdependent” and it’s in “our collective interest that we work together.”Their meeting came as the Biden administration is expected to announce new anti-trafficking and smuggling measures, and hopes to deliver new anti-corruption measures Monday as well, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview announcements before they have been made public. Harris is visiting Guatemala and Mexico as part of her role in dealing diplomatically with the irregular migration to the US, and she will meet with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Tuesday.In Guatemala, the country’s widespread corruption will loom over the discussions, even as Harris seeks new agreements with Giammattei to help stem the spike in migration.Nongovernmental organizations placed Guatemala’s widespread corruption at the top of their list of concerns before Harris’ visit. Last month, two lawyers who are outspoken critics of Giammattei’s administration were arrested on what they say were trumped-up charges aimed at silencing them.The selection of judges for Guatemala’s Constitutional Court, its highest, was mired in influence peddling and allegations of corruption. Giammattei picked his chief of staff to fill one of the five vacancies. When Gloria Porras, a respected force against corruption, was elected to a second term, the congress controlled by Giammattei’s party refused to seat her.“Corruption really does sap the the wealth of any country, and in Central America is at a scale where it is a large percentage of GDP across the region,” said special envoy Ricardo Zúñiga, who joined Harris in the meeting with Giammattei. “We see corruption as one of the most important root causes to be dealt with.”Besides her meeting with Giammattei on Monday morning, Harris will participate in a roundtable with Guatemalan community and civil society leaders, and she’ll meet with young innovators and entrepreneurs, including a number of female entrepreneurs.In addressing the root causes of migration, Harris has laid out an approach centered on creating better opportunities and living conditions in the region through humanitarian and economic aid. She’s focused many of her public events and listening sessions before this visit on work with civil society organizations and international businesses, which her aides say is an acknowledgement that the work of improving the situation in the region cannot be done by its governments alone.Harris announced plans to send $310 million to provide support for refugees and address food shortages, and she recently secured commitments from a dozen companies and organizations to invest in the Northern Triangle countries to promote economic opportunity and job training.Washington won some goodwill through its vaccine diplomacy this past week. Giammattei and López Obrador both received calls from Harris on Thursday telling them the US would be sending 500,000 doses and 1 million doses, respectively, of Covid-19 vaccine.But Harris’ aides say corruption will continue to be a central focus of her bilateral meetings with both Giammattei and López Obrador.While in Latin America, Harris will also have to navigate the politics of immigration. Congressional Republicans have criticized both President Joe Biden and Harris for deciding not to visit the US-Mexico border and contend the administration is ignoring what they say is a crisis there. April was the second-busiest month on record for unaccompanied children encountered at the border, following March’s all-time high. The Border Patrol’s total encounters in April were up 3% from March, marking the highest level since April 2000.Conservatives will be watching Harris closely for any missteps, hoping to drag her into further controversy on an issue that they see as a political winner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-says-leaders-need-to-restore-hope-in-guatemala-101623083075183.html

07-06-2021||World||Maldives' foreign minister Abdulla Shahid elected president of UN General Assembly||Foreign minister of the Maldives Abdulla Shahid was elected as the President of the 76th United Nations General Assembly with an overwhelming three-fourth majority, with143 in favour, 48 against and no abstentions and no invalid votes.This is a post held on an annual basis, rotated amongst various regional groupings. The 76th session (2021-22) is the turn of the Asia-Pacific group. This is the first time that the Maldives will be occupying the office of the President of the UN General Assembly.The Maldives had announced Shahid’s candidature in December 2018. At that time, no other candidate was in the fray. Shahid is eminently qualified to hold the top office of UN General Assembly, with vast diplomatic experience and strong credentials, especially in the multilateral fora.India announced its support for Shahid during the visit of foreign secretary Harsh Shringla to the Maldives in November 2020. Even at that time, he was the only candidate in the fray.Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday took to Twitter to congratulate Shahid on his selection.This is a testimony as much to his own stature as to the standing of Maldives. We look forward to working with him to strengthen multilateralism and its much needed reforms.In mid-January 2021, in a surprising development and with less than six months before the elections, Afghanistan's foreign minister Zalmai Rassoul entered the fray. While Rassoul also has strong credentials, by the time his candidature was announced, the Maldives had already garnered extensive support. Moreover, the island nation has never held the office of General Assembly, while Afghanistan held this post during the 21st GA session in 1966-67.In response to media queries on remarks made by President of the United Nations General Assembly with respect to Jammu and Kashmir, the official spokesperson said, "We express our strong opposition to the unwarranted references made with respect to the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir by the President of the United Nations General Assembly (PGA) Volkan Bozkir during his recent visit to Pakistan.His remarks that Pakistan is "duty bound” to raise this issue in the UN more strongly are unacceptable. Nor indeed is there any basis for comparison to other global situations.When an incumbent President of the UN General Assembly makes misleading and prejudiced remarks, he does great disservice to the office he occupies. The UNGA President's behaviour is truly regrettable and surely diminishes his standing on the global platform."Both the Maldives and Afghanistan have excellent relations with India, and both candidates are friends of India. However, since India had already committed its support to Maldives at a time when no other candidate was in the fray, India voted in favour of Maldives.The office of UNGA President is the highest office in the UN System, and reflects the collective goodwill of the 193 Member States of the UN. India remains committed to supporting the office, as it has consistently done in previous years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maldives-abdulla-shahid-elected-president-of-un-general-assembly-101623081279055.html

Other doctors said clinical trial results were inconsistent and more proof was needed.The FDA said Biogen must conduct a post-approval clinical trial to verify the drug's clinical benefit."If the drug does not work as intended, we can take steps to remove it from the market," it said.Aducanumab was studied in patients with early disease who test positive for a component of amyloid brain plaques. Some trial patients experienced potentially dangerous brain swelling.Biogen has estimated that around 1.5 million Americans would be eligible for treatment with aducanumab, which is given by monthly infusion, raising concerns about costs to the healthcare system.Shares were halted pending the news.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-approves-biogen-inc-s-drug-for-alzheimer-s-disease-101623080586498.html

He will be aboard New Shepard, a reusable rocket of his space company Blue Origin, with his brother Mark Bezos and one more person, the winner of an auction for the third berth, when it lifts off on July 20, two weeks after Jeff is scheduled to step down as CEO of Amazon.“Ever since I was five years old, I’ve dreamed of travelling to space,” Jeff said in a post on Instagram on Monday. “On July 20th, I will take that journey with my brother. The greatest adventure, with my best friend. #Gradatim Ferociter (a Latin phrase that is Blue Origin’s motto, and translates to ‘step by step, ferociously’).”“I wasn’t even expecting him to say that he was going to be on the first flight,” said Mark, who is senior vice-president at Robin Hood, a poverty-fighting charity in New York City, in a video in the Instagram post. “What a remarkable opportunity, not only to have this adventure but to do it with my best friend.”If nothing changes between now and July 20, Jeff Bezos will become the first billionaire to go into space, beating fellow “Space Barons” Elon Musk, whose SpaceX has been flying crewed missions to the International Space Station since 2020, and Richard Branson, who has announced plans several times before to go up in a Virgin Galactic rocket, but hasn’t yet.Jeff’s space company Blue Origin, which is based outside Seattle in Washington state, has been conducting flight tests of the New Shepard and its safety systems since 2012, and the company said it had 15 successful consecutive missions, including three successful escape tests, demonstrating its crew escape system can activate safely in any phase of flight missions. New Shepard, which is a reusable rocket system, is named after Alan Shepard, the first American to go into space.The 59ft rocket, with a six-seater capsule, will take off on July 20, the anniversary of the 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. The flight will last 11 minutes and will travel 60 miles above Earth to the edge of space, according to reports.Along with Jeff’s brother will be the winner of an auction that is under way, with the highest bid standing at $2.8 million. The winner will be declared at a live auction on June 12; participants have until June 10 to communicate their bidding limits. Earnings from the auction will go to foundation step to up to promote education in STEM courses - Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.Jeff founded Blue Origin in 2000 to enable, the company said on its website, a “future where millions of people are living and working in space to benefit Earth. In order to preserve Earth, Blue Origin believes that humanity will need to expand, explore, find new energy and material resources, and move industries that stress Earth into space”.Musk founded SpaceX two years later in 2002 and Branson followed up with Virgin Galactic in 2004.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bezos-going-into-space-on-july-20-beating-space-barons-musk-branson-to-it-101623078516249.html

During the eclipse, the Moon will move between the Sun and the Earth, and with the three celestial bodies exactly in line with each other the Sun's light will be blocked from reaching the Earth.This eclipse is going to appear as a 'ring of fire'. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), in solar eclipses the Moon isn't close enough to Earth to entirely block the view of the Sun from the planet, leaving a ring of sunlight around the moon.The solar eclipse, also called Surya Grahan in India, will not be visible in the entire country. While only some parts of Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh will witness it, people in other regions can see the eclipse via a live webcam. To watch this rare phenomenon, people are advised to use protective solar eclipse-viewing glasses. The website timeanddate.com has published the live stream link which people can tune in to on June 10 to watch the eclipse.Parts of Canada, Greenland, and Russia will be able to witness the eclipse, according to Nasa. Cities like New York, Washington DC, London, and Toronto will see a partial eclipse. New York will witness more than 70% coverage of the Sun.Last month, too, a celestial event in the form of a super blood moon was witnessed. After the upcoming eclipse on June 10, people will get to see the second solar eclipse of the year on December 4. This will also not be visible in India. People from South America, the Pacific, the Atlantic, parts of the Indian Ocean and Antarctica will get to see the last solar eclipse of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/solar-eclipse-2021-to-occur-on-june-10-timing-how-to-watch-ring-of-fire-101623070867234.html
07-06-2021||World||Covid-19: Over 300 stranded Indians petition for return to China||More than 300 Indians who live and work in China but are currently in their home country have petitioned the Chinese government to allow them to return after taking Chinese vaccines from a third country.In March, Chinese missions in many countries including in India said they will facilitate issuing visas to foreigners who need to travel to China if they have taken a China-made Covid-19 vaccine.The rule, however, did not make it easier for Indians to the visas since New Delhi hasn’t yet approved any China-made vaccine in the country.The group of Indians, however, found a way out - they travelled to countries like Nepal, UAE, and Maldives where Chinese vaccines are available to get the jabs. A few also went to Malaysia.Many of them took China’s Sinopharm vaccine, which was approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) in May.After returning to India, the group - which calls itself Indians of China - sent representations to the Chinese embassy in New Delhi, requesting the mission to issue visas as they had complied with the vaccine criteria. They also wrote to the Indian embassy in Beijing to take up the matter with the Chinese foreign ministry.Many among the petitioning Indians have been separated from their families for over 16 months while others are finding it tough to hold on to their jobs in China.For many, the emotional trauma of staying separately from their families is taking a mental toll.The Indians have pressed home the point that since they have complied with the directive to take China-made jabs, they should be allowed to return to China.They have assured Chinese authorities of complying with all necessary pandemic-prevention rules, testing and quarantine procedures once they arrive in China.The Indians, however, have not yet received any response from the Chinese authorities.In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin on Monday said those eligible are being helped to return but did not give details. “In order to restore the normal order of cross-border travel for those foreigners, who have been vaccinated with Chinese vaccines, holding the certificates and meeting the eligibility, we are providing facilitations for their travel. But, for the details, please contact the Chinese Embassy in India,” Wang said when asked about the status of stranded Indians.When asked whether China will recognise vaccines approved by the WHO for travelling to China, Wang said it was important to have a safe system of international travel. “Essentially, this is about cross-border travel and the order to be maintained. We have already stated our position on this issue. I’d like to reiterate that since the outbreak of the pandemic, drawing on the experience of many countries we have rolled out measures to ensure safety, while building a safe and orderly cross-border travel.”Indian students enrolled in Chinese universities but stranded in their home country have also not been allowed to return to China because of the continuing and strict restrictions imposed on international travel related to the Covid-19 pandemic.In March, Beijing suggested that Indian students stay in contact with their universities in China and follow their instructions - in effect saying that they should continue with their online studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-stranded-indians-petition-for-return-to-china-101623076056437.html

07-06-2021||World||Pak, China plan to create media house to challenge West’s ‘info dominance’||Pakistan and China are working on plans to create a television channel and media organisation with the aim of achieving “information dominance” and offering an alternative to the narrative of Western news media, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The two countries are exploring the possibility of creating an organisation on the lines of Qatar’s Al-Jazeera or Russia’s RT network, complete with journalists of international stature, which would be backed by Chinese funding, the people said. The thinking behind the move is that China’s internal dynamics preclude an open media but the country has financial muscle, while Pakistan’s internal scenario is favourable for such a media organisation but the state lacks financial resources, the people said, citing internal documents accessed by Indian security agencies. Also Read | On Israel-Palestine, resist the temptation to mediateThe two countries feel there is a need for a media house of the stature of Al-Jazeera and RT to “propel amenable narratives” and such an organisation could be established in Pakistan and funded by China to achieve the objectives of both sides, the people added. The move comes on the heels of Pakistan’s failed effort about two years ago to launch an English television channel along with Turkey and Malaysia that was to have projected a correct image of Islam and confronted challenges due to Islamophobia. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had spoken about the venture following a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad in New York in September 2019. That project was apparently shelved last year because of lack of interest from Turkey and Malaysia and there have been no updates from the Pakistani side. The people also pointed to Chinese President Xi Jinping’s remarks at a May 31 meeting of the Politburo of the Communist Party about the need to create a “trustworthy, lovable and respectable” image for the country and said this reflected a move by Beijing to tone down its recent “wolf warrior” diplomacy. Xi told senior Communist Party leaders that the country must “make friends extensively, unite the majority and continuously expand its circle of friends with those who understand and are friendly to China”, according to state-run Xinhua news agency. China needs “a grip on tone” in its communications with the world and should “be open and confident, but also modest and humble”, he said. One of the people cited above said: “The current project aims to establish a media house to project a so-called correct image of Pakistan. Though the documents do not refer to China directly in terms of content, the very fact that financing would be provided by China is proof that China intends to use this channel as a platform to improve its image.” One of the documents accessed by security agencies states that China is competing with the West in technology and economy but lags in “information dominance”. It further states that in a world dominated by social media, winning the “battle of narrative is more important than winning of physical battle”, and domination in technology and economy may not be fully realised without domination in the information domain. The proposed media organisation will build “capacity to contest inimical narratives through counter or alternate narratives” and that Sino-Pakistan collaboration is necessary to build “this critical capacity”. The proposed organisation will give significance to information dominance and attempt to quash “engineered misperceptions”, the document adds. In recent months, Pakistan’s powerful military has taken several steps to browbeat and silence its critics in the media. Popular TV anchor Hamid Mir was taken off the air by Geo News, one of Pakistan’s most-watched channels, after he threatened to divulge details of the alleged shooting of a senior military official by his wife during a protest in Islamabad on May 29 against the assault of a Pakistani reporter by intelligence operatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-china-plan-to-create-media-house-to-challenge-west-s-info-dominance-101623069334228.html
07-06-2021||World||France fines Google 220 million euros for abusing market spot with online ads||France's competition regulator on Monday fined Google 220 million euros ($267 million) after finding it had abused its dominant market position for placing online ads, as US tech giants face growing pressure in Europe.The penalty is part of a settlement reached after three media groups -- News Corp, French daily Le Figaro, and Belgium's Groupe Rossel -- accused Google of effectively having a monopoly over ad sales for their websites and apps.The competition authority determined that Google gave preferential treatment to its own ad inventory auction service AdX and to Doubleclick Ad Exchange, its real-time platform for letting clients choose and buy ads."It is the first ruling in the world to scrutinise the complex algorithmic processes for the auctions that determine online 'display' advertising," the authority's president Isabelle de Silva said.Media groups looking to sell ad space on their internet sites or mobile apps using rival platforms often found that Google's services were unfairly competing against rivals, using a variety of methods.For example, regulators found that Doubleclick would vary the commission it took when making a sale based on prices offered by other so-called ad servers.At the same time, Google arranged for AdX, its own supply-side platform (SSP), to give preferential treatment to offers emanating from Doubleclick -- effectively squeezing out competitors such as Xandr or Index Exchange."The practices are particularly serious because they are penalising Google's competitors in the SSP market as well as the editors of websites and mobile apps," the regulator said in a statement.'First in the world'Media groups saw their online ad revenues crimped "even as their business model has been strongly undermined by the decline in paper subscriptions and the associated drop in advertising revenue," it said.Le Figaro eventually dropped its complaint.Google did not contest the findings, and the regulator said the company has committed to operational changes including improved interoperability with third-party ad placement providers."We are going to test and develop these changes in the coming months before deploying them more broadly, including some on a global scale," Maria Gomri, legal director at Google France, said in a statement.The fine represents just a tiny fraction of the $55.3 billion in revenue booked by Google in the first quarter of this year alone, mainly from online ad sales.The ruling comes as American technology firms are drawing closer scrutiny from European authorities, which are giving themselves new resources to better understand the complex workings of fast-evolving markets.Last week, Germany's competition regulator said it was expanding an antitrust investigation into Google and its parent company Alphabet to include Google News Showcase, a service aimed at increasing revenue for media publishers.Facebook also found itself targeted last week by parallel competition inquiries from the European Union and Britain, into whether the social media giant uses data from advertisers to unfairly dominate the online classifieds market.Google had already been fined 150 million euros by the French regulator in December 2019 over "opaque" operating rules for its advertising platform, which were deemed to be applied in "an unfair and random manner."And in December last year, Google, as well as Amazon, were fined a total of 135 million euros by France's privacy watchdog for placing advertising cookies on users' computers without consent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-fines-google-220-million-euros-for-abusing-market-spot-with-online-ads-101623061315948.html
07-06-2021||World||Singapore’s fresh Covid-19 infections lowest since mid-May||Singaporean authorities detected five new coronavirus cases in the community, marking the lowest daily total since the government tightened restrictions on May 16 for a month following an outbreak.All five of these Covid-19 cases were linked to earlier infections, government data showed on Monday. No new cases were discovered in the foreign worker dormitories, while nine imported cases were already under quarantine.The decline in cases comes ahead of a possible easing of restrictions after June 13. It is unlikely, however, that recent measures will be fully removed as the easing will be done in a controlled manner, government officials have said.On Sunday, the Ministry of Health said a hospital cluster, one of the biggest during a recent outbreak driven by more infectious variants, has been closed after no new cases were linked to them for 28 days.“We are heading in the right direction because of the contribution of everyone,” Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, who also co-chairs the virus taskforce, said in a Facebook post on Sunday. Ong said the proportion of untraceable cases “have fallen from 18% to 15%” since the start of the curbs last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapores-fresh-covid-19-infections-lowest-since-midmay-101623057723012.html
07-06-2021||World||Trial of Myanmar's deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi to begin next week||The trial of ousted Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi will begin next week, her lawyer told AFP Monday, with the Nobel laureate facing an eclectic raft of charges, from possessing unlicensed walkie-talkies to flouting coronavirus restrictions during last year's election campaign.Myanmar has been in uproar since Suu Kyi was ousted in a February 1 coup, with near-daily protests and a nationwide civil disobedience movement.Almost 850 people have been killed by the military, according to a local monitoring group.The junta has hit Suu Kyi, 75, with a string of criminal charges. The most serious alleges that she violated the country's colonial-era Official Secrets Act.Her trial will start on June 14 and is expected to wrap up by July 26, according to her legal team.Her lawyers have been allowed to meet with her just twice since she was placed under house arrest, with weeks of delays to her legal case."We will get testimonies from plaintiffs and witnesses starting from next hearing," on Monday, lawyer Min Min Soe said after meeting with Suu Kyi in the capital Naypyidaw.There was a heavy police presence around the Naypyidaw council compound, close to where the court is located, with roadblocks along streets leading to the area, an AFP reporter said.Suu Kyi "asked all (people) to stay in good health," Min Min Soe added.Suu Kyi spent more than 15 years under house arrest during the previous military rule before her 2010 release and rise to power in elections held five years later.Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing has justified his power grab by citing alleged electoral fraud in the November poll, which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won in a landslide.The junta has previously said it would hold fresh elections within two years, but has also threatened to dissolve the NLD.The continuing violence in Myanmar has pushed some in the anti-junta movement to form a so-called "People's Defence Force" (PDF) in their townships -- made up of civilians who fight back against security forces with homemade weapons.But they are often outnumbered and outgunned in clashes with Myanmar's military -- one of Southeast Asia's most battle-hardened and brutal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trial-of-myanmar-s-deposed-leader-aung-san-suu-kyi-to-begin-next-week-101623055797464.html
07-06-2021||World||US lawmakers push Biden for more Covid-19 vaccines and medical aid to India||Several US lawmakers have urged the Biden administration to ensure that India receives enough Covid-19 vaccines and medical aid, saying the health crisis in the country is "devastating" and America has a responsibility to help its close allies defeat the pandemic.The American lawmakers called on the US government to send more vaccines and medical assistance to India after President Joe Biden on Thursday announced that the US will allocate 75 per cent - nearly 1.9 crore of the first tranche of 2.5 crore doses - of unused Covid-19 vaccines from its stockpile to countries in South and Southeast Asia as well as Africa by the end of June.Biden said the US will share the vaccine to many countries to fight the pandemic through the UN-backed COVAX global vaccine sharing programme as part of his administration’s framework for sharing 80 million (8 crore) vaccines globally."The crisis in India is devastating and demands more action from (President Joe) Biden. More Covid-19 vaccines and medical supplies are needed to help one of our most important global allies fight this virus," Texas Governor Greg Abbott said.In a tweet, the Republican governor urged US citizens to join him in praying for India.Republican Senator Ted Cruz said that almost 300 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the US."India is a critical friend of the US. Biden's vaccine sharing programme is flawed: We should prioritise our allies such as India, and make sure it receives the Covid-19 vaccines they desperately need," he said.Senator Roger Wicker from the Senate Armed Services Committee said that it is important for the US to continue helping other nations beat the coronavirus. "Sending excess vaccines to close allies like India doesn't just make sense, it is the right thing to do," he said.Congressman Michael McCaul, a ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs, tweeted, "Glad to see critically needed vaccines and other therapeutics will be sent to India to continue to support a longstanding partner and ally."He said as Texans, this reinforces close ties between "our community and the Indian-American diaspora".Congressman Adam Smith lauded President Biden for the steps taken to assist countries that need help."The Covid-19 crisis in India and other countries has been devastating, and more vaccines and medical supplies are still needed," said the chairman of the powerful House Armed Services Committee."To defeat Covid-19, we must fight it both at home and around the world," Smith, a Democrat, added.Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna, also a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said to help India deal with shortage, the US needs to send those vaccines that it will never use, just like India helped America in its time of need.Congressman Dan Crenshaw said Houston is home to a large Indian community with friends and families in need back in India. "It should be a priority within this international programme," he tweeted.Observing that the Covid-19 situation in India is "heartbreaking", Congressman August Pfluger said that the US has a responsibility to help its ally."We should immediately send additional vaccines and critical medical supplies," he said.The US has also sent critical medical equipment and medicines to India to fight the second wave of Covid-19.Congressman Darren Soto said as a member of the India Caucus, he thanked President Biden for announcing 25 million in vaccines to hard hit places like India."Let’s continue to take the necessary steps to address the deadly second wave of Covid-19 there with surplus medical supplies and vaccines," said the member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.Congressman John Curtis said that while 63 per cent of adult Americans have received at least one shot, many of the US' friends have no access to vaccines."It's important we share with countries like India — a return to normalcy and an eventual end to this brutal pandemic will require some global cooperation," said Curtis, who is a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.Congressman Troy Nehls urged Biden to immediately send surplus vaccines to India to help it in its fight against Covid-19. He is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.In this global health crisis, it is important that America targets excess Covid-19 vaccines to those around the world that need it most, said Congressman French Hill.“The situation in India, one of our closest allies, is dire. I encourage the Biden administration to support India with vaccines in their time of need," said Hill, who is a member of the House Financial Services Committee.Congressman Tim Burchett said that the US needs to make sure that India gets the Covid-19 vaccines.“The response to the tragedy of the Covid-19 pandemic must be global. We must work to close the gaps in our global alert system and work with our allies to make sure this never happens again,” tweeted Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick.India reported 1,00,636 fresh Covid-19 cases on Monday, the lowest in 61 days, taking the infection tally to 2,89,09,975, according to the Union Health Ministry's latest data. The death toll due to coronavirus reached 3,49,186 with 2,427 new fatalities, the lowest in around 45 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-push-biden-for-more-covid-19-vaccines-and-medical-aid-to-india-101623046785943.html
07-06-2021||World||Pandemic wanes in US, other markets, China's exports and imports surge||China has reported its exports and imports surged in May on growing demand as the pandemic was waning in the US and other key markets, though the pace of growth is leveling off.Customs data released Monday showed exports rose 28% from a year earlier and imports soared 51% — at the fastest annual pace in over a decade. Total exports climbed 40% in the first five months of the year from a year earlier. They were up 29% from the same period in 2019.China has led the global recovery from the pandemic, which is still raging in many parts of the globe but receding in some places, mostly where vaccinations have been widely deployed.Chinese manufacturers benefited from strong demand for protective gear and other products as other countries battled Covid-19, gaining market share from competitors.The base-level boost from last year’s slump is fading, however, and the $263.9 billion in Chinese exports in May was about level with the previous month. China’s imports of $218.4 billion in May were 1.2% lower than in April.Beijing's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States rose 14% to $31.8 billion, while the surplus with the European Union fell 43% to $12.7 billion.China’s total trade surplus in May was $45.53 billion, down 26.5% from a year earlier.While the increase in exports was robust in May, it was lower than some economists had forecast and analysts said one reason might be delays at ports in southern China, the main shipping hub, due to increased precautions to fight an outbreak of coronavirus cases.Shortages of semiconductors that are plaguing many industries have likewise hit exports of electronics. Demand for products that surged while people were staying home due to the pandemic, such as toys and furniture, also weakened, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary.“Headline trade growth remained elevated last month. But trade volumes dropped back in levels terms and, while supply constraints are partly to blame, there are signs that demand may be peaking, too," he said in a report.A key factor behind last month's rapid increase in imports was rising prices for oil and other commodities needed to fuel the country's industries. But it also reflects demand for the inputs needed to make so much of what China exports.The recovery in demand is helping neighboring countries in Asia that supply many such goods, such as electronics components. Imports from the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations soared nearly 54% from a year earlier, to $33.1 billion. Exports to the region, where many countries are contending with their worst coronavirus outbreaks so far, rose 40% to $39.2 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-wanes-in-us-other-markets-china-s-exports-and-imports-surge-101623046772591.html

Apart from the death of 36 people, Geo TV said that more than 50 others were injured and several passengers remained trapped under the rubble.A rescue operation is underway for passengers trapped inside the trains. All sides of the tracks have been closed after the incident.In March this year, Lahore-bound Karachi Express had derailed in Sindh province.Later, a probe launched under the federal government inspector of railways (FGIR) had blamed the "poor condition of the track" for the accident in which a woman was killed and 13 others sustained injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-36-killed-in-train-collision-in-pakistan-s-sindh-101623046805857.html
07-06-2021||World||Covid-19 origins: Here's why the Wuhan 'lab leak' theory is back in news||It's been months since a World Health Organization (WHO) investigation into the coronavirus disease's (Covid-19) origins concluded it was "extremely unlikely" that the highly transmissible virus "escaped" from a laboratory in China's Wuhan. Although this idea, dubbed by the media as the "lab leak" hypothesis, has its advocates in certain quarters, the reluctance of the wider scientific consensus to endorse it following the WHO report quickly led to it being branded a "conspiracy theory". However, some new developments put forward by media outlets in the US—White House-led investigation efforts and statements by President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci—have brought the idea back into consideration.Also Read: Covid-19 virus may have escaped from Wuhan lab: Ex-CDC chiefCovid-19 origins: The debateThe debate on the pandemic's origins primarily consists of two contending theories—that of a "natural spillover" hypothesis and of a "lab leak".The first hypothesis brings with it the idea that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, most likely "spilled over" from animals to humans through an emissary animal. This was also the favoured hypothesis of the team of Chinese and international experts constituted by WHO to investigate the pandemic's origins. In its 120-page report, the team said that the virus probably originated in a bat or a pangolin before making the leap to human beings, due to close contact which is not unlikely in a wet market.Also Read: China must hand over the keys to Wuhan lab for Covid-19 origins and global goodThe second idea, far more controversial, projects that SARS-CoV-2 accidentally leaked from a maximum-security biological laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and began to circulate soon after the onset of the pandemic. Lab leaks are rare, compared to the huge work on infectious diseases all over the world. Yet, they are not unknown — the smallpox virus leaked from a lab in the UK, anthrax from the US and SARS-1 may have had a few lab leaks after its natural spillover.'Lab leak' hypothesis, back to notorietyA few recent developments have somewhat revived the idea that the SARS-CoV-2 leaked from the Wuhan lab.In an open letter published in the journal Science last month, more than a dozen scientists—top epidemiologists, immunologists and biologists—called for further investigation into both the hypotheses currently on the table and urged that they "be taken seriously" until we have sufficient data. Moreover, they questioned the WHO report and whether China was being fully transparent during that visit, stressing that an investigation should ideally minimise conflicts of interest as much as possible.US infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci isn't far behind in the race to scepticism, either. In what can be seen as a complete U-turn from his earlier interview to the National Geographic last year, Dr Fauci acknowledged on May 11 that he is now "not convinced" that the virus developed naturally and called for a more thorough investigation into the origins of SARS-CoV-2. Two weeks later, President Biden, with the green signal from his adviser, instructed his intelligence agencies to double-down on their investigations into a possible laboratory leak of the virus responsible for the current pandemic.Recent revelations by the Wall Street Journal have also pointed out that several WIV researchers became sick in the fall of 2019 with symptoms similar to “both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses,” and that at least three were hospitalised, adding fuel to the idea that the Covid-19 virus escaped from the Wuhan lab.It is true that the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) is one of the top virology labs in the world and research on coronaviruses is intensely conducted there, but China's lack of openness in this matter has only fueled further speculation and distrust among the global scientific community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-origins-here-s-why-the-wuhan-lab-leak-theory-is-back-in-news-101623049171660.html
07-06-2021||World||Nepal signed non-disclosure agreement for Sinopharm jabs: Report||Nepal has had to sign a non-disclosure agreement with the makers of China’s Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine in order to gain access to doses amid questions about the legality of such an undertaking, according to a media report on Monday. The Nepal government has been desperately looking for alternate sources of vaccines after India temporarily halted the export of jabs in late March to cope with a devastating second wave. Close to a million people in Nepal who received the first dose of the Covishield vaccine are currently waiting for their second dose after the passage of more than two months. Also Read | AIIMS Delhi begins screening of children for Covaxin trialsSinopharm’s proposal for a non-disclosure agreement created a dilemma among officials of Nepal’s health ministry as the country’s laws don’t have a provision for non-disclosure agreements in public procurements, The Kathmandu Post reported. “The non-disclosure agreement was signed on Friday [June 4] between the Department of Health Services and Sinopharm electronically,” an unnamed official of the department told The Post. “After the Health Ministry authorised the director general to sign the agreement with Sinopharm, the agreement was signed.” The official further said the China National Pharmaceutical Group, the maker of Sinopharm, will quote a price after Nepal states how many doses it intends to procure. “Then the procurement process will move forward. I cannot say when the vaccines will be available,” the official said. Roshan Pokharel, the chief specialist at Nepal’s health ministry, said the government plans to buy 10 million doses but the Chinese side has said it cannot make this quantity available immediately. “We will initially get probably two million doses,” he said. China earlier supplied 1.8 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine as grants to Nepal. Nepal’s Public Procurement Act of 2007 and the recent Covid-19 Crisis Management Ordinance are silent on non-disclosure agreements, though they allow the government to procure directly from suppliers or manufacturers without competitive bidding in extraordinary situations. According to Nepal’s Public Procurement Monitoring Office, details of all procurements must be disclosed under the existing law, except in situations where the government procures defence-related materials that are sensitive from a national security point of view. “If the existing procurement law and the ordinance don’t allow us to procure the much-needed vaccines through the non-disclosure agreement, the procurement process can move ahead only through a policy decision of the Cabinet,” said Taranath Pokharel, director of the Family Welfare Division of Nepal’s health ministry. “I think the Cabinet will take a decision to facilitate the vaccine procurement in the current pressing time,” he added. The controversy over Sinopharm vaccine in Nepal follows rows related to the jab in other countries. The procurement price of the Sinopharm vaccine in Sri Lanka triggered a row after reports emerged that Colombo paid a higher per-dose price than Bangladesh. Sri Lanka is paying $15 a dose, or $5 higher than what Bangladesh paid. Bahrain, which was one of the first countries to back the Sinopharm vaccine last year, has raised doubts about the jab’s effectiveness. Bahraini officials recently told the media that authorities will offer the Pfizer vaccine to high-risk individuals who had received two Sinopharm doses because these jabs didn’t appear to be enough in the face of a new wave of Covid-19 infections in the West Asian country. Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) granted emergency use listing to Sinopharm, making it the first vaccine developed by China to be given such an approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-signed-non-disclosure-agreement-for-sinopharm-jabs-report-101623050553205.html
07-06-2021||World||Switzerland could become first European nation to ban artificial pesticides, referendum on June 13||Switzerland could become the first European country to ban artificial pesticides in a June 13 referendum which backers of the initiative hope will trigger similar prohibitions elsewhere.Globally, only Bhutan has a complete ban on synthetic pesticides, according to supporters aiming to outlaw the use of products made by agrochemical giants such as Switzerland's Syngenta and Germany's Bayer and BASF.Supporters of the ban say the artificial products cause serious health problems and reduce biodiversity. Manufacturers say their pesticides are rigorously tested and regulated, can be used safely and crop yields would slump without them.Another initiative to be voted on the same day aims to improve the quality of Switzerland's drinking water and food by stopping direct subsidies to farmers who use artificial pesticides and antibiotics in livestock.Switzerland has been starkly divided by an unusually bitter debate over the initiatives and the votes look set to be close. A recent Tamedia poll showed 48% of voters favoured the drinking water initiative and 49% supported the pesticide ban.If adopted, the proposals give farmers up to 10 years to make the transition, which would allow Switzerland to become a pioneer in organic food as well as an example to the rest of the world, Swiss winemaker Roland Lenz said."Clean water, one of the foundations of life, is endangered," said Lenz, a 51-year-old organic farmer, whose vineyard is surrounded by farmers opposing the initiative.Syngenta, which is headquartered in Switzerland and owned by China National Chemical Corporation, opposes both initiatives, saying a ban would reduce agricultural yields by up to 40%."The consequences of not using them are clear: fewer regional products, higher prices, and more imports. This is not in the interest of consumers, nor is it in the interest of the environment," a Syngenta spokesman said.Life under siegeThe clean water initiative also wants farmers to stop using the imported animal feed, to restrict the numbers of cows, pigs and chickens in Switzerland along with the manure they produce that can pollute drinking water."People have been sold a romantic image of farming in Switzerland, which is far removed from reality," said Pascal Scheiwiller, a backer of the clean water campaign, which estimates 1 million Swiss people drink contaminated water.The Swiss Farmers Union said many of its members feel their way of life is under siege."A lot of people in cities think if they have two tomatoes growing on the balcony of their apartment they understand farming," said Martin Haab, president of the Zurich Farmers Association."I look back 200 years ago when we couldn't protect our plants and animals, and we had hunger in Switzerland and all over Europe," said Haab.Martin's son Dominic, who runs a dairy farm outside Zurich, said the consequences for the rural economy would be brutal, with local businesses also being hit by a fall in animal numbers to comply with the fodder restrictions.Winemaker Lenz, however, said to continue using pesticides was "sheer lunacy", especially when it was possible to use methods such as growing fruit with thicker skins to make them fungus resistant."With a 'Yes' vote on both initiatives, we will finally move from the chemical age back to the organic age," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/switzerland-could-become-first-european-nation-to-ban-artificial-pesticides-referendum-on-june-13-101623047791685.html
07-06-2021||World||Dating apps to feature Covid vaccine stickers in the UK||The dating apps in the United Kingdom, in partnership with the government, have launched a novel campaign to support the ongoing vaccination drive. These apps will offer their users special stickers, badges and bonuses to show if they have been vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Tinder, Bumble and Hinge are some of the apps which are working together with the government, the Department of Health said on Sunday.This comes as the UK rollout this week reaches the under-30s, as Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed on Sunday.The United States launched a similar initiative in May, linking up with apps including Tinder, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish.The apps are also advertising the British government's "Every vaccination gives us hope" campaign.The Department of Health even suggested that users could boost their romantic chances by telling potential dates they are vaccinated.Meanwhile, the UK's department of health informed on Twitter that 67,994,584 Covid-19 vaccine doses have been given in the country till June 6. "A brilliant team focused on protecting the Nation @NHSuk When you get the txt get the jab," vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said on Twitter.The unique tie-up between the UK government and dating apps comes after a YouGov poll in May found that 28 per cent of adults would not date someone who was unvaccinated and 31 per cent would prefer not to.However, despite turning to dating sites for help, the UK government has not formally given the green light to casual dating during the pandemic.British health minister Matt Hancock said on Sunday that the country's swift vaccine rollout had weakened, but not broken, the link between the virus, hospitalisation and death. Britain's overall death toll from the pandemic stands at 127,836 and is the sixth-highest in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data.Britain on Sunday reported 5,341 new cases of Covid-19, up 68 per cent from a week ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dating-apps-to-feature-covid-vaccine-stickers-in-the-uk-101623046285633.html
07-06-2021||World||Kamala Harris to target corruption, immigration on trip to Latin America||With Kamala Harris visiting Guatemala and Mexico on her first foreign trip as vice president, the Biden administration is expected to announce new measures to fight smuggling and trafficking, and hopes to announce additional anti-corruption efforts as well on Monday, a senior administration official said.The official, who briefed reporters traveling with Harris on Sunday, spoke on condition of anonymity to preview announcements before they have been made public. No further details were provided.Also Read: Kamala Harris’ two assignments that could make or break her presidential bidHarris has been tasked by President Joe Biden with addressing the root causes of the spike in migration to the U.S.-Mexico border, and her aides say corruption will be a central focus of her meetings with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on Monday and Mexico’s Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday.“Corruption really does sap the the wealth of any country, and in Central America is at a scale where it is a large percentage of GDP across the region,” said special envoy Ricardo Zuniga.“We see corruption as one of the most important root causes to be dealt with,” Zuniga added.The trip got off to a rocky start when Harris' plane returned to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland about 30 minutes after takeoff because of what her spokesperson said was a problem with the landing gear. She departed on another plane and landed late Sunday in in Guatemala City, where she was met by Foreign Minister Pedro Brolo.Also Read: Plane, with VP Kamala Harris onboard, forced to return due to 'technical issue'Harris is seeking to secure commitments from Guatemala and Mexico for greater cooperation on border security and economic investment, and aides say she will also discuss vaccine sharing during her meetings. But corruption in the region — a far more intractable challenge — will complicate her efforts.It’s already had a significant impact on her work in Central America. Harris has yet to engage substantively with the leaders of Honduras and El Salvador, who are both embroiled in corruption scandals.Giammattei has faced criticism over corruption within his own government. Zuniga acknowledged that the U.S. government faces a challenge in working with him but argued Harris was in the country in part to have a direct conversation with the president about this and other issues.“The best way to deal with these cases where you have a very complex relationship in a country like Guatemala is to talk clearly and plainly as partners, as countries that have to get along” he said.Harris has laid out an approach centered on creating better opportunities and living conditions in the region through humanitarian and economic aid. She announced plans to send $310 million to provide support for refugees and address food shortages, and recently secured commitments from a dozen companies and organizations to invest in the Northern Triangle countries to promote economic opportunity and job training.Washington won some goodwill through its vaccine diplomacy this past week. Giammattei and López Obrador both received calls from Harris on Thursday telling them the U.S. would be sending 500,000 doses and 1 million doses, respectively, of COVID-19 vaccine.While in Guatemala, Harris also plans to meet community leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs. In Mexico, she will speak with female entrepreneurs and hold a roundtable with labor workers.She’s underscored the need to address corruption in public remarks and events. In a May meeting with a number of leading voices on Guatemala's justice system, she noted her work as a prosecutor and said that “injustice is a root cause of migration.”“Part of giving people hope is having a very specific commitment to rooting out corruption in the region,” she said.Harris has also raised the issue during virtual meetings with the leaders of both countries, and aides say she will do it again during meetings on her trip. During their past conversations, they have discussed areas of mutual interest — improving port security, fighting smuggling networks, going after corrupt actors — and the goal of this trip is to turn that talk into action, aides say.While the vice president will make announcements concerning new efforts at cooperation and new programs, she’s not expected to announce any new aid during her trip.While in Latin America, Harris will also have to navigate the politics of immigration. Congressional Republicans have criticized both Biden and Harris for deciding not to visit the border, and contend the administration is ignoring what they say is a crisis there. April was the second-busiest month on record for unaccompanied children encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border, following March’s all-time high. The Border Patrol’s total encounters in April were up 3% from March, marking the highest level since April 2000.Conservatives will be watching Harris closely for any missteps, hoping to drag her into further controversy on an issue that they see as a political winner.In her efforts to win commitments on corruption from the region's leaders, Harris can point to a number of moves by the Biden administration last week.Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized the problem during his own recent trip to Central America. The White House issued a memo elevating foreign corruption to a major national security issue, and directed all federal agencies to prioritize it and modernize their foreign corruption-fighting tools.Eric Olson, director of policy at the Seattle International Foundation, which works to promote good governance in Central America, said that addressing corruption will take particular diplomatic skill. Harris will need to hold the leaders of Guatemala and Mexico accountable while also deepening trust and cooperation with the two nations.“The challenge that she faces is how to, on the one hand, have a conversation, keep the door open — while not seeming to ignore the obvious elephant in the room, which is this incredible penetration of the state by corrupt actors,” he said.In Mexico, López Obrador continues to face a complicated security situation in many parts of the country. Nearly three-dozen candidates or pre-candidates were killed before this weekend’s midterm elections as drug cartels sought to protect their interests. The government’s inability to provide security in parts of the country is of interest to the U.S. in an immigration context, both for the people who are displaced by violence and the impact it has on a severely weakened economy trying reemerge from the pandemic.The number of Mexicans encountered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection rose steadily from December through April. Mexico remains a key U.S. ally in trying to slow immigration, not only of its own citizens, but those crossing its territory. Successive U.S. administrations have effectively tried to push their immigration enforcement goals south to Mexico and Guatemala.Nongovernmental organizations placed Guatemala’s widespread corruption at the top of their list of concerns before Harris’ visit.Last month, two lawyers who are outspoken critics of Giammattei's administration were arrested on what they say were trumped-up charges aimed at silencing them.The selection of judges for Guatemala’s Constitutional Court, its highest, was mired in influence peddling and alleged corruption. Giammattei picked his chief of staff to fill one of the five vacancies. When Gloria Porras, a respected force against corruption, was elected to a second term, the congress controlled by Giammattei’s party refused to seat her.Harris’ visit comes with high expectations, but experts say clear progress on corruption may be elusive.“These are societies built on corruption,” said Olson. “You’re not gonna have an impact in six months.”___Sherman reported from Mexico City.

07-06-2021||World||World Food Safety Day on June 7: WHO underlines value of food security in Covid-hit era||June 7 each year is marked globally by the 'World Food Safety Day' as per the World Health Organization (WHO), observed annually to raise awareness about foodborne risks and help prevent, detect, and manage untoward diseases, in essence contributing to sustainable human development through proper food security. This year, i.e. on June 7, 2021, the global food safety watchdogs are especially highlighting the risks associated with harmful eating practices, in the backdrop of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, which is believed to have begun spreading among humans two years ago from a 'wet market' in China's Wuhan.The need to establish a world food safety day was discussed in several sessions of the United Nations general assembly (UNGA) from 2016 onwards. A resolution was adopted on December 20, 2018, by the assembly to mark June 7 as the day to "celebrate the myriad benefits of safe food". Through World Food Safety Day, WHO works to mainstream food safety in the public agenda and reduce the burden of foodborne diseases globally. "Food safety is everyone's business," according to the public health agency.The World Health Assembly (WHA) passed a resolution on August 3, 2020, to declare June 7 - the World Food Safety Day - as an important day to raise awareness at all levels about the importance of food safety, and for promoting and facilitating actions to prevent foodborne diseases at local, national, regional and global levels; to strengthen global efforts for food safety to reduce the burden of foodborne diseases.On World Food Safety Day this year, the theme is 'Safe food today for a healthy tomorrow'. With this, WHO intends to stress the fact that the production and consumption of safe food have immediate and long-term benefits for people, the planet, and the economy. "Recognizing the systemic connections between the health of people, animals, plants, the environment, and the economy will help us meet the needs of the future," WHO stated.Since foodborne diseases are usually invisible to the eye and infectious or toxic in nature, Food safety has a critical role in assuring that food stays safe at every stage of the food chain - from production to harvest, processing, storage, distribution, all the way to preparation and consumption. A key precaution is preventing contamination through bacteria, viruses, parasites, or chemical substances."Food safety is a shared responsibility between governments, producers, and consumers. Everyone has a role to play from farm to table to ensure the food we consume is safe and healthy," read an event update on the WHO website.On World Food Safety Day, it must be mentioned that while there is currently no evidence that suggests that the transmission of Covid-19 is associated with food, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that proper food safety etiquette is followed in general. This includes washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds before preparing or eating food, and keep strict checks on the possibility of contamination of food products during storage or packaging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-food-safety-day-on-june-7-who-underlines-value-of-food-security-in-covid-hit-era-101623033898648.html

Officers can be seen grabbing and pushing people as an order to disperse is announced.A police spokesperson said eight officers suffered minor injuries while trying to clear the park. Most of the 23 people arrested were charged with disorderly conduct and given desk appearance tickets, the spokesperson said.The park in the heart of Greenwich Village has long been a scene of protests and vigils and is a popular gathering place for young people, including students from nearby New York University.The 10 pm curfew was first instituted during Memorial Day weekend after some neighborhood residents complained of late-night noise and drug use. The move was criticized Sunday by multiple Democratic mayoral candidates on social media.A spokesperson for the city Parks Department said Washington Square Park will close at 10 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights until further notice. The park is open until midnight Monday through Thursday.“Enforced closures are focused on addressing large after hours gatherings, amplified sound, excessive trashing of the park and other conditions on weekends,” the spokesperson, Crystal Howard, said in an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-say-23-arrested-during-clashes-over-nyc-park-curfew-101623033094883.html
07-06-2021||World||Nigeria's Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau 'kills himself': ISWAP||The Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) militant group said in an audio recording heard by Reuters on Sunday that Abubakar Shekau, leader of rival Nigerian militant Islamist group Boko Haram, was dead.Shekau died around May 18 after detonating an explosive device when he was pursued by ISWAP fighters following a battle, a person purporting to be ISWAP leader Abu Musab al-Barnawi said on the audio recording."Abubakar Shekau, God has judged him by sending him to heaven," he can be heard saying.Two people familiar with al-Barnawi told Reuters the voice on the recording was that of the ISWAP leader.A Nigerian intelligence report shared by a government official and Boko Haram researchers have also said Shekau is dead.Last month, Nigeria's military said it was investigating Shekau's alleged death, also reported in Nigerian and foreign news outlets. The audio statement, first obtained by local media https://humangle.ng/iswap-confirms-shekaus-death-says-its-fighters-were-following-isis-orders, is ISWAP's first confirmation that its arch rival in the Lake Chad region has been killed.Islamic State "are consolidating the whole area, the Lake Chad region and (Shekau's stronghold)," said Bulama Bukarti, an analyst specialising in Boko Haram at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change."ISWAP had framed Shekau as the problem and he was the only person they wanted to remove," Bukarti said of Islamic State's attempt to lure Boko Haram commanders and fighters to their side.Shekau's death could lead to the end of a violent rivalry between the two groups, enabling Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) to absorb Boko Haram fighters and consolidate its hold on territory in northeastern Nigeria, political analysts said.That would allow ISWAP to focus its attention on the government and military, whose war efforts are languishing.SHEKAU 'KILLED HIMSELF INSTANTLY'Boko Haram's leader was reported to have been killed on several occasions over the last 12 years, including in announcements by the military, only to later appear in a video post.In the audio recording, the man identified as al-Barnawi said his fighters had sought out the warlord on the orders of the Islamic State leadership, and battled Boko Haram insurgents until Shekau fled.ISWAP chased him down and offered him the chance to repent and join them, he said."Shekau preferred to be humiliated in the afterlife than getting humiliated on earth, and he killed himself instantly by detonating an explosive," he said.Boko Haram grabbed headlines worldwide with its 2014 kidnapping of more than 270 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok, sparking a global campaign for their return dubbed #BringBackOurGirls, backed by the likes of Michelle Obama.Around 100 of the Chibok Girls are still missing, and some are thought to have died in captivity.Shekau led the transformation of Boko Haram from an underground Islamic sect in 2009 to a full-fledged insurgency, killing, kidnapping and looting its way across northeast Nigeria.The group has killed more than 30,000 people, forced around 2 million people to flee their homes and spawned one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.ISWAP was previously part of Boko Haram before its split five years ago, pledging allegiance to Islamic State. The schism was caused by religious ideological disagreements over the killing of civilians by Boko Haram, to which ISWAP objected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigerias-boko-haram-leader-abubakar-shekau-kills-himself-iswap-101623030208687.html

07-06-2021||World||Trump back on stage, calls for China to pay $10tn reparations||Former US president Donald Trump has returned to public limelight with a speech in North Carolina in which he exhorted Republicans to gear up for the 2022 midterm elections, repeated allegations over his election loss, attacked top epidemiologist Anthony Fauci, and called for China to pay $10 trillion in “reparations” for the Covid-19 pandemic.Trump spoke at a convention of North Carolina Republicans, which his advisers have said will be the first of more such events. “The survival of America depends on our ability to elect Republicans at every level starting with the midterms next year,” Trump said in a characteristically rambling speech that lasted nearly 90 minutes.Republicans are hoping to win the House of Representatives in the 2022 midterm elections, closing and overtaking their eight-seat deficit in the 435-member chamber (they trail 211 to 219 Democrats, with five vacancies), and the 100-member senate, which they split evenly with Democrats. Midterms have tended to favour the party not holding the White House.Trump has managed to keep a tight grip on the Republican Party despite the initial outrage felt among many over his incitement of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, which houses the two chambers of US congress, as his party’s base, which plays a key role in the party primaries, remains largely loyal to him.“We are going to have a tremendous 2022 like we did frankly in 2020, more votes than any sitting president in the history of the US. We had a great election. Bad things happened, but we had a great election,” Trump said, repeating claims of election fraud that were dismissed by more than 60 times by courts and the authorities.Since leaving office, Trump has kept a relatively lower profile. Deprived of social media accounts — Twitter has banned him permanently and Facebook and Instagram have suspended him until January 2023 — communicating largely through short statements, some interviews and advisers.He has teased a run for the White House in 2024 but has not committed himself to it yet. “We’re gonna take back the Senate, take back the House, we’re gonna take back the White House, and sooner than you think,” he said in a short fundraising video released ahead of the North Carolina speech.The former president went on to attack the Biden administration in his speech. “As we gather tonight, our country is being destroyed before our very own eyes. Crime is exploding, police departments are being ripped apart and defunded,” he said. He called the surge of immigrants at the border the start of the “Biden disasters”, criticised the president for rejoining the Paris climate accord and for his proposal to raise corporate tax.“Drugs are pouring in, gas prices are soaring, our industries are being pillaged by foreign cyberattacks,” he went on to say. “That’s a lack of respect for our country and our leaders.” Trump was referring to recent cyber-hacking of US companies. Experts pointed out that the most sweeping and egregious of them -- the SolarWinds attack -- took place on his watch.The former president also attacked Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, saying he is “not a great doctor, but a hell of a promoter”. Trump clashed with Fauci even while in office, which turned the epidemiologist into a target for the then president’s supporters.“Fauci said at the beginning, ‘no masks.’ Remember that? Then he became a radical masker. Get three, four. Get a pair of goggles, ideally. Wear them for another five or six years,” Trump said to laughter.The former president also doubled down on China over the Covid-19 pandemic, even as his administration was accused of poor handling of the public health crisis. “The time has come for America and the world to demand reparations and accountability from the Communist Party of China. We should all declare with one unified voice that China must pay -- they must pay,” he said, going on to suggest the amount be around $10 trillion, with extra tariff.Turning to his own legal troubles, he dismissed them as an extension of the “five-year witch-hunt” he said he had faced from the time he announced his candidature for the White House. He called the Manhattan district attorney’s case “the ultimate fishing expedition”. “It’s been a five-year witch hunt, hoax after hoax,” he added. “They’ll never stop until November of 2024.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-back-on-stage-calls-for-china-to-pay-10tn-reparations-101623014838178.html
07-06-2021||World||Mehul Choksi’s identity was known 3 days later; charged after 4 days: Dominica Police||The Dominica police has claimed in the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (ECSC) that fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi was found seated in suspicious condition on the bayside near the Jetty at Toucarie Bay around 11.30pm on May 24.However, the police charged him with “illegal entry” offence around 9pm on May 28, according to details of Dominica’s police affidavits exclusively accessed by HT.The affidavits filed by Dominica police have several new revelations as well as multiple contradictions. For example, one of the affidavits filed by a Superintendent of Police of Dominica says that after Choksi was found on May 24 and taken to the police station in Roseau, he was given a mattress and clothing at his request, a courtesy usually not extended to other normal prisoners in Dominica.It, however, doesn’t explain why this courtesy was extended to Choksi by the Dominica police.A Sergeant of Police deployed with Border Control in Dominica, who found Choksi at Toucarie Bay around 11:30pm on May 24 (a day after he went missing from Antigua), has said in his affidavit that the individual (Choksi) had a shopping bag in his hand. He stated his name as Choksi from Antigua and said that he was brought to Dominica on a boat, according to the Sergeant.After Choksi could not produce documentation regarding his visit to the country, the cops informed him that he was being arrested on the suspicion of entering Dominica at a place not appointed as an approved point of entry, according to this officer’s affidavit in the court.However, this officer’s added, even though Choksi was brought to the police station in Roseau on May 25 and a report of ‘illegal entry’ was made the same day, he was formally charged for the offence around 9pm on May 28.Choksi’s lawyers have argued last week in the ECSC that he was kept under illegal detention for almost 96 hours and was not produced within 72 hours in the court, according to the local law there. The Dominica police has denied these charges in its affidavits.All the officers of Dominica, in their affidavits, have claimed that Choksi repeatedly said he was abducted and brought to Dominica. However, they have claimed there were no signs that he was kidnapped and they didn’t see any boat.Interestingly, the Dominica police has claimed that it was on May 27 (Thursday), the department obtained his drivers’ licence which proved he was born in India and his name was Mehul Choksi, according to the details of affidavit filed by the Sergeant.However, an Inspector of Police of Dominica, in his affidavit, has claimed that identity of Choksi remained a matter of grave concern until May 28 (Friday) as he had no form of identification to ascertain his identity, age, place of residence or place of birth.At the same time, the Dominica police has stated in its affidavits that attorney-at-law Cara Shillingford (one of the lawyers of Choksi) had contacted them on May 26 to have access to Choksi.The Dominica police has said they didn’t allow Choksi any legal access as he refused to meet any legal representatives and insisted on going back to Antigua.The island’s police has further said they spent US$400 to buy new clothes for Choksi on May 26 and he had been provided access to four lawyers by May 27.It has also claimed that Choksi had refused medical attention after his capture even though he had injuries on his body.While in custody, Choksi was kept away from all the persons as extreme precaution as identity of kidnappers or his associates was not disclosed by him, the affidavit by Border Patrol officer states.While the Dominican police’s affidavits do not yet advocate repatriating Choksi back to India, they claim that investigation is being carried out in respect with his escape from India; the manner in which he fled Antigua after proceedings of revocation of his citizenship and extradition were filed there; and his motive behind coming to Dominica.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mehul-choksi-s-identity-was-known-3-days-later-charged-after-4-days-dominica-police-101623008107379.html

However, he pointed out that a majority of those in hospital as a result of the Delta variant haven’t had a vaccine at all and only a “small minority” have had both doses.Asked if there could be a delay to the June 21 timeline for an end to all lockdown restrictions in the UK, Hancock said the government is “absolutely open” to a delay if it needs to happen.US senators promise to give vaccines to TaiwanThe US will give Taiwan 750,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine, part of President Joe Biden’s move to share tens of millions of jabs globally, three American senators said on Sunday, after the self-ruled island complained that China is hindering its efforts to secure vaccines as it battles an outbreak. Tammy Duckworth, who made a three-hour stop in Taiwan with Christopher Coons and Dan Sullivan, said their visit underscores US support for the democratic island.Study: HIV+ woman had Covid-19 for 216 daysA study has revealed that a 36-year-old woman in South Africa with advanced HIV had carried the coronavirus for 216 days.

The summit comes amid the biggest crisis in ties between the two countries in years, with tensions high over a number of issues.In an op-ed for The Washington Post published on Saturday, Biden promised to shore up Washington’s “democratic alliances” in the face of multiple crises and mounting threats from Moscow and Beijing.“We are standing united to address Russia’s challenges to European security... and there will be no doubt about the resolve of the United States to defend our democratic values, which we cannot separate from our interests,” he wrote.‘US can’t get away by threatening others’Putin earlier said the US was wrong to think that it is “powerful enough” to get away with threatening other countries, a mistake, he explained, that led to the downfall of the former Soviet Union.Putin made the sharp comments during a press briefing late on Friday as he spoke about US sanctions against Moscow, according to Russia’s news agency TASS.In April, the US imposed a broad array of sanctions on Russia, including curbs to its sovereign debt market. “We hear threats from the Congress, from other sources. It is all done within the context of the US domestic political process.”Putin said such behaviour reminded him of the Soviet Union. “The problem with empires is that they think they are powerful enough to make some mistakes.“We will buy these [people], bully them, make a deal with them, give necklaces to them, threaten them with battleships. And this will solve all the problems. But problems accumulate.

07-06-2021||India||SC panel finalises draft rules for live-streaming trials||Courts across the country may soon open their doors to cameras. In a major step towards making courtrooms accessible to more people, the e-Committee of the Supreme Court has finalised draft rules for live-streaming and recording of court proceedings of the high courts, trial courts and tribunals, finally taking forward the promise of a three-year-old judgment.The committee, headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, has written a letter to chief justices of all 24 high courts in the country, seeking inputs and suggestions on the draft rules for live-streaming and recording of court proceedings by June 30.“The right of access to justice, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, encompasses the right to access live court proceedings. To imbue greater transparency, inclusivity and foster access to justice, the e-Committee has undertaken the project of live streaming of court proceedings on priority,” stated the letter.Live-streaming, added the letter, will enable access to live court proceedings, including on matters of public interest to citizens, journalists, civil society, academicians and law students on a real-time basis, something otherwise constrained by geographical, logistical or infrastructural issues.The e-Committee, which is working with the Department of Justice under the National Policy and Action Plan for implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian judiciary, has also invited suggestions and inputs from all stakeholders by June 30.The Supreme Court in 2018 held in a judgment (Swapnil Tripathi and Indira Jaisingh) that telecast of important cases to an audience outside the courtroom would usher in greater transparency and aid accountability, but little moved since. The finalisation of the draft rules is a leap towards letting lights and cameras inside the public institutions. Speaking to HT, justice Chandrachud said that the rules provide for a legal framework and a balanced regulatory structure for live-streaming and recording of court proceedings.“Going forward, infrastructural requirements such as cloud storage and adequate bandwidth will have to be met. The committee is working towards ensuring proper infrastructure so that high courts across the country have an efficient platform to stream the proceedings.”Justice Chandrachud added that the draft rules have been framed with a view to realise the vision of the 2018 judgment and to make certain the courts are open and accountable to the community. The draft rules place a presumption in favour of broadcasting of court proceedings except in a defined range of circumstances. Cases relating to matrimony, sexual offences, gender violence, recording of evidence and those that may provoke enmity among communities have been kept out of the ambit of live-streaming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-panel-finalises-draft-rules-for-live-streaming-trials-101623089345635.html

If we don’t tackle fossil fuel burning, the problem is not going to go away,” Ralph Keeling, a geochemist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, was quoted in the report as saying.Keeling said the world will have to undertake emissions cuts that are “much larger and sustained” than anything that happened during the pandemic, according to the Post.The report cited conclusions drawn by scientists from Scripps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), who said that levels of CO2 peaked in May 2021, reaching a monthly average of nearly 419 parts per million.It represents an increase from the May 2020 mean of 417 parts per million, the report says, and it also marked the highest level since measurements began 63 years ago at the NOAA observatory in Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Twice in 2021, daily levels exceeded 420 parts per million.Pieter Tans, a senior scientist with NOAA’s Global Monitoring Laboratory, was quoted as saying that “it shows we are still fully on the wrong track”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/carbon-dioxide-levels-in-the-air-hit-a-historic-high-despite-covid-pandemic-101623088912316.html
07-06-2021||India||‘Change must take place’: HC bans attempts to ‘cure’ gender identity||Chennai/New Delhi: The Madras high court on Monday banned any attempts to “cure” the gender identity or sexual orientation of people as part of a sweeping set of orders to sensitise state agencies and the central government and protect the rights of LGBTQIA+ communities. The order came on a petition by two women who approached the court to seek protection from their families opposing their relationship. The court took the opportunity to issue orders to police, prison, health, judicial and education authorities with justice N. Anand Venkatesh undergoing counselling to better acquaint himself with LGBTQIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and asexual) issues. “I strongly feel that the change must take place at a societal level and when it is complemented by a law there will be a remarkable change in the outlook of the society by recognising same-sex relationships,” said the judge in the 107-page order. The order came roughly three years after the Supreme Court decriminalised adult consensual same-sex relationships and seven years after it affirmed the rights of transgender people. Currently, the Delhi and Kerala high courts are hearing petitions to legalise same-sex marriage.The petitioners, aged 20 and 22, fled their parents’ homes in Madurai district after falling in love. Their parents filed missing persons’ complaints and two First Information Reports (FIRs) were registered against the women, following which the police interrogated them at their place of residence. This prompted the women to move the court seeking protection from harassment by their parents and the police. In March, the court ordered police protection for them, and further asked that the women and their parents undergo counselling sessions under the guidance of Vidya Dinakaran, a Chennai-based psychotherapist. In the order, the judge mentioned that he too voluntarily sought an “out of the box exercise” involving psycho-educative sessions with Dinakaran and other members of the LGBTQIA+ community to break “preconceived notions” because this case gave the court an opportunity and responsibility to weigh in on inclusiveness, discrimination, morality and traditions. On May 1, justice Venkatesh had said he was “not fully woke” on same-sex relationships. Dinakaran found that while the petitioners were very clear about their decision, the parents felt “great amount of shame, fear, and social disdain upon them because of their daughter’s homosexual relationship,” Monday’s order stated.“I have no hesitation in accepting that I too belong to the majority of commoners who are yet to comprehend homosexuality completely. Ignorance is no justification for normalizing any form of discrimination,” he said.“The judgment is a turning point in our lives…we finally feel safe,” said the 22-year-old petitioner, who declined to be named over safety concerns. “The highlight of the judgement is the openness and transparency. It reinforces the fact that discriminatory practices of any nature can no longer hide under the cover of misunderstanding or ignorance. Given that destigmatisation has only begun, many queer people have started stepping out of their families in search of support and that is where the interim guidelines play an enormous role, addressing all the stakeholders in creating an inclusive and safe environment,” Dinakaran said.The court’s interim directions included asking police to close complaints without harassing trans persons, judicial authorities to provide free legal aid, health professionals to help the community and educational institutions to appoint queer counsellors and make easy procedures to change names and genders. It further asked state agencies including the state’s school education and law departments as well as central agencies such as the Department of Higher Education, University Grants Commission and Union ministries of health and family welfare and women and child development to report to it by August 31 on steps taken to sensitise society and institute measures, including gender-neutral restrooms, change in curricula, awareness campaigns and removing prejudices.The court also ordered mental health camps and awareness programmes to ensure police, judiciary, educational institutions, parents and health workers are sensitised. Banning conversion therapy – a discredited practice claiming to “cure” homosexual and transgender people -- the court ordered that anyone attempting such dubious practices could get their medical licence suspended. “I think we have turned a corner in the fight for equal rights. This judgment will be cited in the future to affirm the rights of the community,” said Manuraj S, lawyer for the two petitioners. “The criminal justice system is regularly deployed against queer couples who have to deal with deep rooted prejudice on an everyday basis. For the scores of individuals being investigated by the police at the behest of their families this is a major breakthrough,” said Mihir Samson, a Delhi-based advocate who has also represented queer couples facing familial violence.The court further asked the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment to publish a list of non governmental organisations (NGOs) that work with the community to ensure counselling, monetary support, legal assistance or coordination with law enforcement agencies about offences committed against any community member. “LGBTQIA+ persons, like cis persons, are entitled to their privacy and have a right to lead a dignified existence, which includes their choice of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender presentation, gender expression and choice of partner thereof,” the court said.The judge also spoke to community activists “to understand ground realities, emotions, social discrimination and exclusion faced by the community”.“As LGBTQIA+ persons, we are used to receiving absolute ignorance and a refusal to learn, especially by the pillars of democracy. It is hard to come across individuals as humble as justice Venkatesh, a gentleman willing to let go of every preconceived notion and wipe his slate clean. The verdict paves the way to secure the rights of LGBTQIA+ persons,” said doctor Trinetra Haldar Gummaraju, who interacted with the judge. The order also referred to two landmark judgments by the Supreme Court that pertained to the rights of the LGBTQIA community. In 2014, the Nalsa versus Union of India judgment recognised the legality of self identified gender of transpersons. In 2018, a Constitution bench held in Navtej Johar versus Union of India that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised homosexuality, did not apply to consenting adults.(with inputs by Dhamini Ratnam)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/change-must-take-place-hc-bans-attempts-to-cure-gender-identity-101623088776461.html
07-06-2021||India||Navy arsenal set to get boost with 3 US copters||The Indian Navy is ready to take a step towards modernising its ageing helicopter fleet as the United States is set to hand over three MH-60R helicopters to it in their country, where Indian crews are stationed for training on the new platform, by the year-end, people familiar with the developments said on Monday.Two of the multi-role helicopters (MRHs) will be delivered to the navy next month, with the third delivery planned around the year-end, said one of the officials cited above. The Indian crews, including around 15 officers, began their training at Pensacola in Florida on Monday.Last year, India ordered 24 Lockheed Martin-Sikorsky MH-60R helicopters from the US to strengthen the navy’s anti-submarine/anti-surface warfare and surveillance capabilities. The government-to-government contract for the helicopters is worth around ₹17,500 crore.The navy had first moved a case to buy multi-role helicopters, a critical operational necessity, more than 15 years ago.But the MRHs were ordered only last year as a replacement for the Sea King 42/42A fleet, which went out of service nearly two decades ago. The MRH is expected to be the mainstay of the navy’s anti-submarine/anti-ship warfare and airborne early-warning capabilities in the coming years.“The procurement is progressing well. The first batch of three choppers is likely to arrive in India in May-June 2022. The remaining 21 helicopters are likely to be delivered over the next three years (by 2024),” said a second official.Armed with AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, MK 54 torpedoes and advanced precision weapons, the twin-engine helicopters can operate from frigates, destroyers and aircraft carriers.Ship-borne multi-role helicopters have been an essential force multiplier for any navy since the 1960s, maritime affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd) said. “I recall the great combat power the earlier helicopters like the Sea King 42 and Kamov variants brought to the fleet in the late 1980s. The induction of the new MRH is a qualitative relief, but quantitative gaps also need addressing,” he said.The navy is also pursuing a plan to build 111 naval utility helicopters (NUH) in India under the strategic partnership (SP) model to replace its outdated fleet of French-designed Chetak choppers. The defence acquisition council (DAC), India’s apex procurement body, cleared the ₹21,738-crore NUH project under the SP model in August 2018, but there has been no forward movement during the last three years.The SP model envisages indigenous manufacturing of major defence platforms by an Indian strategic partner who will collaborate with a foreign original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to set up production facilities in the country.Last week, the defence ministry cleared a project, P-75I, worth ₹43,000 crore for building six advanced submarines in the country under the SP model to bolster the Indian Navy’s underwater force levels and counter the rapid expansion of China’s submarine fleet.The Indian strategic partners cleared to collaborate with the foreign OEMs for P-75I are Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited and L&T. The foreign yards they can team up with for the project are the French Naval Group, German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, Russia’s Rubin Design Bureau, Spain’s Navantia and South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-arsenal-set-to-get-boost-with-3-us-copters-101623088716497.html

Foreign countries would conclude vaccination drives while ours would wait for it to start,” he said“Be it polio, smallpox, or hepatitis-B, the citizens have waited for these vaccines for years,” he added.He further stated that during his first tenure the vaccination coverage across the country was only around 60%, a fact that worried the then newly formed government since by that estimate it would have taken the nation 40 years to vaccinate all eligible citizens.“When we were given an opportunity to serve in 2014 the vaccination coverage across India was only around 60%, a very worrying fact. The pace at which vaccination was being carried out it would have taken the country almost 40 years to achieve 100% vaccination,” he said.“To solve this issue, we launched Mission Indradhanush, to vaccinate on war footing. Anyone who needed a vaccine would be vaccinated. We worked in mission mode and within 5-6 years vaccination coverage went from 60 to 90, we increased the speed and the extent of vaccination,” he added, claiming Mission Indradhanush was launched to include the poor and their children in their purview, something which has never been done before.Also Read: Centre to shoulder remaining 25% of vaccine work done by states, says PM Modi“To save kids from lethal diseases we made them part of the drive, we were worried about the poor, the children and the children of the poor who had never been vaccinated,” he added.The Prime Minister also assured citizens of increasing vaccination supply in the coming months“Vaccine supply will be increasing in the coming days.

07-06-2021||India||Walk to remember: Tiger covers 100km in 4 months to reach Sundarbans in Bangladesh from Indian forest||A tiger which had been radio-collared in India was found to have travelled around 100km to reach Sundarbans in Bangladesh over a period of four months, West Bengal’s chief wildlife warden VK Yadav was quoted as saying.The male tiger was radio-collared in December 2020 to enable foresters to track his movement patterns near human beings. He was captured from Harinbhanga forest just opposite the Harikhali camp under Bashirhat range in Bengal and later released with the satellite collar on December 27, reports said.His long and arduous journey to Bangladesh involved several hurdles including some rivers wider than a kilometre. Braving all odds, the tiger moved across three islands in the span of four months, Yadav said, adding that he did not venture near human habitats.“After initial movements for a few days on the Indian side, it started venturing into the Talpatti island in Bangladesh Sunderbans and crossed rivers such as Choto, Harikhali, Boro Harikhali and even the Raimangal,” Yadav said. The tiger could originally have come from Bangladesh before foresters captured him for radio-collaring, Yadav added.The last recorded location of the tiger was at Talpatti island in Bangladesh on May 11, according to reports. Throwing light on the possible reasons why there was no update on the tiger after May 11, Yadav said the collar may have slipped off its neck."The gadget also had a mortality sensor, which gives signals in case of the tiger's death. But that didn't happen…. In all probability, the collar has slipped off its neck. In the Sundarbans, salinity in the water can also damage radio collars," he said.This was not the first time that a tiger from India has strolled to Bangladesh. In January 2017, a female tiger who was also radio-collared, travelled a 100km distance to reach the Bay of Bengal’s tip. Five other tigers were also radio-collared, out of which one travelled into Bangladesh’s Talpatti island, Dhaka Tribune reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/walk-to-remember-tiger-covers-100km-in-4-months-to-reach-sundarbans-in-bangladesh-from-indian-forest-101623084098896.html

I want to know if India got this recognition after Modi Ji became PM,”“I request Modi Ji -- please work but it is right to go into the past on every topic and seek credit,” he added.Chowdhury’s question comes close on the heels of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation, where he reversed the Centre’s current vaccination policy, and claimed that when he came to power in 2014, around 60% of the population was vaccinated, which was increased to almost 90% during his tenure.The Prime Minister also talked at length about Mission Indradhanush, his government’s flagship immunisation scheme, crediting it with increasing the reach and extent of the country’s immunisation drive. He also claimed that in the last 50-60 years India was entirely dependent on foreign vaccine imports.“To solve this issue (of 60% vaccination) we launched Mission Indradhanush, to vaccinate on war footing. Anyone who needed a vaccine would be vaccinated. We worked in mission mode and within 5-6 years vaccination coverage went from 60 to 90, we increased the speed and the extent of vaccination,” the Prime Minister said.Chowdhury further stated that the government took this decision due to “pressure from the judiciary” and after Congress chief Sonia Gandhi started a campaign demanding free vaccination for all, adding that it is better late than never.“The Government is already late and took this decision under pressure from the judiciary. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had started a campaign for free vaccines. However, it is better late than never,” he said.PM Modi announced a shift in Centre’s previous vaccine policy, in which states were made responsible for procuring 25% of the required vaccine doses from manufacturers.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi asked on Monday as the opposition party demanded universal free vaccination against Covid-19, after the prime minister announced that his government will provide free jabs to states for inoculation of all above the age of 18.The Congress also sought to credit the Supreme Court for the change in the Centre's vaccination policy and said the announcement came after the apex court reprimanded it and sought an affidavit on the inoculation drive.In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Centre has decided to buy 75 per cent of jabs from vaccine makers, including 25 per cent of the state quota, and give it for free to state governments, while private sector hospitals can continue to procure the remaining 25 per cent.After PM Modi's address, Gandhi tweeted, "One simple question - If vaccines are free for all, why should private hospitals charge for them." He used #FreeVaccineForAll hashtag with his tweet.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, "The prime minister is guilty of endangering the lives of Indians by repeatedly changing the (vaccination) policy and instead of accusing the states, he should be tendering an apology for endangering people's lives."Surjewala reiterated the demand for universal free vaccination and said the government should also transfer ₹6,000 into bank accounts of the poor to help them cope with the impact of the pandemic and the resultant lockdown.He alleged that the government has brought these changes in its vaccination policy after it was reprimanded by the Supreme Court.Some states had gone to the apex court against the Centre's vaccination policy alleging that it is not uniform.Surjewala said the Modi government has changed its vaccine policy thrice on January 16, May 1 and now today.Accusing the prime minister of endangering the lives of indians, he asked if he would take responsibility."Why burden the middle class and the salaried people with payments in private hospitals," he asked."Why not transfer ₹6000 in the accounts of every poor considering there have been two crore job losses in the second wave of coronavirus," he asked.Surjewala claimed that at the current vaccination rate with the average between January 16 and June 7 being only 15.46 lakh jabs per day, it will take 1,091 days, or till May 2024, to inoculate all."Then, how will you vaccinate 100 crore people by December 2021, as promised," he asked, alleging that only 4.61 crore have been fully vaccinated in last six months, which is 3.28 per cent of the population.The Congress has been demanding free vaccination for all and has urged the Centre to procure the jabs and provide them to states.The Congress on its official Twitter handle said, "Modi ji - stop with the tokenism, it will not heal the deep wounds you've inflicted on our nation. Instead - apologise and not give lectures".Congress leader and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said, "Thank PM Narendra Modi Ji for acceding to our request of central procurement and distribution of vaccine for all age-groups. I had written twice to Narendra Modi Ji on this issue and to (Health Minister) Harsh Vardhan Ji suggesting this as the only feasible solution to Covid Vaccine crisis."Another Congress Chief Minister, Ashok Gehlot of Rajasthan, said PM Modi should inform which states had demanded that vaccines should be procured and provided for 18-44 years age group."To my knowledge, no state had made such a demand and it seems that the prime minister has been misinformed," he said on Twitter.Gehlot also said that many states, including Rajasthan, had moved the Supreme Court against the Centre's vaccination policy and the result of which is that the prime minister had to change it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-should-private-hospitals-charge-for-them-rahul-gandhi-asks-on-free-covid-19-vaccine-to-adults-101623081562552.html

The facility is available till August 31 this yearThese categories will also be allowed to take the second dose of Covishield before the mandated minimum interval of 84 days from the date of first dose. However, the second dose will only be given 28 days after taking the first dose. CoWin will soon provide the facility of administering the second dose in such cases.“With the receipt of several representations for allowing administration of dose of Covishield for such persons who have only taken first dose of Covishield and are seeking to undertake international travel for educational purposes or employment opportunities or for participation in India’s Contingent for Tokyo Olympic games, but whose planned travel dates fall prior to completion of the currently mandated minimum interval of 84 days from the date of first dose, the issue was discussed in Empowered Group 5 (EG-5) and appropriate recommendations have been received in this context,” the ministry said in a press release.States and Union territories (UTs) have been asked to designate a competent authority in each district for giving permission to administer the second dose of Covishield. The authority will check whether a period of 28 days has elapsed after the date of the first dose and will also check the genuineness of the purpose of travel.People travelling abroad for education will have to present documents related to admission offers or associated formal communications. Here, the competent authority of a state and UT will also check whether people are already studying in a foreign institute and have to go back to continue their education.Those going for work will have to present their interview calls for the job or offer letters for taking up the employment. On the other hand, athletes, sportspersons and accompanying staff of the Indian contingent attending Tokyo Olympics will have to present documents related to the nomination to participate in the sporting event.“It is advised that vaccination may be availed in cases through passport which is one of the permissible ID documents as per the current guidelines so that the passport number is printed in the certificate.”If the passport was not used as an ID proof at the time of administering the first dose, the details of the other photo ID used for vaccination will be printed in the vaccine certificate and mentioning the passport number here is not to be insisted upon, the release further said adding the competent authority might issue another certificate which will link vaccination certificate with the passport number of the person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-need-to-travel-abroad-for-education-employment-centre-issues-sops-101623077572868.html

07-06-2021||India||Railway employees demand ‘frontline worker’ status, priority vaccination||The Railways Employee Union launched a campaign on Monday to demand they be declared ‘frontline workers’, as they have been working throughout the pandemic, losing around 2,000 colleagues to the virus. To this end a social media campaign with the hashtag ‘Treat Railway Employees Frontline Worker’ was also started on Twitter."Responding to a clarion call given by the All India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF), railwaymen across the country demanded, through a Twitter Campaign, the status of 'Frontline Workers' for them, by tweeting to the prime minister, the railways and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare," All India Railwaymen's Federation (AIRF) said in a statement.AIRF, the largest union of railway employees, had written to Railway minister Piyush Goyal in early May, demanding that those succumbing to Covid in the line of duty should be compensated ₹50 lakh, at par with other frontline workers, as opposed to the ₹25 lakhs they are currently being paid, and priority vaccination."We also appreciate the prime minister when during 'Mann Ki Baat' he called railwaymen as corona warriors. AIRF, since the beginning has been demanding parity between different cadres who are working 24x7 during this corona period and scarifying their lives. However, It is quite unfortunate that while other categories of front line workers viz medical staff, security forces, sanitation staff etc. are being paid ₹50 lakh as compensation but Railwaymen are being paid ₹25 lakh only,” AIRF general secretary Shiva Gopal Mishra had written.While the government is extending all the benefits to the staff of other departments, treating them as 'Frontline Workers', Railwaymen are being given step-motherly treatment," Mishra said.Mishra told news agency PTI that “serious discontent” is brewing amongst railway employees on not being given the due recognition of a frontline worker despite serving the nation during its crisis period. Mishra had claimed earlier that around 65,000 employees have made a successful recovery from Covid-19 and rejoined service, adding that a letter of appreciation from the Prime Minister is commendable but what railway workers really want is being treated at par with other frontline workers. He also said that the ongoing campaign will be extended if their demands are not met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railway-employees-demand-frontline-worker-status-priority-vaccination-101623075946579.html

However, they also did point out that the decision should have been taken much earlier to ensure less damage by the disease.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said that Modi has conceded to the state government’s requests of centralised procurement of vaccines. “Good that Centre has decided to take over vaccine procurement & distribution for the whole country for all age groups.

This is a victory of public sentiment.” Gehlot also congratulated all the MPs, MLAs and Congress workers in his state.Rajya Sabha MP and former Union minister Jairam Ramesh also expressed similar opinions saying that the prime minister has accepted the opposition’s demand for centralised procurement. “The Prime Minister inflicted a huge cost on the people of India before accepting the Opposition’s demand for centralised procurement and free vaccination for those in the age group of 18-44-year-old. Humility and reaching out will not hurt him,” he tweeted on Monday.The Prime Minister inflicted a huge cost on the people of India before accepting the Opposition’s demand for centralised procurement and free vaccination for 18-44 year olds.

However, the new guidelines mention the use of antipyretic and antitussive for symptomatic relief.Among the key guidelines which have been routinely stressed on include use of wearing masks, physical distancing and hand hygiene.Suggesting a moderate use of other drugs like Remedesivir and Tocilizumab, the guideline advises the former to be used only in select moderate/severe hospitalised Covid-19 patients on supplemental oxygen within 10 days of onset of disease.Tocilizumab, an immunosuppressant drug, was approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and is mentioned in the guidelines on what conditions the drug should be used.What do the experts sayExperts have said Covid-19 patients on home care should not take Remdesivir medication and they should get admitted at a hospital if the oxygen level drops below 94."Remdesivir should never be taken at home. Positive attitude and regular exercise are a must for patients in home isolation, Dr Neeraj Nishchal of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) had said.Informing about the use of Ivermectin and Paracetamol, Dr Manish from AIIMS said that their use depends on the immunity level and other patient-specific conditions so one should take medicines only as prescribed by the doctors.While informing about the medicines taken to fight Covid-19, he said, many patients insist on the use of Azithromycin, but the guidelines clearly discourage the use of these tablets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-drops-ivermectin-hcq-and-favipiravir-from-covid-19-treatment-list-101623058343019.html

07-06-2021||India||SC orders removal of slums from Aravalli forest land in Haryana’s Faridabad||The Supreme Court on Monday ordered eviction of thousands of slum dwellers encroaching on Aravali forest area in Haryana’s Faridabad district, holding that there cannot be a compromise or concession on forest land.The top court gave six weeks to the municipal corporation of Faridabad to complete the demolition and directed the secretary, forests department of Haryana government to file a compliance affidavit before the next date of hearing on July 27.As the municipal commission had complained of stone pelting by occupants during the demolition drive carried out in April this year, the bench directed police protection to the corporation officials visiting the site and Faridabad superintendent of police was held personally responsible for ensuring adequate logistical support for the corporation.Also Read | ‘PM-CARES for Children’ scheme: SC gives Centre more time to draw up modalitiesThe bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari held, “We expect that the corporation will take all essential measures to remove encroachments on the subject forest land without any exception, not later than six weeks from today and submit a compliance report in that behalf, under the signature of the chief executive officer of the corporation.”The dwellers of Khori Gaon in Faridabad had approached the Supreme Court for protection after the municipal corporation of faridabad began to demolish their houses in April this year. After nearly 300 houses were demolished, the occupants of the remaining 10,000 houses approached the top court seeking rehabilitation before their houses got demolished.The bench termed them “land grabbers” and refused to come to their aid. In the past, the top court had, on February 19, 2020, and then on April 5, 2021, directed the occupants to be cleared from forest land. On Monday, the bench reiterated, “We make it clear that the corporation shall proceed in the matter as observed in our orders dated February 19, 2020 and April 5, 2021.”As the past directions of the court were not complied with, the bench observed, “It seems like the corporation does not intend to evict (the occupants).” The corporation was represented by senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj who said that corporation officials required adequate protection as past experience showed how occupants had pelted stones at them.The bench observed, “We want a certificate from the authorities that the forest land is completely cleared of encroachment. This being forest land, there can be no concession or compromise. Either you (petitioners) vacate on your own or we will ask the municipal corporation to forcefully evict you.” The court demanded an undertaking from the petitioners to vacate the land.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, who represented the slum dwellers, argued that during a pandemic it would be difficult for such a large number of people to find alternate accommodation. He requested the court to first consider their claim for rehabilitation under the Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran Rehabilitation Policy as Right to Housing is a fundamental right under Article 21 of Constitution. This scheme requires an inhabitant to be in occupation of government or government agency land as on April 1, 2003. Most of the petitioners have been living on the land in question since 2010.Gonsalves requested the court to consider tweaking the rehabilitation policy in order to accommodate the petitioners. The petition filed through advocate Satya Mitra said, “They (petitioners) have been residing on government land since 1980. Most of them, however, are unable to show any proofs of existence since then. Many of the residents today have proof of existence since 2010 onwards, when they were given ration cards and election cards and other forms of identity.”The bench said that once the certificates (of compliance) are submitted in six weeks, the court will consider passing further directions including due verification of certificates by an independent agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-orders-removal-of-slums-from-aravalli-forest-land-in-haryana-s-faridabad-101623068974330.html

The move announced by PM Modi reverses the earlier policy of asking the states to compete for supplies for the 18-45 age group."From Monday, June 21, in every state of the country, for all citizens above the age of 18 years, the Government of India will provide free vaccines.

At least a dozen states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh rushed to float global tenders for procuring vaccines but could not achieve any confirmation from international vaccine manufacturers.India has administered 232 million doses since January 16 after launching the inoculation drive and close to 3.4% of its population is now fully immunized.It will take another 22 months to cover 75% of the population, according to Bloomberg Vaccination Tracker.India on Monday continued to see a decline in its daily infections, signalling the end of a deadly second wave after peaking on May 7 this year.

FPCE said less 10% of the ongoing projects have been completed since the law was enacted. “Not even 10% of the ongoing projects which were covered under the law have been completed even after five years of the law being implemented,” FPCE president Abhay Upadhyay said.The FPCE recently won a case against the West Bengal government which had notified its real estate law, the Housing Industry Regulatory Authority, in contravention of the Central Act. The Supreme Court had termed the West Bengal law unconstitutional.Also read: Sell properties on carpet area, not super area: H-Rera to developers“The government should also bring out a whitepaper on how many projects launched after the RERA came into existence have been completed within the given timeline.

Getting extension for completion of the project is not the birthright of builders,” Upadhyay said.Updadhya also raised questions about the authorities experimenting with new ideas, which are out of the legal framework of the law, instead of focus on bringing relief to homebuyers. He said, “It’s good progress so far as registration of 65,000 projects and disposal of 64,000 cases are concerned. But now there is a need to do more to bring relief to homebuyers, which is enshrined in the law,” Upadhyay said.He alleged that the government authorities get “out of box ideas” when it comes to providing relief or comfort to the builders. The organisation said they had opposed the Union housing and urban affairs ministry’s move last year to extend the deadline for ongoing projects due to the coronavirus disease pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rera-failed-customers-of-housing-projects-stuck-after-5-years-homebuyers-forum-101623065359103.html

During that address, he said that the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic had hit India "like a storm" and appealed to states to use lockdowns only as the "last resort"."In a situation like today, we have to save the country from a lockdown. If you all work together, create awareness then there is no need for containment, never mind a lockdown. I appeal to states that they should use the lockdown as the last resort.

07-06-2021||India||Choksi’s complaint names mystery woman, 2 Indians as his abductors||Fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi has named the mystery woman, Barbara Jarabica, two Indians he identified as Narender Singh and Gurmit Singh, and “unknown persons” as his abductors in his complaint filed with the Royal Police Force of Antigua and Barbuda. Choksi has also claimed that once he was brought to Dominica, he was informed by his abductors a high ranking ‘Indian politician’ will interview him. Antigua’s Prime Minister Gaston Browne has said they have started investigation into Choksi’s abduction allegations even though he doesn’t believe that he was abducted, as reported by HT. In his five-page complaint, filed with the Commissioner of Police of Antigua on June 3, Choksi says he was on friendly terms with Barbara Jarabica for past one year, who initially resided opposite his residential complex at Jolly Harbour but later she shifted to Coco Bay Hotel. She was even friendly with Choksi’s staff and they used to meet regularly, often while going for walks in the evenings, Choksi says. Also Read | Mehul Choksi’s identity was known 3 days later: Dominica PoliceHT has seen the complaint. On Sunday, May 23 (the day he went missing from Antigua), Choksi’s complaint says, “Barbara asked him to deviate from the normal schedule of meeting and asked [me] to pick her up from her house, located on the road next to the marina. The businessman, wanted in India for bank fraud worth ₹13,578 crore along with his nephew Nirav Modi, adds that he reached Barbara’s residence around 5-5.15 pm where she invited him in and indicated that she had to finish her wine and told him that they will step out in a minute. The complaint says when he entered the house, 8-10 heavily muscled men appeared from all sides. “They claimed to be Antiguan police and that they know about me and have been watching me for a while,” Choksi says, adding that they wanted to take him to St John’s police station. The fugitive, currently being treated in Dominica in custody after being charged for ‘illegal entry’, has alleged he was mercilessly beaten with bare hands and tased; and that the abductors took away his Rolex watch, cell phone, and wallet having $1500. The complaint says Choksi was put on a wheelchair while he was almost in a comatose state due to the beating, a gag was put in his mouth and his face was covered. During the whole episode, he claims, Barbara didn’t even attempt to help him, which “clearly points to the fact she was an integral part of this entire scheme to kidnap me”. He was first placed in a small watercraft and then a larger boat, and when he resisted, he was threatened at knifepoint. Aboard the boat, there were two Indians and three persons of Caribbean descent. Choksi has said their appearances suggested the two Indians were highly trained mercenaries, hired specifically to abduct him. “One of the Indians said I was under observation for almost a year. They knew my intimate details about my household, such as I had a nun, where I would walk, my favorite restaurants, my daily schedule etc,” Choksi says. Another Indian, he adds, asked him detailed questions about his finances, offshore bank accounts and threatened that if the answers were not satisfactory, he and his family will face dire consequences in India. “I was also made to speak on the phone with a man who identified himself as Narender Singh. He said he was the chief agent of my case. He began to pressurize me to say I had cooperated with my captors and that I accompanied them of my own free volition which of course was not true,” Choksi’s complaint states. This person, Choksi alleges, also asked him to leave Barbara out of whole issue as it will lead to a public scandal. Choksi claims the boat reached Dominica 15-17 hours after his ordeal began, which was roughly 9:30-10 am Antigua time (May 24). “..I was told that I have been brought to this special location to give an interview to a high-ranking Indian politician. He also told me that my citizenship would be ‘fixed’ in Dominica and that I would soon be repatriated to India,” the complaint reads. Choksi has said he was received by a battery of police officers in Dominica, including chief of police, who informed him he was arrested on the basis of Interpol red notice. In Roseau police station, the complaint claims, Choksi was kept in a cell barely 20 square metres in size and was denied medical treatment or legal representation, saying “we don’t do that here with prisoners”. His lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said,“Truth and false both are five letter words and not even a single letter is common. My client Mr Choksi, by giving detailed narration of events, has stated his truth, now false, which was state-sponsored, will get exposed if investigated honestly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksis-complaint-names-mystery-woman-2-indians-as-his-abductors-101623065374643.html

They will discuss issues like Maratha reservation, OBC reservation and cyclone relief,” Dilip Patil was quoted as saying by new agency ANI.Last month, Uddhav Thackeray wrote to Prime Minister Modi requesting him to take steps to declare the Maratha community in the state as Socially and Educationally Backward (SEBC) to enable them to claim reservation in education and government jobs.Also read | Marathas now EWS; 6K youths to get govt jobs"The Judgement delivered by the Constitution Bench (comprising of five Judges) of the Supreme Court on May 5, 2021, has given me this occasion to write to you with the earnest request that appropriate steps be taken at the earliest to grant reservation to the Maratha community from my State, albeit in accordance with the law, to the minimum extent of 12 per cent in Education and 13 per cent in Public Employment," Uddhav Thackeray said in this letter to PM Modi.Uddhav Thackeray’s visit to the national capital comes after Shiv Sena’s mouthpiece Saamana said in its editorial on May 31 that the battle for Maratha reservation will be fought in Delhi. It said it becomes necessary to knock on the doors of Delhi on the issue of the Maratha reservation.

A five-judge constitution bench said in its judgment said that that people from the Maratha community cannot be declared as educationally and socially backward community to bring them within the reserved category.On Sunday, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati announced that a statewide agitation demanding reservation in education and jobs for the Maratha community will be launched from the memorial of Chhatrapati Shivaji in Kolhapur in Maharashtra on June 16.“I have decided not to stay silent until the Maratha community gets its reservation. The state government has done nothing since the ultimatum was issued. The agitation is now certain. Our first rally (morcha) will be organised at Shahu Samadhi Sthal, (resting place of Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj) in Kolhapur,” Chhatrapati said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uddhav-thackeray-to-meet-pm-modi-in-delhi-tomorrow-discuss-maratha-quota-issue-101623064001959.html

On May 23, she asked me to pick her up at her house. When I went there, 8-10 men appeared from all the entrances and beat me mercilessly," Choksi said in his complaint.He alleged that the woman was a part of the abduction attempt."When I was being beaten up, Jabarica didn't even attempt to help me or assist in any other way by calling for help from outside; manner in which Jabarica conducted herself clearly points that she was an integral part of this entire scheme to kidnap me," Choksi said.Choksi went missing from Antigua on May 23 when he was going for an evening walk. While the Antiguan PM repeatedly said that Choksi fled to Dominica with his girlfriend, the businessman’s wife Priti Choksi and his lawyers -- Wayne Marsh and Vijay Aggarwal -- have alleged that he was abducted by Antiguan and Indian officers, tortured and taken to Dominica in a boat. He has been charged for illegal entry in Dominica and is being treated at a hospital there after a court has adjourned the matter to June 14. A chartered jet, which went last Friday with Indian officials hoping to get Choksi deported from Dominica, has since returned.The Dominica police claimed in the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court that Choksi was found seated in suspicious condition near a jetty at Toucarie Bay in Dominica around 11.30pm on May 24.Also read | Mehul Choksi found in a suspicious state: Dominica policeHowever, the police charged him with “illegal entry” offence around 9pm on May 28, according to details of Dominica’s police affidavits exclusively accessed by HT.Indian-born Choksi was detained by Dominican police on charges of illegally entering the island.

07-06-2021||India||IMA writes to PM Modi, seeks 'personal intervention' on assault on doctors||Taking cognisance of incidents of doctors and other healthcare professionals being assaulted by the family members and relatives of patients, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking his personal intervention in ensuring ‘optimum milieu’ for medical professionals so that they can work without any fear.“In the midst of this pandemic, we are deeply hurt to see the increasing incidents of physical violence against the doctors and the health care professionals in this country,” IMA said and cited the recent attack on one of its doctors in Assam along with assaults on women doctors and veteran practitioners across India. The Assam police have so far made 24 arrests for attacking the IMA doctor at a Covid care centre in the Hojai district on June 1.Also Read| 'Coronil not a medicine,' Uttarakhand IMA raises concerns over Ramdev's therapy“The Health Services Personnel and Clinical Establishments (Prohibition of Violence and Damage to Property) Bill, 2019, which seeks to punish people who assault on-duty doctors and other healthcare professionals by imposing a jail term of up to 10 years – which, apparently, was dismissed by the home ministry during an inter-ministerial consultation over the draft law, ought to be promulgated immediately along with the incorporation of provisions from the IPC/CrPC and with stipulations for a fixed time schedule for speedy conclusion of trials,” the IMA said in its letter to the Prime Minister.Also Read| Doctor assaulted in Assam accuses police of inactionThe doctors’ body pointed that people who were spreading misinformation about the Covid-19 vaccination drive must be booked and punished in accordance with the law, including under the relevant provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Disaster Management Act, 2005. Without naming Ramdev's Patanjali, IMA also sought the immediate curtailment of attempts by any person to fool the public and promote ‘magic remedies’ or ‘wonder drugs’ without the Union health ministry’s approval. The doctors' body has been in a squabble with Ramdev over his comments on modern medicine and has also threatened legal action against the yoga guru.As several states and Union territories (UTs) have suspended vaccination for the 18-44 years age group, the IMA requested PM Modi that the Centre should promote universal free vaccination without leaving the doses to the extent of 50% to states and private hospitals. “We believe that only when a strong leader like you leads this programme, the full benefit shall reach out to all people.”Also Read| Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address nation at 5pmThe IMA also said that doctors who have lost their lives while treating patients of the Covid-19 disease ought to be recognised as Covid-19 martyrs with due acknowledgement of their sacrifice and their families ought to be supported by the Centre.India has so far recorded 28,909,975 cases, 349,186 deaths and 27,159,180 recoveries due to the Covid-19 disease.

07-06-2021||India||'PM-CARES for Children' scheme: SC gives Centre more time to draw up modalities||The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the central government more time to appraise the court regarding the modalities of the recently launched 'PM CARES for Children' scheme, launched for the welfare of children orphaned by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The national commission of protection of child rights (NCPCR) said that the governments in certain states and union territories are not cooperating and have not provided the latest data on the number of children who have lost their parents due to coronavirus.The scheme includes various measures such as including providing a specially designed scheme to create a corpus of ₹10 lakh when the beneficiary child turns 18 years old. The fixed deposits will be opened in the names of such children.On June 1, the top court had asked the central government to provide information on the 'PM-CARES for Children' scheme, launched on May 29 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and directed states to appoint nodal officers to appraise it on identification and welfare measures for such children.Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, appearing for the NCPCR, told the Supreme Court bench on Monday that it was facing difficulties with West Bengal and Delhi, who are not uploading the data of such children on ‘Bal Swaraj’. Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, that they are in consultation with states and ministries to work out the modalities of the 'PM-CARES for Children' scheme. “We need some more time to appraise the court about the modalities of the scheme as the consultation is still going on. We have made district magistrates directly responsible for the children who have been abandoned or have been orphaned,” Bhati said.Responding to the NCPCR's claims, the Delhi government, represented by Advocate Chirag Shroff, said their data is provided solely by Child Welfare Committees (CWC), while in other states different departments provide data to the district magistrates from where it is uploaded. The Delhi government last week wrote to different departments like revenue and police and sought data from them, he said.To this, the Supreme Court bench responded by saying that Delhi should have a task force at the district level like other states and upload the information as soon as they get it without waiting for court orders to attend to the immediate needs of the children.The bench pulled up the West Bengal counsel and asked it how can the state government not understand the court's order stating that information regarding children, who have been orphaned after March 2020, is needed.“All states have understood the directive properly but how can only West Bengal not understand the order,” the bench said, adding that the state has to direct the authorities concerned to provide all the data about the children.In an earlier affidavit, the NCPCR had said that as per the data given by states so far, 9,346 children have either lost both or one of their parents to the deadly virus. As many as 1,742 children have lost both of their parents and 7,464 have lost one of the parents, the child rights body had said.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmcares-for-children-scheme-sc-gives-centre-more-time-to-draw-up-modalities-101623058445744.html
07-06-2021||India||As states begin unlocking, returning migrants struggle to find work||Dinesh Rathore from Muzaffarpur in Bihar returned to Delhi nearly after two and a half months of staying in his native village during the lockdown in the national capital amid the rising Covid cases in April.“I am the sole bread earner of my family. There are younger brothers and parents back at home to feed. All my savings, from my daily wages of ₹300 wages, were over during this year’s lockdown,” says Rathore.As lockdown restrictions have started easing in many migrant worker receiving states such as Goa, Mumbai, Delhi, workers have begun returning in search of work.Also Watch |‘Jahan vote, wahan vaccination’: Kejriwal announces mega vaccination campaign“Our village has hundreds of people who come to Delhi for work. We heard that work here would resume by May-end so I returned with a brother of mine, hoping to find him work too. But there is really no work here. For 10 days, we have been approaching different factories to give us work. I am skilled at iron smithing and welding work as well, but they are not allowing strangers to enter the factories,” he says, adding that the siblings are left with very little ration.Another migrant labourer, Pavan Sahni, who belongs to Poornia in Bihar, returned to Neemrana in Rajasthan where he worked earlier, but he says not much has changed. With a wife and three kids to support, Sahni earlier sold ice-creams that a local factory gave him along with a refrigerated cart. He got paid ₹2 rupees per piece sold. “I used to earn over ₹400 a day but people are now wary of buying food from small-time vendors like me and the police also don’t allow us to station the cart in streets, leave alone major roads,” he says.“There is a place called Labour Chowk here where migrant workers assemble in the morning and people looking for labourers hire them for ₹300 a day. My friend and I got work only twice,” he saysSahni adds there has been a rush of labourers to the chowk as the news [of police allowing labourers to wait for work] spread. “I am jobless again. These ₹600 rupees are all that I have earned since I came back for work. I could not even earn enough to pay for the rent of the room where my family stays,” he says.Gulzar Ahmad from Jharkhand had also returned home from Goa as the state imposed a lockdown in April. Most of the labourers in his village worked in Goa as labourers and housekeeping staff in hotels but now, they are choosing to go to other states, not Goa.“Since the lockdown, not many tourists are going there and most of the hotels are closed. Some of my friends left for Hyderabad yesterday as someone assured them on the phone that he needed workers. They are not sure about it but it is better to search than stay idle or even go to Goa where everything is shut,” he said.He added that the weather in states such as Karnataka, Goa, and Kerala is also not conducive, post-Cyclone Yaas.“There has been a severe cyclone recently and that has impacted work availability as well,” he says.Gayatri Sahgal from Stranded worker action network (SWAN), a volunteer group working for migrant workers, says that the government has been negligent and has been giving false assurances of support to them.HT has already reported on the defunct government helplines which include contact numbers of 100 labour commissioners meant to help these workers with ration, non-payment of wages, basic financial assistance, protection from eviction by landlords and travel support for workers to get back home. Some of these commissioners tasked for this did not even know that their numbers were listed as helplines.Sahgal says unlock has not been planned well, adding that migrant workers trying to get back to work need some basic financial assistance to survive till they find work .She adds that while Delhi is lending ration of 4 kgs of wheat and 1 kg rice, migrant workers may not have support in places they wish to go for work. “The extension of ration to non-PDS card holders should be done on a war footing. While the government might claim stock assessment issues as migrant workers are not a static population in any one state, there are some well researched surveys of this patterned migration which could give them an average number of labourers in each state,” she says.“We have better models of reducing migrant distress, like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), available with us. Their extended implementation is needed, especially when the urban economy has suffered so much,” she says adding the government should also start projects in urban localities which could cater to the welfare of such workers. MGNREGA provides at least 100 days of daily wage employment every year to unemployed people for those adults who volunteer to do unskilled manual work, according to its official website.A labour ministry spokesperson admitted to HT that there have been complaints from workers who are unable to find work despite easing of lockdown curbs and that most factories are refusing to let them in, but the government was yet to chalk out any plan to address the issue.There also wasn’t a response from Central Labour Commissioner DPS Negi on how the government was planning to re-integrate these workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-curbs-eased-returning-migrants-continue-to-struggle-for-work-101623058233660.html
07-06-2021||India||Twitter, once the soul of BJP’s political struggle, has now become a burden: Shiv Sena||Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana hit out at the Centre over the ongoing standoff between microblogging site Twitter and the Union government. In its editorial published on Monday the Shiv Sena said Twitter has “become a burden” for the government which they want to “throw away”."Earlier, Twitter was the soul of political struggle or campaign for the BJP or the Modi government. Twitter has now become a burden for them and the Modi government has reached the extent of deciding whether to throw this burden away. Today, all the media in the country is under the complete control of the Modi government, except the mediums like Twitter." the editorial stated.Alleging the social media platform was being used for “mudslinging” and “character assassination” during the 2014 election campaign and that the ruling party was more active online than it was on the ground at that time."In the last few years, a campaign of mud hurling, character assassination is being run on social media. No political party other than BJP knew how to make full use of it. In 2014, the BJP had mastered this task. In the campaign of that time, the BJP army was more active in the cyber world and less on the ground.”"Under what rules did the objectionable words used for Rahul Gandhi on Twitter and Facebook? What are the adjectives used for a senior leader like Dr Manmohan Singh? From Uddhav Thackeray, who has spent life in politics and social service to politicians like Mamata Banerjee, Sharad Pawar, Priyanka Gandhi, Mulayam Singh Yadav, etc, character assassination campaign was launched against opposition leaders," questioned Saamana.The editorial further states that the opposition has now learned how to effectively use Twitter and are taking on the BJP in states like West Bengal and Bihar creating panic within the ranks of the ruling party."As long as these attacks were going on in a one-sided manner, the BJP members were happy, but when the opposition launched attacks by deploying equally capable cyber forces, then there was panic in the BJP camp. In West Bengal polls, Trinamool Congress' Mohua Moitra and Derek O'Brien injured the BJP with the double-edged sword of Twitter. In the Bihar elections, Tejashwi Yadav exposed Modi and Nitish Kumar through Twitter," the editorial said.The editorial also talks about the government’s mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic which was amplified by social media platforms like Twitter, stating that the images of "dead bodies flowing in the Ganges, pyre burning continuously in Varanasi and Gujarat, ambulance queues outside the crematoriums reached the world and the working style of the BJP government was exposed".Twitter and the Centre have been at loggerheads over the new information technology rules. Twitter was sent “last notice” asking it to comply with the new IT rules, issued as a “gesture of goodwill” on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-once-the-soul-of-bjp-s-political-struggle-has-now-become-a-burden-shiv-sena-101623057737778.html

They had moved to court seeking protection from the family members of the girl. The order was passed by the bench on June 3.The court was informed that upon learning about the relationship between the girl and her partner, her parents wanted her to marry a person of their choice, following which the girl left her paternal home to live with her partner. They have decided to live together till the time they are legally allowed to solemnise their marriage, they submitted.Also read: Live-in couples entitled to protection, rules Punjab and Haryana HCOn denying protection to people who opt for live-in relationships with dire consequences, the court said, "It would be a travesty of justice in case protection is denied to persons who have opted to reside together without the sanctity of marriage and such persons have to face dire consequences at the hands of persons whom protection is sought.""In case, such a course is adopted and protection denied, the court would also be failing in their duty to provide its citizens a right to their life and liberty as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India to uphold to the Rule of Law," the court observed.Spotlighting the killings by families in the name of 'honour', the court said, "At this stage one cannot lose sight of honour killings which are prevalent in northern parts of India, particularly in parts of states of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.""Honour killing is a result of people marrying without their family's acceptance, and sometimes for marrying outside their caste or religion. Once an individual, who is a major, has chosen his/her partner, it is not for any other person, be it a family member, to object and cause a hindrance to their peaceful existence. It is for the State at this juncture, to ensure their protection and their personal liberty," the bench said.Also read: Runaway couples seeking protection share their ordealThe court underlined that the petitioners have not asked the court for permission to marry or to approve their relationship.Observing that such a relationship does not amount to offence, the court said, "The concept of a live-in relationship may not be acceptable to all, but it cannot be said that such a relationship is an illegal one or that living together without the sanctity of marriage constitutes an offence."The court further added that once an individual, who is a major, has chosen his/her partner, it is not for any other person, be it a family member, to object and cause a hindrance to their peaceful existence. “It is for the State at this juncture, to ensure their protection and their personal liberty," the bench added.Notably, the Supreme Court has granted protection to a live-in couple in Tarn Taran, whose petition was dismissed by high court on May 11 observing that they in the garb of filing the petition are seeking seal of approval on their relationship, which is “morally and socially not acceptable” and no protection order in the petition can be passed.The apex court in its order on June 4 granted protection observing, “Needless to state that since it concerns life and liberty, the Superintendent of Police is required to act expeditiously in accordance with law, including the grant of any protection to the petitioners in view of the apprehensions/ threats, uninfluenced by the observations of the High Court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-live-in-relationship-not-for-us-to-judge-couple-s-decision-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-101623042696651.html

07-06-2021||India||These drugs, test have been dropped for Covid-19 treatment. Details here||In revised guidelines for managing patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Union ministry of health and family welfare has dropped all medicines, except those for fever and cold, for asymptomatic and mild cases. The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) under the health ministry has stressed the importance of following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour—wearing of a mask and following physical distancing, hand hygiene and cough etiquettes— and said they must be followed by asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe patients.Drugs droppedDGHS in the revised guidelines, issued on May 27, has dropped all drugs including hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, doxycycline, zinc, multivitamins, etc prescribed by the doctors to asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic Covid-19 patients. Doctors have also been asked not to prescribe unnecessary tests to Covid-19 patients such as CT scans.Also read | India's daily Covid cases and deaths drop to 100,636 and 2427; tally nears 29 mnIn mild cases, the guidelines said, patients should self-monitor for fever, breathlessness, oxygen saturation (SpO2) or worsening of any symptoms. It said people may take antipyretic and anti-tussive for symptomatic relief, and inhalation of budesonide at a dose of 800mcg twice daily for five days for a cough. “No other Covid-19 specific medication required. The patient may have to be investigated further if symptoms persist or deteriorate.”Also read | Covid-19 origins: Here's why the Wuhan 'lab leak' theory is back in newsNo medication is required for asymptomatic cases and those with comorbidities who need to continue taking their prescribed medicines, the guidelines said. DGHS has advised people experiencing symptoms of the coronavirus disease to follow a healthy, balanced diet and keep themselves hydrated. Guidelines for use of remdesivir1. Remdesivir is to be used only in select moderate or severe hospitalised Covid-19 patients on supplemental oxygen within 10 days of onset of disease. 2. It is not for mild Covid-19 patients who are at home or in Covid Care Centres. 3. It must be advised by senior faculty members or specialists directly involved in patient’s care. 4. If it has to be advised or ordered during odd hours, it should be done by the duty doctor after telephonic consultation with a senior faculty member/specialist/ unit in - charge.Guidelines for use of tocilizumab in severe and critically ill patients1. If the patient shows no signs of improvement in terms of oxygen requirement even after 24-48 hours of administration of steroids, tocilizumab can be prescribed.2. It can also be prescribed when the patient has significantly raised inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein≥75 mg/L) 3. However, it must be ensured that the patient is free of any bacterial/fungal/ tuberculous infection at the time of administration of Tocilizumab. Guidelines for use of steroids1. Steroids are harmful in asymptomatic and mild cases of Covid-19. 2. Steroids are indicated in only hospitalised, moderately severe and critically ill Covid-19 cases. 3. Self-medication of steroids must be avoided. 4. Monitoring of blood glucose is mandatory in all patients put on steroids as it may precipitate hyperglycaemia.Guidelines for use of anti-coagulants1. Prophylactic doses to be used in moderate cases of Covid-19 with un-fractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin.2. There should be no contraindication or high risk of bleeding. 3. Doses to be used in severe cases with un-fractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin.4. Therapeutic dose to be used only if there is evidence of thromboembolism or obstruction of a blood vessel by a blood clot that has become dislodged from another area in the circulation. 5. There should be no contraindication or high risk of bleeding.Guidelines on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan1. Nearly two-thirds of those with asymptomatic Covid-19 have abnormalities on HRCT chest imaging which are nonspecific. Most of them do not progress clinically. 2. HRCT imaging of the chest done in the first week of Covid-19 might often underestimate the extent of lung involvement, giving a false sense of security. 3. Correlation between extent of lung involvement by HRCT and hypoxia—when the body or a particular region is deprived of adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level—is imperfect. 4. The guidelines said that often, young people with extensive lung involvement will not develop hypoxia but elderly individuals with minimal or less extensive lung involvement may develop hypoxia. 5. Radiation exposure due to repeated HRCT imaging may be associated with risk of cancer later in life.(Source: DGHS statement)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-drugs-test-have-been-dropped-for-covid-19-treatment-details-here-101623054672831.html
07-06-2021||India||Isro develops three types of ventilators to battle Covid-19||The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has developed three types of ventilators and has come forward to transfer the technology to industry for clinical usage as the country battles the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.A low-cost and portable critical care ventilator, 'Prana' ("Programmable Respiratory Assistance for the Needy Aid') is based on the automated compression of an Ambu (Artificial Manual Breathing Unit) bag.The system has a sophisticated control system that includes an airway pressure sensor, flow sensor, oxygen sensor, servo actuator as well as expiration and Peep (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) control valves, according to an interest exploration note posted on the website of Bengaluru- headquartered space agency.The clinicians can select the ventilation mode and set the required parameters through a touch screen panel and monitor various parameters like pressure, flow, tidal volume, and oxygen concentration on the same screen.The ventilator can deliver the required flow of oxygen-air mixture to the patient's lung at the desired rate set by the clinicians.It has a provision to attach an external battery for backup during power failure.Isro said Prana supports both invasive and non-invasive ventilation modes and is capable of giving mandatory breaths (controlled by ventilator) as well as spontaneous breaths (controlled by the patient).A robust algorithm for controlled and safe ventilation of the patient is implemented which raises alarm and opens safety valves to prevent barotrauma, asphyxia, and apnoea during the ventilation.An alarm is also raised in case of wrong or improper connection of the ventilation circuit or inadvertent disconnection of the hose or sensors.There are also provisions to attach bacterial viral filters at each interface to prevent cross-infection and the contamination of air.The ICU grade positive pressure mechanical ventilator titled 'VaU' (abbreviation of Ventilation assist Unit) can assist or replace spontaneous breathing in patients under respiratory distress, Isro said.VaU is based on a centrifugal blower that draws in filtered ambient air, compresses it, and delivers it to the patient to achieve ventilation and can therefore operate without a compressed pneumatic source.Provision is also given in the ventilator to connect a high-pressure oxygen source, from which oxygen is metered automatically, to achieve the desired oxygen concentration (FiO2) in the inspiratory flow.The microcontroller-based control module in the ventilator acquires signals from an array of sensors and commands the electro-pneumatic components to effect closed-loop control.VaU also comes with an intuitive Human Machine Interface (HMI) System running on a medical-grade touch screen PC, which allows the operator to set and monitor various ventilation parameters in real-time.A power supply unit, which can operate with 230VAC or an internal battery pack, is used to power the electro-pneumatic components, controller, and the HMI system of the ventilator.VaU has been configured to operate in a variety of patient/ventilator-triggered invasive and non-invasive ventilation modes and has provisions to detect fault conditions and raise alarms through the HMI system to alert the operator.Gas-powered ventilator 'Space Ventilator Aided System for Trauma Assistance (SVASTA)', a basic model for non-invasive ventilation, is well-suited for emergency use for first-line treatment and as transit ventilators inside vehicles, according to Isro.The basic design is simple, and the components can be easily mass-produced for emergency use in pandemic-like situations.This ventilator, which runs on compressed air, is able to perform various ventilation conditions using manual mechanical settings.The system is capable of pressure control ventilation (PCV) in its basic mode of operation with the provision for setting different tidal volumes.The basic ventilator design can be re-engineered appropriately by the manufacturer to cater to various modes of ventilation with control systems, electronics, and associated software, it was stated.The prototype of the three ventilators developed at Thiruvananthapuram-based Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), a major space research center of Isro, has undergone in-house test & evaluation and meets various specifications.The responsibility of obtaining mandatory certification from approving agencies of the government of India before clinical usage vests with the industry, the Isro note said.Isro said it intends to transfer the technology of these three ventilators to PSUs/ industries/ start-ups having a good track record in the manufacture of critical medical/ electronic equipment manufacturing.It invited Interested industries/ entrepreneurs to submit their expression of interest before June 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-develops-three-types-of-ventilators-to-battle-covid19-101623053775130.html

An official said these are troops returning after election duties in four states and a Union Territory.Officials said around 300 companies of troops, especially the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), had left the Valley on election duties.So far, 70 of them have returned while others are on their way back.Also Read | Govt comfortable with non-political setup in J&K: Lone“It’s nothing unusual. Approximately 300 of Central Armed Police Forces had moved out of our security grid for the recent assembly elections . So far, only 70 companies have returned,” said a senior police officer who is privy to details and oversees the security grid in Kashmir.The unusual movement of troops, especially in north Kashmir, has led to speculation that the Centre may be planning a move similar to that of August 5, 2019, when Article 370 giving special status to J&K was nullified and the state divided into two Union Territories.Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference chairman Sajjad Lone said, “We want to believe even in rumours rumoured to be rumours. We love rumours, don’t we? Last few days have been all about rumours and conspiracies. They say don’t believe a rumour to b true until govt actually denies it,” he tweeted.National Conference leader Tanveer Sadiq, who was also the political advisor of former J&K chief secretary, also raised concerns about the rumours, wondering if mainstream leaders could again be arrested and lodged in MLA hostel. “While rumours are flying thick and fast -- should we be ready for second semester? MLA’s hostel 2.0?,” he tweeted.Senior BJP leader and former legislator Sofi Yousuf rubbished rumours that J&K will be further bifurcated. “Once things are normal, J&K will get back its statehood. These are rumours that J&K will see further division,” he said.Meanwhile, J&K Lt Governor Manoj Sinha is in Delhi, along with top senior officers, and has held several meetings in the past two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-troop-movement-in-j-k-as-capf-companies-return-from-poll-duty-101623054453385.html

This will be the first visit from the Indian side to Kuwait since Sheikh Nawaf became the oil-rich nation’s new ruler last September, following the death of Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah. Kuwaiti foreign minister Ahmed Nasser al-Mohammed al-Sabah had visited India in March. Jaishankar’s official visit is part of continuous efforts between officials of the two countries to “strengthen the already strong and solid bilateral relations and push them towards better levels”, a person familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Also Read | Adar Poonawalla thanks Biden, Jaishankar for US policy changeThe external affairs minister is expected to carry a letter from the Indian Prime Minister regarding bilateral relations and ways to enhance them, the person added. During foreign minister Ahmad Nasser’s visit to India in mid-March, the two sides announced the establishment of a joint commission, chaired by the foreign ministers. A number of joint working groups would be established under the joint commission to enhance cooperation in fields such as trade, investment, economic affairs, petrochemicals, defence and culture. The two foreign ministers have also exchanged a number of phone calls within a short period of time since a second wave of Coronavirus infections hit India, during which the Kuwaiti minister reiterated his country’s commitment to stand with India in these difficult times and to provide relief materials, especially oxygen, the person cited above said. Jaishankar has expressed India’s appreciation for the support extended by Kuwait by providing relief materials and medical oxygen through ships that is still continuing. Under an air and sea bridge arrangement, Indian Navy ships are carrying large oxygen tanks from Kuwait ports to Indian ports, and Indian Air Force aircraft then transport the empty tanks back to Kuwait for refilling. The joint commission created earlier this year was aimed at institutionalising bilateral ties in areas ranging from energy to defence and to forge a framework for future cooperation. It will act as an umbrella for all bilateral institutional engagements such as foreign office consultations and joint working groups. Apart from existing working groups on hydrocarbons, manpower and mobility, and healthcare, new groups would be created on trade and investment, defence and security, and maritime cooperation. India is among the largest trading partners of Kuwait, and bilateral trade was worth $10.86 billion during 2019-20. India’s imports, mainly oil, were worth $9.6 billion during this period. Kuwait was the 10th largest oil supplier to India during 2019-20 and met 3.8% of the country’s energy needs. Kuwait is also home to nearly 900,000 Indian expatriates. The Indian government had supplied 200,000 doses of Covishield vaccines to Kuwait in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-to-visit-kuwait-on-june-9-carry-pm-s-message-101623053853225.html

While Capital Delhi began a second phase of unlock from a lockdown which has been in place since April 19, Maharashtra -- with the highest Covid-19 caseload -- began a "five-tier" unlock from lockdown-like restrictions. The state's capital, India's financial hub Mumbai, has been categorised under level three.When PM Modi last addressed the nation, on April 20, daily Covid-19 cases were nearing the 300,000-mark while more than 2,000 deaths were being recorded in a single-day. In the following days, the daily cases rose to more than 300,000 and subsequently 400,000 while single-day fatalities were close to or above 4,000.In recent days, however, the daily cases and deaths have both seen a steady dip; fresh infections, though, continue to be the above the 100,000-mark. On Monday morning, the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) data showed an addition of 100,636 cases and 2427 related deaths. This was the lowest single-day rise in more than two months, or 61 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-address-nation-at-5pm-101623052534631.html

Of the 425 Covishield and 90 Covaxin recipients, 98.1% and 80.0% respectively, showed seropositivity. However, both seropositivity rate and median (IQR) rise in anti-spike antibody was significantly higher in Covishield vs. Covaxin recipient...”Also Read | Will Indian students in US be asked to get vaccines again? All you need to knowIn effect, while both vaccines elicited good immune response after two doses, although seropositivity rates and median anti-spike antibody titre was significantly higher in Covishield compared to Covaxin arm.Both the vaccines studied are currently being given under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme in India.According to the study, overall combined results of both vaccines showed 95% seropositivity to anti-spike antibody, 21-36 days after the second dose.Serum Institute of India (SII) is locally producing Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine under the brand name Covishield, and Covaxin is co-developed by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The primary aim of the researchers was to analyse antibody response (seropositivity rate and median [inter-quartile range, IQR] antibody titre) following each dose of both vaccines and its correlation to age, sex, blood group, body mass index (BMI) and comorbidities.“While no difference was observed in relation to sex, BMI, blood group and any comorbidities; people over 60 years or age or those with type 2 diabetes had a significantly lower seropositivity rates.”The research was led by Dr Awadhesh Kumar Singh, consultant endocrinologist, GD Hospital and Diabetes Institute, KolKata, West Bengal.However, fewer post-vaccination infections, also known as breakthrough infection, were seen in health care workers who took Covaxin, corroborating the other possibility of the vaccine having better cell-mediated response.“Breakthrough infections (defined as SARS-CoV-2 infection >2 weeks after the second dose) were reported in 4.9% (24/492) of cases following both vaccines. Breakthrough infections were noted in 5.5% (22/399) cohorts in Covishield and 2.2% (2/93) of Covaxin recipients. Majority had mild (28/30) to moderate (2/30) Covid-19 infections and all recovered,” found the study.The phase II trial results of Covaxin published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases showed enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.According to a paper on immunology published in ScienceDirect, cell mediated immunity does not involve antibodies but rather incorporates the activation of macrophages (a type of white blood cell of the immune system that engulfs anything that doesn’t have, on its surface, proteins that are specific to healthy body cells) and natural killer cells enabling them to destroy intracellular pathogens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-immune-response-from-covishield-and-covaxin-study-101623051633436.html

After the release, farmers who were staging a sit-in outside the Tohana police station in the Fatehabad district, withdrew. "We have decided to no longer gherao the Tohana police station. One more person is still in jail and a meeting is underway with the police administration to release him," Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said, according to news agency ANI.Ravi Azad and Vikas Sisar were arrested on June 1 following their demonstration against JJP leader Devendra S Babli. During the protest, the farmers gheraoed Babli and shouted slogans against him and showed him black flags. Later, the member of the legislative assembly (MLA) filed a first information report (FIR) alleging that some of the protesters resorted to unruly behaviour and vandalised his car.After this, the farmers also demanded that Babli should be booked for allegedly using abusive language against the farmers and threatening them during the spat.On Saturday, the JJP leader released a video and apologised for his comments. “I forgive those involved in the June 1 incident and apologise for my comments at the time,” he said. Babli also said that he would withdraw the cases filed against Azad and Sisar.The farmers' protest against the three contentious central farm laws completed six months in May as thousands of agriculturists continue to sit at the Delhi borders demanding the Centre to repeal the legislation. Despite several rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmer leaders last year, the deadlock still remains.They are protesting against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Meanwhile, Tikait is scheduled to meet West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on June 9 to discuss the agitation. Mamata Banerjee has been very vocal against the farm laws and gave her support to farmers' protest. Several TMC lawmakers also visited the Delhi borders where farmers have been protesting since November last year.During the recently-held Bengal assembly elections, Tikait visited the state and campaigned for Banerjee's Trinamool Congress (TMC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-police-release-2-farmers-meeting-underway-for-third-protester-101623045976086.html
07-06-2021||India||Lakshadweep residents on hunger strike to protest ‘partisan’ regulations||Lakshadweep residents are on a 12-hour hunger strike on Monday to protest against three proposed rules governing tourism, cattle and panchayat elections, which they fear will destroy the unique culture and tradition of the island, home to around 70,000 residents.The Save Lakshadweep Forum, a body floated to channelise mounting protests against the rules, said local residents will fast in their homes and all shops and establishments, except emergency services, will stay closed from 6am to 6pm during the first major protest in the archipelago in the Arabian Sea. The island administration, led by Praful Khoda Patel, has warned of strict action under the pandemic laws to deter crowding at public places. “This is the first time all islands are observing such a protest. Though we have been assured repeatedly that local sentiments will be heard and addressed, the administrator is going ahead with his partisan and retrograde decisions,” said UCK Thangal, one of the convenors of the forum.Residents of Lakhadweep, an archipelago in Arabian Sea comprising 37 tiny islands—including 11 inhabited by humans--- have been protesting against Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (2021) that proposes to develop the islands as a major tourist destination. Residents allege it will destroy the islands’ character and identity since 97% of the islands are covered by pristine forests and 95% of its population belong to the protected scheduled tribe category. They are also protesting against Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation, which proposes to ban the killing of bovine animals and prohibit the consumption, storage, transport or sale of the cattle, meant in island environments. Most of the Lakshadweep residents are Muslims and they feel the regulations target their food habits. The residents are also opposing the Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, 2021, which proposes disqualification of candidates with more than two children in the gram panchayat elections.Many parliamentarians, former bureaucrats and artists have described the draft regulations as “arbitrary” and insensitive towards the majority community of the islands. Last week, the Kerala assembly passed a unanimous resolution seeking the recall of the administrator, and on Sunday, 93 retired bureaucrats sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticising the “partisan attitude” of the new administrator and urged him to protect the unique culture and tradition of the islands.A convenor of the Save Lakshadweep Forum, Thangal said 34 administrators have governed the UT since its formation in 1956 but a situation like this never arose. “Anger and fear have gripped the island like never before. Hope the Union government will realise the gravity of the situation and take corrective measures,” he said, adding the future course of protests will be decided after Monday. The letter to the PM written by the group of former bureaucrats alleges the draft regulations not only ignore the unique geography and community life of islands, but it also gives “arbitrary and draconian powers” to the administrator to acquire, alter, transfer and remove or relocate islanders from their property. They also pointed out that the Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (Goonda Act) is quite unwarranted and uncalled for. “According to the National Crime Records Bureau the crime rate in the island is very low compared to the rest of India, it has generated fear that the real purpose of the regulation is to smother dissent or protests against the policies and actions of the administrator,” the letter said.They said the proposed regulations were presently with the Union home ministry for approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-residents-on-hunger-strike-to-protest-partisan-regulations-101623042692802.html

These are forest areas, and we don’t have roads and proper ways of transport to reach the border area. But on Mizoram’s side, they have constructed roads to reach the border areas. There are some abandoned houses in Assam along the border and two of them were burnt by miscreants on Friday night,” police superintendent (SP) Ramandeep Kaur said.She added that while two cases have been registered and efforts were on to find the culprits, the border dispute issue needs to be solved by officials at a “higher level”.Last year too, several houses were burnt along the border, forcing around 50 families to move from Gutgutia-Gallacher; their abandoned houses were burnt on Friday night. Similarly, several houses were burnt, two government schools bombed and one person was killed in Cachar district’s Dholai constituency last year. Three districts of Assam’s Barak Valley, Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi, share a 164.6 kms border with Mizoram’s Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit districts. Despite several rounds of talks, the Assam-Mizoram border dispute is yet to be resolved.The border area in Hailakandi falls under Katlicherra assembly constituency represented by Suzam Uddin Laskar, who visited the site and appealed to chief minister Himanta Biswa Sharma to resolve the matter immediately. Hailakandi deputy commissioner Rohan Kumar Jha and Ramandeep Kaur visited the area on Saturday and Sunday and assured the locals that their lives and properties will be protected. “We have also tried to talk to the officials in Mizoram administration. There was fear among the people in the past... We have deployed our team in border areas and there will be a strict vigil from now on,” DIG (deputy inspector general) Southern Assam Range, Debojyoti Mukherjee said. Last year the issue had escalated to result in a standoff with a group in Dholai blocking the national highway connecting the two states for 11 days, which was partially resolved after Centre’s intervention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-tension-along-assam-mizoram-border-after-2-huts-burnt-by-miscreants-101623036992526.html

Maharashtra has seen 100,130 deaths due to Covid-19 so far.If Maharashtra were a country, it would have ranked 10th in the world, just after France (109,973 deaths) and before Colombia (91,422), in terms of Covid-19 deaths, according to data collated by worldometer. The United States of America (612,209) tops the list of fatalities, followed by Brazil (472,629). India ranks third (346,784).Also Read | Delhi unlock: Markets, shops reopen on ‘odd-even’ basis after nearly 2 monthsIn India, the gap between the state with the most fatalities and the second-most affected state is of 68,800 deaths. Karnataka, as per the data of the ministry of health and family welfare, ranks second with 31,260 fatalities.The state breached the 10,000-mark in Covid-19 fatalities on July 11, 2020, and went on to add 10,000 deaths every month till it crossed the 40,000-mark on October 10. As the first wave receded, the deaths were fewer between October and January.It took 91 days to go from 40,000 to 50,000 deaths, which happened on January 9, 2021. Subsequently, it took 99 days to cross the 60,000-mark. In the past 50 days alone, the state had added nearly 40,000 deaths. On April 18, the state breached the 60,000-mark in Covid deaths. Since then, it has added 39,657 fatalities. Officials and experts attribute the high number of deaths to more Covid-19 cases and transparent reporting of data. They added that lack of treatment protocol, logistics issues have also contributed to some of the deaths in both the waves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-crosses-grim-mark-of-100-000-covid-19-deaths-101623035792737.html

The state's sex ratio is 840, against the national average of 899, the SDG showed.The best performer in this category was Chhattisgarh, where male-to-female ratio at birth stood at 958 - much above the national average - the Niti Aayog report further showed. Kerala is at the second place with a sex ratio of 957.States like Punjab and Haryana, which have seen low sex ratios, have improved their position. While Haryana recorded birth of 843 females per 1000 males, in Punjab the number has reached 890.Overall, Kerala was the top performer with a score of 75 in the Niti Aayog index, while Bihar was adjudged to be the worst-performing state with a score of 52.The country's overall SDG score improved by 6 points - from 60 in 2019 to 66 in 2020-21.This positive stride towards achieving the targets is largely driven by exemplary country-wide performance in clean water and sanitation, and affordable and clean energy, the Niti Aayog said in a statement.The SDG index evaluates progress of states and UTs on social, economic and environmental parametres.First launched in December 2018, the index has become the primary tool for monitoring progress on the SDGs in the country and has simultaneously fostered competition among the states and union territories by ranking them on the global goals.The index, developed in collaboration with the United Nations in India, measures the progress at the national and sub-national level in the country's journey towards meeting the global goals and targets.In the first edition, it covered 13 goals, 39 targets and 62 indicators. In the second edition, the SDG index measured 17 goals, 54 targets and 100 indicators in the second. This year's edition (the third one) covered 17 goals, 70 targets and 115 indicators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-has-lowest-child-sex-ratio-in-the-country-niti-aayog-s-sdg-index-101623035143233.html

Protesting doctors also raised slogans demanding justice for junior doctors of MP and held placards of the AIIMS Delhi Resident Doctors' Association and the Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FRDA)."We are enraged to learn about the atrocities and callousness of the government of Madhya Pradesh," said representatives of the Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) in a statement. "The resident doctors are protesting for their rightful demands which were denied outrightly and the outraged administration is headed to spoil the careers of thousands of trainee doctors," they also said."Our healthcare system is anyways in shambles and any further reduction in manpower will affect it adversely," the statement added.The representatives of FORDA also met National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Chairman Justice Arun K Mishra (retd) and apprised him of the concerns of agitating junior doctors in MP.The doctors demanded that Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan immediately meet protesters and resolve the issue within the next 24 hours. Failing in doing so will lead to nationwide agitation, they warned.Thousands of junior doctors are holding a strike, demanding a hike in their stipends and reserved Covid-19 beds for them and their family members for a Covid-19 emergency. On June 4, nearly 3,000 doctors resigned from their respective duties after the MP High Court directed the protesters to resume their duties and called the agitation "illegal." Following this, the state government also sent eviction notices on Saturday asking them to vacate their hostels.In view of the protests that came amid the Covid-19 pandemic in the country which has already the healthcare system to its breaking point, the Madhya Pradesh government gave a raise of 17 per cent. However, the protesting doctors have rejected this and are sticking to their demand of a 24% hike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-junior-doctors-stir-aiims-safdarjung-residents-warn-of-nationwide-protest-101623027530086.html

These booths will start operating in all 75 districts of the state from Monday.The decision was taken after a review meeting chaired by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday.The state government has directed the districts to initiate at least two women special booths for focused immunity-booster drives. While one booth will cater to women between the age of 18 and 44, the other one to those above the age of 45.The Uttar Pradesh government has given instructions to set up these camps are in district women hospitals or district joint hospital. If there is a need, such camps can be set up in tehsils as well, as per the government order.Uttar Pradesh, meanwhile, crossed the milestone of administering 2 crore (2,02,34,598 to be exact) cumulative Covid-19 vaccine doses. It has so far inoculated 30 lakh people in the age group of 18-44, which is the highest in the country for this category.The chief minister said at the review meeting that the vaccination drive must be expanded to counter the third wave of Covid-19, which many experts say is expected to strike in weeks to come.“Till now we have administered more than 2 crore doses of vaccine against the coronavirus. In view of the huge population of Uttar Pradesh, we have to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination. We must now work upon expanding the 'Mission June' target by three times in July,” Adityanath said.Under 'Mission June', Uttar Pradesh has set a target of administering one crore vaccine doses in one month. The chief minister has asked for it to be increased three times for July so that 10 crore people can be given Covid-19 vaccine in the next three months. And on order to do that, at least 10 lakh people need to be administered the doses every day.“A district-wise strategy should be prepared to meet the target of 10 lakh doses a day in July. There is no shortage of vaccine. With the courtesy of the central government, many new vaccines will be available soon," said CM Adityanath said on Sunday.He added that about one lakh additional vaccinators should be trained, including the nursing students, in order to achieve the target.Around 22.80 crore people have been given vaccine doses across India and Uttar Pradesh accounts for 8.9 per cent of the total doses. In the last 24 hours, 3.88 lakh people received vaccine shots in the state, according to government data.Uttar Pradesh's Covid-19 caseload surged to 16,98,389 on Sunday with 1,165 fresh infections while the death toll climbed to 21,252 as 101 more people succumbed to the viral disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-uttar-pradesh-to-launch-special-pink-booths-for-women-101623023116102.html
07-06-2021||India||After 41 days, Odisha’s daily TPR dips below 10% but rising deaths trigger concern||For the first time in the last 41 days of the second wave of Covid-19 infections, Odisha’s daily test positivity rate dropped below 10 per cent raising hopes of quick decline in cases and an end to lockdown in the state.On Sunday, Odisha reported 7,002 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours from a test sample of 71,973 with a positivity rate of 9.72, the first time daily TPR dropped below 10% after going above it on April 26 when 6,073 people tested positive. However, the number of deaths remained high as 42 fatalities were reported over the last 24 hours. The number of daily fatalities has been over 40 for the last 5 days.Director of Health Services Bijay Mohapatra said the declining TPR and number of cases showed that Odisha was seeing a decline in transmission. “From 24 per cent 3 weeks ago to less than 10 is a good sign. If the fall continues to be like this the state government can slowly lift lockdown in a phased manner. Hopefully by the end of this month we would be in a comfortable position. Odisha government’s 3T formula- Tracking, Testing and Tracing to contain Covid-19 is succeeding,” said Mohapatra. Odisha on May 30 had extended its lockdown and complete weekend shutdown in the entire state to June 17.The decline in daily TPR notwithstanding, at least 19 of the 30 districts in the state continued to have weekly average TPR of over 10 per cent between May 30 and June 5 with Bhadrak leading the chart at 34 per cent followed by Dhenkanal at 31 per cent, Jajpur at 23.55, Khordha at 22.51, Balasore at 21.3 and Puri at 20.3. The state also has a TPR of over 13.53 per cent (last seven days average) as against the national average of 6.68 per cent.With 70,673 active cases, Odisha was at No 6 position among all the states and ahead of states like West Bengal (44,441), Chhattisgarh, (26,977), Rajasthan (21,550), Gujarat (22,110) and Uttar Pradesh (19,434).Noted microbiologist Dr TM Mohapatra said despite the daily TPR going below 10, the state would take some more time before the situation can be termed to be in control.“The weekly TPR continues to be high in 15 districts and more number of RT-PCR tests needed in those places to check the transmission under control. The government delayed in ramping up the tests in rural areas and this is leading to high TPR and rising fatalities. The actual number of fatalities may be higher as many such cases are not being recorded by the government machinery,” he said.Mohapatra said the fatalities may be rising due to high number of unvaccinated people getting infected, many patients reporting to hospitals at a later stage and ICMR and AIIMS treatment protocol not being followed by most Covid-19 dedicated hospitals. Public health activist and state convenor of Jana Swasthya Abhiyan, Gouranga Mohapatra also said Odisha is still not in a comfortable position. “The tests were ramped up over last fortnight and by that time the rural surge of Covid-19 had started. The rising fatalities that we are seeing right now is due to delayed detection of cases in rural areas where number of oxygen beds and ventilators may not be available. The deaths may also be rising due to addition of backlog cases over last few weeks. But the total number of deaths may be higher due to undercounting,” said Mohapatra.However, health officials said the deaths may be rising due to several Covid-19 patients turning critical. “Many patients whose condition had turned critical over the past few weeks may be succumbing to Covid-19 and that could be the reason of rising deaths,” said director of health Bijay Mohapatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-41-days-odisha-s-daily-tpr-dips-below-10-but-rising-deaths-trigger-concern-101623010831153.html

Traders resorted to various modes of protests to raise their demand of opening up of markets and trade establishments which have been closed since implementation of the curfew in the last week of April. State traders division (Chaudhary faction) offered milk to deity Ganga praying for wisdom for the state government for allowing shops of non-essential items also as Covid-19 cases have sharply dipped in the past few weeks. “We want opening up of markets as well as the Char Dham pilgrimage as trade business of Haridwar revolves heavily on Char Dham pilgrimage from April to November which is the Char Dham season. We also demand an economic package for affected traders as due to the earlier lockdown and now the curfew there has been a severe impact on us,” said state traders division president Sanjeev Chaudhary. Jan Vikas Kalyan Samiti president Kushal Pal Singh Saini demanded the opening up of markets on odd-even basis so that Covid-19 safety norms as well as the livelihood of traders can be ensured together. In Nainital district, traders held protests with black bands tied on their eyes. Some traders also burnt the effigy of the state government, demanding that they be allowed to open their shops. Angry traders also warned of non-cooperation if the state government doesn’t approve of their demands. Members of Devbhoomi Udyog Vyapar Mandal held protests at Patel Chowk market against the closure of markets by tying black bands on their eyes. Hukum Singh Kunwar, president of Devbhoomi Udyog Vyapar Mandal said, “Due to closure of markets for the last one month, traders are on the verge of starvation. We are unable to pay our loan instalments, taxes, electricity bill, and salary of workers and so on.” He said Covid-19 cases have sharply dipped in recent weeks but the government is continuing ahead with the curbs and restrictions, especially on traders. Govind Bagadwal, city president of Devbhoomi Vyapar Mandal said, “If the government is not concerned about the trader community who have been cooperating with the government since the Covid-19 outbreak then it’s high time we stand together and protest and they too have to work for safeguarding our interests. No assurance of any financial package has been given to us so far by the state government. They have left us on our own and is not allowing us to open our shops.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/traders-in-kumaon-garhwal-intensify-agitation-against-covid-19-induced-curfew-101623009511231.html

We will visit several areas in South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore,” news agency ANI quoted a member of the team as saying.The very severe cyclone Yaas made landfall in Odisha on May 26 and affected a large part of the state as well as West Bengal.“The team will hold meetings with officials of disaster management and finance department in Nabanna, the West Bengal state secretariat. The team will also visit Cyclone Yaas-affected areas in South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore,” people familiar with the development said.The West Bengal chief minister had said, as per initial assessment, the cyclone had led to damage of an estimated ₹20,000 crore to property and agriculture. She added that 18 lakh people were affected by the cyclone and around 2.21 lakh hectares of crops and 71,560 hectares of horticulture area suffered damage.On May 28, Modi had conducted an aerial survey of the cyclone-affected areas followed by a review meeting at Kalaikunda air force station. While Banerjee and the then chief secretary, Alapan Bandyopadhyay, a senior IAS officer, did not attend it, they met Modi for a few minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-team-visits-bengal-to-assess-cyclone-damage-101623009263366.html
07-06-2021||India||Nine states underutilised Covid-19 vaccine doses: Govt||At least nine states underutilised vaccine doses supplied to them between January and March, causing a slowing in the immunisation drive against the Covid-19 pandemic, according to central government data, with officials saying that demands by various states to widen and decentralise the inoculation programme may have been premature.India launched the world’s biggest vaccination drive against the infectious disease on January 16. In the first two phases of the drive up to March 31, healthcare and frontline workers were covered exclusively, followed by Indians older than 60 and those above 45 who suffer from co-morbidities.Data accessed by HT showed that Rajasthan, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra and Delhi majorly underutilised the doses provided to them.“These states, despite having adequate supplies of vaccines from the Centre in January, February and March, failed to commensurately use those supplies to effectively vaccinate a large enough proportion of their respective populations,” a top government official said on condition of anonymity.“In each of these states, the Centre supplied an increasing number of vaccines every month,” the official added.While the nationwide drive got off to a slow start amid vaccine hesitancy and lack of awareness, officials said some states failed to commensurately use the doses supplied by the Centre. In the first two phases, the vaccines were provided by the central government free of charge.While Rajasthan used 5.7 million of the 10.6 million doses supplied to it in the three months, Punjab used about 840,000 of the 2.9 million doses it received. Chhattisgarh used 1.9 million doses of the 4.3 million supplied to it and Telangana utilised only 1.3 million of the 4.1 million doses it was given. Andhra Pradesh administered 2.6 million doses of the 6.6 million shots it received and Jharkhand managed to utilised about 1.6 million of the 3.1 million doses it was provided. In Kerala, 3.4 million shots were administered, while the total number of doses provided by the Centre was 6.3 million.Maharashtra used only 6.2 million doses of the 14.3 million provided by the Centre till March 31, and Delhi administered 2.4 million of the 4.4 million doses it was granted.Data showed that while the pace of vaccinations in these states was abysmally low in the first two months of the vaccination drive, the coverage picked up in terms of the proportion of the total number of doses provided by the Centre in the third month.“A few states have contributed disproportionately to the slowdown in the nationwide vaccination drive,” the official quoted above said.Another official said that several states demanded that the vaccination drive be widened and decentralised to cover all adults very early in the programme, even though they were unable to utilise the doses provided by the central government. Now that the states are demanding that the process to purchase vaccine doses to ramp up supplies be centralised, the Centre is considering steps in this regard, the official added.The government’s data also showed that Delhi, Maharashtra, Punjab and Telangana have so far administered the first dose of vaccines to health care workers lower than the national average of 81%.Until June 5, India administered more than 230 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, second only to the US, which has administered about 300 million shots so far in the fight against the pandemic that began raging early last year||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nine-states-underutilised-covid-19-vaccine-doses-govt-101623008599901.html
07-06-2021||India||India logs lowest daily Covid-19 cases in 2 months: Data||With a little over 100,000 new infections across India on Sunday, daily cases in the country dropped to the lowest level seen in over two months, underlining the country’s turnaround after the brutal second wave of the viral outbreak.On Sunday, 101,237 new infections were reported across the country and 2,446 new deaths, taking the total number of confirmed infections in India to 28.9 million and deaths to 349,247, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard. While the daily cases were the lowest since April 4, or in 62 days, the number of reported daily deaths in the country touched a low of a month-and-a-half (or since April 22).The second wave of the pandemic has now seen a steady drop for four consecutive weeks across the country. The seven-day average of new infections in the country – which denotes a region’s Covid-19 curve – had touched a peak of 391,819 case a day on May 9, but has now dropped to 123,232 cases a day in the past week, a drop of over 68% from the peak, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.“The second wave is stabilising or we can see is localised at the moment as from at least 500 districts reporting nearly 100 or more daily new cases in May, the number has come down to around 250 districts as on date. Most districts have shown substantial decrease in numbers since the peak was observed May 7, and hopefully the numbers will go down further in days to come,” said a senior health ministry official.In a recent press briefing on Covid-19, the Union health ministry informed that only five states constituted two-thirds of all new infections in the country now.“Among our new reported cases, 66% are effectively being reported from just five states, which is a sign to suggest we have managed to contain the disease transmission in a localised area,” said Lav Agarwal in the briefing.The health ministry on Sunday said that the country has recorded fewer than 200,000 daily new cases for 11 continuous days now. “This is a result of collaborative and sustained efforts by the Centre and states, Union territories following the “whole of Government” approach... The country’s active caseload has dipped below 15 lakh mark… The caseload is below 20 lakh for seven successive days,” the ministry statement said.The daily test positivity rate has also dropped significantly, a factor that experts attributed to a significant increase in daily testing.The average weekly test positivity rate – proportion of samples tested that return positive for Covid-19 – in the country has now dropped 18 percentage points from the peak and is continuing to go down rapidly, offering what is perhaps the clearest sign of the country’s brutal second wave coming under control.For the week ending May 9, more than a fifth of all samples (22.8%) tested in the country returned positive, compared to just 4.8% in the past week. This turnaround is even more evident in the single day positivity rate, which has dropped to 3.2% on Saturday (the lowest in 81 days), compared to 25.3% on April 25 – the highest ever recorded.Much of this turnaround in positivity rate appears to be the direct result of a massive increase in testing. On average, more than 3 million samples have been tested in India every day in the past week – the highest this number has ever touched in the 15 months of the outbreak in the country. In fact, the daily rate of testing (seven-day average) has increased in over a million a day in just the past two weeks.Experts also say the numbers are indicative of a downward trend. “The numbers are stabilising but one recommendation cannot suit all states. This has to be local,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.“Each state has to make decisions on unlocking based on the objective indicators locally. The lower test positivity will have to sustain at least for two weeks while the load on hospitals is considerably eased, especially the availability of beds with critical care. Based on some of the indicators, gradual unlocking should be done,” he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-logs-lowest-daily-covid-19-cases-in-2-months-data-101623007719764.html

The Patna district administration has lodged FIRs against four private health facilities in this connection so far. It has also facilitated refunding excess payment to as many as five patients, encouraging them to withdraw their complaints. The Patna district administration, which has been proactive in this regard, has received 31 complaints against private health clinics overcharging Covid-19 patients. Twelve among them have been examined and show-cause notices issued. The complaints have been filed either directly by patients or their relatives and friends, generally after they were discharged from health centres. “In as many as five cases, we succeeded in facilitating refund of excess amount to patients or their relatives. FIRs were registered against private health centres who did not cooperate with our investigations,” said Chandrashekhar Singh, Patna’s district magistrate (DM), who constituted a special task force, comprising administrative officers, doctors, a drug inspector, a magistrate and police officers, for this purpose. The Patna district administration had empanelled a total 91 private health facilities for treatment of Covid-19 patients. They were, however, supposed to charge patients within the government approved treatment rate, capped at a maximum of ₹15,000 per day for non- National Accredited Board of Hospitals (NABH) hospitals in Patna and ₹18,000 per day for NABH hospitals. “We found that some empanelled hospitals were charging patients up to ₹50,000 per day. In some cases, they would charge patients ₹1,00,000 in the first couple of days and then release the patient or threaten to release them, taking the alibi that the government was not making oxygen available to them. We dealt sternly with all such hospitals and lodged FIRs against a few, sending a strong message across all private hospitals. Automatically, many others fell in line and began toeing the government order,” said Singh. “Inquiries into several other similar complaints are on and we will take them to their logical conclusion,” said Richie Pandey, Patna’s deputy development commissioner, also the senior nodal officer, treatment cell of Covid-19, constituted by the DM. The Hindustan Times has accessed a “provisional in-patient bill” of a well-known NABH-hospital in Patna that raised a bill of ₹2.44 lakh for 10-day hospitalisation between October 25 and November 4, 2020. Interestingly, the hospital has levied ₹38,000 as bed charges in Covid-19 “day care unit” (ward type), ₹42,495 for laboratory investigations, ₹29,000 as miscellaneous charges, ₹23,960 as ward procedure, ₹9,240 under hospital procedure and ₹5,200 as in-patient consultation charge. A whopping ₹94,070 has been raised against in-patient drug sale. A closer scrutiny of the bill revealed that the patient was prescribed costly investigations either daily or every second day. Some of the common investigations prescribed included liver function test, renal function test, complete blood count, D-Dimer (helps rule out the presence of a serious blood clot), ferritin (it helps understand how much iron the body stores), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) test, which looks for signs of damage to the body’s tissues, interleukin-6 (to check for chronic inflammatory disorders), C-reactive protein test (to check the level of c-reactive protein, produced by liver, in blood), urine culture and sensitivity test, etc. The August 20, 2020 order of the health department, fixing treatment rates for Covid-19, however, did not specify tests and drugs. As such, the hospitals exploited this loophole to the fullest and charged patients, prescribing these tests at their whims and fancy. Patna district magistrate accepted having come across several such cases. “We came across many such cases where costly drugs and investigations were prescribed repeatedly to patients. We could not do much because the government order fixing treatment rates only mentions basic medicines and tests, without specifying them. We have flagged it to the health department,” said Singh. “Doctors should tickle their professional morality and not exploit patients in crisis,” he added. In Gaya, two complaints were lodged of patients being overcharged, said its district magistrate Abhishek Singh. In both the cases, the private facilities refunded the excess amount to patients as soon as the district administration proceeded against them. The district administration even de-empanelled one of the 17 facilities for treatment of Covid-19 in the district after it overcharged a patient for high resolution computed tomography of thorax (chest), the government-approved being ₹3,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-private-hospitals-in-patna-under-scanner-for-fleecing-covid-19-patients-101623007110982.html

Ltd, has initiated a Phase-II clinical trial of a repurposed anti-tapeworm drug for treating coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the Union ministry of science and technology announced on Sunday.“CSIR in collaboration with Laxai Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., has initiated Phase-II clinical trial with anti-helminitic drug Niclosamide for treatment of Covid-19. The trial is a multi-centric, phase-II, randomized, open label clinical study to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of NIclosamide for the treatment of hospitalized Covid-19 patients,” the ministry’s statement read.Niclosamide has been extensively used in the past for the treatment of tapeworm infection among adults as well as children. The safety profile of this drug has been tested over time and has been found safe for human consumption, it added.The subject expert committee of the national drugs regulatory department, Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, recommended the Phase II clinical trial using Niclosamide, which is generic, affordable drug, and easily available in India and therefore can be made available to Indian population.Dr Ram Vishwakarma, advisor to director general, CSIR, said in a screen to identify drugs that can inhibit syncytia formation, Niclosamide was identified as a promising repurposed drug by a research group from King’s College London, which collaborated in the project.“Based on successful clinical evidence generated during clinical trials in Indian studies, emergency use authorization may be sought so that more treatment options are available to COVID-19 patients,” said Dr Ram Upadhayaya, CEO, Laxai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/phase-ii-clinical-trial-of-tapeworm-drug-begins-101623006728190.html
07-06-2021||India||After DMK, AIADMK also calls for NEET cancellation||Chennai: All India Anna Dravida Munnetre Kazhagam (AIADMK) coordinator O Panneerselvam on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to scrap the National Eligibility cum Entrance Exam (NEET) for admission to undergraduate medical colleges in the state. The letter comes a day after the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-led state government set up a committee headed by retired high court justice A K Rajan to study the impact of NEET on socially-backward students as part of the process to seek abolition of the national exam.In his letter, Panneerselvam recalled how late former chief minister and AIADMK supremo J Jayalaithaa had objected to the NEET exam since 2011 when it was first introduced. The move is interesting as the DMK holds the AIADMK responsible for allowing NEET to be conducted in the state after Jayalalithaa’s demise in 2016. The AIADMK, in return, has blamed the DMK as it was in coalition with the Congress during UPA-2 when the exam was introduced. In his letter to Modi, Panneerselvam listed six reasons why the NEET exam put students, especially those in rural areas, at a disadvantage. “Tamil Nadu had among the highest number of medical aspirants, especially poor and the marginalised, in the country when admission was based on class 12 marks. However, NEET made this entrance process difficult for marginalised communities,” he wrote. The former deputy chief minister requested Modi to take a ‘uniform policy decision to abolish’ NEET and common entrance exams for all professional courses ‘forever’.Abolishing NEET was one of the election promises of the DMK which formed the new government after securing 159 of 234 seats with its coalition partners in the assembly elections. Opposition parties have extended their support to the government and chief minister M K Stalin also wrote to Modi in this regard. On Saturday after cancelling the class 12 board exams, Stalin, in a separate letter to Modi, urged him to scrap all entrance exams, including NEET, in view of the pandemic. Stalin asked for the state to be allowed to fill all professional seats, including MBBS, on the basis of Class 12 marks as was the case before the NEET-scored based admission was introduced in Tamil Nadu in 2017. “I therefore urge you to cancel the conduct of all national level entrance examinations like NEET, as the same reasons adduced for cancelling the Class XII board examinations are equally applicable to entrance examinations as well,” his letter read. The Class 12 marks this year, he said, would be awarded by a committee headed by the School Education Department Principal Secretary. Such marks alone shall be the basis for admission to college courses, he said. As coaching for government school students did not yield desired results, the previous AIADMK regime in October 2020 introduced a 7.5% horizontal reservation in medical colleges for students who cleared NEET for the 2020-2021 academic year, a development considered as an achievement by former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami. Tamil Nadu had also communicated its stance against NEET to the Centre during a meeting in May with Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal and all states to collate their opinions on conducting CBSE Class 12 exams, which were subsequently cancelled in view of the pandemic. Experts believe that while the state’s move to scrap the NEET exam may be correct, they should not make any amendments without giving students ample time to be prepared for the change. “NEET shouldn’t be scrapped this academic year because students have been preparing for it and there are repeaters,” education analyst and founder of Career Guidance J P Gandhi said, adding: “Any radical change should be brought in by giving students at least 12-15 months to prepare for the change.” He said that while education is in the concurrent list, states should be empowered to manage them while the Centre can offer outlines.The DMK believes that NEET is against social justice and equality. If its appointed committee finds that the exam has affected socially backward students, they may suggest alternative admission methods and possible legal remedies for implementing it. Educationists have supported the workings of this committee. “NEET has turned into a commercialisation of coaching classes which has turned into a multi-million industry,” Gandhi said. “Before NEET came in, Tamil Nadu students who joined MBBS with just Class 12 scores had outperformed in the NEET postgraduate exams they wrote, which shows that the argument that NEET produces better quality doctors is false.”Bengaluru-based Tara Krishnaswamy, founder of Political Shakti and a commentator on politics, said the learnings from Covid-19 pandemic should be applied to understand that each state has to further its own healthcare system and medical education. The pandemic has exacerbated the need for decentralising and scaling-up healthcare centres, PHCs with equipment, doctors and medical staff across hinterlands, villages, towns and small districts,” she said. “NEET cuts students’ access to the right to education. It doesn’t encourage medical professionals within a state and the likelihood of improving your own rural areas and towns becomes lower,” Krishnaswamy said. “It is unimaginable that a student from Punjab admitted to Madras Medical College works at a PHC in a village in Tamil Nadu and infeasible as well. But, what is likely to happen is that when a child is born and raised in a village and sees that they don’t have enough doctors and medical care, he/she wants to become a doctor and when you prioritise them, they will serve their people in these areas,” she added. The national-level exam has gone through several legal and political wrangles in Tamil Nadu. The exam also drove several students to take their lives either for failing or over fears of not being able to clear it. S Anitha, a 17-year-old dalit girl, died by suicide after she failed to clear the exam in 2017 despite topping her school examination in Ariyalur district with 98%. She had earlier visited Delhi, impleading herself in the state government’s petition against the exam in the Supreme Court. The plea was, however, rejected. Anitha’s death resulted in widespread agitations against the state and central governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-dmk-aiadmk-also-calls-for-neet-cancellation-101623006451565.html

People may take anti-pyretic and anti-tussive for symptomatic relief, and inhalational of budesonide (given via metered dose inhaler with space device) at a dose of 800 mcg twice a day for 5 days for cough, the guidelines said. “No other Covid-19 specific medication required. Patient may have to be investigated further if symptoms persist or deteriorate,” it recommended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dghsrevises-covid-treatment-guidelines-101623006212478.html

On its anniversary, we reduce this pain by uttering ‘Khalistan Zindabad’. It can never be forgotten. It will be part of our memory forever,” Singh said, amid echoes of slogans during his address from the highest temporal seat of Sikhs on the 37th anniversary of the military action at Golden Temple.Even during his address last year, Singh had stated that every Sikh wanted Khalistan and if the government offers them the formation of a separate nation, “they will accept it happily”.“The Indian Army attacked Akal Takht just like it battled against China and Pakistan during wars... the treatment given to Sikhs was more oppressive and brutal than one given... to the losing side in a battle,” he said.“The community has already recognised Operation Bluestar as another ‘ghallughara’ (holocaust),” he said.Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Bibi Jagir Kaur endorsed the jathedar’s views on slogans.SGPC to initiate damages suit talks with CentreMeanwhile, the SGPC is set to begin negotiations with the Union government for out-of-court settlement of ₹1,000-crore damages suit related to Operation Bluestar, immediately after the 37th anniversary of the military action at Golden Temple.The suit was filed by the SGPC, under its then president Gurcharan Singh Tohra, in the Delhi high court in March 1985. Thirty-six years on, it is still pending. On the court’s order, both sides — Centre and SGPC — are ready to resolve the dispute out of court since 2019, but no meeting has been held so far.“The matter, which came to a standstill due to the pandemic, was discussed in our last executive committee meeting held on June 2,” said Bhagwant Singh Sialka, an advocate and general secretary of the SGPC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akal-takht-justifies-pro-khalistan-slogans-on-op-bluestar-anniversary-101623005780342.html
07-06-2021||India||Suvendu Adhikari’s ‘aide’ arrested in job scam case, MLA and brother booked for theft||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) found itself in a tight corner on Sunday when the Kolkata Police arrested an old associate of Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the Bengal legislative assembly, in a job scam case and the leader and his youngest brother Soumendu Adhikari were booked in a case involving theft of relief material in East Midnapore district, the home turf of the Adhikari family. This is the first time since the BJP emerged as a formidable force in Bengal and took the Trinamool Congress (TMC) head on in the 2019 Lok Sabha election and the recent assembly polls that a prominent saffron camp leader has been booked in a criminal case. In both polls – the BJP wrested 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats but bagged only 77 of 294 assembly seats last month – it was the BJP that highlighted the alleged involvement of TMC leaders in chit fund scams and the Narada sting operation case during campaigns. The saffron camp became the target of the TMC on May 17 when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested three TMC legislators, including two cabinet ministers, Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, and the former mayor of Kolkata Sovan Chatterjee, who left the TMC last year, in connection with the 2016 Narada sting operation case. TMC leaders accused the BJP of using the CBI to avenge its electoral defeat.In the job scam case, accused Rakhal Bera, a businessman based in East Midnapore, was held for allegedly taking ₹2 lakh from a man in 2018-19 by promising a job in the irrigation department that Suvendu Adhikari headed at that time. Police officials said some more people were cheated and they were on the lookout for Chanchal Nandy, another accused who reportedly claimed to be an irrigation department employee. Bera was remanded in police custody till June 12 by a Kolkata court. His lawyers told the media that he was a victim of “political vendetta” because of his proximity to Adhikari. “This is an attempt to malign the image of Suvendu Adhikari,” one of the lawyers said. Adhikari did not respond to queries from the media. After serving in chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet, Suvendu Adhikari joined the BJP in December last year and defeated her at Nandigram in East Mindapore district in the recent state polls. The BJP elected him as leader of the opposition in the state assembly. The TMC routed the opposition by winning 213 seats but Adhikari made news by defeating Banerjee by 1958 votes. His father Sishir Adhikari and the family’s second son, Dibyendu, are Lok Sabha MPs from East Midnapore. In the theft case, an FIR was filed against Suvendu and Soumendu Adhikari for allegedly stealing tarpaulin from the Kanthi municipality office. The case has been filed against the brothers on the basis of a complaint lodged by Ratnadip Manna, a member of the municipal administrative board. Soumendu Adhikari was head of the civic body till he resigned and joined the BJP last year. “We will fight the case in court. People will come to know the truth,” said Sishir Adhikari. “On 29 May 2021 at 12:30 pm as per direction of Suvendu Adhikari and his brother and former municipal chief Soumendu Adhikari of Kanthi municipality, government tripal (tarpaulin) whose estimated value is around lakhs of rupees, was taken away from the municipality office godown by forcefully and illegally opening locks,” read the complaint submitted by Manna at Kanthi Police Station on June 1. The complaint also said that the BJP leaders used central force personnel in the alleged theft. Reacting to the allegation that Adhikari was being targeted for political reasons, TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said, “The arrest of our ministers by the CBI was a case of vendetta because they were held after the investigation was over and the agency was ready to file the charge sheet. In these cases, the complaints have just been registered. The arrest in the job scam case is part of the investigation.” Reacting to the arrest in the job scam case, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said, “I don’t know who is close to whom. If someone has committed a crime then he will be punished. However, the lodging of the case is an admission from the chief minister that corruption marked her government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suvendu-adhikari-s-aide-arrested-in-job-scam-case-mla-and-brother-booked-for-theft-101623005670838.html

Last week, an old woman estimated half her mango crop was devoured by the Rhesus Macaques. This, a resident tells me, is a phenomenon no older than ten years. The villagers suspect that the forest department trapped the monkeys from another area, perhaps a city, releasing them here. But they also blame another phenomenon: a new roadway, frequented by pilgrims- a new food mecca for these monkeys, whose blessings these passing pilgrims seek. The villagers are stuck: they don’t want to deny the sacred monkeys food, but they are uneasy about these co-inhabitants who bite.This village isn’t a lone example. Monkeys are increasingly seen as a menace. This is sad as they are, in reality, internally displaced animals. As cities change, their traditional eating habitats are lost. Orchards, small farms, empty spaces or even forts-places they lived in, are disturbed, developed or destroyed. They are forced to move out in groups to clash with human beings. As pressure mounts to get rid of them, they are often captured and released elsewhere. If their groups are fractured, the lone stragglers turn aggressive.The solution is not to dump them elsewhere. A combination of meticulously undertaken and monitored sterilization processes, innovative awareness to end public feeding and ensuring natural food sources are key to a win-win. Over time, the population might reduce, but for now, there is no short-cut to bearing this expense.(The writer is Founder and Director Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/change-in-cities-led-to-monkeys-displacement-101623005351340.html
07-06-2021||India||Monsoon has reached N-E early: IMD||Monsoon has come four to five days early to the whole of northeast India, most parts of sub-Himalayan West Bengal, and Sikkim, said India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials on Sunday.New monsoon dates were issued by IMD last year based on onset data from 1961 to 2019, and withdrawal data from 1971 to 2019. Going by these, monsoon was expected to cover Sikkim and sub-Himalayan West Bengal around June 10.“But it has advanced to Sikkim and parts of Maharashtra four to five days in advance. The monsoon flow is strong and southwesterly winds have picked up on a large scale,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.Monsoon is likely to pick up further as a monsoon ‘low’ or a low-pressure area is likely to form over north Bay of Bengal on June 11.“Under the influence of that monsoon low, we are expecting monsoon to be vigorous and cover most of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal — all of east India by June 13. We are now getting very early indications that monsoon will reach western parts of the country earlier than expected too,” added Jenamani.But it’s too early to say if monsoon will arrive in Delhi early, officials said. “For now, we can say that pre-monsoon rain and thunderstorms are likely to begin over Delhi and parts of Uttar Pradesh around June 12 and 13 because of the low-pressure area that will develop over the Bay of Bengal. It’s difficult to say immediately if monsoon will arrive earlier than expected. Normal date is around June 29,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.This year, between June 1 and 6, the country has got 44% excess rain, with Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Punjab, etc, recording ‘large excess’ rain — 60% above normal.On Saturday and Sunday, Puddukkottai in Tamil Nadu recorded 19 cm rainfall, Tripura and Gangtok recorded 11 cm each, and Shirali in Karnataka and Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh received 10 cm each.The weatherman also predicts fairly widespread rain in the northeastern states and adjoining parts of eastern India in the next four to five days. Isolated heavy rain is very likely over Arunachal Pradesh on June 6 and 8; over Assam, Meghalaya, sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim on June 8 and 9; over Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on June 7; over Odisha on June 8 and 9; and over Gangetic West Bengal on June 10.Under the influence of the offshore trough (area of low pressure) at mean sea level from the north Maharashtra coast to the north Kerala coast, and a cyclonic circulation over Konkan and Goa, scattered to widespread rain accompanied by thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds was likely over parts of south Peninsular India and the west coast on Sunday and Monday.In its long-range forecast, IMD said monsoon rain, a key variable in the health of the rural economy, is likely to be normal at 101% of the long-period average (LPA) after two years of above-average rain. LPA is the average rainfall (88 cm) recorded from 1961 to 2010.India receives about 70% of its annual rainfall during the four-month monsoon that is crucial for rice, soybeans, and cotton cultivation. Good rains have been a prime reason for the farm sector’s resilience for two years despite the raging pandemic. India has over 150 million farmers and nearly half of Indians are dependent on a farm-based income. Agriculture is one of the mainstays of its economy. Monsoon spurs farm produce and improves rural spending. Monsoon impacts inflation, jobs, and industrial demand. It also replenishes 89 nationally important reservoirs critical for drinking water and power generation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-has-reached-n-e-early-imd-101623005190327.html
07-06-2021||India||BJP asks cadre to promote govt schemes ahead of 2022 elections||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday decided to popularise the central government’s social welfare schemes ahead of the upcoming elections in seven states next year, said a functionary familiar with the matter. In the wake of the second wave of Covid-19, the party will also train 100,000 health volunteers across the country to operate medical devices and perform other essential medical services.The decision was taken during a review meeting between BJP president JP Nadda and party general secretaries, where the different wings of the party were instructed to take stock of and promote the social welfare schemes launched by the Centre. For example, the Scheduled Tribe (ST) wing of the party was asked to focus on promoting the Centre’s Vandhan Yojana for tribals.“The party will ensure that there is awareness about the social welfare schemes and enhance its relief outreach,” said the functionary quoted above.“The party will also strengthen the organisation. In the coming days we will hold meetings at the booth and mandal level to strengthen the party’s presence on the ground,” said party general secretary Bhupinder Yadav.According to a person aware of the matter,after the meeting, Nadda and BJP’s general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and party general secretaries called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to apprise him of the party’s plans for the upcoming elections.The PM has advised the party workers to assess the performance in the previous elections and improve strategy to expand their support base to other communities as well, the person said.The states going to polls next year are Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Manipur, Goa, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab.Meanwhile, as part of its Covid relief campaign, Seva hi Sangathan, the party will also organise training sessions for volunteers about the use of medical devices such as concentrators and oxygen cylinders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-asks-cadre-to-promote-govt-schemes-ahead-of-2022-elections-101623004232958.html
07-06-2021||India||Kids in 30k families directly hit by Covid-19: NCPCR to SC||Children in more than 30,000 families were abandoned, became orphans or lost at least one of their parents between April 2020 and last week, according to the latest data submitted to the Supreme Court by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), which is by far the most comprehensive estimate provided by states on the status of children affected by the pandemic.The figures were uploaded by the respective states and Union territories on the NCPCR website “Bal Swaraj”. The commission in an affidavit filed before the top court added a disclaimer stating that the reason for death of parent(s) could be any and not just Covid-19.“The Commission is presenting the number of children who have lost either their mother or father or both parents from April 1, 2020 to June 5, 2021, based upon the information uploaded on “Bal Swaraj” portal up to 5th June 2021,” the affidavit of the NCPCR filed through advocate Swarupama Chaturvedi on Sunday said.The reason of death was not uploaded by the states/UTs, leaving open the possibility of the death of parent(s) having occurred for reasons other than Covid-19.The latest data shows that among 30,071 children affected during the pandemic, 3,621 lost both parents, a significantly high number of 26,176 lost either parent while 274 were left abandoned. Of the affected children, there are 15,620 boys, 14,447 girls and four transgenders. The commission categorised the data into age-wise brackets. This showed that more than 11,800 children are in the age group of 8 to 13 years, requiring urgent care. About 10,247 are between 14 and 18 years of age.This is the second affidavit filed by the commission in response to a query put by the top court on the number of children affected due to the pandemic. The possibility of a significantly high number of orphans during the pandemic and an urgent need to cater to their care and protection was raised by amicus curiae advocate Gaurav Agrawal, assisting the court in a suo motu petition on steps to contain the spread of Covid-19 in child care homes. The earlier affidavit filed by NCPCR on May 31 did not contain complete figures of affected children as many states faced technical challenges to upload data on the “Bal Swaraj” portal.The matter is fixed for hearing on Monday before a bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose. Along with the affidavit by NCPCR, a note prepared by Agrawal focusing on 10 states with regard to an identification mechanism of children affected by Covid-19 and steps taken to provide them care under various central and state schemes. These 10 states are Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand.Agrawal has made suggestions on protecting the property rights of orphans/children. His note stated, “A large number of children have lost their father, who was the earning member of the family. In some cases, there is absolutely no income, no insurance benefits and no property with the widow.”Agrawal suggested that when orphans or children in need of care and protection are produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), it could assess the financial capacity of the family or guardian and award an amount of ₹5,000 per child as financial assistance. Some states have already announced special financial schemes for such children, Agrawal added.According to data from NCPCR, most among the affected 30,000-odd children are at their homes with the single parent, guardian or family member, with only 819 in children homes (including observation homes and shelter homes), 41 in orphanages, and 62 with special adoption agencies.Among the states, Maharashtra recorded the highest number with 217 children orphaned and over 6,800 losing either parent. Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan recorded high numbers of orphans at 706 and 671, respectively. The NCPCR affidavit has requested the court to direct states and UTs not to share names or information about children in the public domain or provide it to any person/entity/organisation, making these children susceptible to trafficking, abuse, illegal adoption, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kids-in-30k-families-directly-hit-by-covid-19-ncpcr-to-sc-101623004110302.html
07-06-2021||India||Kannada content struggles for space on OTT platforms||With the mushrooming of streaming platforms, movies and soap operas have become accessible in living rooms across the country, breaking region and language barriers. Among the south Indian industries, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu movies have made their presence felt across the country on various over-the-top (OTT) platforms over the last few years, with a steady increase in non-native audiences. But, even in this gold rush, Kannada contents are still struggling to find a space for themselves.While a handful of Kannada movies have managed to do reasonably well on streaming platforms, regional content creators from the industry overall have struggled to find a slot on OTT platforms. In 2020, a Kannada web-series – Honeymoon – had a similar fate when it was not accepted by any platform. Later, a Telugu OTT platform, impressed by the content, did decide to stream it, but only after dubbing it in Telugu.Pawan Kumar, director of the movie U-Turn, which was the first Kannada movie to get an OTT release, said that while some Kannada movies have managed to find a space in India’s OTT experiment, they were not a success story as big as Malayalam industry. “Over the years, because of various movies in our language coming out on OTT platforms, Kannada content did get some exposure, but it has not been able to create a buzz like contents from Malayalam and other south Indian industries. It was this buzz and word-of-mouth that helped our neighbouring industry become so popular on OTT services. People went looking for Malayalam movies because of the buzz,” said Kumar.Kannada movie director Hemanth Rao, who was also a co-writer for the Hindi movie Andhadhun, took examples of short films to put his point across. “If you compare the views a Kannada short film and a Telugu short film has received, you will see the audience for the Kannada short film is less. Even the most popular short films in Kannada will have around only one million views. OTT work is based on market response. This is a reason for the poor response for Kannada content on OTT,” said Rao.An executive working with one of the streaming platforms that plans to expand its southern content, agreed with the lack of response to Kannada content.“In the entire country, Bengaluru reports the highest subscriptions and views. At the same time, the business from the rest of Karnataka is not as big. If you look at Bengaluru, the demand is not for Kannada content, but audiences here watch everything from international movies to regional movies. It is often the quality of movies or the buzz around them that attracts them. Kannada content per se doesn’t have such demand. One of the reasons is the low subscriptions from rest the state,” he said.“It is not all bad news,” said writer and actor Danish Sait, who has made two Kannada movies for OTT platforms. “I’m talking from my personal experiences. While comparing the situation three years ago, Kannada movies made a big jump,” he said.Sait added that OTT services have given a platform for content creators like him, who could not bring masses to the theatres like the big stars, but were able to create engaging content. “OTT has given a lot of people like me the big platform. We are the people who have made careers because of the internet and that is one of the reasons we know that the content we create is best suited for OTT. Because of the streaming services, we have been able to take our movies to a national audience and their response gives us the confidence to make more content,” said Sait.However, several film critics said that compared to the other southern industries, Kannada is yet to find its niche and more importantly, the number of quality films made in the language is limited. “If you look at the Malayalam industry, post-2010 there was a paradigm shift in the movies that came out of there. The quality of the movies ensured that there was an audience for these movies across the country,” said a senior film journalist with an online platform, who didn’t want to be named.“At the same time, Kannada movies continue to produce the so-called ‘event movies’, where the movie revolves around a superstar, and it is a spectacle created for his fans. Such a movie will never get a national audience. Yes, there have been some movies, like Thithi, but we could count the number of such movies on fingers,” she added.A Kannada director, who didn’t want to be named, said that in the new era of Indian cinema, the industry is stuck in a catch-22 situation. “The money at present is in making mass, superstar-based movies. Only some of them, like KGF, have gained audiences outside of the state. If the Kannada industry needs to mark in this new OTT experiment, we need fresh and nuanced content appealing to the new internet generation,” he said.“For this, most filmmakers who have the potential to make path-breaking movies need producers. But producers are not certain about investing, since Kannada movies are not getting enough space in the streaming services. In this chicken and egg situation, we are losing out,” he added.In the past few years, several attempts have been made to make local streaming services in Kannada, but they have not been successful. “I wouldn’t take names, but there were several portals that started streaming services in Kannada. They even got some good content. But for running such a service, you need a constant flow of funds. For example, ‘Aha’ streaming service in Telugu is backed by some major business groups, who saw the potential in regional content. Here, the owners are trying struggling for funding. In the lockdown, we saw that tier-two cities consumed more online content and even paid for it. Kannada missed that opportunity,” said the executive cited before.The film critic concluded that if Kannada movies have to make an impact on the national audience and thus on the streaming platforms, there is a need to relook at the quality of the content the industry produces. “Streaming is as big as a threatre release now. To make a mark in streaming services, our content needs to grow beyond event films for superstars. Our industry is known for producers like Shankar Nag, who were way ahead of their times. It is time to bring back such mindsets to industry,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kannada-content-struggles-for-space-on-ott-platforms-101622919745299.html
