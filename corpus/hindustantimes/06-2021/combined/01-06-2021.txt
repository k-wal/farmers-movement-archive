01-06-2021||News||India’s tax burden shifted from boardrooms to petrol pumps during Covid-19||The provisional Gross Tax Revenue (GTR) collection of the Union government was ₹20.24 lakh crore in 2020-21. This is slightly more than the ₹20.1 lakh crore which was collected in 2019-20. India’s nominal GDP suffered an annual contraction of 3% in 2020-21. That the Union government managed to increase its revenue collections despite a fall in GDP is an impressive statistic.An HT analysis shows that this otherwise impressive feat was achieved by disproportionately shifting the tax burden on the poor. In fact, the corporate sector today contributes the lowest share in taxes in more than a decade. This has happened at a time when corporate profits have seen a sharp spike, and inequality and poverty has increased. Unless reversed, such a regressive turn in India’s tax burden will have harmful consequences for mass demand and hence growth.How did the centre’s GTR in 2020-21 exceed 2019-20 levels? The devil lies in the detail. Every major tax head (corporation tax, income tax, customs, goods and services tax and Union excise duties), except customs and Union excise duties, saw a lower collection in 2020-21 compared to 2019-20. In absolute terms, only the excise collections have made the difference. On a year-on-year basis, corporation tax collections saw the biggest decline, whereas Union excise duties had the biggest jump. Union excise duty is the only tax head where actual collections have surpassed even the budget estimates in the Union Budget presented on February 1, 2020.Also Read | Prices rise again: Petrol costlier by 4.09/lt, diesel by ₹4.65/lt since May 4This is the result of a sharp increase in taxes on petrol and diesel. This hike was imposed when crude oil prices crashed, but still continues to be in place. Between March and May 2020, the Central government had overall increased the excise duty on per litre of petrol and diesel by 65.7% ( ₹13) and 101% ( ₹16) respectively from that prevalent before March 14, 2020.Majority of taxes on petrol-diesel are paid for by the poor While it may sound counter-intuitive, it is the poor and not the rich, who pay a bigger share of taxes on petrol-diesel. A March 2021 story in this newspaper, based on a survey conducted for the ministry of petroleum by Nielsen in January 2014, gave estimates of end-users of petrol-diesel. The summary findings of the story are worth reproducing here.Let us say that the government gained 100 rupees each from taxes on petrol and diesel respectively. The end usage data indicates that 60% (i.e. ₹60) of this total tax collected on petrol was paid by the two-wheeler owners, while only ₹37 was paid by the car owners. In case of diesel, the data suggests that for every 100 rupees gained by taxes, ₹13 is paid by the agricultural sector while commercial vehicles (including busses and trucks) have paid ₹38 of total increased taxes. This is bound to get passed on to the non-rich who use these for public transport or via increased transportation cost of goods. Private car owners would have paid ₹28.5 in taxes.Taxes on profits had the smallest share in overall tax basket since 2009-10 The share of corporation tax collections – taxes on profits of companies – in GTR in 2020-21 is the lowest since 2009-10. 2009-10 is the earliest period for which detailed tax data is available in the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s (CMIE) database. If the 2021-22 budget estimates hold, this figure will improve marginally: from 22.6% to 24.7% between 2020-21 and 2021-22. But it will not go back to previous levels.The fall in share of corporation tax collections in is likely a result of a sharp cut in corporation tax rates which were announced in September 2019. The government slashed corporate tax rates for domestic manufacturers from 30% to 22%, while for new manufacturing companies; the rate was reduced from 25% to 15% provided they do not claim any exemptions.A cut in tax rates generates tailwinds for retained profits, which accrue to the rich. To be sure, the bulk of India’s income tax collections also come from what can be described as statistically rich Indians. However, the fact that income tax collections fell by a much smaller amount than corporation tax collections during 2019-20 and 2020-21 (see chart 1) shows that owners rather than their white-collar workers had a better deal when it came to tax rates.Lower tax rates were an icing on the cake for corporate incomes A Business-Standard story based on an analysis of Capitaline database says that the combined net profit of listed companies was up 57.6% to ₹5.31 lakh crore in 2020-21. This led to the corporate profit share in GDP hitting a ten-year high of 2.63% compared to a record low of 1.6% in 2019-20. Profits went up in 2020-21 even though revenues fell, as companies managed to cut costs, both for raw materials and wages. This is what has been described as profit-led recovery by many experts.An overwhelming majority of Indians suffered a fall in incomes as the pandemic wreaked havoc on the economy. “In April 2021, only 4.2 per cent of households said that their incomes were higher than a year ago and only 5.2 per cent said that they expect their incomes to go up in a year”, said an article by Mahesh Vyas, the Managing Director of CMIE on the CMIE website. “These proportions used to be 33 per cent and 30 per cent in 2019-20”, the article adds. The really rich seem to have escaped this predicament and tax policy has helped this process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/indias-tax-burden-shifted-from-boardrooms-to-petrol-pumps-during-covid19-101622537693090.html
01-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai university hints at another academic year online||With exams to most undergraduate and postgraduate courses in colleges affiliated with the University of Mumbai (MU) coming to an end, the varsity is now busy planning the new academic year. While an official statement is yet to be released, varsity officials have confirmed that the upcoming semester 2021-22 academic year will be conducted online.“We have put together a team of experts which also includes deans of all faculties to chalk out a detailed plan for the next academic year. Since Covid-19 cases are still being recorded across the state, the new academic year will have to commence online,” said a senior official from MU. He added that the university will release circular highlighting rules and regulations for the new semester within a week. Amidst confusion over the regular lectures last year, the university had released a notification in the last week of August, directing all colleges to start the 2020-21 academic year online from September 7, 2020, onwards. Many colleges struggled for a few weeks before getting used to the virtual classroom routine. This year colleges seem much more prepared for regular lectures as well as exams.“We have asked for suggestions from several stakeholders and are trying to incorporate the most efficient ideas in a way that both students and affiliated colleges ease into it. While we know that lectures will have to begin in online form only, there are suggestions for hybrid teaching module as well, which could be implemented once the Covid-19 situation in the city improves,” said another official from MU. He added that for now, colleges will be asked to continue the same virtual format that they followed throughout 2020-21 to ensure a smooth transition from one year to another.In December 2020, MU released a circular clarifying the academic timetable for the 2020-21 academic year which clearly stated that exams have to be completed by May end and the summer vacation dates are from June 1-13. “As per this circular, we are reopening our college for the new academic year on June 14 and have already started preparing for the semester online. Students and parents too are unsure about physical classes, especially with the fear of a third wave looming over us,” said Marie Fernandes, principal of St Andrew’s College, Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-university-hints-at-another-academic-year-online-101622572019507.html
01-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: PILs seeks relief for Covid-affected specially-abled and orphans||Two public interest litigations (PIL) have been moved in the Bombay high court (HC) seeking protection and various reliefs to over 1,450 children orphaned after their parents succumbed to the Covid-19 infection and setting up of special Covid wards in Covid care centres with specially trained medical staff to attend to visually-impaired patients and special vaccination facilities for them.The first PIL filed by Gayatri Patwardhan, a social worker from Pune through advocates Asim Sarode and Ajinkya Udane has claimed that while the state has announced various reliefs and gave assurances of taking care of children orphaned due to Covid, there was no guarantee of the authorities keeping their word, hence the PIL sought various directions for the benefit of such children.The petition has sought to increase the grant of ₹1,100 per month for children up to the age of 18 years under the Child Care Scheme and Foster Care Policy to ₹5,000 per month. The petition also seeks free education for orphaned children and to start and implement Education Sponsorship Programme (ESP) under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act and the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) guidelines.The PIL also seeks directions to authorities to properly identify and prepare documents pertaining to caste certificate, birth certificate, property documents and identification records of orphaned children.The second PIL filed by Swagat Thorat, editor of a Braille Magazine, has raised concerns over the lack of healthcare facilities for visually impaired people and seeks reliefs including special Covid-19 wards, ‘barrier-free’ hospitals with specially trained medical staff to attend them and special vaccination facilities for them. The PIL also seeks direction to the state Disability Commissioner to provide data of visually impaired people who succumbed to Covid-19 infection, so that their families can be compensated through various government schemes. The PIL also demanded a scheme to support children and family members of visually impaired persons and increased economic support of ₹5,000 per month for blind persons under Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Yojana.The PILs are likely to be heard on Wednesday, June 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-pils-seeks-relief-for-covid-affected-specially-abled-and-orphans-101622571960222.html

The government on Monday issued a fresh notification extending the same scheme till September 2 considering the fact that most traders could not avail the scheme due to the start of the second wave of the pandemic in March end.“The scheme will now remain in effect from March 3, 2021 to September 2, 2021 with all the terms and conditions being the same as laid down in the GO issued on March 3, 2021,” the notification issued by additional chief secretary, commercial tax, Sanjiv Mittal said.Earlier, commercial tax commissioner Ministhy S on May 25 wrote a letter to the government proposing the extension of the interest waiver scheme that covers tax liabilities only prior to the GST regime that came into effect on July 1, 2017. The scheme offers 100% waiver of interest component on the arrears up to ₹10 lakh, 90% on the arrears more than ₹10 lakh and up to ₹1 crore, 50% on the on the dues between ₹1 crore and 5 crore and only 10% on the arrears if they are above ₹5 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-extends-interest-waiver-scheme-for-traders-till-september-2-101622571959520.html

The positivity rate of the state stands at 6.34%.The total number of tests conducted on Monday were 222,599 while the number of recoveries was 35,949. The state currently has 230,681 active cases while the total number of people affected by Covid-19 to date has reached 5,761,015. There are currently 230,681 active patients across the state, of which, Pune tops with 30,092 patients followed by Satara with 20,777 active patients. The death toll has now reached 96,198, with Mumbai leading with 14,849 deaths followed by Pune with 12,569.Mumbai on Tuesday witnessed 830 new cases and 23 deaths taking the case tally to 706,118 and deaths to 14,849. The last time the city reported below 900 cases was on March 2 when 849 cases were reported in the city. According to state health department data, the ​city’s recovery rate is 94% with 668,976 recoveries. The city’s fatality rate is 2.10% and there are 20,147 active cases. Dharavi- city’s former hot spot also recorded only three cases on Tuesday, taking the total to 6,828 and 6,449 discharges.Though the number of new Covid-19 cases reduced in May in the state compared to April, there was a higher number of deaths in May compared to April. There were 20,140 deaths in May compared to 13,835 in April.Subhash Salunke, advisor, Maharashtra government on Covid-19 management said the deaths in May are cumulative figures from April onwards. “The deaths which occurred in May are mainly of those who were affected by Covid-19 in April. The cases peaked in April and many of these deaths occurred in May. Hence, the number of deaths in May is higher than April,” said Salunke.Dr Jeevan Jain, physician from Lalbaug who has treated more than 15,000 patients said most of the patients struggled at least 20 days before succumbing to this virus. “Most of the patients take at least one week to get themselves admitted in the hospital. After that, the doctors try every method to revive them and even put them in ventilators to save them. This consumes a lot of days,” said Jain.There were 1,141,447 new Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra in May compared to 1,794,406 in April.The decline was due to various factors like the total lockdown, ramping of testing as well as early diagnostic results, coupled with beefing of hospital infrastructure.The private hospitals in Nashik have decided not to admit any new Covid-19 patients. Their contention was since the Covid-19 cases have come down, the government hospitals can accommodate them. The Pune Municipal Corporation, which started the walk-in vaccination drive for students planning to study abroad, saw huge crowds. Aurangabad and Nashik market places witnessed huge crowds after lockdown rules were relaxed there on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-14-123-new-covid-cases-mumbai-records-830-101622571839472.html
01-06-2021||Other||Now, seers to motivate people against burying dead along riverbanks||After the recent reports of people burying their dead by thousands on riverbanks from various UP cities like Hamirpur, Unnao and Prayagraj, seers spread across the length and breadth of the country will soon be touring and convincing rural folk as well as poorly educated residents of cities located on the banks of rivers against doing so. They will motivate them to go for cremations using eco-friendly electric crematoriums instead. Following an in-principle agreement among various senior seers of different akharas on the issue, Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP)—the apex decision-making body of 13 recognised Hindu monastic orders—has decided to table a formal proposal in this regard in its next meeting. The date and venue of the meeting will be decided soon. Some claim it to be an age-old practice among residents of certain region while other blame it on locals being unable to afford proper cremations due to sudden spike in cost of wood during the pandemic.“The practice of burying dead bodies on riverbanks is an old tradition among many communities and sects of Hindus of some regions across the country. Also, death owing to some specific reasons like snakebites or certain skin ailments besides dead bodies of children also prompt many to follow this practice as per their own beliefs. However, the threat of pollution due to these graves on riverbanks that rivers like Ganga and the Yamuna face cannot be denied,” said ABAB chief Mahant Narendra Giri.“So even as the governments are doing their bit, we believe that the saints of the country also need to do their bit to save our sacred rivers, many of which are revered as goddesses, by millions in India,” he added. “We want to involve all over 2.3 million saints affiliated with our different akharas who have presence in thousands of mutts, ashrams and temples dotting the country in this nationwide mission aimed at protecting the sacred rivers of the nation from pollution due to dead bodies buried on their banks,” Giri said.“Following support shown by various saints in private discussions, we have now decided to table a formal proposal in our next meeting which we plan to hold soon depending upon the status of the pandemic,” said Giri who is also the secretary of Shri Panchayati Akhara Niranjan, one of the 13 recognised monastic orders.With an aim to bring down the burials by one third within a year and further cut it down to half in another six months, the plan of the ABAP is to have the saints, who are revered and respected by locals, convincing people in cities and villages located along the rivers like Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Narmada and Kaveri among others to cremate their dead thereby not just protecting the rivers but also countless trees that are chopped to provide wood for traditional cremation, Mahant Narendra Giri said.General secretary, ABAP, Mahant Hari Giri, who is also chief patron of the Shri Panchdashnaam Juna Akhada, said burying the dead on sandy riverbanks needed to be stopped as this caused the sand getting displaced with time due to water current and strong winds and the bodies going into the river thereby polluting it.“Even as saints strive to convince people to stop burying dead bodies on riverbanks, efforts also need to be made to provide some land near villages etc to enable Hindus to bury their dead keeping in with the tradition of ‘samadhis’ as this too would help curtail people from using riverbanks for the purpose,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-seers-to-motivate-people-against-burying-dead-along-riverbanks-101622571779464.html

He was in complete disarray when his mother and elder brother tested positive for Covid-19 in April.Despite all efforts, Singh could not find a ventilator for his mother in the hospitals of Lucknow after which he sought help on Twitter. Several of his former students came to the rescue."Three of my students studying in medical colleges traced a ventilator bed for my mother in a hospital in Noida after which my mother could be saved," he said."The students' gesture prompted me to support those students who are severely hit by the second wave of Covid-19 either due to the death of their earning family member or due to the pandemic-induced unemployment of their kin," said Shashi."I decided to form a corpus fund of ₹11 from my pocket with the determination of arranging more funds for such financially distressed students," he said."I am providing financial assistance worth up to ₹25,000 for meeting the requirements of the annual school or coaching fees of such students," he added.Singh said he has already extended financial assistance to nearly 16 students who hail from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bengal and others.One of his students, on condition of anonymity, said that he lost his father to Covid-19 but Singh approached him with ₹25,000 assistance which helped him with his school fees.Shashi Prakash Singh, popularly known as SPS Sir, resides in Kota, Rajasthan and has been teaching for 14 years now in various coaching institutes, such as Aakash, Allen, Pathfinder Academy etc, to name a few. He is presently one of the top educators on the coaching portal Unacademy.Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Singh decided to support 2021 families by investing all his savings and assets.Shashi said that he strongly believes that the strongest pillar for the middle and the lower class people is education which is the only platform that can secure their future and provide more security to the entire family. "Financial instability, especially in current times of crisis, can strongly hinder their education which can put many families’ future in darkness," he said."It is my opinion that money should never be a limiting factor in anyone's success and bright future," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/kota-teacher-pledges-support-to-over-2-000-students-amid-covid-19-crisis-101622570680706.html

The efforts of local activists have helped reunite the girl, now 17, with her family. With the maturity that six years can bring, the girl probably realised that she had erred in taking the rash step of running away from home. Till now, living in a children’s shelter home in Ghaziabad, the girl made a video explaining who and where she was, making a desperate appeal that her parents be traced in Prayagraj. In the video, she described how she had run off to Mumbai and was put in a children’s shelter there. A couple of years later, she was transferred to the shelter home in Ghaziabad. The rest, as they say, is history. The video went viral. Arshad Nawaz, a Prayagraj social activist received it around a week back. “In the video, the girl did not mention an address or a mobile number. She did mention the name of Mumfordganj locality. I tried to trace her parents but to no avail,” Nawaz said.Nawaz then approached his friend Anwar, who traced the girl’s parents to Myorabad locality nearby. They had since shifted from Mumfordganj.“The girl’s father, Saleem, had lodged a missing person’s complaint at the Colonelganj police station but even the police failed to locate Shaheen. Years passed and the family lost all hope of finding their lost daughter,” Nawaz said. Nawaz then took the help of juvenile court magistrate Saim Zaidi, who called his counterpart in Ghaziabad. The juvenile court magistrate in Ghaziabad, Madhu, traced Shaheen to the Grace Care Home child shelter. After tracing exactly where Shaheen was, he reached out to her family and informed them that their daughter had been found. Juvenile court magistrate Saim Zaidi said the reunion of Shaheen with her family required a lot of paper work. As the family was not financially strong, they were helped in documentation and were even provided with train fare to reach Gaziabad.Shaheen’s parents are now in Gaziabad and have met their darling daughter. The happy family is expected to return to Prayagraj on Wednesday after completing a few formalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/six-years-later-runaway-girl-unites-with-family-thanks-to-activists-101622571059503.html
01-06-2021||Gurugram||City reels from power cuts as officials grapple with damaged infrastructure||Several residential areas of the city witnessed long power cuts, up to 14 hours in some instances, since Sunday night after strong winds uprooted electricity poles and trees collapsing on electricity infrastructure.Officials of the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) said that rain and thunderstorm on Sunday and Monday damaged a few distribution cables and more than 10 electric poles in the city.PK Chauhan, the superintending engineer of DHBVN, said they were aiming to repair the damaged electric poles, transformers and cables by Tuesday night, provided there is no disruption due to further rain or thunderstorm. “We face issues when the infrastructure is damaged. Our teams work around the clock in such times and we ensure people get an uninterrupted power supply. There have been issues due to thunderstorm but teams are repairing the poles and transformers,” he said. Power outages were mainly reported from Sushant Lok-1, South City-1, DLF Phase 3, sectors 31, 46, 56 and 57, and developing sectors. Residents alleged there was no electricity since 1am and despite repeated calls to DHBVN officials, there was no respite. In some areas, residents complained that the power supply was not restored till Tuesday evening. The city has been witnessing spells of heavy winds since Sunday night. On Sunday, an old tree next to the old MCG office in Civil Lines was uprooted due to the high-speed winds and slammed against the MCG building, damaging the office ceiling. As per the IMD’s forecast, a partly cloudy sky with one or two spells of rain or thundershowers may further be witnessed this week. AK Nagpal, former president, Sushant Lok-1 RWA, said that the power infrastructure in the city was poor, and even light spells of rain often led to frequent power outages. “Power went off around 12.30am on Tuesday and was restored only around 11am. The authorities should inform residents about such long hours of power cuts. There is no communication on part of the distribution company and people, including Covid patients, are being left to suffer,” he said. Residents also said that the power outage hampered their work routine. A resident of DLF Phase 3 said that his family members charged their phones and electronic gadgets at their friends’ place in other areas. “The invertor batteries also died out as there is no power since 1am on Monday. Senior citizens are living alone and managing on their own. It becomes very difficult to manage without electricity,” said Nitin Gaur. In many areas, the power supply was hampered due to faults in cables, said DHBVN officials, adding that the power was restored in the first half of the day. “During rains, the number of complaints increases because of snapping of trees which disrupt supply. All efforts are being made to restore power to affected areas at the earliest,” said Chauhan.The residents of Sector 46 complained that there was no power throughout Monday and Tuesday, barring for one hour of supply.“We suffered immensely due to the power cut that started around 1am on Monday. There was no water supply, as, without electricity, we could not even pump water,” said Rajkumar Yadav, RWA president. Residents also complained that despite DHBVN repeatedly asserting that it was upgrading infrastructure across the city, the situation on the ground had improved very little. Joginder Singh, former president, RWA Sushant Lok-3 said that there was a major fault in their area, which took almost 12 hours to be fixed. “There was no power all night and on Tuesday, we got very little power supply. The fall in temperature helped a bit though,” he said. Vijay K Kapoor, a resident of South City-1, said that the area was the worst hit as there is power disruption of at least four hours every day, coupled with low voltage. “The low voltage is a chronic problem, due to which most of the gadgets don’t work and also malfunction and get damaged often,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/city-reels-from-power-cuts-as-officials-grapple-with-damaged-infrastructure-101622570099325.html

As many as 30 cars were damaged in residential areas of sectors 56, 57, Sohna Road, Golf Course Extension Road, Manesar, Palam Vihar, Dundahera, Badhshahpur and sectors 17 and 14 on Monday night. Residents woke up to see uprooted trees lying on their cars on Tuesday morning.The police control room received 36 calls on Monday and 42 on Tuesday regarding damaged properties and electricity poles. Pankaj Parashar, the fire officer of Sector 29 station, said that they received several calls from residents about damaged cars due to uprooted trees. “We had sent vehicles to different areas to remove the trees and tried to pull up electric poles which fell on Monday night. We have cleared several roads which were blocked due to the falling of trees. Damages have been reported from many parts of the city,” he said on Tuesday. The city has been facing extreme weather conditions over the past two days, being hit with thunderstorms during the night. Clothes, chairs and other household goods were strewn across the floor due to the winds.As per a forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), there is a possibility of a partly cloudy sky with one or two spells of rain or thundershowers on Wednesday as well. Officials said the sky will remain cloudy and a thunderstorm could also be in the offing. The minimum temperature on Tuesday was recorded at 21°C, five degrees below the normal for this time of the year, and the maximum temperature was 33°C. However, data on wind speed was unavailable.Anoop Kumar, a resident of Sector 17, said that he was driving back home from Jaipur and took the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR) road to drop his friend in Sector 71 when a tree landed on his car. “As soon as I took left towards SPR, a heavy tree fell on my car. We escaped unhurt but the roof of my Honda City and front bonnet were damaged. We called another friend to drop us home and called a crane to tow the car to the service centre,” he said. Many residents said they moved their cars to sheltered spots when winds started blowing in the night.Amit Jindal, the president of Vipul Greens residents’ welfare association (RWA) on Sohna Road, said that recent storms caused substantial damages to trees and at least five cars. “Every year, fully grown trees are uprooted due to thunderstorms that damage cars parked in open slots. In the last storm on Sunday night, at least four trees and four cars were damaged. As the storms rage, we see residents running to get their cars to safety. In the process, they risk their lives amid falling branches,” he said. Yashesh Yadav, a resident of Vatika India Next, a residential society in Sector 83, said that sudden extreme weather condition on Sunday and Monday night brought down many big trees in their township, which damaged vehicles parked in the society. “We were able to move a few of them in time, thanks to the alertness of the guards, but still, more than five vehicles were damaged. Fortunately, no one was hurt during the storm,” he said. In Sector 46, at least 10 vehicles were damaged on Sunday night due to a thunderstorm. “I had parked my car around 1am outside my house and around 5.30am, when I went to check my car, I saw a huge tree trunk had fallen on three cars including mine, and damaged them,” said Rahul Kumar, an executive working with an IT company in Udyog Vihar. Rajkumar Yadav, the president of Sector 46 RWA, said that more than 20 trees fell in the sector damaging properties on Monday night. “Trees even blocked the roads, leading to traffic issues in the internal sector roads. We hired people to remove the trees and sent all damaged vehicles to workstations for repair. Residents have suffered losses due to natural calamity, but authorities should have timely pruned the trees. No one even bothers to check independent residential areas,” he said. At least five cars were damaged in sectors 56 and 57 on Sunday and Monday night, said residents. Joginder Singh, a resident, said that water tanks were flung on the parked cars during the storm, causing severe damage. “Residents in these sectors park their vehicles on the road outside their houses which are prone to such calamities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/thunderstorm-pulls-down-trees-leaves-properties-damaged-101622570039992.html
01-06-2021||Bhopal||MP govt warns of action as junior doctors' strike enter 2nd day||Around 3,000 junior doctors from six medical colleges in Madhya Pradesh continued their strike for the second day on Tuesday to press for their various demands, including free treatment for them and their families if they contract Covid-19.However, the state government has warned of action if the strike continues.On Monday, the protesting doctors abstained from work at the Out Patient Departments (OPDs), the In-Patient Departments (IPDs) and other wards of various health care facilities.They also withdrew from Covid-19 duties on Tuesday, MP Junior Doctors Association president Arvind Meena told PTI.The association, comprising around 3,000 members from six medical colleges in the state, has demanded that beds for junior doctors serving Covid-19 patients be reserved in separate areas in case they contract the infection.It has also demanded that medical treatment should be free for such doctors as well as their family members.Meena said there has not been a hike in their stipend since the past couple of years, despite an assurance from the state government.Earlier, the junior doctors went on a strike on May 6, but resumed a few hours later after the state government assured them that their demands would be met.Meena claimed the state government had then promised that the association's demands would be met, but nothing has materialised so far.The association has now demanded that the government release a written order fulfilling their demands, he said.Meanwhile, state Medical Education Minister Vishvas Sarang said the government will take action if the protesting doctors do not resume work."It is unfortunate that when society needs them the most, the doctors are on strike. The government has accepted their demands. The state government is paying a stipend of ₹60,000 to ₹70,000 per month tothem," Sarang told reporters when asked about the matter.He said four out of six demands of the junor doctors have been accepted completely, but they are still maintaining a stubborn attitude."This is like blackmailing patients. It is an unfortunate situation, that when the time comes to fulfil the resolve with which they have become doctors, they have started blackmailing the patients," he claimed.Sarang said he has requested the doctors return to work as soon as possible."If they do not return to work, then we will definitely have to take action. It will be difficult for us to tolerate any injustice to patients," the minister added.However, MP Congress chief Kamal Nath said the state government should consider the demands of the junior doctors."They are on strike to press for their 6-point charter of demands. Health services are being affected by their strike in this period of pandemic. The government should immediately consider their demands sympathetically and take a decision in the public interest," Nath said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-govt-warns-of-action-as-junior-doctors-strike-enter-2nd-day-101622567979985.html
01-06-2021||Gurugram||Shop owners to get ownership on discounted collector rate||The Haryana government has decided to give ownership of shops to people who had taken those on lease or rent from the municipalities for over 20 years — on a discounted collector rate, and this is likely to help thousands of traders in Gurugram.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced on Sunday that traders and business owners have been renting shops in Sadar Bazar, Sabzi Mandi, Old Railway Road and other adjoining areas in the district over the years can now get ownership of the properties.Gurugram and Faridabad traders, who have rented shops from the civic authorities, welcomed the move and said that “this has been a long pending demand”.Bablu Gupta, president, Sadar Bazar Traders Association (SBTA), said that it was a beneficial announcement. “There are over 1,000 traders in Sadar Bazar, who will be benefitted by this scheme as everyone wants to get property ownership. The rebate announced by the CM will also ensure that reasonable amount of money has to be paid,” said Gupta, adding that this move will also generate a large amount of revenue for the state government.Sadar Bazar traders said that property ownership will allow them to redevelop these properties, and also make repairs and changes to the structures. “The state government should also make provision so that the payment could be collected in instalments over one year instead of two months,” said Kishan Sharma, a trader.Faridabad traders, led by Faridabad Vyapar Mandal, also said that the decision to grant freehold ownership of shops to traders will benefit them greatly.Madhu Azad, Gurugram mayor, said, “There are a number of such properties owned by the corporation in Sadar Bazar, Sabzi Mandi, Old Railway road near Bhim Nagar, and eligible traders can take advantage of this offer. This offer of ownership will also generate revenue for the corporation and the government.”Azad also said that the government notification in this regard was still to reach the MCG and the modalities of the offer of ownership would be clearer once the written directions reach them. As per the announcement made by the CM, an eligible person must have the possession of property for 20 years as of December 31, 2020, to avail the scheme.Khattar said that once the eligible persons apply, they will get relaxation in collector rate and those who have possession of the properties for over 50 years will get a rebate of 50% on the collector rate. Likewise, those having possession for 40 years will get a rebate of 40%, possession for 30 years to get 30% rebate, and possession for 20 years to get 20% rebate. At least 20 years is also the minimum period required to avail the benefit of this scheme.The beneficiary will have to deposit 25% of the amount within 15 days, and the remaining 75% of amount in 45 days — based on the collector rate, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/shop-owners-to-get-ownership-on-discounted-collector-rate-101622568599800.html

Vaccination for those aged above 45, however, continued at all 37 government facilities on Tuesday. “We have sufficient doses for people aged above 45 years. Therefore, vaccination for them will continue at all 37 government health centres. However, for adults below 45 years of age, we are yet to receive stock from the state health department,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation. Currently, Covishield doses are being given at all health centres except Tigra, Chauma, Manesar and Badshahpur, where Covaxin is being administered to those aged above 45 years. The district health department held a major vaccination for people in the 18-45 age bracket on Monday by allowing direct walk-in at health centres and administered over 8,200 doses in a single day. But due to lack of vaccine supply, the department suspended vaccination for 18 above on Tuesday. According to the health department data, 701,224 doses have been administered in the district till now, of which 9,584 doses were administered on Tuesday. Over 5,518 people in the 18-45 age group took their vaccine shots at private hospitals. Among those aged 45 and above, about 3,133 people took their doses at government health centres, and 479 were inoculated at private facilities. About 130 healthcare workers and 324 front-line workers and their family members also took the vaccine shot. Despite the shortage of vaccines, the health department has conducted multiple drives in May to cover high-risk population groups. On Wednesday, the health department will hold a special Covid-19 vaccination camp for widows at four government health centres. It will cover at least 400 women of all age groups, who are registered under the social welfare scheme. Officials said that women have been informed about the vaccination camps by the department of social welfare. “Camps for widows will be held at the community health centre in Farrukhnagar, subdivision hospital in Sohna and Pataudi block, and Polyclinic in Sector 31 under Gurugram block. The health department has been trying to reach out to people who should be prioritised for vaccination, like widows, having all the responsibilities of the household in the absence of the husband. It is important to keep them on priority so that they are not missed from getting vaccinated,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. On May 30, the health department held a special vaccination camp for the transgender population at Dundahera. They have also conducted camps for adults with special needs at Ambience Mall and differently abled people in Pataudi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vaccination-for-18-45-group-on-hold-for-second-consecutive-day-as-district-awaits-doses-101622568599245.html
01-06-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19 case count falls below hundred, but deaths remain a concern||The district on Tuesday reported 86 new coronavirus infections, the first time it has dipped below hundred since March 17, when 97 cases were confirmed. The test positivity rate, the proportion of positives out of the samples tested, has now dipped to 1.9%, according to the district health department data. However, fatalities continued to remain high in the district, with over 10 deaths being reported every day since May 1. The highest number of deaths in a single day was reported on May 6, when 15 people had died of Covid.According to the health bulletin, the district on Tuesday confirmed eight Covid-19 deaths, taking the toll to 827. Among them, at least 558 had co-morbidities while 269 succumbed to Covid without having any previous illness. The number of cases per day has been steadily declining since May 21, when the case count fell below 1,000 (about 623) in a day after almost two months. The active case count reached 1,336, while the total tally of infected people is at 180,032. Officials and experts attribute the lockdown and aggressive testing in large outbreak areas as key reasons for the constant decline in transmission of infection. For the last one week, the positivity rate has been maintained at 2%, indicating that transmission has been under control in large outbreak areas, well below the 5% threshold set by the World Health Organisation, for the first time since May 23 (when it was nearly 3.5%). Before that, the positivity rate varied between 32% and 15%, with more than 4,000 new Covid-19 cases being reported every day. According to the district health department data, nearly 42% of Gurugram’s Covid-19 deaths were recorded in May. Of the 827 Covid-19 fatalities since the start of the outbreak, 343 were recorded in May alone.Health department officials attributed the high fatality rate to a large number of people contracting coronavirus from mid-April till mid-May.Officials said that infected persons, in several instances, died due to complications arising from the virus after undergoing treatment for two to three weeks. Hence, they said that the fatality figures in May were higher as it also included those who contracted the virus in mid-April.Between April 11 and May 16, when the cases were spiking, the district recorded 103,458 new Covid-19 cases, nearly 58% of the total Covid-19 cases recorded in the city since the start of the outbreak till June 1. Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer (CMO), health department, said that a significant number of people had contracted the virus in late April and early May that resulted in high fatality numbers.“Due to the city being under lockdown for the entirety of May as well as the intensive screening in large outbreak regions (LORs), and quarantining of suspected or confirmed Covid-19 cases, we were able to break the chain of transmission. The daily registering of cases has now reached two digits from the peak of 5,000 cases a day and the positivity rate has also come down below 2%. In June, the fatality numbers will see a major drop,” said Yadav.Patients who need intensive care or need to be out on ventilator support has also declined to 176. Until May 24, about 1,758 people were admitted to various private hospitals, which reduced to 509 on May 25, as per the health bulletin. Since then, it has been on a steady decline, reaching 227 on May 31. Yadav said, “Strict enforcement of norms on home isolated positive patients, effective contact tracing and increased testing will continue to control the transmission. Above all, people will have to follow appropriate Covid-19 behaviour by maintaining social distancing, wearing a face mask and avoiding unnecessary movement.” Despite the drop in the numbers, Yadav said that the health department will continue to monitor the situation closely. “The process of unlocking has started. Malls have reopened and people have started venturing outdoors. We are monitoring Covid-19 behaviour closely and ensuring norms are followed. Otherwise, coronavirus cases can once again surge in June,” said Yadav.In comparison to April, however, the city recorded marginally fewer cases in May.In April, the district recorded 59,921 new Covid-19 cases, while 57,012 new cases were recorded in May. However, the recoveries in May were much higher than in April, as 91,837 people recovered from Covid-19 in May, compared to 25,059 in April.“There is a considerable change in the Covid-19 situation at the start of May compared to its end. When the month started, Covid-19 was at its peak but now it is on the downward slope. We are hoping that the trend continues in June as well and all efforts would be spent in ensuring the virus remains at its minimal,” said Dr Yash Garg, deputy commissioner.On May 1, the city had 36,693 active Covid-19 cases, while on May 31, it decreased to 1,529.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-case-count-falls-below-hundred-but-deaths-remain-a-concern-101622568542281.html

However, as the hill station’s tourism has been badly hit by the Covid- induced lockdown, many in the horse-ride business have started abandoning the horses. These animals are now being adopted by NGOs like the Sadhu Vaswani mission. As many as 297 horses abandoned by operators hit by restrictions, are now being provided fodder. According to Azeem Dange, who owns eight horses, their livelihood has been badly hit due to the pandemic after local authorities imposed a lockdown in April in Mahabaleshwar, which attracts a large number of tourists from Pune and Mumbai. For these tourists, the horse ride on the table-top of the hill station has been a major attraction. “In normal times, our entire family used to earn our livelihood by taking tourists on horse rides in the hill station. However, the pandemic has put brakes on all leisure activities here, making it difficult to manage fodder for our horses,” he said. He added that generally a horse needs 15 kg of fodder per day, which costs ₹500 to ₹600, and it has becoming difficult to provide adequate fodder to the starving horses. “It was me, who reached out to the Sadhu Vaswani mission informing them that the horses in Mahabaleshwar were starving as most of the owners were not able to provide fodder. The volunteers of the mission then came here, conducted a survey, and made arrangements for fodder by engaging with local suppliers,” he said. Sadhu Vaswani Mission recently adopted 150 starving horses from Panchgani. Earlier, the mission adopted 147 horses from Mahabaleshwar, facing a similar situation due to the second wave of the pandemic. “Once we adopted horses in Mahabaleshwar, we realised that the situation would be similar in other regions where tourism is the basic earning factor. Following a survey, we found that another 150 horses in Panchgani were undergoing the same plight, so we decided to add them into the mission family,” said a Vaswani mission spokesperson. According to the mission, there are total of 298 horses, including new-born foals, that are now being provided daily fodder by Sadhu Vaswani Mission. The fodder is sourced from a local provider. Each horse eats about 10kg of fodder per day. The cost of the fodder is ₹10 per kg. The daily cost for a feeding a horse is ₹100. The mission plans to continue serving the horses until the need is there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/297-horses-abandoned-in-mahabaleshwar-panchgani-sadhu-vaswani-mission-to-the-rescue-101622567879190.html

So much for good governance and accountability,” tweeted the NC vice-president.This is the second time in three days when Omar took potshots at the government on the issue of chief secretary. Earlier, Omar, in a tweet, had said that Subrahmanyam wasn’t keen to handover charge to the new chief secretary.“Very unusual order issued by the J&K government. If I didn’t know better, I’d read this order to mean the outgoing CS wasn’t too keen to hand over charge to his successor. Either way, I haven’t seen an order like this before,” he tweeted, while posting a government order about the new chief secretary.He blamed Subrahmanyam for trying to undermine the mainstream politicians in J&K.“A man who famously said no Kashmiris shed tears when mainstream politicians were detained in 2019. In 2021, it looks like no one can wait to show him the door. Be careful who you step on, on the way up, you will meet them on the way down,” Omar said in another tweet.Subrahmanyam was appointed as OSD in the Union commerce ministry. Senior IAS officer AK Mehta, who has served in J&K at different posts in last two decades, was appointed as the new chief secretary of the UT.Without taking the name of Subrahmanyam, People’s Conference chairman Sajjad Lone had said that the former chief secretary had hatred towards people of Kashmir.“Will be remembered as the darkest person in the darkest hours of Kashmir. A person consumed by self and also consumed by hatred for Kashmiris. Saw expression of naked hatred for Kashmiris and belittlement of Kashmiris as a means of upward mobility for his self,” Lone had said in a series of tweets.“Trespassed into a domain which belonged to the political class. Made statements which were unambiguously political nature. Made a trespass into the dividing line between politics and bureaucracy,” he said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jk-bureaucracy-divided-between-outgoing-chief-secretary-others-omar-101622566320188.html

Shop owners have had to close down for good jobs due to the situation.December 2020- April 3, 2021, is the period when malls across Pune functioned at full capacity. The had opened partially from August 2020.The government has now relaxed restrictions for standalone non-essential shops, though curbs continue for establishments within malls. Mukesh Kumar, chairman, Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI), said that the number of shops that have had to close down is still very small. Most brands can sustain losses. Only in a few cases, owners have completely shut their business. In malls, most of the time, old brands exit and new ones arrive.”Shops in malls get financing under a LRD scheme (lease, rental discounting), which allows them to repay loans.“Generally shop owners get a space on lease in malls for 59 months (five years). Those whose contract is over, unfortunately during Covid, and s/he doesn’t want to renew, then the mall can do nothing. In a few cases small shop owners whoses business completely depends on footfall are winding up. The same owner will return when business peaks. This happened last year when an owner returned to set up shop in December,” said Arun Arora, centre director, Pheonix Market City.Raj K is a travel agent who had set up a shop in a mall near Kharadi. He said, “I was getting no booking since people avoided travelling, so I shut down my shop. The mall owner handled the situation very well.”“Due to lockdown many international brands have completely shut their operations in India, so these shops are closed now and replaced by others,” added Arora. Most restaurants in malls have survived and are continuing to do deliveries.SCAI is hoping that malls will soon be given permission by the government to restart operations.“Crowds gathering in malls is a myth. Everything is sanitised at the malls and well organised. We monitor how many people are entering the shops, washrooms, and track social distancing – these are few characteristics that make malls safer places. We are also figuring out how to vaccinate all the employees of malls,” said Kumar.Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India (RAI), said, “While it is imperative to get the last-mile workers in retail vaccinated on priority, it is equally important to ensure that the entire cost of the shutdown is not borne by the business alone. We do believe that the state government, the central government, the Reserve Bank of India and the banks also have to chip in to soften the blow of the pandemic to businesses and the economy.”Facts of the matterNumber of malls in Pune: 20Total loss incurred (second wave): Rs1,300 croreTotal number of malls in Maharashtra: 75Source: Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/malls-report-multi-crore-losses-in-second-wave-as-shop-owners-shut-down-for-good-101622565178973.html

Drawing parallel with previous financial scams and loss of investor confidence in getting back their money, the depositors appealed to the RBI to fast track their reimbursements. The RBI cancelled the license claiming that the bank does not have adequate capital and earning prospects. In its order dated May 28, 2021, the RBI stated “Consequently, the bank ceases to carry on banking business, with effect from the close of business on May 31, 2021. The registrar of cooperative societies, Maharashtra has also been requested to issue an order for winding up the bank and appoint a liquidator for the bank.” Consequent to the cancellation of its licence the Shivajirao Bhosale Sahakari bank Ltd., Pune, Maharashtra is prohibited from conducting the business of ‘banking’ which includes acceptance of deposits and repayment of deposits as defined in Section 5(b) read with Section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 with immediate effect, the order stated. Pravin Walvekar, one of the members of Shivajirao Bhosale Bank Kruti Samiti said “In the past , the refund would take a long time and it was a long-drawn process but as per the new legislation the clarity has been brought. There is an insurance cover insured against each depositor to the extent of liability of ₹5 lakh and this amount must be given within three months. We hope that the insurance companies pay the amount to the depositors at the earliest.” “Initially, the auditor was unwilling to lodge a police complaint and we told him we will complain to the Institute of Chartered Accountants seeking debarring his license and after the complaint was lodged. Then EOW took over and kept on delaying for some time. Unscrupulous methods were used to manipulate the banks and siphoned off the money belonging to depositors and investors. The scam took place because of the interference of the political machinery, and we want justice to be done,” Walvekar said. Sangeeta Thombare, a teacher said “We have seen that during previous financial fraud cases in the city, the refund has still not come even after 10 years following the arrest of the fraudsters. This time the RBI must carry out special work and ensure that all the depositors are given back their dues. The law enforcement including RBI and other government department has been very slow in investigating the case.” Macchindra Talpe, a depositor of the bank said “I had deposited ₹10 lakh for the scheme but lost the entire money which I needed to fund the education of my children. Today, I am living in debt and afflicted by disease due to fraud played on us by Anil Bhosale and his associates. We don’t have any hopes left as refund seems to be a distant possibility.” As many as 71,000 investors have invested a fixed deposit of ₹5 lakh, while 8,000 investors invested more than ₹5 lakh in the form of various deposits. In January 2020, the Pune police registered a case against Maharashtra State Legislative Council (MLC) and bank chairman Anil Bhosale, bank director Suryaji Jadhav, chief accountant Shailesh Bhosale and chief executive officer Tanaji Padwal. A case has also been registered against Bhosale’s wife Reshma Bhosale who is also an accused in the case. The case was registered under sections 406, 408, 468, 471 and 34 of IPC and relevant sections of Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors (MPID).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/depositors-of-shivajirao-bhosale-bank-appeal-for-fast-tracked-refunds-101622563438825.html

We have one intensivist at present, we have to have minimum three,” Dr Bhardwaj said.Dr Chandrashekhar, the head of the paediatric intensive care at Madhukar Rainbow Children's Hospital in Malviya Nagar, said the number of paediatric ICU beds at the facility can be increased to 30 from 25 at present, if need arises.In case a child aged below one month gets infected, he/she can be accommodated in the 40-bed neonatal ICU at the hospital.However, there has hardly been any case of child that age getting infected."We expect more cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and are ramping up our technical and manpower support and taking steps to ensure enough quantity of essential drugs and oxygen," he said.The hospital is likely to create oxygen storage capacity on its premises and can also tie up with neighbouring hospitals having oxygen plants, he said.Sources from Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals said that the hospital has existing arrangements with two vendors who would meet any increased requirement for liquid medical oxygen in future.Moreover, the hospital has installed an oxygen generator plant to meet its requirements of cylinders through the support of the French government. The hospital is also exploring the creation of an LMO generation plant in keeping with the directions of the Delhi High Court and the Delhi government, sources told PTI.The Delhi government-run Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital had recorded around 40 cases of "severe" coronavirus infection among children during the second wave and around 15 of them were aged below one year.Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of LNJP, said the hospital is making more ICU beds for children and a special ICU for them."All the 1500 bed will have piped oxygen. Currently, 1100 beds have piped oxygen and for the rest, we rely on cylinders. But we will do away with the cylinders," he said.Dr Rajiv Sherwal, medical director of the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital and Chacha Nehru Bal Shikitsalaya, said the Rajiv Gandhi Hospital is likely to have its own oxygen generation plant within a week. Beds are being kept aside of children and procurement of medical equipment for children is also being done.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hospitals-ramping-up-paediatric-care-infrastructure-for-a-possible-covid-19-third-wave-101622559235959.html

01-06-2021||Ranchi||2016 Rajya Sabha horse trading case: Police approaches court to book former CM for corruption||In a new development in the 2016 Rajya Sabha horse trading case, Ranchi police on Tuesday moved court to invoke charges under Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against former chief minister and BJP leader Raghubar Das, who has been made another accused in the case.Filing an application with the court in this regard, police stated evidence collected in the horse trading case prima facie indicated involvement of Das who committed offences under PC Act. “Informing the court about new developments in the case is a legal process that has to be followed. The investigating officer of the case, therefore, filed the application,” said Ranchi’s senior superintendent of police Surendra Jha. Controversy gripped the 2016 Rajya Sabha biennial polls after BJP candidates Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Mahesh Poddar made it to the upper house on two vacant seats from Jharkhand, election for which was held on June 11 that year.The election of BJP’s second candidate, Poddar, came as a surprise, as the party didn’t have sufficient number of votes.Soon after the elections, Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) chief Babulal Marandi introduced horse trading charges against the then ruling BJP, alleging that some people at the helm of power adopted corrupt practices to influence the legislators to secure their votes in favour of BJP candidates.Marandi, who is now BJP’s leader of opposition, filed a complaint at the time before the Election Commission of India (ECI), annexing with it a compact disc (CD) containing telephonic conversations between the then additional director general, CID, Anurag Gupta, the then chief minister Rahubar Das’ political advisor Ajay Kumar and a former Congress minister Yogendra Sao, whose wife Nirmala Devi was then a sitting legislator.It was alleged that Gupta and Kumar coerced Sao to convince his wife Devi not to vote in the polls. They allegedly offered ₹5 crore to Sao and assured him to withdraw several criminal cases pending against him.Finding the allegations prima facie true, the ECI on June 13, 2017, issued a letter to the state chief secretary, asking him to initiate legal action in the matter. An FIR was then registered in March 2018 against Gupta and Kumar under Sections 171 (E) ( punishment for bribery) and 171 (F) (punishment for undue influence or personation at an elec­tion) of the IPC. The case was currently under investigation.After the change of guard in the state, the incumbent Hemant Soren government in February last year suspended Gupta and initiated departmental inquiry against him. Besides, corruption charges were also invoked against him.The case has now taken a new turn, after the home department gave its nod to arraign Das, who was not named in the FIR, as accused and asked police to invoke corruption charges against him. The charges, if proved in a court of law, prescribe a minimum of one year sentence which can be extended up to a maximum of seven years.Reacting to the move, Das said, “The police have thoroughly failed in last four years to collect any evidence in this case. In order to keep this case alive, some competent officers following the government’s diktat are trying to include new offences in this case. It’s the beginning of vendetta politics in the state. But, one should not forget that nothing is permanent here.”Police made Das as an accused on the basis of statements of former Congress minister Yogendra Sao and his wife Nirmala Devi. The duo earlier informed the police that Das allegedly offered them ₹5 crore to abstain from voting process and assured them to withdraw all pending cases against them. They also informed that a day before the election on June 10, 2016, Das visited Sao at their house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/2016-rajya-sabha-horse-trading-case-police-approaches-court-to-book-former-cm-for-corruption-101622559898511.html

The term of all elected functionaries of panchayat raj institutions (PRIs), like gram panchayat, zila parishad and gram kutcheries, ends on June 15. As panchayat polls have been deferred in view of the deadly second Covid wave, the advisory committees would take charge of PRIs until the fresh panchayat elections once the ordinance gets the Governor’s nod. The state government had to approve the amendments to the act via an ordinance, as it has no alternative arrangement under the Act to allow operations the PRIs beyond their five-year term, as stipulated by the 73rd amendments to the Constitution. The state panchayati raj act would stand amended once the Governor gives his nod to the proposed ordinance. Officials familiar with the development said that structure and powers of the advisory committees and remunerations for its members would be decided by the cabinet once the ordinance is approved. They said reputed members of previously elected PRIs might be inducted in the advisory committees. This was among 18 proposals discussed and approved by the cabinet at its meeting chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday. The cabinet also gave its nod for release of ₹656 crore as advance to gram panchayats in accordance with recommendations of the sixth state commission for the current fiscal. The social welfare department’s proposal to give monthly monetary assistance of ₹1500 to the children whose parents fell victim to the pandemic was also approved. The CM had announced this scheme, Bal Sahayata Yojna, a few days ago. The state government also okayed the bilateral agreement between Bihar State Hydroelectric Power Corporation (BSHPC) and National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC), a government of India, for setting up 130 MW multi-purpose hydel power plant at Dagmara village of Supaul district for a period of 40 years. A sum of ₹700 crore has also been sanctioned for the construction of the project for the next five years. The cabinet granted its nod for construction of a high-level RCC bridge to create additional waterways in the existing Pipraghat bridge on the river Kamla on Rajnagar-Babu Barahi-Khutauna stretch of the state highways in Madhubani district. A sum of ₹37.58 crore would be spent on its construction.

Instead of procuring these through Government E-Market place portal (GEM), ambulances were purchased from another place,” Kunwar alleged in his letter and requested the CM to get the matter investigated.The former MLA further said 10 ambulances have been purchased from funds provided by BJP MLC Tunna Pandey and former MLAs Ramesh Singh Kushwaha and Vyasdev Prasad. Meanwhile, acting on a complaint from Kunwar, Siwan district magistrate Amit Pandey has ordered a probe. “A committee has been constituted to probe the matter. Ambulances also carry a few special types of equipment for Covid, which is why their rates were higher than normal,” the DM told ANI.MLC Tunna Pandey feigned ignorance about the cost of the ambulances. “We don’t know at what price the ambulances were bought. The DM has constituted a committee for investigation into the matter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ex-minister-alleges-scam-in-ambulance-purchase-101622559778500.html
01-06-2021||Other||How ready for 3rd wave, HC asks state govt||PATNAThe Patna High Court on Tuesday sought to know how well the state prepared learning from the past in view of the anticipated third wave of Covid-19 pandemic and its likely impact on children.“Our focus is on the rural areas and that we have made clear from day one. All that we say that the Centre’s digital programme for death registration be put in place, as it will help the state in forward planning, be it in terms of infrastructure, testing in rural areas, oxygen requirement or extending social welfare schemes. If correct and up-to-date data is not there, how can the state plan?” the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar asked advocate general Lalit Kishore.The AG earlier said the valuable time of the court should go into strengthening the infrastructure of the district hospitals, as there was good connectivity in rural areas to help the needy reach there from blocks and panchayats within one or one and half hours. He also cited the improved Covid situation, with less than 2% positivity rate and over 97% recovery rate and underlined that vaccination and well-equipped district hospitals would hold the key in tackling the anticipated third wave.However, the bench cited reports from states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi etc. where virus had already started affecting children. “Is the state prepared for that situation?. If children start getting affected, it is matter of serious concern,” the bench said.The AG said the state had made provisions of ICU for children in 27 districts. However, the bench said the pattern of the affidavits filed by the officers “nothing but promised, promises”.“Despite clear order for digitally uploading all death figures, there is nothing in the affidavits to suggest it has been complied with. This is what raises suspicion in our mind,” the bench said.Admitting that the uploading death figures on the website was still not done, the AG said the chief secretary has directed officials to expedite the matter. “I agree that registration of deaths needs to be expedited and I will pass on the court’s directions,” he said.The bench was also particular about the figures of testing in the rural areas and if that was reflected through the overall increase in the number of tests being carried out in the state. “The affidavit says the government plans to set up RTPCR testing facilities at the district level. It is good, but what we are interested in is the timeline. When will the facilities be available for the people? The affidavit talks about mobile vans. We want to know how many of them are actually in service. We are only expediting the matter. The government says rapid antigen tests are being done down to the block level in Buxar. It is a big statement. If it is so, this model must be replicated everywhere and the people must be aware of the facilities available,” the bench said.To a court’s query on supply of liquified medical oxygen, the AG said the requirement had come down significantly and the state was also in the process of setting up its own generation plants and involving private parties. However, the bench asked if the oxygen situation in the state was good enough to handle the anticipated third wave.There was another application filed with regard to decongestion of prisons in the state. However, the court said it should be filed as an independent petition and before that the petitioner, Sameer Kumar, should draw the attention of the authorities towards the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/how-ready-for-3rd-wave-hc-asks-state-govt-101622559718531.html

As many as 54 children had registered at the institute for the trials of which 16 were in the 12-18 years age group. “We are commencing the trials today in the reverse order of age from today. Children in the 12 to 18 years age group will be given the shots first. We will then proceed with the 6 to 12 years age category before inoculating children in the 2 to 6 years age bracket,” said Dr CM Singh, professor of community and family medicine, also the principal investigator of the trial at AIIMS-Patna and medical superintendent. “Besides physical examination of the child, we will conduct real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) to check them for Covid antibody and test them for any pre-existing diseases before administering the vaccine,” he said. The two doses of the whole virion, inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, will be administered at an interval of 28 days through intramuscular shots. The trials will be carried out on 525 healthy volunteers. “There is no specific target on number of volunteers given to any centre participating in the research. We hope to enrol 100 child volunteers for the trial,” said Dr Singh. Those participating in the trials would be given a flat conveyance reimbursement of ₹1,000 per visit to the institute, he added. The AIIMS-Patna had undertaken Covaxin trial on 1,306 adults last year before the national regulator, the Drugs Controller General of India, approved the vaccine for emergency use. The first phase trial, which was of 194 days duration, on 46 volunteers was completed on February 3 and the second phase on 44 volunteers got over on April 7. The 208-day third phase trial, initiated in December 2020 on 1,216 volunteers, would end in September this year. AIIMS-Patna is one of the research sites for the Covaxin’s clinical trials in children.

Rajender, who left for New Delhi on Sunday evening, met BJP national president JP Nadda on Monday night along with state BJP president Bandi Sanjay and party in charge of Telangana affairs Tarun Chugh.He held discussions with Nadda for over an hour over the recent developments in the state. “Rajender raised certain clarifications from the BJP chief and the latter assured him that he would get the due respect and recognition in the BJP. Nadda asked him to take an early decision on joining the party,” a senior BJP leader familiar with the development said.Rajender reportedly expressed doubts over the possibility of the BJP adopting a soft corner towards the TRS, in the wake of TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s friendly relations with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“However, Nadda told Rajender that the BJP would go all out against the TRS in the state as it had done in West Bengal. Our aim is to capture power in Telangana in the next elections and there is no doubt about it,” the BJP leader said.Rajender is expected to return to Hyderabad on Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning and would announce his decision to join the BJP. Before that, he would resign from the primary membership of the TRS and also his assembly seat. Along with him, another senior leader and ex-MLA Enugu Ravinder Reddy, who also accompanied Rajender to Delhi, would join the BJP.Rajender, who represents Huzurabad assembly constituency in northern Telangana, had been associated with the party since 2003 and held several positions including party floor leader in the assembly, besides being the first finance minister of Telangana state. During the second term of the TRS, Rajender was given the medical and health portfolio.Though Rajender had been loyal to the party for the last 18 years, there had been reports of serious differences between him and the party leadership on several issues. On many occasions, he expressed his displeasure over the alleged humiliation meted out to him and other ministers by the chief minister.The cold war between Rajender and the TRS leadership culminated in stripping of his medical and health portfolio on May 1, when reports of his alleged land grabbing in Medak district surfaced in a section of vernacular media. A day later, Rajender was sacked from the cabinet, following a report submitted by Medak collector confirming the allegations of land grabbing.Rajender alleged that the TRS leadership unleashed a smear campaign against him and resorted to his character assassination. He said he was ready to face a probe even by a sitting judge or the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).In the last few weeks, Rajender met several leaders including Pradesh Congress Committee working president A Revanth Reddy and Congress Legislature Party floor leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka, besides ex-MP Konda Vishweshwar Reddy and Telangana Jana Samithi leader M Kodandaram, seeking their support to his fight against the KCR government.He also met state BJP president Bandi Sanjay, Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy and others to discuss his future course of action. Finally, he decided to join the BJP to continue his fight with the TRS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sacked-telangana-health-minister-eatala-rajender-all-set-to-join-bjp-101622559540696.html

"The CM has said that whenever we go for unlocking, it should also be in a staggered manner.""If unlocking is done it should be in a phased manner and it cannot be done at once, because the decline is not to the level of our expectations or to that of the TAC, though cases have come down, it is still not below 5 per cent.

A rundown of the data available with the health department shows that the state recorded 91,043 infections in May, which was the highest ever in a single month since the outbreak last year. Compared to April, when the state recorded 35,682 infections, there had been a 155% spike in the new cases in May. The highest single-day spike was recorded on May 8 with 5,424 infections while the active cases had peaked by May 13, touching the 40,008-mark. The hill-state registered 1,643 fatalities, highest in 15 months of the pandemic; 200% higher than the first wave and 22% (1,194) more than April when 449 people had died due to the virus. However, May also turned out to be the month with the highest recoveries (94,250). In April, the state had recorded 19,868 recoveries. Kangra, Mandi, Shimla worst hit Though the entire state was grappling with the highly contagious and virulent second wave, Kangra, Mandi and Shimla were the worst-hit districts. With 25,628 new cases, Kangra topped the infection chart in May followed by Mandi with 11,033 cases and Shimla with 9,053 cases. With a cumulative caseload of 92,625, these three districts account for 48.7% disease burden of the state. Solan and Sirmaur, which share borders with Punjab and Haryana, recorded 8,166 and 7,660 cases respectively during the month. Kangra also saw the highest 559 deaths during May followed by 211 fatalities in Shimla and 179 in Solan. All-time high positivity rate As the cases peaked, the state authorities also ramped up testing. During May, 4,12,643 Covid tests were conducted, which was around 1.63 lakh more than April’s count of 2,49,056. The overall positivity rate was 22% and touched the grim peak of 28.9% from May 10 to 16. The positivity rate was 14% in April. In the week (May 24-30), the positivity rate again slipped to 12.9%. The positivity rate was at its lowest 0.67% in month of February. In 3 weeks, daily cases fall by 80%National Health Mission director Dr Nipun Jindal said the state saw its peak between May 10 and 16 with 28,817 cases recorded in seven days. Since then, there has been a steady decline in the cases. “From touching the single-day peak of 5,424 cases on May 8 to 861 cases on May 30, the daily new cases have fallen by 80% in just three weeks,” he said. He said weekly cases dipped to 10,431 in the last week of May as compared to 18,794 in the penultimate week. “Fatalities have also declined by more than 75% from 78 on May 18 to 19 on May 31,” said Dr Jindal. Given the decline, curbs have been eased in the state but people must continue following Covid-appropriate behaviour, said Dr Jindal, adding that the state is also gearing up for the anticipated third wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/himachals-covid-recoveries-outnumbered-fresh-cases-in-may-101622555459122.html

01-06-2021||Delhi||Hospitals in Delhi record lowest Covid admissions in nearly two months||Delhi recorded less than 200 hospital admissions of Covid-19 patients on Monday, the lowest in nearly two months, according to government data.The number of people discharged from hospitals on a daily basis after recovering from Covid-19 has outnumbered the number of those getting admitted since May 14, the data showed.The decline in hospital admissions can be attributed to the drop in the number of positive cases, officials said.According to the government data, Delhi witnessed 182 hospital admissions as against 333 discharges on Monday.On Saturday and Sunday, the hospital admission figures stood at 228 and 237 respectively, while 619 and 425 patients were discharged on those days.The hospital admissions have dropped below the 1,000-mark since May 16.The admissions on a single day had risen to 1,993 on April 29, it showed.Between April 1 and April 5, when the daily cases were below 5,000, the admissions were more than the discharges on a daily basis, according to the data.On May 14, 1,256 new Covid patients were admitted as against 1,331 discharged, it stated.The next day, 1,052 patients came to hospitals while 1,379 were discharged.Between May 16 and May 20, the hospital admissions recorded were 952, 914, 806, 731 and 560 respectively while the discharges in the same period were 1,079, 895, 1,326, 1,090 and 978 respectively.Since May 22, the hospital admissions have remained below the 500-mark.

When the cases were at a peak in April, we were seeing 190-200 admissions on a daily basis while now we see eight, nine or 10 admissions in a day."Echoing similar sentiments, Dr BL Sherwal, medical director of the Delhi-government run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, said there are now only one or two admissions and during the time the cases were on a spike, 30-40 patients were admitted daily.Hospitals had to turn away patients at that time owing to shortage of beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hospitals-in-delhi-record-lowest-covid-admissions-in-nearly-two-months-101622551369729.html
01-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Ganga Ram hospital begins monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy for Covid-19||Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on Tuesday started administering monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy, which is thought to prevent high risk patients from progressing to severe infection. The therapy uses a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies -- laboratory-made proteins that mimic the body’s immune cells -- called casirivimab and imdevimab marketed by Roche. The monoclonal antibodies attach themselves to the spike protein of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 and prevent the entry of the virus into the human cell. The therapy is administered to those at high risk of developing severe infection before the disease progresses from mild or moderate category with no need for oxygen support. Those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes and are obese, or those who have chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, chronic lung disease, or are immunocompromised because of cancer, HIV, or an organ transplant are considered to be at high risk of developing severe Covid-19. Also Read | God won’t help if we don’t help ourselves: Delhi HC on govt’s vaccination policyIndia’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation approved the therapy for all those who have tested positive for the viral infection, have mild to moderate disease (not on oxygen support), and 12 years or above, and weigh at least 40 kgs. The therapy was approved in early May when the cases of Covid-19 were soaring across the country; US Food and Drug Administration had approved the use of the therapy last year in November. The monoclonal antibodies are given either intravenously or through a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. Once the injection is given, the person is kept under observation for four to five hours before being sent home. “We have started offering the therapy from today; the patients who come to the hospital for Covid-19 treatment will be offered the option if they fit the criteria. If they agree, they will be given the injection,” said Ajoy Sehgal, public relations officer, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Dr DS Rana, chairman (board of management), Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said, “As per the claims of the company, we hope that the therapy will be a major factor in fight against Covid-19 to prevent disease from progressing to further severity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-ganga-ram-hospital-begins-monoclonal-antibody-cocktail-therapy-for-covid19-101622551738129.html
01-06-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: #GenerationRestoration to give Pune’s ecosystems a new breath of life||Pune folks are lucky to live amidst a variety of ecosystems – streams, lakes, rivers, grasslands, forests patches, and even quarries that have become unique habitats. We benefit in many ways from these ecosystems. Indeed, they are the basis of what makes the city liveable. Human-made infrastructure is but a layer on natural endowments.Ecosystem benefitsThe city is just at the edge of the Sahyadri mountains, and we enjoy their natural beauty. Walks and treks on hills in and around Pune are among the most popular recreational activities. An invaluable ecosystem the Pune urban region draws from the Sahyadri mountains is high quality, unpolluted water from Mutha, Pavana and Bhima rivers. Pune has grasslands too. Recent research shows that the hills in Pune have naturally harboured grasslands and scrub vegetation, and not forests as many think. The western regions of Pune, such as Aundh, Baner, Balewadi, used to have orchards of guava, ber, ramphal and sitaphal. These are mostly converted into built-up spaces and only a few fruit trees remain. These diverse ecosystems and habitats harbour many different types of plants and animals, including birds, butterflies and moths, spiders and other arthropods, skinks, lizards, snakes, insects and small mammals. All of them are a part of the complex webs of life and ecosystems in our city. These ecosystems help to balance our microclimate, cleanse the air, provide us shade and moisture, help percolate groundwater, and convey floodwaters.They are spaces to connect with nature, and they make our city beautiful. They give us flowers, fruits and medicinal plants too, since the bees, birds and butterflies that help in pollination are also part of the complex web. The conversion of dead plants and animals to compost, humus and soil matter is also an ecosystem service. Under threatUnfortunately, often civic infrastructure projects end up destroying hills, grasslands, rivers and streams. Worse, ecosystems and habitats are just viewed as urban land to be traded for profit, covered with buildings; or waterbodies to be put into storm water drains and sewage pipes. With degradation and destruction of ecosystems, our city is likely to become less resilient, subjecting people to more risks and ill-health. We may recall that lives have been lost in the flash floods in Pune in recent years, especially due to narrowing of nallah courses and encroachment. Abuse and cutting of hill sides has also caused compound walls to crash and kill people in adjoining huts.Towards conservationThe theme for World Environment Day on June 5 is “Join #GenerationRestoration to revive and protect our ecosystems”. In addition, the UN has declared 2021 to 2030 as the Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, recognising that “there has never been a more urgent need to revive damaged ecosystems than now”. It can help to end poverty, combat climate change and prevent mass extinction. It will only succeed if everyone plays a part.Pune has many wonderful initiatives for biodiversity conservation taken up voluntarily by people and NGOs: action projects of greening, home gardens, cleaning up and composting, adopting river bank stretches, to biodiversity studies and being vigilant about debris dumping. Such efforts need support and strengthening, and lots more volunteers. Pune’s public also needs to ask elected representatives to ensure that the city takes up ecosystem restoration and biodiversity protection in earnest. Government roleIn fact, protection of nature is one of the mandatory functions of municipal corporations. City governments are expected to Set up Biodiversity Management Committees at the city and ward levels and prepare Biodiversity Registers according to the Biodiversity Act, 2002. Just making the committees is not enough. Their actual work should be to support extensive participatory processes that help to understand, document, protect and conserve biodiversity and ecosystems. They need to ensure that city development and civic projects are conceived with an understanding about biodiversity and sensitivity to conservation. For example, riverfront development or beautification is likely to destroy the ecosystem, and it should not be confused with river restoration. It is imperative that biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration are taken up in Pune with scientific guidance and participatory processes. The City Biodiversity Indicators framework developed under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity is a useful guide. It suggests focusing on conserving native biodiversity and ecosystems and enhancing ecosystems services. It also suggests the creation of suitable governance mechanisms for local biodiversity conservation. It can be adapted for local situations, understanding and safeguarding the dependence of local communities on ecosystems.Such as for fuel wood, grazing, and cultural needs. Let’s get active!As the World Environment Day 2021 message goes: We are the generation that can make peace with nature. We need to get active, not anxious. Let’s be bold, not timid.

The average national wastage is 6 per cent."There is zero vaccine wastage in the 18-44 age group, he said.So far, Rajasthan has administered 1.70 crore Covid vaccine doses and the state has remained a front runner in vaccinating people since the beginning of the inoculation drive, he added.In a letter to Vardhan, Sharma said the data given in the news report is "not correct"."... I would like to inform you that the matter has been thoroughly enquired by our officers and it has been established that the news mentioned in your letter is misleading, false and not based on facts," Sharma said."The statements recorded from all the concerned medical staff involved in vaccination in the health institutions mentioned in the news (report) clearly show that the facts are totally contrary to the news report and similar modus operandi was adopted to collect vaccine vials by misrepresentation," he said.At the health institutions, Sharma said, the media persons introduced themselves as officials from the state directorate of medical and health and as WHO representatives, he claimed."They managed to get the vaccine vials from the concerned health institutions by coercing the staff. The media persons took the vaccine vials from the used vials collected at the institution for disposal as per GoI guidelines for biomedical waste disposal," he said.Sharma further claimed that not a single vial was found in waste bins as mentioned by the media persons in their story."The act by the media persons is against the Central Pollution Control Board Guidelines for biological waste disposal, which state that the used/partially used vaccine vials can't be taken out of the concerned health institution without properly disinfecting them for disposal," he said.A Covid-19 vaccine vial has to be discarded after four hours of opening. Sometimes, after opening a vial, the required number of beneficiaries do not turn up for vaccination and it has to be discarded in accordance with the government of India's operational guidelines, Sharma said."It leads to some amount of wastage," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/media-report-alleging-vaccine-wastage-in-rajasthan-false-state-govt-to-centre-101622549144377.html

Police said the arrested accused also claimed to have received assistance from Nigerian nationals Jerry Sunday and Edward for the fraud. Mohammed Hussain Shaikh (51), Trijugilal Kurmi (43) and Salim Shaikh (39) used to rent flats, office spaces for two to three months and open bank accounts apart from obtaining some documents to make their ‘fake’ business look real, police said.Their elaborate fraud came to light when one Nafis Khan lodged a complaint with the police alleging one woman named Archana Kumar introduced him to Shaikh claiming he could deliver the Ayurveda powder Khan was looking for. Shaikh asked Khan to transfer ₹1.39 lakhs to his account. Khan says he did not get any promised powder after making the payment. The police arrested the three accused from various locations after tracking their mobile phones and following clues from the bank transactions they had made.“The three had opened 16 accounts in various banks with the help of rent documents and cheated people to the tune of ₹4.95 crores.

The Congress has formed a three-member committee to resolve the infighting in its Punjab unit, and legislators and ministers are meeting the panel led by Rajya Sabha member Mallikarjun Kharge in Delhi since Monday. Also read: Punjab Congress MLA Navjot Sidhu sticks to his guns over rift with Capt“Instead of holding meetings in Delhi to sort out differences within @INCPunjab, focus should have been on preventing more #COVID deaths in the state! Shame that the Congress party’s priorities have nothing to do with people,” opposition Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Harsimrat Badal tweeted. Slamming the Capt Amarinder Singh government over the number of Covid deaths, she also questioned Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over the state government’s “dismal performance”. “For 34 days continuously, the Covid toll in Punjab has remained at more than 100/day and mortality rate is double the national average. Has @capt_amarinder taken a single step to mitigate the crisis? Why is @RahulGandhi quiet on his govt’s dismal performance?” the SAD’s Bathinda MP said in another tweet. The committee, formed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, also has AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former MP JP Aggarwal as its members. On Monday, it had met around 25 party leaders from Punjab, including state chief Sunil Jakhar and ministers. The panel has been tasked with addressing differences between Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu. Sidhu, who represents Amritsar East constituency in the Punjab assembly, has been attacking his party’s government in the state for failing to act against those involved in the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib in 2015 and subsequent firing incidents in Kotkapura in Faridkot. On Monday, the opposition in Punjab had slammed the Congress government, saying ministers and MLAs have abandoned the state’s people in the midst of the Covid pandemic and gone to Delhi “to save their chairs”. Punjab has so far registered 5.67 lakh infections and 14,550 fatalities due to the viral disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congs-priorities-have-nothing-to-do-with-people-in-punjab-harsimrat-101622546333572.html
01-06-2021||Delhi||God won’t help if we don't help ourselves: Delhi HC on govt’s vaccination policy||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday questioned the government’s vaccination policy against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and suggested that the younger people should be saved as they are the future of the country. “These are not a satisfactory system. You initially started the vaccination of 45-60. And now you have introduced it for 18-year-olds. We only find you are not vaccinating them. There is no vaccine. Why did you announce vaccination for them? Why did you have to make such a wrong declaration? We have to invest in the future, not rest in the future. We are sidelining the youth of our country and preferring the older people,” it said.“So many young people have lost their lives. It is the younger lot which is the future. We are on our way out. We need to protect our future, we need to save our youth,” it saidThe bench of justice Vipin Sanghi and justice Jasmeet Singh said it the duty of the government to lay down the way forward as it cited the example of Italy, which it said apologised for picking the young over the old when there was a shortage of hospitals beds in that country.“We don't have beds for old patients. Your 80-year old has lived your life... But when we are in times of crisis... Ideally, you should save everyone and if you don't have the resources then chose to think about the younger,” it said. “God will also not help us if we don't help ourselves. You have all the figures,” the court added.Amit Mahajan, representing the Centre, said the issue is under consideration. “We discussed all these points. How are doctors giving prescriptions to patients? When medicines are with the hospitals? They have alternate medicine,” he said.On Monday, the Delhi High Court asked the Centre and state government to put before it a policy on who should be given priority amid an acute shortage of Amphotericin-B, the only last-line drug used to treat mucormycosis. Justice Sanghi and Justice Singh said authorities will have to take the “cruel decision” of excluding certain age groups or classes till supplies of the drug are short.The bench said that if there are two patients who need the drug — one who is 80-year-old and another who is 35 — and there is only one dose of medicine, one will have to be excluded. “If we have to make that cruel choice, we have to make it. We are faced with that situation. We will have to cross this bridge. Will you give it to the 80-year-old or to the 35-year-old who has two children to support?The court asked the central and Delhi governments to return on Tuesday with instructions on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/god-won-t-help-if-we-don-t-help-ourselves-delhi-hc-on-govt-s-vaccination-policy-101622545367879.html

As part of state government’s “Break the Chain” initiative, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Monday allowed reopening of non-essential shops in the city on alternate days but as per the circular, shops on the right hand are to open on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Shops on the left are allowed to remain open on Tuesdays and Thursdays.This rule will be applicable on rotational basis, and the local wards are expected to issue list of roads specifying left and right side, said the circular. Also Read | Man murders Jharkhand girl in Mumbai’s Bandra, dumps body at Mount Mary ChurchHowever, there was mixed response to reopening of non-essential shops on Tuesday as the local wards of the BMC were yet to specify left and right hand side of all areas.Viren Shah from the Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association said, “In many areas, non-essential shops were opened but police asked them to shut. The orders were issued late night and the message did not reach everyone. Even shopkeepers are confused as to the left and right side.”Shah added, “We have also appealed to the state government to revise the timing from 7am to 2pm to 10am to 5pm. We are also asking BMC to allow reopening of shops on all days considering once we open shops, we have to pay salary to employees, rent to landlords.”Paras Bamboli, Chembur Merchants’ Association, said, “In Chembur also, there is confusion among shopkeepers. If I stand facing Kurla, my shop is on the left, and if I stand facing Govandi, my shops falls on right hand. Hence, the BMC should specifically mention left and right.”Though non-essential shops have been allowed to remain open, salon, beauty parlour, gym, restaurant and bars have to remain shut until further orders, civic officials said.Meanwhile, Javed Juneja Congress, corporator from Nagapada area, said, “There is confusion among shopkeepers about opening on rotation basis. The same thing happened last year as well, and we hope this confusion might be over by tomorrow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-curbs-eased-mumbai-shopkeepers-confused-about-left-right-side-101622540993330.html

Kritesh Piplani, owner of well-known hotels located in Mumbai’s Chandivali and Powai area, was arrested on the basis of his phone call records, said police.Piplani told police that he was kidnapped on November 28, 2019 when on the way to withdraw money from an ATM kiosk at Powai to pay his staff. He claimed two men in a Maruti Eco car pulled him in, and when he regained consciousness on the roadside at Aarey Milk Colony, he found the ₹60,000 he was carrying was gone.The crime branch officials said they began investigating after finding his story suspicious. The CCTV recordings near the ATM kiosk in Powai and at Aarey Milk Colony, along with Piplani’s call data records, suggested the alleged incident never happened; making the police charge him with faking the robbery.“Piplani then confessed that he wanted to escape paying salaries to his hotel employees and had come up with this plan to fake the robbery,” said a crime branch officer from unit 10. Piplani has now been handed over to Powai police for further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-hotelier-faked-robbery-to-avoid-paying-salariesarrested-101622540813831.html

The city received 48.3mm of rain since 8.30am on Monday, of which 48mm had fallen by 5.30pm, indicating that only trace amounts of rain fell early Tuesday.About a third of Maharashtra’s 36 districts (including Mumbai, Thane and Palghar) have been placed under green alert for Tuesday by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) -- indicating less chance of severe weather -- while the rest of Maharashtra has been placed under yellow alert. In fact, as per IMD’s seven-day forecast for its weather stations in Santacruz, only “partly cloudy skies” are expected to prevail from Wednesday, with little chance of rain.According to a spokesperson with IMD’s regional meteorological centre in Mumbai, “There is a chance of very intense pre-monsoon showers over a 48 hour period on the coming weekend. But for now, rains will remain very sporadic over the Konkan coast. Heavier rains will be felt in Marathwada and north madhya Maharashtra.” Conditions in Mumbai, meanwhile, are likely to get muggier with relative humidity levels having gone up to 77% as of this morning (as against 61% on Sunday evening).

01-06-2021||Dehradun||'Death of humanity': Stray dogs eat human corpses at riverbank in Uttarakhand||Grisly videos have emerged showing stray dogs eating human corpses at Kedar Ghat on the banks of river Bhagirathi in Uttarkashi in Uttrakhand.Local residents said parts of bodies, some of them half burnt, had drifted onto the bank after a rise in the water level of the Bhagirathi due to rainfall over the past few days."I was doing some painting here yesterday and I saw these half burnt bodies and stray dogs gnawing and feeding on them. The District administration and Municipal Corporation should take cognizance of this and do something immediately. It is a matter of concern and I feel that it is death of humanity," said a local.Another local said that there is a possibility that the bodies are of Covid-19 infected people who have been cremated and civic body authorities should take immediate action so as to avoid the spread of infection."I request to administration to take proper care of this," adding that despite local resident putting in complaints to the municipality and the district administration, no arrangements were made to dispose of the bodies after conducting last rites.Meanwhile, Municipality president Ramesh Semwal said that after receiving complaints from locals, they had assigned a person at Kedar Ghat to cremate the half-burnt bodies, washed up on the riverbank."During the last few days, number of deaths has been increased in our area. I also came to know that bodies are not burnt properly so I have directed the administration to arrange at Kedar Ghat for the cremation of half-burnt bodies," said Ramesh Semwal.Previously there have been incidents reported from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where large number of bodies were found floating in the river Ganga.Authorities believe the relatives of those who succumbed to the Covid-19 virus, may not have been able to find space or afford the last rites.The Centre had last month directed authorities in these states to prevent the disposal of bodies in the river.Meanwhile, Uttrakhand on Monday reported 1,156 fresh cases of Covid-19, taking the overall tally to 3,29,494.

01-06-2021||Mumbai||Reduce gap for vaccination of students travelling abroad: Sena MP||Shiv Sena parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi has urged the Centre to reduce the mandated gap between two Covid-19 vaccine doses for students travelling overseas for further studies.“Maharashtra has initiated the vaccination [drive] for students travelling overseas for further studies, however, the 12-15 week mandated gap by ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) has led to [an] apprehension [among students] about [not] receiving the 2nd dose on time (sic),” Chaturvedi said in a tweet and shared the letter she wrote to union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan.In May this year, Centre increased the mandatory gap between the two doses of Covishield vaccine from 4-8 weeks to 12-16 weeks while retaining the 4- 6 weeks gap between the two doses of Covaxin. It argued that the dosing interval extension was recommended after a careful study without pressure from anyone and in consultation with the World Health Organisation (WHO).After appeals from several quarters, the Maharashtra government is now vaccinating students, scheduled to fly abroad, in Mumbai, the Mumbai metropolitan region and in Pune. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had announced free walk-in vaccination for students with confirmed admissions to foreign universities at Cooper, Rajawadi and Kasturba hospitals.“Some states like Maharashtra have understood the concern and opened up vaccination for these students to get their first dose on priority but the problem of getting the 2nd dose on time before July end to enable them to travel on time [remains]. Most of the students have to report to their campuses by mid-August which implies that they would have to board their flight from India by end July or latest by [the] first week of August. The health department of the BMC has also approached the ministry and [I am] hoping [that] you will expedite this crucial decision,” Chaturvedi’s letter says.The Sena MP sought a “humanitarian response” on the matter from the union health secretary’s office so as not to put students’ “futures at risk”. Last week, Sena minister Aaditya Thackeray asked municipal commissioners of Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur among others to vaccinate students flying abroad on priority. Thackeray, who heads the protocol department, added that his department will consult with the envoys of destination countries to ensure students from Maharashtra can fly safely and smoothly to universities abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sena-mp-seeks-2nd-vaccine-dose-at-shorter-interval-for-students-heading-abroad-101622536433327.html
01-06-2021||Ranchi||Centre's Covid-19 vaccine procurement policy stands against federalism: Jharkhand CM||Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren on Tuesday said the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines by states on their own during the ongoing pandemic "stands against the principle of cooperative federalism" and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide free vaccines to States for beneficiaries of all age groups."The State of Jharkhand like other States has always received vaccines free of cost from the central government for all other programs such as Pulse Polio and Routine Immunisation. This is probably for the first instance in the history of Independent India that the States have been mandated to procure vaccines on their own. Such a mandate under the ongoing challenging and unprecedented circumstances where the entire nation is struggling for over a year stands against the principle of cooperative federalism," wrote chief minister Soren in his letter to the Prime Minister."In this regard, it is pertinent to note that the rates specified by the central government for procurement of vaccines by the State for the age cohort of 18 to 44 years are significantly higher than the rates at which vaccine is being procured by the central government for the beneficiaries in the age cohort of 45 years and above. This dichotomy will not stand the scrutiny of reasonable classification under the fundamental principles of the Constitution of India," he said.The chief minister said the financial burden on the State for vaccination of the age cohort of 18-44 years is likely to be more than ₹1,100 crore considering 1.57 crore eligible beneficiaries. With the vaccine being available for the age cohort of 12-18 years and below, the mentioned financial burden will further increase by around ₹1,000 crore. It will be "extremely difficult" to spare as many resources from the resource pool of the State which is already stressed during Covid-19 times.According to Soren, the inherent diversity of India creates various peculiarities specific to the concerned states. Every state has its own high-risk groups depending on geographical, cultural, and traditional heterogeneity. As such, a common framework defined by the central government with regard to prioritizing beneficiaries across the country is not desirable."It is requested to provide to the State free vaccine for beneficiaries of all age groups and also give us the freedom to define priorities for vaccination coverage. This would help us in achieving the target of full vaccination in a timely manner which would go a long way in ensuring effective tackling of the anticipated third wave. The State and the people of Jharkhand shall be ever grateful for your kind support under such difficult times," urged the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/centres-covid-19-vaccine-procurement-policy-stands-against-federalism-jharkhand-cm-101622533014028.html

01-06-2021||Gurugram||International Sex Workers’ Day: This vaccination camp in Gurugram is a hit||From singing to dancing, the Covid vaccination camp, set-up for approximately a fortnight, for sex workers and transgenders at Gurugram has it all. And those turning up here are unable curtail their happiness for being brought into focus alongside the mainstream, and given a provision to get vaccinated for Covid-19. The camp not only diminished apprehensions of many on getting the jab, but also helped in eliminating the difficulties for them to avail a slot. And on International Sex Workers Day, as we speak to the sex workers about this initiative, they say that it is everything that they could have asked for! “Maine bahut jaga try kiya, par slot book nahi ho paa raha tha,” says Suman Gupta, a sex worker from Gurugram, who turned up at this camp and feels, “It was very important for us to have a set-up like this where we could get ourselves vaccinated. We are the ones who come in contact with people the most. Hum logon ko bahar nikalna hi padta hai, aur hum dusre logo ke sabse zyada sampark mein aate hain. Gurugram ke swasthya vibhag ne humare baare mein socha, hume bahut acha laga. Ye vyavashtha hone ki wajah se hume kahin dur nahin jana pada. Ek local area mein hi suvidha mil gayi. And this benefitted a lot of people who were earlier sceptical to get themselves vaccinated. Now, they are motivating us, too... Jaise yeh Gurugram mein hua hai aise pure desh mein hona chahiye.” “Har koi transgender ki respect nahi karta. Ek alag nazariye se dekhte hain hume (People don’t respect us; we are looked with a different gaze) says a transgender and a sex worker Naira Tanwar, who too was facing difficulties in getting a slot since a month. “Wahan I felt ki hum log bhi aapke jaise hain. We were either trying vaccination free of cost or with money, but we weren’t getting it anywhere.”Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, district administration of Gurugram, says, “ Ek idea tha ki in logon ke liye kuch karna chahiye. They were deprived. Some even booked slots for themselves and still didn’t get the vaccine. Yeh wahan par jaate, ya toh shy the ya wahan par kaise jaye kis tarah se karwaye is soch mein...I thought inhi ki locality mein we should make some arrangement. Taaki inko dur nahi jaana pade. There are around 750 (sex workers and transgenders) in Gurugram. We’ll try to vaccinate them in a span of two weeks.” “This is the respect we need,” says a trans woman Kiran Sakhi, adding, “This facility was a privilege for us and it made me happy from the bottom of my heart. We even got sanitisers, disposable gloves. And it took hardly two to five minutes for the whole process to complete. There weren’t any long queues or a risk factor for us, as one would expect in centres that have big crowds. We in fact enjoyed the whole experience, and even danced to express our joy!” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/international-sex-workers-day-this-vaccination-camp-in-gurugram-is-a-hit-101622530914540.html

In this situation, the sero survey could be a significant step, the spokesperson said.With a recovery rate of around 97% and a positivity rate of below 1% in the state, the government has taken the initiative to run a vaccination campaign that will target one crore people in June.The campaign that started on Tuesday will focus on the beneficiaries of both age groups -- 18-44 as well as those above 45 years of age -- and will be conducted in all 75 districts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-cm-yogi-adityanath-orders-sero-survey-to-assess-prevalence-of-covid19-101622527711635.html
01-06-2021||Kolkata||Bengal Guv calls Mamata’s reasons for skipping PM’s review a ‘false narrative’||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who shares a strained relation with the state government, on Tuesday accused chief minister Mamata Banerjee of giving a ‘false narrative’ on why she recently skipped the review meeting on cyclone Yaas chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In a tweet early on Tuesday, Dhankhar claimed that Banerjee had messaged him on Thursday, on the eve of the meeting, and hinted that she may boycott it if Suvendu Adhikari was also going to be present.“Constrained by false narrative to put record straight: On May 27 at 2316 hrs CM @MamataOfficial messaged “may i talk? urgent”. Thereafter on phone indicated boycott by her & officials of PM Review Meet #CycloneYaas if LOP @SuvenduWB attends it. Ego prevailed over Public service,” the Governor tweeted.Even though the chief minister skipped the Prime Minsiter’s review meeting on May 28 at Kalaikunda in West Midnapore district, she met him for a few minutes to hand over a report on the damage caused by cyclone Yaas in the state.Also Read | Mamata Banerjee urges PM Modi to cancel bureaucrat’s Central deputation“I wanted to have a quiet word with you, a meeting between the PM and CM as usual. You however revised the structure of the meeting to include a local MLA from your party and I am of the view that he had no locus to be present in a PM-CM meeting. You had invited the Governor and some Union ministers, which I had not objected to. But an individual MLA having no locus attending the meeting was unacceptable,” Banerjee wrote in a five-page letter to the Prime Minister on Monday.Even though the TMC swept the recently ended assembly polls by winning 213 seats out of the 292 constituencies where polls were held and returned to power for the third consecutive term, Banerjee was defeated by her protege-turned-adversary Suven Adhikari who joined the BJP in December 2020 and contested from Nandigram in East Midnapore.She also alleged that the state’s chief secretary continuously sent messages to a senior official accompanying the Prime Minister to sort out issues or arrange a meeting between the PM and CM, but to no avail.The issue of CM skipping the PM’s review meeting triggered a political storm with the BJP’s top leadership, including the party’s national president JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah, slamming Banerjee.Banerjee, however, said she had already met the PM and left with his permission as she had scheduled meetings to attend.She told mediapersons on Saturday that her flight from Sagar to Kalaikunda (where the PM was scheduled to hold the meeting) was delayed by at least 20 minutes for security reasons. At Kalaikunda, her flight had to hover for 10 – 15 minutes. When she reached the Kalaikunda air base, the PM’s meeting had started and the SPG made her wait.Responding to the Governor’s tweet, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said, “Why isn’t the Governor tweeting anything about the Centre not supplying adequate supply of medicine, oxygen and vaccine to the state? Did he raise any questions on why the Opposition leaders are not called to attend a Prime Minister’s meeting in a state ruled by the BJP? He just wants to create confrontation and confusion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-guv-calls-mamata-s-reasons-for-skipping-pm-s-review-a-false-narrative-101622526172650.html

I will appeal to all state governments of India, all opposition leaders, IAS, IPS officers, NGOs to be together to fight the battle," she was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Also watch | ‘Those who are scared..’: Mamata Banerjee quotes Sholay dialogue; slams PM ModiBanerjee was referring to the controversy  that erupted after the Centre’s order recalling Alapan Bandyopadhyay. The senior officer retired as Bengal’s chief secretary on Monday and chose not to accept the deputation even as he was given a three-month extension just days ago. The Centre’s deputation order came after Mamata skipped a review meeting chaired by PM Modi last Friday to take stock of the damage caused by Cyclone Yaas in her state.Also read | The battle in Bengal persistsBanerjee refused to release him on Saturday and urged the Centre to reconsider its decision. On Monday, she wrote a five-page letter to PM Modi, saying she was “shocked and stunned" by the “unilateral order" asking Bandyopadhyay to report to the Centre. She also questioned the legality of the transfer order and asked if it was linked to Friday’s meeting.“The government of Bengal cannot release, and is not releasing, its Chief Secretary at this critical hour, on the basis of our understanding that the earlier order of extension, issued after lawful consultation in accordance with applicable laws, remains operational and valid," Mamata wrote in her letter.Alapan Bandyopadhyay, a 1987-batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer of West Bengal cadre, was scheduled to retire on Monday after completion of 60 years of age. However, he was granted a three-month extension by the Centre after a request by the state in view of his experience and work in managing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. He has now been appointed by Mamata Banerjee as her chief adviser.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-uses-sholay-dialogue-to-attack-centre-urge-other-cms-to-unite-101622522551955.html

On Monday, the rate was at 17%.Following the developments, the government on Monday announced some relaxations including allowing stand-alone shops, including those selling liquor, to operate for three hours between 12pm to 3pm from Tuesday.“The daily count of Covid-19 cases and the positivity rate has dropped following restrictions imposed by the government from May 16. We shouldn’t let our guards down. Restrictions are still in place even though some relaxations have been given,” said a senior official of the state government.On May 16, the state government imposed several restrictions effective till May 30. All conveyances – trains, buses and Kolkata Metro – were shut down, government and private offices were closed, and markets and retail shops timings were restricted for three hours in the morning. Night activities between 9 pm and 5 am were prohibited.Later, the state extended the near-lockdown restrictions to June 15, providing some relaxations to the jute and construction sector.While on one hand the daily cases of Covid-19 have dropped, cases of mucormycosis or black fungus are gradually rising across the state, officials said.While on May 21, the state had information of only around four cases of mucormycosis with one death, the total number of cases, including suspected cases, has now shot up to 60.“Till Monday, the state has recorded 24 confirmed cases and 36 suspected cases [of black fungus].

Of this, 10 cases were reported in April and 12 in May, which is slightly higher than usual.Experts said the cases reported early in the year are not indicative of whether there is likely to be an outbreak.As many as 40 dengue cases were reported in May 2017, which was not an outbreak year for dengue.

The move comes a week after changes to the Delhi Excise Policy, 2021, had received the approval of Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal.Officials said not every liquor retailer will be allowed to carry out home delivery of alcohol under the new rules. “Only a particular kind of license holder will be allowed to home deliver liquor. In Delhi, we have now allowed home delivery of liquor only to L-13 license holders," an official told HT.Also read: Rush at liquor stores as Delhi lockdown sparks fears"This is not a new license category that has been created. L-13 permits existed in the previous excise rules as well, but hardly any such license was issued till now because of complexities in the clause which stated that liquor can be delivered to residences only through fax or emails,” said a senior excise official who did not wish to be named.Additionally, the new excise rules state that the delivery will not be made to any hostel, office, and institution. The order will only be completed by the liquor licensee at a residential address if the order is received through a mobile app or online web portal.The Delhi government is yet to issue an official statement on the order.The move comes more than a month after liquor manufacturers asked the Aam Aadmi Party-led government to allow home delivery of alcoholic beverages in the wake of lockdowns which saw mass crowding at the shops.Also read | 42 shops, 3 owners: Tip of iceberg of Delhi liquor cartels, say officialsOfficials said last year that the Delhi government was working on setting up a web page—and deliberating on creating a mobile phone application—to enable the home delivery of liquor in the Capital, as a measure to reduce the massive crowds outside the limited number of open liquor shops. With the scaling down of the lockdown measures after the first wave ebbed in the national capital, people started thronging the few liquor shops open for business. A similar trend continued in the following three waves of the coronavirus pandemic that Delhi witnessed.The Supreme Court also observed last year that states should consider the indirect sale of liquor, either online or through the home delivery mechanism to ensure social distancing norms are not violated.So far, several states including Punjab, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal, have initiated the process of enabling the home delivery of liquor.Also read: Delhi reduces age bar in major liquor reformMaharashtra is another state where home delivery has been allowed by the state government after it faced a severe wave of Covid-19 infections this year.

01-06-2021||Lucknow||UP is facing wheat storage problem ahead of Monsoon||Uttar Pradesh is running short of space to store wheat during the current procurement season, which is due to last two more weeks, people aware of the issue disclosed.The government has purchased close to 40 lakh MT (metric tonnes) of wheat so far this season at the minimum support price (MSP) and the final procurement is expected to close at around 55 lakh MT, since around 1 lakh MT wheat is being purchased from farmers every day.“Despite the tough situation arising from the second wave of Covid pandemic, we have already purchased around 40 lakh MT wheat, worth more than ₹7,817 crore from 828,697 farmers. Less than 24 lakh MT wheat was purchased during the corresponding period of the previous year,” a senior official said.The aggressive purchasing of wheat after record procurement of paddy in winters amid farmer bodies’ protests against the Centre’s three agriculture laws, however, has led to the problem of lack of safe storage space before the monsoon arrives.“As of now, we are able to overcome the problem because around 15 lakh MT of wheat is lifted from our godowns every month for regular distribution under the National Food Security Mission and free distribution under the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana that has been announced for two months. This PDS (public distribution system) off-take of wheat creates space for intake from procurement centres,” the official explained.He said the problem was expected to get more acute in the days to come as wheat procurement was expected to be 55 lakh MT by the time purchase season ends in 15 days.Earlier in March this year, UP food commissioner Manish Chauhan had indicated that the state was planning to create extra storage spaces in case it got more wheat than last year by setting temporary sheds at government factories and sugar mill complexes. Last year, the actual purchase of wheat amounted to 35.76 lakh MT against the procurement target of 55 lakh MT.The procurement started this year from April 1 on the fixed minimum support price (MSP) of ₹1,975 per quintal, an increase of ₹50 per quintal than last year. To keep middlemen out of the procurement process, the government has made registration mandatory for farmers on the portal of the food and civil supplies and also arranged for biometric authentication through e-PoS machines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-is-facing-wheat-storage-problem-ahead-of-monsoon-101622517832057.html

Without naming Capt Amarinder Singh, the former minister said that he has conveyed the truth and voice of the people of Punjab. “Truth can be punished but not defeated. On top of it, my stand is the same, was the same and will be the same that the democratic power of people of Punjab which goes to the government in the form of taxes has to be returned to them,” he said after the meeting, announcing that all anti-Punjab forces have to be defeated. Also read: Rumbling in ruling Cong: Kharge panel meets 25 Punjab Cong leadersThe Amritsar East MLA said that he had come to bring to the Congress high command the voice of the people from the grassroots and had apprised them of the ground situation. “Each citizen of Punjab has to be made a partner,” he said in a brief statement to reporters outside the Congress war room in the national capital. He, however, did not take any questions from the media.The committee, led by Rajya Sabha member Mallikarjun Kharge, met 25 Punjab Congress leaders, including state unit chief Sunil Jakhar, during the first round of talks on Monday. Virtual slugfest that escalated to real faceoff The committee is seeking to resolve differences between chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and his former cabinet colleague Sidhu and to tackle factionalism in the state unit ahead of next year’s assembly elections. Sidhu had on May 21 targeted the chief minister over the 2015 sacrilege incidents involving Guru Granth Sahib and the killing of two people in police firing. “To know what is right and not to do it is the worst cowardice,” he had tweeted. On April 27, Capt Amarinder had challenged Sidhu to contest the elections against him from Patiala. The chief minister had said that indiscipline would not be tolerated in the party at any cost and that if Sidhu wanted to contest against him then he is free to do so, but that would only lead to Sidhu meeting the fate of General JJ Singh (retd) who lost his security deposit in the election as the Shiromani Akali Dal candidate in 2017. He also asked Sidhu to clearly spell out whether he is a member of the Congress or not. Responding to Amarinder Singh’s remarks, Sidhu said that he was only “fighting for justice. Efforts to derail Punjab’s conscience will fail ... my soul is Punjab, and Punjab’s soul is Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Our fight is for justice and punishing the guilty. An assembly seat is not even worth discussion in the same breath!” Sidhu said in a tweet. It’s not about an individual: Jakhar On Monday, Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar said that the meeting was for “manthan (brainstorming session)”. “It’s not about an individual but Punjab and the Congress. Meetings will take for at least three days. MLAs, MPs and senior leaders will meet during this time and see how to strengthen the party,” Jakhar said. He said the issue will be resolved soon and that everyone has expressed their opinion in the meeting. “A few people try to find opportunities among hardships, they shall also be exposed. Those who had backstabbed that will be accounted for also so that the party can benefit and contest the elections unitedly.” Panel member JP Aggarwal on Monday said there were no differences. “We have talked to 25 MLAs. There are no differences. There was no talk on the leadership of Captain Amarinder Singh. Everyone has said their point. There are small issues to be resolved. We will give our report. On June 1, Navjot Singh Sidhu will come,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-congress-mla-navjot-sidhu-meets-panel-today-over-rift-with-capt-101622516632202.html

Questioning of those arrested is also going on which could lead to more arrests.Among those arrested on Monday are some persons, who were involved in the manufacture of alcohol-based products.A large number of vehicles owned by persons involved in the illicit liquor trade have also been seized. Police parties are checking roadside eateries to ensure that no illicit liquor is sold through such outlets.The SSP said the process of confiscating the properties of those found to be involved in the illicit liquor trade has also started.Former Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA from Aligarh Zameerullah Khan produced before the media the families of 12 people who he claimed died over the past three days after consuming the spurious liquor and whose post-mortem was not conducted. He demanded that the state government provide compensation to all such families.CMO Kalyani said, "A total of 71 bodies have arrived at the post-mortem house from Friday to Monday forenoon. Liquor poisoning has been confirmed as the cause of death for 36 of these people." The post-mortem of the remaining 35 bodies has also been conducted.Though these people are also suspected to have died of liquor poisoning, the cause of death will be confirmed once the viscera report comes, he said.BJP Lok Sabha MP from Aligarh Satish Gautam accused the district authorities of "protecting some corrupt officials in the excise department and attempting to implicate some innocent businessmen". He said he would raise the issue with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.The MP, who had claimed on Sunday that the death toll in the hooch tragedy had crossed 35, said the district magistrate cannot "escape responsibility" of identifying and listing the names of those who have lost their lives in this tragedy.Gautam also denied reports that he is "using his influence to protect some businessmen who are close to him"."Let the police investigate such cases with a free hand and catch the real culprits. But I will not allow any official to cover up his lapses by diverting attention and framing innocent people," he said, adding that he will meet the CM shortly to apprise him of the situation.District magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh did not comment on the MP's allegations.SP leader Zameerullah Khan demanded that compensation be given to all such families. In one case, Khan claimed, a woman whose husband was among the hooch tragedy victims who were cremated without a post-mortem has been running from pillar to post with her four-day-old child to seek compensation."Can such victims be denied ex-gratia relief on vague technical grounds?" he asked.The SP leader further claimed there are similar cases in several other villages and they should be investigated immediately to prevent further agony for the bereaved families.Other opposition parties also alleged discrepancies in the official death toll.President of the Bahujan Samaj Party's Aligarh unit Ratandeep Singh said he has also written to the district magistrate regarding the 12 cases from Lodha, Rait, and Sujaapur villages in which the alleged hooch tragedy victims' last rites were conducted "without a post-mortem examination".He claimed there are several such cases that can only be traced by conducting a detailed survey of the affected villages.Congress leader Pradeep Mathur alleged that the local administration is hiding facts and the number of deaths is "much higher". He also accused the state government of "patronising" the liquor mafia.In a statement, SSP Naithani said two inspectors under the Tappal police station were suspended on Sunday after reports were received that liquor shops are operating freely in their area.Similarly, the station house officer of Akrabad police station and another inspector were suspended after it came to light that a factory manufacturing spurious liquor had been operating in their area for the past six months, he said.UP additional chief secretary (Excise) Sanjay Bhoosreddy said the joint excise commissioner of the Agra zone, Ravi Shankar Pathak, has been suspended along with the joint excise commissioner of Lucknow, Dheeraj Singh, given the additional charge of the Agra zone.Deputy excise commissioner, Aligarh, OP Singh, has also been suspended. Deputy excise commissioner Vijay Kumar Mishra has been given the additional charge of Aligarh. Action has also been initiated against five other officials, he said.Commissioner of the Aligarh division, Gaurav Dayal, held a high-level meeting to review the situation and instructed officials to continue raids and take stern action against the liquor mafia.Meanwhile, three people in Chandana locality under the Kuwarsi police station area here fell ill early this morning after consuming liquor. They were rushed to the hospital in a serious condition, the police sources said.As of Sunday, 11 of the 12 people, including kingpin Anil Chaudhary, booked in connection with the hooch tragedy had been arrested, according to police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aligarh-hooch-tragedy-death-toll-mounts-to-36-top-excise-officials-sacked-101622512385510.html

I appeal to all the journalists to come here and get themselves vaccinated for free,” Kejriwal told reporters after inaugurating the vaccination centre.The chief minister said some teething issues in a few centres will be resolved soon.“We will rectify whatever issues the people are facing. I observed that the portal was facing some issues today. We are working towards resolving those and all the other issues, based on the feedback we receive from the people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cm-inaugurates-walk-in-vaccine-centre-at-ito-for-journalists-their-families-101622512241568.html
01-06-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand seeks free Covid-19 vaccine for 18-44 age group||Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and sought free Covid-19 jabs for the 18-44 age group, saying the state was unable to incur nearly ₹1,100 crore on it due to stressed resources.Soren said the state was battling a deadly second wave of Covid-19 with its limited resources."The financial burden on the state for vaccination of the age cohort of 18-44 years is likely to be more than ₹1,100 crore considering 1.57 crore eligible beneficiaries. With the vaccine being available for the age cohort of 12-18 years and below, the mentioned financial burden will further increase by around ₹1,000 crore. It will be extremely difficult to spare as many resources from the resource pool of the state which is already stressed during Covid-19 times," the letter mentioned.He said the abysmal supply of vaccines as compared to the state's requirement is the foremost impediment to the ongoing vaccination drive.Terming the mandate for states to procure medicines against cooperative federalism, Soren said, "This is probably for the first instance in the history of independent India that the states have been mandated to procure vaccines on their own."Such a mandate, under the challenging and unprecedented circumstances where the entire nation is struggling for over a year, stands against the principle of cooperative federalism, he said.Soren said with the emergence of the second wave of Covid-19 in the country, the state experienced an unexpected outbreak of the pandemic, and the existing medical infrastructure of the state was put under unparalleled strain.He mentioned that it is now well established that timely and full vaccination of all the eligible beneficiaries is the only sustainable measure against the spread of Covid-19 infection and to control mortality on account of it."Better preparedness and response to a possible third wave in the near future will hinge on the extent of vaccination coverage across the country. The State of Jharkhand is taking all possible measures to ensure maximum coverage in the least possible time frame," he said.Stating difficulties in procuring vaccines, the chief minister said as mandated by the central government, Jharkhand is putting all efforts to procure Covid-19 vaccine directly from the available manufacturers for the age cohort of 18 to 44 years."However, the supplies against the orders placed continue to remain extremely limited and it ultimately depends on the allocations made by the central government. On account of scarce supplies, the overall pace of vaccination is not as desired and defeats the very purpose of vaccination drive for this age cohort," he stressed.Further, Soren mentioned that Jharkhand like other states has always received vaccines free of cost from the central government for pulse polio and routine immunisation.Also, he said that rates specified by the central government for procurement of vaccines by the state for the age cohort of 18 to 44 years are significantly higher than the rates at which vaccine is being procured by the central government for the beneficiaries in the age cohort of 45 years and above."This dichotomy will not stand the scrutiny of reasonable classification under the fundamental principles of the Constitution of India," Soren who earlier hit out at PM Modi for "launching vaccination drive without preparedness," said."Further, the inherent diversity in our country creates various peculiarities specific to the states concerned. Every state has its own high-risk groups depending on geographical, cultural, and traditional heterogeneity. As such, a common framework defined by the central government with regard to prioritizing of beneficiaries across the country is not desirable," the letter mentions.Urging the Prime Minister to provide to the State free vaccine for beneficiaries of all age groups and also give freedom to define priorities for vaccination coverage, Soren said this would help the state in achieving the target of full vaccination in a timely manner which would go a long way in ensuring effective tackling of the anticipated third wave.He said the State and the people of Jharkhand shall be ever grateful for support under such difficult times.Facing delays in vaccine supplies, Jharkhand which could not launch a vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group on May 1 ultimately launched a free drive on May 14 but has been stressing on constraints in supply.Hitting out at the Centre on vaccine distribution, the CM in an interview to PTI on Sunday had said a state like Jharkhand has almost exhausted doses for people in the 18-44 years age group.Accusing the Centre of "no transparency in vaccine allocation", Soren said under the circumstance he was left with no other option than to appeal to the companies operating in the state to come forward for vaccination of communities in their areas.Jharkhand's Covid-19 tally soared to 3,36,943 on Monday as 703 more people tested positive for the infection, while 19 fresh fatalities pushed the state's coronavirus death toll to 4,977.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-seeks-free-covid-19-vaccine-for-18-44-age-group-101622511933988.html

But after losing her husband to Covid about a month ago, Dr Shivani Rawat Adhikari, 37, took up her writing in a more urgent way. “It essentially became a series of letters to my husband... I had so many things in my head... so much to tell him,” she says, at her home in Noida. She is a dentist, and so was Dr Gautam Adhikari, her husband. They were married for 10 years, and have a son who is in third grade.Dr Adhikari agreed to share excerpts from her journal.Day 15It has been 15 days since you passed away. Since then I often question myself. Was I not enough for you to share your pain with? Why did you not share it then! Now I am filled with immense grief, the grief of losing a partner, a friend whom I was meant to share my life with, till we would age and all our teeth would fall off. But can we possibly fix a plan for life? Finalise the course of it in advance? All I have are questions that will mess up my mind for a lifetime. Every night I rest my head praying for you to come visiting me in my dreams and tell me about everything that was left untold.Also read: Centre panel to study mixing doses, Covishield single shotDay 20My dreams are scant, but my sleep is uneasy and disturbed, as though some deep dreams are looming in me! My life with you was such a myriad of emotions. It occurs to me now that we would often push the boundaries for each other, so as to learn and feel a little bit more. Friends and family check up on me every now and then, hoping to hear a voice a little stronger... but I don’t think they can hear that yet!Day 28Most days are now alike, old ruins making way for newer debris. It all appears to be in shambles, and it’s scary… for the future that lies ahead, and for the people that remain! But with each of us fighting their own losses, all we can do is gather the shambles and veil them in cling film so that no flaws no pain show.Of all the things I miss, I miss you the most.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-letters-to-the-beloved-101622496665539.html

01-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Covid-19 positivity rate below 1% after 74 days||With just 648 new Covid-19 cases, Delhi’s positivity rate on Monday dipped below 1% for the first time in 74 days, as the city stayed on the recovery path after a brutal wave of infections between April and May.The positivity rate stood at 0.99% on Monday, a dip from 1.25% the previous day, even as the number of tests fell during the weekend.The city conducted 65,240 tests, the state health bulletin issued on Monday said, down from 75,440 on Sunday.The test positivity rate is a crucial metric as experts say it shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when a dropping positivity rate is coupled with decreasing new cases, it indicates that the spread of the virus is reducing within the community.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a positivity rate at or below 5% for at least two weeks before an outbreak can be considered under control. In Delhi, this number has been below the threshold for 11 days now.Also read: Virus curve bends in Haryana, active cases nosediveDelhi maintained a positivity rate of less than 5% for 124 consecutive days between December-end and early April. In this period, the positivity rate stayed below 1% for 82 straight days, data shared by the Delhi government shows.At the peak of the fourth wave of cases on April 22, the positivity rate increased to over 36%.The city also reported 86 deaths due to the infection, recording less than 100 deaths for two consecutive days. As the fourth wave swept through the city, overwhelming health care systems, over 400 people died of Covid-19 on three consecutive days, with 448 dying on May 3 — the most in the city on a single day.In another positive sign on Monday for the city’s fight against Covid-19, the number of hospitalisations dropped below the 5,000 mark for the first time in 53 days since April beginning. Only 17% of the total beds earmarked for Covid-19 treatment in Delhi and nearly 40% of the ICU beds were occupied as on Monday evening, according to the government’s Delhi Corona app. At the peak, there were days when no ICU beds were available in the city.Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior pulmonologist at Indraprastha Apollo hospital, said, “We are 15 to 20 consultants in the department, but we are not seeing any new cases. In the last five days, I have seen only one Covid-19 case and the patient was not from Delhi. It looks like the majority of the people have had the infection and it is unlikely to surge for now. The picture will become clear in the first 10 days after the lockdown is lifted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-covid-19-positivity-rate-below-1-after-74-days-101622495200267.html

Ramdev’s new toned-down line, which came after a week of hurling allegations and running down the allopathic system of treatment, was timed a day before doctors were to observe Tuesday, June 1, as a black day, to protest his remarks.“I respect allopathy and allopathic doctors, their contribution is immense to the medical field and society. Our drive is not against them but those who sell medicines at exorbitant prices and treat patients as revenue-earning customers. We are against those who unnecessarily recommend medical tests, operations and costly drugs while the patient doesn’t require them at all,” said Ramdev.Claiming that some of his recent statements were twisted and misunderstood, Ramdev said he wants to end this dispute. “An integrated approach was needed where both ayurveda and allopathic medical therapy should be co-developed for the betterment of the whole world”, he said.He, however, called for action and drive against what he called was a drug mafia which has been raking in money in the name of medicine and cure from hapless patients hurting the credibility of allopathy.“I want to end this so-called ayurveda-allopathy superiority episode. We respect allopathy and expect the same for ayurveda and it should not be seen as pseudo-science or alternative therapy. It is an ancient medical science practiced honed and has been curing people for ages,” said Swami Ramdev.Indian Medical Association, Uttarakhand chapter general secretary Dr Ajay Khanna said that they will only be able to say on this when a written or verified communique is made from Patanjali Yogpeeth.“It is a good move that both allopathy and ayurveda should go hand in hand. Ancient practice and modern medical science paves way for rational medical therapy which is the need of the hour,” said Dr Sanjay Shah, vice president of Uttarakhand chapter of Association of Physicians of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/respect-allopathy-its-doctors-ramdev-s-new-line-ahead-of-black-day-protest-101622494490782.html

The SIT, headed by additional director general of police LK Yadav, had on Sunday pasted a notice on the outer wall of Saini’s Chandigarh home for questioning. The Kotkapura incident had taken place during the tenure of the SAD-BJP government. Saini was the state police chief at that time. Other top officers of state police who were questioned included IPS Sahota and Rohit Chaudhary who holds the charge of special director general police. Suspended IPS officer Paramraj Singh Umranangal was also called for questioning. While Sahota and Chaudhary were quizzed during the earlier part of the day, Umranangal could not be questioned due to shortage of time. Sahota was head of a bureau of investigation constituted by the then SAD-BJP government to give report on the turn of events that unfolded and Chaudhary was in the crime branch of the state police. Last week, the SIT was in Kotkapura to quiz the senior police officials who were present on the spot during the firing incident. A section of Punjab Congress leaders on Monday told the party’s central leadership that the SIT should take the sacrilege and police firing cases to a logical end. They said the delay was hitting the party hard as it was losing ground in the battle of public ahead of the 2022 assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-police-firing-sit-grills-punjab-ex-dgp-saini-for-4-hours-101622492870854.html

01-06-2021||Chandigarh||Patti double murder was contract killing, say police||Tarn TaranInvestigation into the Patti shootout case has indicated that an Akali worker and his accomplice were killed for “supari” that was given to notorious criminal Daya Singh, alias Preet Sekhon.Amandeep Singh, alias Aman Fauji, Akali worker with a criminal taint, and his accomplice Prabhjit Singh of Patti city, were shot dead by two car-borne men when they were returning after paying obeisance at a tomb in Patti on May 27. Aman and Prabhjit’s third accomplice Samsher Singh, alias Shera, received a bullet injury in his stomach.Two Facebook posts claiming responsibility for the killings had surfaced soon after the crime. One of these was posted from an account named after Preet Sekhon Amritsaria. The second one was posted from the account of one who claimed himself an associate of gangster Jaggu Bhagwanpuria.“Investigations proved that the crime was executed by Preet Sekhon. But it has emerged that it was a supari (contract) killing. A suspect had contacted Sekhon for executing the crime. Why the suspect had contacted is yet to be ascertained,” said a senior police official, who didn’t wish to be named.Sekhon’s aide held in Hoshiarpur“On Monday, Hoshiarpur police arrested Preet Sekhon’s aide Gurjinder Singh, alias Sonu Ror Majra, and recovered seven illegal pistols from his possession. Our counterparts in Hoshiarpur have made it clear that Sonu was not with Sekhon at the time of Patti shootout. Sonu and Sekhon were involved in Amritsar bouncer’s murder case,” said the police official. Meanwhile, one more Facebook post has surfaced from Preet Sekhon Amritsaria’s account. The new post reads: “I am posting this for humanity. Don’t give political colour to the Patti murders. I had a personal enmity with him (Aman Fauji) and it will be disclosed once the time comes……I have a request to the administration that the punishment should be given to me as the crime was committed by me. I don’t want any innocent one to get punished.”Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale said: “All FB posts are being analysed by our expert teams. Investigation to ascertain the links behind the killings is still on. We are hopeful of cracking the case soon.”Shera, who was injured in the attack, was taken to a “secluded place” from a private hospital. “Shera was undergoing treatment in a private hospital in Amritsar. His family members have got him discharged from the hospital without informing the police. “Shera’s questioning is important in the case. Even the family members have not been providing us the victims’ mobile phones. The car which had received bullet shots is also still in possession of the families,” said another senior police official.DSP (investigation) Kamaljeet Singh said they had not deployed any policeman for Shera’s security as he was not a criminal, but a victim.Shera was facing a case under NDPS Act while Aman Fauji was facing five criminal cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/patti-double-murder-was-contract-killing-say-police-101622491190516.html

01-06-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers of 5 border villages in Punjab harried as BSF ‘restricts’ access along fence||The farmers of five villages situated along the India-Pakistan border in Amritsar district’s Ajnala sub-division are a worried lot these days as they are still to till their land ahead of the paddy-sowing season. They alleged that the Border Security Force (BSF) has restricted their access to the causeways along the barbed fence on both sides, making it difficult for them to visit their fields.Scores of farmers of Kakkar, Manjh, Lodhi Gujjar, Hetampur and Tanjurai villages said due to the closure of the causeways, they were forced to carry their agricultural equipment, including tractor-trailers, to their fields through fields of others. Nearly 1,500 acres of land belonging to the residents of these villages is situated on both sides of the fence. While the causeway on this side of the fence is 22-foot wide, the one on the other side has a width of 14 feet. “The BSF has installed a new small fence ahead of the barbed fence. The new fence is around 2 km long, restricting the farmers’ entry to their fields through the causeway. The BSF officials told us to pave our way through the fields if we want to till our land. How will we take fertilisers and agriculture equipment to fields if the causeways are closed for us?” asked Rajbir Singh, 45, of Kakkar village, who owns 7 acres across the barbed fence.Sakattar Singh, (42), who owns 15-acre land across the barbed fence, said, “We were asked not to use the two ways after we harvested our wheat crops. We faced difficulty managing the crop residue. If the issue is not resolved, we will not sow paddy this year. We are already facing a tough time due to the pandemic.”Kabal Singh Muhawa, district president of the Punjab Border Kisan Union said the BSF’s 22-battalion was behind the move. “No such restriction has been imposed in other border villages of the state. We met the company commander several times, but to no avail. We also approached senior BSF officials, but no one is listening to us,” he said.“Even the farmers of Kakkar village are not allowed to use gate number 89. They are forced to reach their fields across the barbed wire fence through gate numbers 90 and 91, which are more than 3 km away,” Muhawa added.BSF public relations officer (PRO) deputy inspector general (DIG) Kuldeep Singh said the matter was not brought to his attention and he will get it checked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-of-5-border-villages-in-punjab-harried-as-bsf-restricts-access-along-fence-101622491015177.html

The probe team is yet to file a supplementary chargesheet in the case.The “bir” was stolen on June 1, 2015, and a case was registered at the Bajakhana police station in the district the next day on the complaint of granthi Gora Singh. The SIT led by inspector general of police (IGP) Surinder Pal Singh Parmar is probing the “bir” theft case and two other interlinked cases wherein derogatory posters were put up at Bargari on September 24, 2015, night and torn pages of a “bir” were found scattered near Bargari gurdwara on October 12, 2015. With the recent arrest of six Dera Sacha Sauda followers, the Parmar-led SIT is focusing on two other cases, while the probe into the bir theft case has come to a standstill. The Akali-BJP government, led by Parkash Singh Badal, had handed over the probe into the three sacrilege incidents to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on October 26, 2015. In July 2019, the CBI filed a closure report, but withdrew it later to reinvestigate the matter.The Captain Amarinder Singh government challenged the CBI move of reinvestigation and handed over the probe to the SIT led by DIG Ranbir Singh Khatra on April 22, 2019. In July last year, the SIT named jailed dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and national committee members Sandeep Bretta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri, as accused in the “bir” theft case. The probe team also filed a chargesheet against seven dera men in the case.In January this year, the Punjab and Haryana high court asked the state government to replace the head of the SIT probing sacrilege cases, after which IG Parmar was appointed as the new chief. The HC had also directed CBI to handover all the case files and asked the SIT to file a supplementary chargesheet in “bir” theft case after taking into account of the evidence filed by the CBI.Though the central agency handed over the case files to Punjab Police on February 4, the SIT is yet to file a supplementary chargesheet. Officials said the probe team is finding it difficult to negate the facts stated by the CBI in its closure report. 2 events to mark sacrilege anniv Shiromani Akali Dal (Samyukat) leaders Ranjit Singh Brahmpura and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa will reach Burj Jawahar Singh Wala, while members of Sikh outfits, including SAD (Amritsar), will go to Bargari to mark the sixth anniversary of sacrilege incident on Tuesday. SAD (Amritsar) leader Jaskaran Singh Kahan Singh Wala said that Brahmpura and Dhindsa are working against the Sikh community by holding a separate event. “We observe the sacrilege anniversary every year at Bargari in protest, so why they are going to Burj Jawahar Singh Wala? They should have joined us,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-sacrilege-anniversary-six-years-on-probe-into-bir-theft-case-hangs-fire-101622491011503.html

An ED official privy to the development said Singh asked Dosanjh to perform at his daughter’s wedding even as he investigated a Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) violations case against the singer-actor. “Singh purportedly made a payment of ₹2 lakh to Diljit for the performance which is considerably lower than the amount he charges for such shows. By doing this, Niranjan Singh, the then assistant director, did not maintain integrity and misused his position,” he added.When contacted, Singh admitted that the ED had begun an inquiry in the matter. “I had paid ₹2 lakh to Dosanjh for the performance from my bank account,” he said. On the timing of the probe, he said, “The ED chargesheeted me since I had approached the Punjab and Haryana high court against the agency in several cases. The Dosanjh case was transferred from me a year before my daughter’s marriage. Why should I book Diljit for a marriage function if his case was with me?” he questioned, rejecting the allegations of any quid pro quo in the case. In 2017, the ED had issued a show-cause notice to Dosanjh for an alleged violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). In 2018, Niranjan Singh was cross examined in the Bhola drug case where the defence counsel also questioned over the expenditure incurred on his daughter’s marriage in 2016. Singh had said in a Mohali court that he had also probed complaints against singers Gippy Grewal and Jazzy B. “I am the only earning member of my family and in 2018 I had a monthly income of Rs. 1.5 lakh. He (Diljit) sang some songs probably on the demand of those present at the function. I do not remember how much I paid him. But I did make him some payment,” he had said. The defence counsel had said that Diljit charged ₹40 lakh for a performance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ed-officer-niranjan-singh-chargesheeted-over-diljit-dosanjh-show-at-daughter-s-wedding-101622491010329.html
01-06-2021||Chandigarh||Rumbling in ruling Cong: Kharge panel meets 25 Punjab Cong leaders||Amid an attempt by the Congress leadership to resolve factionalism in the state unit, several ministers and MLAs from Punjab on Monday conveyed to the three-member committee headed by Rajya Sabha MP Mallikarjun Kharge their concern over the state government losing ground in the battle of public perception on sacrilege and police firing cases. The committee constituted by Congress president Sonia Gandhi had one-on-one meetings with Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and 25 cabinet ministers and MLAs in Delhi to hear their grievances and suggestions to find a solution to infighting and present a united face in the state assembly polls due early next year. Cabinet ministers Brahm Mohindra, Manpreet Singh Badal, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Charanjit Singh Channi, Aruna Chaudhary, OP Soni, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sunder Sham Arora and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, and MLAs Sangat Singh Gilzian, Raj Kumar Verka, Gurkirat Singh Kotli, Raj Kumar Chabbewal and Arun Dogra were among the prominent state leaders who met the panel. At least four of them, including two senior ministers, confirmed pressing for prompt action in these sensitive cases before the state elections, besides raising other poll promises such as action on reports against drug dealers and cancellation of power purchase agreements, in their separate meetings with the committee. “We are battling perception of a government that has failed to deliver on these important poll promises. If decisive action is not taken now, it will diminish the party’s credibility in the eyes of people,” one of them told HT on the condition of anonymity after the meeting with the committee that also includes All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former MP Jai Prakash Agarwal. Randhawa and Channi, who have been critical of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh lately, are learnt to have raised the unfulfilled promises and vindictive action towards some party leaders, according to sources. Channi told reporters that their fight was on issues and not against any particular individual. Though most ministers and legislators were guarded and declined to disclose details of their interaction, they said there was no discussion on leadership change. Jakhar said there were differences of opinion in the party on action against those who were behind or involved in sacrilege and police firing on protesters, but the government was determined to act in these cases. “The perpetrators in these cases will be caught and the issue will be resolved. However, those who have been backstabbing their own party by seeking the ED and CBI probes into illicit liquor seizures in the state have been totally exposed. Why are they silent on an illicit liquor racket busted at Badal village?” he asked, hitting out at Rajya Sabha MPs Partap Singh Bajwa and Shamsher Singh Dullo. The Punjab Congress president was the first to meet the committee at 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road office, which is also the party’s “war room”, and then others were called one by one. The ministers and MLAs were asked to give their suggestions and allowed as much time as they wanted with Kharge and his team noting down their suggestions. Dalit CM demand, OBC representation Amritsar West legislator Raj Kumar Verka raised the demand for a Dalit CM face in the state. “It is time someone from the community heads the Congress government in the state,” he said, expressing confidence that they would get some good news soon. Urmar MLA Sangat Singh Gilzian also made a pitch for representation for OBCs in the state cabinet, stating there was not even a minister from the community. Besides raising issues related to development works in their constituencies, several members also spoke to the committee on the adverse consequences of infighting on poll prospects. Though a senior minister is said to have sought action against former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu for his public statements criticising the state government and the chief minister, he did not respond to calls. Agarwal, while confirming that most members were concerned about the political fallout of the high court order in the Kotkapura police firing case, said there was no crisis or groupism in the state Congress. “Their concerns are not something that cannot be addressed,” he said, after the exercise that lasted close to seven hours. Sidhu and Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh are among the next batch of 25 ministers and MLAs scheduled to meet the committee on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rumbling-in-ruling-cong-kharge-panel-meets-25-punjab-cong-leaders-101622490832381.html

01-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab housing dept reduces non-construction fee by 50%||Mohali In a relief to allottees who could not start construction over their plots in the stipulated time, the department of housing and urban development, Punjab, has halved the non-construction fee. Besides, the earlier provision of calculating penalty half yearly in such cases has been replaced with monthly mode. The decision is applicable to properties, including residential, commercial, institutional, industrial, housing societies, private builders etc under Punjab Urban Development Authority (PUDA), Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) and other special development authorities. The reduced non-construction charges have come into effect from April 16, 2021, and for period before April 16, 2021, old charges will be applicable. An amendment to this effect has been made in the Punjab Regional and Town Planning and Development Act, 1995. A spokesperson of the department said it was deliberated that the non-construction fee being charged from the allottees was high and due to this, those who were not able to start construction, were compelled to resale the property.In case of residential and other allotted properties except commercial sites, the allottees would be required to pay the non-construction fee on the prevalent reserved price of plots or sites in the vicinity and no interest will be charged, the spokesperson said. However, in case of commercial sites, the fee would be calculated on auctioned or allotment price. Delayed payment in such cases, would attract compounded interest at the rate of 7% per annum, the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-housing-dept-reduces-non-construction-fee-by-50-101622490530392.html
01-06-2021||Chandigarh||May added half of total Covid deaths in Haryana||A month back when the skyrocketing medical oxygen demand had set the alarm bells ringing, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had described as “tsunami” the second Covid-19 wave which in May has left behind a trail of death and devastation.“One can expect a deluge in the rainy season and prepare accordingly, but what has hit us is nothing short of a tsunami,” Khattar had said in a news conference as the public in the streets panicked and even high-heeled people struggled to get a bed in the hospitals. And what followed was the scarcity of medical oxygen and the unnerving scale of the body bags that poured out of the homes and hospitals in May when almost 50% (4,005) of the total (8,221) deaths due to coronavirus took place in a month in Haryana. According to the analysis of the daily health bulletin data up to May 30, 2021, May has been the deadliest ever since the Wuhan virus was detected in Haryana in February 2020. In April this year, Haryana recorded the second highest 1,061 fatalities, 107 in March, 30 in February and 113 in January. On the other hand, till May 31, 2020, the death toll in Haryana due to Covid-19 was 20 and it began mounting after that. For example, the virus claimed 216 lives in June, 185 in July, 268 in August, 693 in September, 407 in October, 639 in November and 477 in December. Hisar has been the worst affected district where 860 people (420 in May alone) have died. The infection has claimed 328 lives in May in Gurugram out of total 804 fatalities. Faridabad is another district with high fatalities where 707 people (195 in May) have died. In May, Rohtak recorded 277 deaths followed by Bhiwani 268, Jind 262, Karnal 252, Panipat 242 and Ambala 233. The size and scale of this “tsunami” of death can be gauged from the fact that 268 people had died across 22 districts of Haryana in August last year and eight months later the disease killed 268 people in Bhiwani district alone in May. The fatality rate from 0.86% on April 30 has risen to 1.09% on May 30. More cases in may than total of last year Haryana had detected 2.62 lakh total positive cases till December 31, 2020. But in May the state recorded over 2.67 lakh Covid-19 positive cases, a clear indicator of how and why everybody including the health institutions were overburdened. While over 16.26 lakh samples were taken in May, Haryana had barely crossed the 16 lakh mark of total sample collected till September 17-18, 2020. Over 3.39 lakh people also recovered during the month and the recovery rate saw 16.98% jump. As per the data, in April, over 11.38 lakh samples were collected and over 1.97 lakh new infections were detected in the state while over 1 lakh patients had recovered. However, the recovery rate in April dipped by 16.43% as the recovery rate which was 95.57% on March 31 came down to 79.14% on April 30. The recovery rate 96.12% in May is almost close to what it was in January. Khattar updates PM Under mounting pressure to deliver and control the Covid surge, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who crisscrossed the state during medical oxygen crisis and took a series of steps to control the spread, on Monday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and apprised him how Haryana dealt with the second Covid-19 wave. Khattar said Prime Minister has expressed satisfaction over the arrangements Haryana government made to control the infection. Khattar also apprised the PM of the present and the future requirements of Haryana to combat Covid-19. The chief minister said that in view of the possibility of third wave, the PM has asked to be alert in the coming times as well. He said that the Prime Minister was also informed about the requirements for vaccine stock and black fungus medicine.The black fungus, as per official data, has claimed 61 lives in Haryana. There were 821 cases in the state till May 30 out of which 692 were under treatment and 68 people have been cured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/may-added-half-of-total-covid-deaths-in-haryana-101622490410744.html

The mega camps have been set up as part of the UP government’s aggressive vaccination drive that aims to administer around one crore doses in June.In addition to the mega camps, vaccination will be done at 76 existing centres across the city which can administer over 19,000 doses in a day, according to the health department. District magistrate Abhishek Prakash reviewed the last-minute preparations at the newly-established mega vaccination centres on Monday.“We have set up three mega Covid 19 vaccination centres— Chhota Imambara, KD Singh Babu Stadium and Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium to carry out Covid 19 vaccination on a mass level,” Prakash said. The vaccination centres would operate between 10am and 4pm, he said.The Ekana Cricket Stadium would be the biggest vaccination centre.“The centre would have 20 booths — 10 for people between 18 and 45 years of age and the remaining for those above 45 years of age”, said Dr MK Singh, additional chief medical officer/district immunisation officer (DIO). The Chhota Imambara and KD Singh Babu Stadium centres would have eight booths each — four each for the 18- 45 age group and the 45- plus category.So far, around 6,000 people, including those in the 18-45 age group, have got themselves registered on the mobile application for vaccination at the three mega centres.“For those who are 45 plus and are technically challenged, we have also created an on-spot registration desk. They can get the registration done by showing their Aadhaar cards,” said officials with the health department.The health department has set a target of vaccinating over 10,500 people per day. The health department has deployed a team of over 200 officials, including doctors, paramedical staff and Ashas (accredited social health activists) to ensure smooth vaccination at the three mega centres.“Three doctors, including the nodal officer, will take care of the entire vaccination exercise. Besides, there will be four doctors each at all the three mega vaccination centres and over 70 vaccinators. This is double the requirement. Around 40 data entry personnel will upload the data on the portal. We have also deployed ambulances at all the vaccination centres in case of any emergency situation,” he added.The KD Singh Babu and Ekana stadium vaccination centres would have parents’ special booths where parents of children up to 12 years of age can get themselves vaccinated on priority after showing the valid age proof of their children.Dr Singh said unlike regular centres where people have to reach on their own, the administration has made transportation arrangements for women and senior citizens.“The aim is to enable them to get to the vaccination centres,” said Dr Singh.“Be it potable water facilities, seating arrangements, clean toilets, well-furnished observation area and transportation, all these facilities would give altogether a different experience to people,” he said.The health department has also made special arrangements at all three centres for the safe handling of the vaccines and to check wastage. Officials said the department had arranged heavy duty vaccine carriers to maintain the cold chain and to keep the vaccine temperature between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. These vaccine carriers are designed to maintain the cold chain for a longer period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stage-set-for-launch-of-major-vaccination-drive-in-lucknow-over-10-500-jabs-to-be-given-at-three-camps-daily-101622489389733.html

Vaccines were to be administered to different target groups as per the guidelines of the state government, he added. Besides regular vaccination centres, two parents’ special vaccination booths have been established in the city area for inoculation of parents who have children below the age of 12 years. These vaccination centres would be functional from June 1 and the parents can book their slots after registration either on CoWin or Aarogya Setu. “Three hundred parents would be vaccinated daily at these centres,” said Dr Gautam. In addition, frontline workers would be administered vaccines at their workplace. “Every day, 1000 such people (500 each in the 18-plus and 45-plus age groups) would be vaccinated,” said Dr Gautam. A special drive for Bar Association and judicial services members, mediapersons, teachers (basic and intermediate), power corporation and roadways employees has also been launched at their workplace and every day 100 persons are being vaccinated in each category, he said.Chief medical officer (Meerut) Dr Akhilesh Mohan expressed satisfaction with 43.1% vaccination in the 45-plus age group.“We are in third position in vaccination in the state,” he said, while admitting, “We need to work more to bring a bigger percentage to the vaccination centres.” He mentioned reluctance among Muslims and large rural population as reasons for the vaccination percentage being below the target. “We are seeking help of some NGOs and influential people. Health officials also had called on (Samajwadi Party) city MLA Rafeeq Ansari in this regard who has assured his help,” said CMO. He added, “ Despite non- cooperation from some sections of the society, we have done fair enough.” For his part, Dr Gautam said, “Convincing the rural population is also a herculean task.” He said a majority of villagers believed that the coronavirus could not infect them as they worked hard in the fields and, therefore, their immunity was stronger than others. City’s nayab shahar qazi and Jamial-e-Ulema Hind city president Zainus Rasheedin said Muslims had suspicions about the vaccines. “Many of them ask why only two vaccines are being administered? It brings fever and other sufferings. And Adar Poonawala’s (chief executive officer of Serum Institute of India) decision to go to UK has also raised suspicions about his vaccine,” Rasheedin said. “I have made an appeal to people to come forward and get vaccinated because it is safe,” he said.About why and his elder brother shahar qazi Zainus Sajeedin had not taken the vaccines yet, the nayab qazi said, “We are heart patients and also have other problems because of old age. That is why we have not taken the vaccine yet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/43-vaccination-target-for-45-age-group-83-for-18-met-in-meerut-district-101622489269666.html

The victim, Karan Yadav, a resident of Sanjay Gandhi Colony, worked at a hosiery factory. His brother Ravi Kumar told the police that Karan used to play cricket with the colony youths. On Sunday, he had an altercation with two brothers, Amit and Ravi, over a game before returning home.Around 9pm, Karan stepped out for a walk, when he was waylaid by Amit, Ravi and their accomplice, who arrived in a Maruti Suzuki Esteem near Gopal Mandir.The complainant, who saw the men arrive in the car, alleged that the trio started hurling abuses at Karan in connection with the cricket game earlier.Ravi suddenly pinioned Karan and Amit hit him repeatedly with a baseball ball.

01-06-2021||Mumbai||6 million doses in June: Maharashtra to focus on 45+ age group||With Maharashtra expected to get six million vaccine doses in June, the state’s focus is administering second doses to beneficiaries and covering maximum people for first dose in the 45+ age category. The state is awaiting enough stock to resume inoculation of beneficiaries in the 18-45 age category, senior health department officials said.According to officials, Maharashtra is set to get four million vaccine doses from the Centre throughout June and it has placed a purchase order for two million doses, mainly for the 18-45 category. However, the 2 million doses could be diverted for inoculation of above 45, if there is a delay in supply from the Centre.DN Patil, state immunisation officer, said that the distribution of the expected vaccine doses will be done on the basis of active patients, positivity rate, etc. He said the department will push vaccine doses in districts that are lagging behind in immunisation. “We will push the doses in areas that have high positivity. It is a combination of giving priority to second dose and pushing first dose to cover all areas. Besides, districts that have low vaccination percentage are given more doses to boost their numbers,” Patil said.On Monday, Maharashtra administered 256,827 doses till 9pm, taking the tally to 22,582,329 doses. So far, 4,569,247 beneficiaries are fully inoculated, as per the data on CoWin portal.Meanwhile, a formal decision is yet to be taken on when the drive for people in the 18-45 age group. The inoculation for the category was temporarily suspended since May 13 due to lack of adequate vaccine stock for second doses for those over 45 years. “We will see how the stock comes in—both from the Centre and what we purchase—depending on that, we will take a decision. We have not set a date for resumption for the drive for 18-45, but we hope to resume it in the near future,” added Patil.Maharashtra has over 9,000 vaccination centres, including sub-centres, which cover 4-5 villages each.From its share, the Central government allocates vaccines to states and union territories based on criteria such as number of active cases, speed of vaccination and wastage. “We have been following the same guidelines. Besides, we also look at the size of the population that is eligible for vaccine,” said an official.The Centre had directed state governments and union territories to form a state steering committee, state task force and state control room. Similar committees and task forces have been formed down to the block level to plan and execute the vaccination drive, the official added. “We have implemented the organisational set up to form task force and committees under the chief secretary as directed by the Centre. Besides, we have enough experience to tackle large scale vaccination drives,” the official added.Overall, the distribution of vaccines in the state depends on the population eligible for inoculation. Every district has cold chain, which gets supply from the cold chain at the divisional level. The districts get the supply based on the number of vaccination centres, which are finalised on the number of beneficiaries based on the population. A centralised system gets real-time data of the usage of the vials and on the basis of the potential number of eligible citizens, further stock is provided. The distribution of the stock is also done on the basis of the available stock, state officials said.The stock is supplied to the divisional/district/city level cold chains on the basis of availability at the state level and the requirement at lower level. The supply chain works in pyramid system. State level centre is at the apex, while the sub-centre level is at the bottom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/6-million-doses-in-june-maharashtra-to-focus-on-45-age-group-101622488610433.html

Several institutes in the country have been studying the virus. Under the circumstances, rope in the Central Drug Research Institute for doing genome sequencing of the coronavirus in UP. Such scientific research would certainly help in protection from the pandemic in the future,” he said at a Covid-19 review meeting.CDRI is a premier drug research institute under the CSIR (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research).He also discussed the state’s preparations for tackling the speculated third wave of the pandemic.It was important to have proper training of the personnel who would be engaged in pandemic control and treatment, he said.“Such training would begin in Noida and Lucknow today (Monday). Similarly, paediatric training would start on June 1 (Tuesday). Accomplish the training as soon as possible,” he said.He also said UP’s Covid recovery rate was now 96.6%. In the last 24 hours, the positivity rate (the number of positive cases against the total number of tests) was 0.5%, he added.“In the last 24 hours, the state did 3.12 lakh tests. Since March last year, a total of 4.94 crore tests were conducted in the state.

The Maharashtra government on Monday issued a resolution announcing that community members with an annual family income of less than ₹8 lakh can take advantage of the quota. The resolution has also clarified that the community can avail the benefits for the quota with retrospective effect, helping those who had received the benefits during the period of interim stay by the Bombay High Court on September 9, 2020 and Supreme Court quashing the quota on May 5, 2021.The 6,000 youth were selected under the erstwhile Maratha quota, but they were not formally recruited as the quota was scrapped before the process could be completed. The government has now included Marathas in the EWS with retrospective effect which means they will be accommodated in government service. The EWS is available for all candidates in the open category who fulfil the criteria of being economically weak. Candidates from castes that have reservation do not get the benefit of EWS. As Marathas no longer have a quota, the government has now scrapped the previous order and issued a fresh one saying they are eligible for the EWS. “There are about 6,000 youth who had completed various stages of recruitment in government jobs of various departments before September 9, 2020, but were not given appointment letters. The SC order does not give protection to the employees not recruited before September 9 last year. Although the state government had taken the decision of accommodating the community in EWS on September 22, the order was issued only on December 23 because of the resistance of the community. People were recruited during this period. With the help of this order, we can now consider accommodating such youth in EWS quota. Some of the candidates from EWS quota may get thrown out of reservation, but we are considering accommodating them by creating extra posts,” said an official from Mantralaya. The Supreme Court on May 5, scrapped 13 and 12% quota in jobs and education to Marathas under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018. The SC, however, protected the jobs given before September 9, 2020. The state has appointed a high-level committee under retired high court judge Dilip Bhosale to study the court order and recommend the way forward till May 31. The committee has given seven more days submit its report till June 7. “Besides the legal recourse to find a way out to get the reservation back, the committee is also expected to recommend alternatives to safeguard the jobs of youth who could not be recruited in due time. The decision will be taken in days after the submission of the report,” the official said. Maratha community leaders have expressed their unhappiness over the government decision. “We will not get even 4% share of the EWS quota as many other communities from open category are getting these benefits,” said Rajendra Kondhare, general secretary, Akhil Bharatiya Maratha Mahasangh. Meanwhile, BJP MP and Maratha leader Sambhajhiraje Chhatrapati stirred controversy on Monday by saying that government was spying on him. In a tweet in the evening, he said that he was surprised to learn that government was spying on him with the help of police personnel in his security squad. However, hours after, he tweeted it was a misunderstanding. “State home minister Dilip Walse Patil spoke to me and clarified that there was not such intention. The additional police force was given to prevent any nuisance. I am satisfied with it,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/marathas-now-ews-6k-youths-to-get-govt-jobs-101622488491869.html

Non-essential shops will remain closed on Saturday and Sunday. The new guidelines will be applicable from Tuesday. BMC issued the order under the state government’s ‘Break the Chain’ initiative, under which non-essential shops are allowed to reopen in districts where the positivity rate is below 10% and the oxygen bed occupancy is less than 40%. As Mumbai fulfils both the criteria, some restrictions have been curbed. An order issued by civic commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Monday stated that e-commerce websites will be allowed to deliver non-essential items. However, gyms, salons and beauty parlours will continue to remain shut. Restaurants and bars will also continue to remain shut. However, home delivery is allowed on all days of the week.According to Chahal’s order, on the first week, non-essential shops on the right side of the road will be allowed to open on Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 7am and 2pm, while those on the left side can operate on Tuesday and Thursday. The left-side shops will remain open the next week for three days. Thus, on a rotational basis, both the sides will get to operate the shops thrice every alternate week. BMC officials said that the local wards will provide clarity on which sides of the road will be considered left and right sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nonessential-shops-in-mumbai-to-open-in-rotation-101622488489616.html

Most of these police personnel, from constables to assistant commissioners of police (ACPs) rank, have June 1 as their birth date and on retire on May 31, on the eve of the completion of 58 years.A police officer said that as the new academic sessions used to begin on June 1, children born in the 1960s and 1970s were often given that date as their date of birth, especially if their parents were unsure about the exact dates. Because of this, hundreds of government sector employees have their birth dates on June 1 and retire on May 31.Among those who retired from the police department on Monday include investigators who played a key role in some of the most sensational and high-profile cases, including several terror probes, in the past.“In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, official farewell functions for retiring cops have been cancelled since last March. However, seeing the decline trend in the cases of Covid-19 infection in the city, the department has restarted the felicitation ceremony again from this month,” said a police officer. Considering Covid-19 protocols, senior officers have instructed to keep low-key farewell functions on the respective police stations or other units.“To ensure social distancing and avoid mass gathering, commissioner of police Hemant Nagrale felicitated a group of only 27 retired police personnel selected on the basis of their seniority. The function was held at JS Bharucha Hall at the police headquarters on Monday morning,” said deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Chaitanya Siriprolu.The family members of the police personnel were not invited for the retirement day function as part of the Covid-19 protocol.Those felicitated on their last day in the service include assistant commissioners of police (ACPs) Dattatray Bhadgude, Sukhlal Varpe, Rajendra Patil, Vijay Dhopawkar, Pandit Thorat, Pandharinath Waval, Kundalik Nigade, Vilas Kanade and senior inspectors Pandit Thackerey, Vinod Gadankush and Vidyasagar Kalkundre.The retired cops were presented with wrist watches, a new identity card and a memento, among other gifts.

The court’s directions came after it was informed that the ambulances provided for the rural population and the needy, as per its instructions, had turned into profiteering by the service providers, though there was a cap on the charges that they could collect from Covid-19 patients.The directions were given on May 28, when the division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and Balchandra Debadwar was hearing the criminal suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) based on news reports of issues pertaining to the shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir, treatment of Mucormycosis, bed management and other Covid-related issues. During the hearing, the bench was informed by amicus curiae Satyajit Bora that new reports pointed to profiteering by ambulance service providers. Bora added that while the state and civic authorities had complied with the court’s directions to provide ambulance services in far-flung rural areas, the ambulances were demanding exorbitant amounts. During the May 13 hearing, the bench had been informed that ambulances belonging to the state and some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) had been deployed to ferry patients to Covid-19 facilities, the rates for which were fixed. The bench had accepted the submission but observed that errant drivers of state ambulances should be dealt with strictly, and slip-ups by drivers of ambulances of NGOs would result in deregistration of the organisations themselves. The court had sought an update of the issue in every hearing. In the next hearing on May 19, the state informed the bench that it was complying with the court orders and providing ambulance services in rural areas as well as for the needy. However on May 28, Bora drew the attention of the bench to a news report wherein a journalist had interacted with an ambulance driver who was demanding an exorbitant amount to ferry a patient to a Covid Care Centre. The report also pointed out that though rates had been capped, the ambulance driver refused to abide by it and the regional transport authority had not taken cognisance of the reporter’s complaint. After hearing the submission the bench said, “We are of the view that since the collector of every district is the authority under the Disaster Management Act, all aggrieved patients/their relatives would be at liberty to complain to the district collector if they have suffered such overcharging of ambulance fare. The district collector would deal with such complaints in accordance with the procedure as is laid down.” The next hearing has been scheduled for June 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-act-against-ambulance-services-for-overcharging-101622488429642.html
01-06-2021||Mumbai||SEC nod for BMC elections in February 2022||The state election commission (SEC) on Monday gave a go-ahead to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to hold the civic polls in February 2022. Amid Covid-19 wave, the BMC had last week sought clarification on the schedule. The city has 227 wards and the civic polls were last conducted in February 2017. The Shiv Sena has a majority of corporators (97), followed by BJP (82), Congress (30) and other smaller parties. The civic body will now study the models and patterns of five states – Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry – where Assembly elections were conducted recently. Civic officials will also study the gram panchayat elections conducted in Maharashtra earlier this year. The preparations will be undertaken considering the 2011 census, as the 2021 census is delayed due to the pandemic. UPS Madan, state election commissioner, told HT, “As of now BMC polls are as per schedule.” According to SEC officials, a lottery for reserving wards for women and SC/STs will be undertaken later this year. Reservation for OBCs will be affected by the Supreme Court order which rejected the state government’s review petition concerning reservation to Marathas. The SEC has also asked the BMC to begin work on delimitation of electoral wards or rectification of wards, which were redrawn in 2017. However, since no new census data after 2011 is currently available to carry out a full-fledged delimitation exercise, it is likely that only a rectification process will be carried out. The SEC has also asked the BMC to prepare new voter lists, based on the voter lists for 2019 state Assembly elections. Sangeeta Hasnale, assistant municipal commissioner, said, “We have been informed that the elections for BMC will take place as per schedule in February 2022. Accordingly, we are starting our preparations for the paperwork. We will have to consider 2011 census for the upcoming polls. We will definitely have to consider Covid-19 while planning, considering it may remain till that time. However, the situation might have changed with vaccination, but we will have to factor it in our planning.” Meanwhile, Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party (SP) corporator, said, “I will not comment on whether it is okay to conduct elections. But the BMC can approach the state Covid task force to get an understanding of the ground situation.” Ravi Raja, Congress corporator and leader of opposition in the BMC, said, “It is good that permission has been given by the SEC, but Covid-related factors should be considered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/secnod-for-bmc-elections-in-february-2022-101622488430196.html
01-06-2021||Chandigarh||Govt should brace itself for possible third wave: Hooda||Sounding an alarm bell, leader of opposition in Haryana Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Monday said the state government should start preparing for the possible third wave of coronavirus infection. Hooda said emphasis should be now on strengthening the health services infrastructure in Haryana. At a press briefing on Monday, the former chief minister said a lot of planning will have to be done to handle the post-corona conditions such as inflation, recession, poverty and unemployment. “The unemployment rate in Haryana has reached 35.1% and every third person of the state is unemployed. The government should lend a helping hand to those whose business has been affected during the pandemic,” he said. Hooda demanded that government should give ₹5 lakh each to the families of the people who lost their lives due to Covid. “Pension should also be announced for families with no bread-earner left in their family. But for this, the government must first collect the correct figures of those who died. It is clear that the number of people who died from the pandemic is much higher than the numbers put out by the government,” he said. Hooda said he did not agree with the statement of chief minister ML Khattar who said the government had slowed down the pace of vaccination. “Instead of decreasing the pace of vaccination, it needs to be increased,” he said. Hooda said the government had failed in containing the pandemic and the state health minister himself issued a statement saying that the situation has become so bad that the army will have to be called. The BJP MP from Bhiwani-Mahendragarh had also spoken about the collapse of the health system, Hooda said. Responding to Khattar’s remarks that a letter written by Hooda to him did not deserve a reply, the former chief minister said that as the leader of Opposition, it was his duty to raise people’s problems before the government. “What I had asked were not personal questions but concerns of the people who were battling the virus without beds, medicines and oxygen. But the chief minister did not answer any of them because the government does not have any answers. The CM instead is resorting to political commentary to hide the government’s failure,” Hooda said. “In this hour of crisis, we are ready to cooperate with the government for the welfare of the people. But the CM refused to even call an all-party meeting and is now resorting to passing personal remarks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-should-brace-itself-for-possible-third-wave-hooda-101622488313494.html

Now, over 50% beds dedicated to Covid patients are vacant at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, Bhagat Phool Singh (BPS) Medical College at Khanpur Kalan in Sonepat, Maharaja Agrasen Medical College (MAMC), Agroha, and other healthcare institutes in the region. As per official data, only 110 Covid -19 patients against the bed capacity of 566 are undergoing treatment at PGIMS, which means 81% beds are available. Similarly, MAMC has 200 Covid beds, of which only 98 are occupied, while 270 of the 350 beds are vacant at BPSMC, Khanpur. Director of MAMC Dr Geetika Duggal said only critically ill patients are coming for the treatment now and most of them need either oxygen or ventilator. “There are many patients who were admitted during the peak time and are undergoing treatment. The numbers have started coming down for the last one week. The demand for the ICU beds is still on the higher side, but the oxygen beds are easily available,” she said. PGIMS medical superintendent Dr Pushpa Dahiya said the number of Covid-19 patients has been continuously decreasing and they were relieved. “The critical patients have to stay for longer duration in hospital. Those who are on ventilator support take up to a month to recover. The casualties are also decreasing. Our doctors and other medical staff have worked tirelessly. The people should continue to wear face masks and take all precautions because the virus can take ugly turn anytime,” she added. Doctors at two private hospitals in Rohtak said there is demand for ventilators and most of the patients are from rural areas. “These are the patients who didn’t get tested on time and assumed that they are suffering from viral fever not from covid,” said a doctor, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/more-than-50-covid-beds-in-main-hospitals-vacant-101622488196719.html

The government said while an assessment formula has been issued for Class 10, Class 12 exams have been postponed, adding that taking the same decision for the two would be “like comparing apple and cheese, just because both are edible”. The next hearing is likely on June 1. The state on May 28 announced Class 10 students would be evaluated through internal assessment and results of Class 9 for 2020-21. The affidavit, filed through Rajendra Pawar, deputy secretary, state school education department in response to the PIL by Pune resident and retired professor Dhananjay Kulkarni through advocate Uday Warunjikar, said SSC exams were cancelled considering the safety of students, teachers, parents and stakeholders amid second wave. Kulkarni in his petition claimed there was no justification behind cancelling SSC exams, which nearly 16 lakh students were to appear for, while postponing HSC exams, which are attempted by nearly 14 lakh students. The state said final decisions pertaining to Class 12 exams would be based on consultation, discussion and guidance of stakeholders along with the Centre’s decision on national level. “It was thought fit that Class 12 board examinations were relatively more important milestones in the education of students as their future careers depend upon the same, as compared to 10th standard examinations…There would not be any debate that a Class 12 student would be more mature, independent, socially aware, bodily and mentally fit as compared to Class 10 student…it cannot be said that a decision that is taken in regard to holding or not, of any of these two examinations, must be uniformly made applicable to both these examinations. It is like comparing an apple with cheese only because both are edible.” The affidavit said as there is a threat of a third wave in July or August, which experts say would affect those between 10 and 18 years of age, decisions pertaining to exams will have to be taken after due consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/class-10-12-exams-like-apple-and-cheese-can-t-be-compared-101622488129600.html

The court observed that though the blame game for Covid-related issues will continue, recovery of lives lost to the virus will not be possible. The bench held that as three members of the trade union succumbed to Covid-19, while two others were in home quarantine, “the heavens would not come down” if elections to the union were not held. The division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice Balchandra Debadwar, while hearing a petition filed by the trade union members, was informed by advocate PV Barde that the deputy registrar of the trade unions and Nashik district collector had refused permission to conduct elections on May 12 and 18, respectively. As the term of elected officials would come to an end on May 25, the union wanted to conduct the elections but the members were opposing it. Government pleader DR Kale informed the bench that as per the ‘Break the Chain’ notification of the state government, an assembly of people was not allowed, and if the elections were to be conducted, it would result in violation of the notification and hence, must not be allowed. The union, however, informed the bench through advocate SR Patil that initially the deputy district collector had allowed the election, provided six conditions were complied with. Patil submitted that the poll should be allowed as the union and its members were willing to comply with the conditions. In light of this, he sought HC’s directions for the district collector and deputy registrar to permit the elections.After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “These are unprecedented situations and this country is facing a health challenge. It is the responsibility of every citizen to take care of health and safeguard the health of all others too. If the elections are permitted, and if for any reason, a few voters report [Covid-] positive post elections and leads to loss of life, the entire blame would be on those office-bearers of the union, who are desirous of holding the elections despite such a challenging situation. In such an unfortunate situation, the blame game may continue, but the loss of human life can never be recovered.” The bench refused to issue any direction to authorities to allow the elections and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-rejects-plea-for-trade-union-polls-101622487949614.html

01-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh saw 175% increase in Covid deaths in May||Seeing a record number of infections and deaths, May turned out to be the worst month ever since the pandemic broke out in the city last year.Though the cases have started to come down now, the number gradually increased to 895 single-day cases recorded on May 9. During this month, the city also witnessed overwhelming of the health-care infrastructure as the ICU beds with ventilators remained occupied, leaving the patients scrambling for critical care beds. For seven days in a row, there was scarcity of critical beds in the city.In absolute numbers, the deaths went up from 99 in April to 275 in May, an increase of around 175%. “The surge that was witnessed in the month of April resulted in high number of fatalities in May. The situation is expected to come down in the next three weeks,” said Dr Jagat Ram, the director of PGIMER.In the last one week, the number of new infections grew by an average of 0.3% every day. The positivity rate also reached 3.6%, with a constant decline in the cases from 11%.Dr Amandeep Kang, the director of health services, stated that the doubling rate in the city is now 242 days.

01-06-2021||Chandigarh||May alone accounted for 39% Covid deaths in Mohali||Though there was a dip in the number of Covid-19 cases reported after May 10, the month still contributed to 30% of the total cases so far.Out of a total 66,495 cases, 19,924 cases were reported in May, which is the highest ever number since the outbreak.

01-06-2021||Mumbai||Environment group flags reclamation of CRZ areas for waterfront projects||Environmentalists have once again raised red flags over the reclamation of mangroves, mudflats and other ecologically sensitive intertidal areas along Thane Creek in Navi Mumbai. They alleged reclamation continues unabated despite multiple letters to authorities flagging violation of coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) rules in the area.The latest location to be affected by such reclamation — which has been carried in out in patches since 2017 when construction work on the Thane Waterfront Project began — is the creek front near Saket Ground and Biodiversity Park, a kilometre of which has been buried under rubble and debris, according to city-based environment group Vanashakti.“The entire stretch of the creek has been reclaimed and a wall has been made inside creeklets... On the other side of the road, huge stretches of mangroves and intertidal areas have been reclaimed and dead transplanted tree trunks are visible. Reclamation and dumping of debris and waste is seen on both sides of the road. Dumping of debris and work is going on in CRZ-1 areas, within 50 metres of mangroves and on mangroves at many places,” Vanashakti wrote in a letter dated May 29 to the environment department, mangrove cell and revenue department.In a separate letter titled Objection to reclamation of mudflats and inter tidal areas for waterfront and beautification projects, addressed to the environment department and Cidoco, Vanashakti clarified they “have no intention of preventing the use of waterfront areas for recreation, but the constructions and reclamation cannot happen inside high tide line”. “We have objected to the violations and time and again, but the local bodies say Maritime Board has given permission,” the letter read.The letter was prompted by legislator Manda Mhatre’s announcement on May 20 that work on a marina waterfront in Navi Mumbai’s Belapur area is soon to commence. Together with a jetty, the marina project is expected to boost tourism along a network of waterfront destinations in Mumbai, Raigad and Thane including Bhaucha Dhakka and Elephanta Caves, among others. The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) had given CRZ clearance for the project in March 2019.“We have observed that MCZMA gives permissions for constructions in CRZ with a general rider in general conditions that states that work should be in accordance with the provisions of the CRZ notification. Beyond that there is no specific directions given. We also find a condition that mangroves will not be destroyed and that permission of the Bombay high court must be obtained to destroy mangroves,” wrote Vanashakti. However, despite these clauses, which were also present in the clearance for Thane waterfront development, rampant reclamation of intertidal areas within the high tide line still continues, pointed out Stalin D, director of Vanashakti.The problem, experts said, is that simply curbing mangrove destruction is not enough to protect mudflats and associated intertidal ecosystems.“We request you to specify that no reclamation or construction will be done inside the approved high tide line. The loss of intertidal areas in such projects means that entire stretches of biologically active mudflats are permanently buried... The destruction that has happened in Thane must not be repeated in Navi Mumbai,” Vanashakti wrote. The group also called upon the Maharashtra Maritime Board to exercise restraint and ensure that they do not permit projects that need extensive reclamation and destruction of intertidal biodiversity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/environment-group-flags-reclamation-of-crz-areas-for-waterfront-projects-101622487290345.html
01-06-2021||Mumbai||Woman fights off two thieves in Nallasopara flat||A 35-year-old trichologist fought off two thieves who entered her flat in Nallasopara (West) on Sunday. The thieves broke into her flat on the fourth floor of the building in dawn by sliding the grill-less aluminium windows, when she was sleeping on the sofa in her living room. One of the thieves, Hussain Kader Shaikh, 30, lived on the first floor of the same building and has been arrested in the case, said senior inspector Vasant Labde of Nallasopara police station. Dr Sheetal Alhat said she had shifted to the flat, which belongs to her friend, a fortnight ago as her own flat is under renovation. “As the bedroom of my friend’s flat is full of her belongings, I would sleep in the living room. Around 4.15am on Sunday, the two thieves entered the flat and Shaikh covered my mouth, held a knife and threatened to kill me. But I fought back, bit his hand and freed myself. The other thief opened the main door, and both ran away with my mobile phone and a purse containing ₹5,000 and other documents,” said the medico. She then screamed for help and alerted the neighbours. Police registered a case under sections 380 (theft), 458 (house trespass) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested Shaikh after the victim identified him. The other accomplice is absconding. “Shaikh has been remanded in police custody by the Vasai court and we are investigating further,” said Labde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/woman-fights-off-two-thieves-in-nallasopara-flat-101622487230830.html
01-06-2021||Mumbai||Curbs eased in Mumbai, Maharashtra cities from today||Most of Maharashtra’s 10 major cities, such as Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Aurangbad and Nagpur, will see a slight relaxation in lockdown curbs from Tuesday after the state government’s notification issued on Sunday. Besides these cities, around 20 districts will see curbs relaxed as their positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds has improved over the past few days. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, while taking a serious note of the traffic jams on arterial roads in Mumbai, however, warned of imposing curbs again if the congestion on the city’s roads continued.Meanwhile, Maharashtra on Monday recorded 15,077 Covid-19 cases. bringing the total in May to 1,141,447. April saw 1,794,406 cases. After the stricter curbs of more than four weeks, the state issued a notification on Sunday, announcing a few relaxations in districts that have a Covid-19 testing positivity rate of less than 10% and the occupancy of oxygen beds is less than 40%. A total of 22 districts have their positivity rate at less than 10%, but five to six of them account for over 40%, with respect to oxygen-bed occupancy. As a result, 20 districts would be able to implement the relaxations announced on Sunday. The state government has classified 10 cities with more than 1 million population as a unit to ensure that the high positivity and oxygen bed occupancy of the district does not affect them. This means if the Pune district’s positivity rate is more than 10%, it would not prohibit Pune city from rolling out relaxations if the city fit the criterion.“Most of the 10 cities enlisted will be eligible for relaxations and they have issued their orders accordingly. The idea was to safeguard the urban areas, which have less positivity rate from the rural parts of districts, with high rate. But in smaller cities, the district’s rate is applicable, because of the high mobility from city to rural parties and vice versa. In big cities, municipal corporations have mechanisms to contain the spread from rural areas,” said an official from Mantralaya.He said that barring Panvel, all other eight municipal corporations in MMR are eligible for the relaxations. Sindhudurg in Konkan is the only district which will have stricter curbs and would not be able to allow inter-district travel.State government has allowed to extend the timings of operation of the essential sector establishments to 7 to 2pm, from existing 7 to 11am. The shops and establishments in non-essential sectors have been allowed to operate in the same time, but the powers to decide it have been given to local authorities. The attendance in the government offices has been increased to 25% from 15%. The new orders will come into force from Tuesday morning and will remain in force till 7 am on June 15.Rajesh Narvekar, collector, Thane, said that the district’s positivity rate is below 10% and the oxygen bed occupancy is 22%. “Entire district is eligible for the relaxations but the three municipal corporations (Thane, KDMC and Navi Mumbai) will issue their orders, while our order for relaxation will be applicable to two smaller municipal corporations - Mira-Bhayander, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, rural areas, two municipal councils,” he said.Panvel municipal commissioner Sudhakar Deshmukh said that though their positivity rate is less than 10% , the oxygen bed occupancy is little more than 40% because of patients coming from rural areas. “That is the reason we would not be able to relax the curbs,” he said.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, however, on Monday warned the people from Mumbai to brace for stricter curbs if the crowding on roads continues. “Corona has not gone yet. The threat of the pandemic is not over. The lockdown restrictions have not been lifted because of it, but there are traffic jams on arterial roads and it is critical. If this continues, we would not even continue with the relaxations which have been given now. We will be left with no other option to go for re-imposing stricter norms,” he said at a function at the international airport.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said he was surprised by the traffic jams on Monday morning. “As I was arriving for this programme, I faced traffic jams. The Covid-19 is still there,” said Pawar.Meanwhile, according to Subhash Salunke, adviser to the government of Maharashtra on Covid-19 management, various factors contributed to the decline. “The lockdown played an important role in the decline and even the urban population was careful,” said Salunke. He attributed the rise in rural areas to the casual attitude of the people. “The rural population is still not adhering to Covid-19-appropriate behaviour, like wearing masks or maintaining social distance. The enforcement of lockdown is poor,” said Salunke.Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary-general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild, blamed the administration for the neglect in the rural belt. “The local administration in places like Amravati, Konkan, Satara and Sangli focussed on only urban areas. In these places, there were hardly any proper testing or counselling facilities for patients. The administration was caught unawares as they felt like the first wave, it will hardly impact the rural areas,” said Gilada.There were 184 deaths on Monday, which took the toll to 95,344. The total number of tests conducted on Monday were 1,93,446, while the number of recoveries were 33,000. He credited the government for their efforts to bring down the numbers especially in urban pockets.Mumbai recorded 666 cases with 29 deaths. The state currently has 2,53,367 active cases, while the total number of people affected by Covid-19 till date has reached 57,46,892. There are currently 2,53,367 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 36,563 patients, followed by Mumbai with 24,850 active patients.The toll has now reached 95,344 with Mumbai leading with 14,826 deaths, followed by Pune with 12,507. On Sunday, BJP legislator Mahesh Landge was said to have celebrated his daughter’s wedding, disregarding Covid-19 norms The police has registered a case against him for violating the norms. The Vasai-Virar administration in order to control the virus has now ramped up its testing by setting camps in places like outside the railway stations and randomly testing the citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/curbs-eased-in-mumbai-maharashtra-cities-from-today-101622487230178.html

01-06-2021||Mumbai||Anti-crash barrier to be put up along vulnerable route of Matheran toy train||In a move to increase safety of passengers travelling by popular toy train between Neral and Matheran, anti-crash barriers will be installed on the route.The anti-crash barriers will be installed on the 1.5-km railway track stretch of the 21-km route between Neral and Matheran railway stations. The 1.5-km stretch where the barriers will be installed include the track stretch with open valley near it. Work on the installation of the same will begin post monsoon. In addition, construction of retaining wall and strengthening of the entire railway track between Neral and Matheran stations will also be undertaken. “Work on strengthening the tracks is presently going on. The anti-crash barriers will be introduced as safety barriers for the toy train,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway.The zonal railway recently floated a tender for the provision of anti-crash barriers and gabion wall for strengthening of track embankment and other track protection work in critical locations in the railway section. Presently, only shuttle services between Aman Lodge and Matheran railway stations are operational due to the damage caused by Cyclone Nisarga in 2020. Toy train tracks and retaining walls were washed away due to heavy rainfall caused by the severe cyclonic storm in Matheran.Earlier, after a series of derailments during operations on the Neral-Matheran toy train route, Central Railway had introduced a new inter-railway communications system. The optical fibre communication system was introduced on the entire 21-km stretch and placed parallel to the tracks in order to improve communication between motorman, guard of the toy train and railway station masters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anticrash-barrier-to-be-put-up-along-vulnerable-route-of-matheran-toy-train-101622487170894.html
01-06-2021||Mumbai||Two vital links between Thane and Kalyan partially open for commuters||In a major relief to citizens in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) region, especially in cities such as Thane, Bhiwandi and Kalyan, one arm of the Rajnouli flyover and two lanes of the six-lane Durgadi flyover on Bhiwandi-Kalyan Road was inaugurated by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday. The two bridges will reduce the travel time by around 30 to 40 minutes along the Thane-Kalyan route. “The existing two-lane bridge cannot handle the increasing vehicular traffic movement on the busy NH-222. To overcome this situation, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) proposed to construct a new six-lane bridge parallel to the existing bridge so that a total of eight lanes will be available for motorists. Today we opened two new lanes; so along with the existing two lanes, commuters can now access four lanes,” said an MMRDA official. MMRDA granted administrative approval to extend works during its meeting held on June 27, 2014 for a budget of ₹85 crore. After the commencement of work, the original contractor carried out preliminary survey and made a design of the bridge. As per the revised no objection certificate dated May 9, 2017 of the Maharashtra Maritime Board, the length of the navigational span had to be increased and the proposed structural design of the bridge had to be changed. Therefore, an extension was sanctioned till May 2019 to complete the work of the parallel bridge. However, the machinery and manpower required for the construction could not be provided by the contractor. The contract of the contractor was terminated on October 25, 2018 after a show-cause notice was issued on September 5, 2018 due to no progress of work. Around 20% of the work was completed over a 32-month period. A new contractor was then appointed on March 8, 2019 for an estimated expense of ₹101.70 crore. “By overcoming the hurdles encountered due to heavy rains during the monsoon of 2019 and 2020 and lockdown, two of the six lanes were open to vehicular traffic. The decongestion of road traffic on both sides of Durgadi bridge is expected,” added the official. The bridge is 820.60-metre long and 25.30-metre wide. “Both the bridges play a vital role in traffic movement between Thane, Bhiwandi, Kalyan, Mumbai and Nashik. Now we have additional lanes to divert the traffic and this will definitely help reduce the traffic jam,” said Balasaheb Patil, deputy commissioner of traffic police, Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/two-vital-links-between-thane-and-kalyan-partially-open-for-commuters-101622487109583.html
01-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC House passes resolution for rolling back water tariff hike||The municipal corporation (MC) general House on Monday once again passed a resolution seeking the cancellation of the UT administration notification passed in September 2020, under which water tariff had been hiked by 200%. The civic body also sought that payments made over the last ten months be adjusted in the future bills of residents and reduction in sewage cess. Congress councillor and city Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Arun Sood, said, “After the September resolution is cancelled and the pandemic ends, a fresh look will be taken at the water tariff.” Notably, the administration had issued an order on May 25, deferring the implementation of the September notification till March 31, 2022. But, the order was prospective in nature ie the stay on the hiked bills was only for the next six months, and not for the previous ten months for which residents have already paid. The administration had also stated that there will be no adjustment.However, municipal commissioner KK Yadav had opposed the MC’s resolution on rollback of the hiked tariffs, citing major losses to the financially-struggling civic body. The MC is likely to suffer a loss of at least ₹68 crore in the wake of the deferment.House calls for 25% slash in sewage cessThe House has also sought immediate reduction in sewage cess from the current 30% to 5%. The cess is imposed on the water bill charges and it was hiked in 2018. The cess came under severe criticism after the water tariff hike after which residents had to pay nearly double. The MC house also decided to constitute a committee to suggest relief measures like reduction in property tax in the wake of hardships caused due to the pandemic. Garbage collection charges revisedThe MC General House revised the monthly garbage collection charges, reducing them in most categories. It also changed the measurement unit for calculation of user charges in urban residential properties from square metre to marla/kanal. The charges are ₹50 for less than 2 marla, ₹100 for 2-10 marla, ₹200 for 10 marla-1 kanal, ₹250 for 1-2 kanal and ₹350 for above 2 kanal. Street vendors have to pay ₹50 and traders have to pay between ₹200 and ₹800. Depending upon the seating capacity, restaurants and hotels have to pay ₹2,000- ₹5,000. The rate for community centres and marriage palaces is ₹1,000 per event.In rural areas, rates for houses range between ₹50 and ₹200, while shops have to pay ₹100 and eateries ₹200. New tenders to be invited for sanitation of southern sectorsIt was also decided that fresh tenders will be invited for the cleaning of southern sectors.Currently, Delhi-based Lions Services Limited has been carrying out mechanised sweeping in southern sectors at a cost of ₹5 crore per month. The project had been outsourced to the firm in 2016 for five years.MC had tabled the agenda for extension of the current contract, but the House decided to call fresh tenders, for which the same contractor can apply again.Notably, the MC had constituted a committee under its chief engineer, to examine whether to continue with existing company or call allot a fresh contract. The committee, in its meeting on May 13, unanimously resolved that the contract period of the Lion Service Limited should not be extended and the contract be allotted afresh.Plans for garbage processing plant’s upgrade in limbo The House failed to take a final decision on the technology to be adopted to upgrade the garbage processing plant in Dadumajra. It was decided that councillors will now visit sites of waste processing plants where different technologies are being used.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-house-passes-resolution-for-rollback-of-water-tariff-hike-101622487055247.html

The accused, Faisal Shaikh, entered the compartment at 7.15pm at Kalwa station when the train started moving. He tried to snatch Patil’s phone and get off the train, but she resisted and held the accused. Shaikh, a habitual offender, got down despite the train gaining speed and pushed Patil when she tried to get off.” Patil fell just when the platform ended and came under the train and died on the spot. Other commuters pulled the emergency chain and the motorman informed the railway officials. The GRP officer added, “We checked the CCTV footage and the accused was immediately identified as he was wanted in several other chain snatching incidents.

The video went “viral” on Sunday. Superintendent of police (Sant Kabirnagar) Dr Kaustubh said after taking cognizance of the video, an inquiry had been ordered into the incident. In the video, the trio was seen carrying the body to the field in an excavator along with the cot on which their father had died. They used the excavator to dig up field to bury the body and the cot. The station house officer (SHO) of Dharamsinghwa police station has been directed to submit a report. Action will be taken against those who flouted the state government’s order to cremate or bury the bodies of Covid -19 patients according to the Covid protocol, the SP said. A district administration officer said Ram Lalit, 62, resident of Parsa Shukla village, complained of breathing difficulty on May 22. His sons took him to a private hospital in Gorakhpur. The hospital admitted him and he tested positive for Covid-19. Nevertheless, the sons got their father discharged from the hospital on May 23 to take him to their village. Ram Lalit died after reaching the village. Instead of using a hearse, the sons hired an excavator to transport the body and the cot on which their father died. The three sons, Buddhi Ram, Anil and Mohan, said when the villagers and neighbours came to know that their father was Covid positive, they closed their doors. “With no support from the villagers or the family members, we decided to hire a JCB machine to bury the body,” they said. Countering the sons’ statement, the village pradhan’s representative Triyuga Nand Gautam said the village panchayat members offered assistance to Ram Lalit’s sons in cremating of the body, but they turned down the offer. A medical practitioner Dr AK Singh said the district administration should ensure that the body of a Covid-19 patient was buried or cremated according to the protocol in order to check the spread of infection. Dumping a body in a field was in violation of the protocol, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-men-bury-covid-19-positive-father-s-body-in-up-village-field-probe-ordered-101622486809557.html
01-06-2021||Other||UP again extends deadline for submission of vaccine bids||Uttar Pradesh may have to wait for some more days to procure Covid vaccines from foreign or Indian companies as the state cabinet on Monday approved a proposal to further extend by 10 days the last date for the submission of bids in response to a global tender floated to get 40 million doses for the state. June 10 is now the last date for the bids.“Yes, we are extending the last date for the submission of bids by 10 days,” said additional chief secretary (health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad.This is the second such extension. It comes a day before the launch of vaccination for all above 18 years of age in all 75 districts of the state. A senior officer of the state government said sufficient quantity of vaccine was available in Uttar Pradesh. The officer also said the state government proposed to administer one crore doses in June following the directives of chief minister Yogi Adityanath in this regard.The state government had earlier fixed May 21 as the last date and then extended it by 10 days to May 31 on the request of the vaccine manufacturers.A decision to further extend the last date was taken after briefing the state cabinet (by circulation method) about the demand and the availability of the vaccine for the 18-45 year age group.Prasad said the last date was extended again on the request of the vaccine manufacturing companies that were keen to participate in the global tender. The representatives of the various companies again sought the extension on the same issues as earlier, including regulatory approval from the central government, Prasad said. Others said that they needed time to maintain the vaccine stock as, according to the bid conditions, the companies would have to supply the second dose after the first one, he added. The representative of another company said that they needed time for obtaining approval for the vaccine rate, the additional chief secretary said.Even as foreign vaccine manufacturing companies Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson have said that they have a policy to enter into agreements only with national governments, Uttar Pradesh government spokesperson and cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh said the UP government had opened channels with the foreign companies. In the pre-bid meeting held on May 13, top vaccine manufacturing companies — Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Zydus Cadila, Pfizer, Serum Institute of India (SII), Bharat Biotech and a Korean company — had raised the issues of storage and transportation of the vaccines and bid security. The state government on May 17 had revised the supply conditions, bid security and eligibility terms for the bidders to pave the way for the participation of maximum companies. In the revised tender, the state government stated that the manufacturers of vaccines requiring storage or transportation at temperatures like -20 degrees Celsius, -70 degrees Celsius or -80 degrees Celsius can participate in the tender, thereby paving the way for the entry of foreign vaccine manufacturers like Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson in the global tender.The vaccines manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer are stored at low temperatures, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-again-extends-deadline-for-submission-of-vaccine-bids-101622486569569.html
01-06-2021||Chandigarh||HC pulls up Chandigarh admn for ‘undue hurry’ in power privatisation||The Punjab and Haryana high court has come down heavily on the Chandigarh administration for showing “undue hurry” in pushing for power privatisation amid a raging pandemic. “... we are unable to reconcile with the fact that when the whole world is grappling with the deadly virus, when there is no oxygen, no ICUs, a long queue at the cremation grounds and no place in the hospitals, the undue hurry on the part of the administration to hand over the profit-making department to a private entity at this stage of the history and in this situation of crisis faced by the entire mankind, seems to be misplaced,” the bench of justice Jitendra Chauhan and justice Vivek Puri recorded. Justice Chauhan retired on Friday, the day the bench stayed the UT’s move to privatise the power department. The order, which came on a plea of the UT Powermen Union, was released on Monday. Earlier, on December 1 too, the HC had applied brakes on the process. However, the UT approached the Supreme Court, which had stayed the HC order but also remanded back the case to it.‘A profit-making entity’ The bench said that it is not clear as to what was the intended purpose of setting up the engineering wing — the power distributor in the city — and whether it has failed to achieve the same. The court also wondered that when the department is a profit-making entity, how it is covered under Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self -Reliant India Mission). “If the argument on behalf of the respondents is to make India ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, we are at a loss to understand that what can be more ‘Atmanirbhar’ than an institution made in India, by Indians, operationalised by Indians, creating jobs for Indians and enriching the Indian State with its profits,” it remarked. ‘Protect such institutions’The bench further said that such institutions (departments) should be protected, as they provide a security net for the society to fall back upon, for the poorest of the poor to dream of a better future and for the person at the end of the line to be aspirational, so that he too can be part of the Indian dream. “The proposed action of privatisation is in direct conflict with the nation’s agenda ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’,” the bench asserted. The bench said that at a time when the functioning of the courts is curtailed and the petition could not be decided, the cause of “justice and humanity” will be better served by putting the process in abeyance. “We feel that privatisation is not a panacea for all the ills and privatisation with blind motive of so-called efficiency falls flat as this department is not only a profitable one but also time and again matched the high standards of customer satisfaction and has a big role in maintaining the City Beautiful,” it recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-pulls-up-chandigarh-admn-for-undue-hurry-in-power-privatisation-101622486270663.html

He directed that school fees of all such children be exempted. Also, if any child needs accommodation in the administration’s welfare home, it should be provided for free, he said.

In the video, a Covid-19 patient is seen lying under a washbasin, near the toilet while another is lying naked on the floor.The video was allegedly shared by the attendant of a Covid-19 patient who died at the hospital on May 23.Bibhudutta Dash, who lives in Baripada town of Myurbhanj, said he admitted his relative to the Covid-19 hospital in Baripada on May 22.“As his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to another Covid hospital at Bankisole, about 10 kilometres from Baripada town. On May 23 at noon, I was informed about the death of my relative,” said Dash, who got the video clip on Saturday.“In the video, I saw my relative sitting on the bed on which there was no bed sheet and pillow. He was wearing just a towel. Some of them are also seen sleeping in front of the toilet. There were some oxygen cylinders in the ward. But there was no one to operate them. There are no staff nurses and doctors to attend to the patients. The government is spending a huge amount on the treatment of the Covid patients but where is all the money going and to whom?” he asked.BJP MLA from Baripada, Prakash Soren, also alleged negligence in the treatment of patients at the Covid hospital at Bankisole. “Several patients are dying in the facility in the absence of oxygen support. The doctors do not understand what the patients want and the nurses do not come close to them fearing infection. The situation is such that patients do not even get food on time,” he alleged.Mayurbhanj district collector Vineet Bhardwaj said efforts are on to install CCTVs in the hospital to monitor the activities and fill the gaps.The hospital was set up last year after the Mayurbhanj administration signed an MoU with the Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS). It was closed in March after cases of Covid-19 dipped in the district.This month, the National Human Rights Commission issued summons to the Odisha health secretary to appear before it on June 30 over the death of a Covid-19 patient at the verandah of the district headquarters hospital of Dhenkanal due to the alleged negligence of medical staff.In the second wave of Covid, at least 830 patients in Odisha have succumbed to the disease since April 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patients-sleeping-near-toilets-video-of-odisha-s-covid-19-hospital-goes-viral-101622485850036.html
01-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi likely to get Sputnik shots only after June 20, says Kejriwal||The Capital is likely to receive its first consignment of Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccines after June 20, said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday, even as the Capital’s government-run vaccination centres for the 18-45 age group continue to remain shut after having run out of the two India-made vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, the doses of which will only be available by June 10, according to health officials.“Sputnik will probably offer vaccines only after June 20. They (Indian manufacturer of Sputnik) will start vaccine production in August. As of now, Sputnik V vaccines are being imported to our country. A portion of these imported vaccines will also be allotted to the Delhi government,” Kejriwal told reporters after opening a vaccine centre for journalists and their families at ITO.The chief minister reiterated that the central government should procure vaccines through a single global tender and distribute them to states. “It has become apparent that states are not able to procure vaccines on their own and the Centre has to do it. States should be held responsible if and when they are not able to make proper arrangements to administer the vaccines after the Centre has procured, produced and supplied vaccines to us,” Kejriwal said.Also read: Covid orphaned 1,700 children, another 7,400 lost one parent, Supreme Court toldThe government vaccination centres for those between the ages of 18 and 45 years have been closed for over a week after Delhi ran out of its allocated vaccine doses for the month. Next month, the city will receive even fewer doses. Only 550,000 vaccine doses will be available in June as compared to over 817,000 doses that it got in the month of May.“In Delhi, government vaccination centres have been completely closed for the 18-plus age group for more than a week. Only private hospitals are vaccinating the young, but at expensive rates. We urge the central government to make available vaccines for the youth soon because the lockdown in Delhi will slowly be eased and youngsters will move out of homes once the process begins,” said AAP MLA Atishi.Although vaccine doses were available with only three major hospital chains in Delhi – Max, Fortis, and Apollo – at the beginning of the month, at least 14 others have started inoculating people between the ages of 18 and 45 years.The vaccine doses have been procured by individual hospitals. Of the 14 hospitals, with several branches and sites, Covaxin is being administered at five and Covishield at the rest, according to Co-WIN portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-likely-to-get-sputnik-vaccines-only-after-june-20-kejriwal-101622485609452.html
01-06-2021||Delhi||BJP trying to stop CM efforts to give Covid jabs to all: Sisodia||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday accused Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and ministers of criticising chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for his “relentless efforts” towards vaccinating every adult in the national Capital, instead of extending their support.“It is the prerogative of the Delhi government to ensure each and every citizen gets vaccinated at once. Every time CM Kejriwal begins his work towards helping people and managing the Covid crisis, BJP leaders, instead of following his lead, start attacking him and try to stop his efforts,” Sisodia said in a digital press conference.Delhi BJP leaders dismissed the charges, and said the turnout at vaccinations centres in Delhi was low.Sisodia’s statement came hours after Haryana CM ML Khattar accused Kejriwal of playing politics over Covid vaccines, saying Delhi is exhausting its supply too soon while his state is stretching it over a longer period.Kejriwal also responded to this through a tweet in Hindi: “Khattar sahab, it is only with vaccines that we can save the lives of people. The sooner vaccines are administered, more people will be protected (from the virus). My goal is not to save vaccines, but to save people’s lives.”At the press conference, Sisodia reiterated that “the mission of the Delhi government is to save people, not vaccines”.Also read| Delhi likely to get Sputnik vaccines only after June 20: KejriwalKhattar’s comment was also criticised by the Congress. “Deliberate delay in administering vaccines is also being termed as a strategy. He (CM) says the government has vaccines, but these will be administered to people in small numbers over several days. This is the reason why the people of Haryana are not able to get the vaccines...,” said Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala in a tweet in Hindi.On Sunday, BJP national president JP Nadda, ostensibly alluding to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), had said it was creating “hindrances” in Delhi.Sisodia, on Monday, said BJP leaders make false statements to “hide their own failures”. “When the nation was reeling under Covid cases and needed immediate help, BJP government was more interested in managing their image and conducting elections. It seems like the only mission is to sell and save vaccines by playing dirty politics,” he said.In response, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta accused the AAP of resorting to politics over the issue.“Nobody is stopping them from demanding vaccines for Delhi... When it was time to talk to Indian vaccine manufacturers, AAP leaders were busy criticising the Centre and now when they failed to arrange vaccine, they are playing politics of confrontation with private hospitals by questioning their vaccine quota,” he said.The Delhi BJP further said there is low turnout in government vaccination centres.“It should be noted that Delhi has 180 vaccination centres where Covishield is being administered to people above 45 years of age. In all these places, the footfall is significantly dismal. In Rohini’s Sector 9 on May 30, the centre had 400 Covishield doses available, and only 55 people took the dose. Today (May 31), only 70 people visited the centre, while it had 400 Covishield doses available for 45+ group. At Prashant Vihar centre on May 29, 100 doses of Covishield were available and only one person got the jab,” claimed Rohini MLA Vijender Gupta.Speaking to reporters on Monday, chief minister Kejriwal said, “Procurement and distribution is the responsibility of the Centre, and administering the vaccines is the responsibility of the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-leaders-trying-to-stop-cm-s-efforts-to-vaccine-at-delhi-residents-sisodia-101622485549526.html

Police said they kept watch to ensure unexempted businesses and individuals do not open up or move around.Amid a sharp fall in Covid-19 cases in the city, the Delhi government started easing the lockdown that has been in place in Delhi since April 20, and allowed construction and manufacturing units in approved industrial areas to function from Monday.“The movement on the city’s roads increased marginally. So we pressed more police staff at the pickets as there was a possibility of some taking undue advantage,” said Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police spokesperson.Also read| Covid-19: ICMR plans 4th nationwide sero surveyWhile the guidelines mandate workers to show ID cards, police said they were given instructions to verify those who didn’t have adequate papers as well. “We sent out our personnel with a briefing that there could be many genuine factory and construction workers who do not have identity cards. The police were instructed to use their experience to distinguish genuine workers the rest,” said RP Meena, DCP(south-east), an area which has hundreds of factories in its jurisdiction.While police officers estimated a 5-10% increase in movement on the roads on Monday, not too many factories opened on the first day. “There were also factories that didn’t open due to lack of raw materials, or because opening up wouldn’t be profitable to them without most of their workers,” said Meena.As for compliance with the guidelines at workplaces, police said they held meetings with associations and owners of these factories and construction sites. “They were counselled and sensitised about the guidelines...

01-06-2021||World||Canadian firm ties up with Indian company for Covid vaccine production||A Canadian vaccine maker has tied up with a Hyderabad-based pharma company for production of the former’s Covid-19 vaccine.Providence Therapeutics, headquartered in Calgary in the province of Alberta, has struck a deal with Biological E for transfer of technology from the Canadian company, while it will sell 30 million doses of its vaccine candidate, called PTX-Covid19-B.“This sale represents the sale of all the remaining 2021 Providence production, plus a portion of the early 2022 Providence production, after accounting for the first sale of Providence vaccines to the Province of Manitoba, Canada,” a joint statement from the two companies said.Providence CEO Brad Sorenson said, “This initiative is an important commitment by a Canada-based company to help India and other nations vaccinate their citizens against Covid-19. Providence was founded to serve patients, and this commitment by Biological E allows us to achieve that essential goal.”However, the availability of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in India will be contingent upon it receiving the necessary emergency-use authorisation from India authorities.Sorenson also said Providence was looking at “a minimum production capacity of 600 million doses in 2022 and a target capacity of one billion doses”.Biological E will be responsible for clinical development and regulatory activities for the mRNA vaccine in India.On May 12, Providence had announced “very favourable interim clinical data” for its Phase 1 study of the efficacy of the vaccine candidate. While the company had originally looked at ramping up vaccine manufacturing capability within Canada, Sorenson had later complained of the lack of sustained support from the Canadian government that was forcing it to seek opportunities abroad.“The mRNA platform has emerged as the front-runner in delivering the first vaccines for emergency use to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Biological E is very pleased to be able to work with Providence on its promising mRNA vaccine candidate. We hope to provide India and other countries yet another option to ramp up their efforts towards achieving herd immunity against Covid-19,” said Mahima Datla, managing director of Biological E.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-firm-ties-up-with-indian-company-for-covid-vaccine-production-101622570279931.html

The certificates are being issued to people who are fully vaccinated as well as those have already contracted the virus and developed antibodies and others who have had a PCR test within the last 72 hours.The documents will have both digital and paper forms. They’ll be free of charge, distributed in the national language plus English and be valid in all the bloc’s countries.“EU citizens are looking forward to travelling again, and they want to do so safely. Having an EU certificate is a crucial step on the way,” EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said.Greece’s digital governance minister, Kyriakos Pierrakakis, said easier travel will open up within the EU as nations adopt the new verification standard.“What will happen is that countries will stop issuing certificates using their own convention and adopt the common convention. That will simplify things considerably, because you can imagine the number of bilateral agreements that would otherwise need to be worked out,” Pierrakakis told private Skai television.Kyriakides said in the next few weeks, all EU nations need to "fully finalize their national systems to issue, store and verify certificates, so the system is functioning in time for the holiday season.”Countries will be allowed to add extra vaccines to their individual entry list, including those that have not been formally approved for use across the EU.The EU Commission believes that people who are vaccinated should no longer have to be tested or put into quarantines, regardless of where they are travelling to or from, starting 14 days after receiving their second shot.Member countries, however, have not yet endorsed that recommendation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-greece-5-other-countries-kick-off-covid-19-vaccination-travel-certificates-101622569734745.html

Yet, he hopes to access enough water to produce a marketable melon crop.Farmers across California say they expect to receive little water from state and federal agencies that regulate the state's reservoirs and canals, leading many to leave fields barren, plant more drought-tolerant crops or seek new income sources all-together."We're taking a big risk in planting crops and hoping the water gets here in time," said Del Bosque, 72.Agriculture is an important part of California's economy and the state is a top producer of vegetables, berries, nuts and dairy products. The last major drought from 2012 to 2017 reduced irrigation supplies to farmers, forced strict household conservation measures and stoked deadly wildfires.California farmers are allocated water from the state based on seniority and need, but farmers say water needs of cities and environmental restrictions reduce agricultural access.Nearly 40% of California's 24.6 million acres of farmland are irrigated, with crops like almonds and grapes in some regions needing more water to thrive."I'm going to be reducing some of our almond acreage. I may be increasing some of our row crops, like tomatoes," said Stuart Woolf, who operates 30,000 acres, most of it in Western Fresno County. He may fallow 30% of his land.Del Bosque, who grows melons, asparagus, sweet corn, almonds and cherries, said his operation could lose more than half a million dollars in income, and put many of his 700 workers out of work. He and other farmers say drought has been exacerbated by California's lack of investment in water storage infrastructure over the last 40 years."Fundamentally, a storage project is paid for by the people who want the water," said Jeanine Jones, drought manager for California's Department of Water Resources. "All we can do is deliver what mother nature provides."New dams face environmental restrictions meant to protect endangered fish and other wildlife, and don't solve near-term water needs, said Ernest Conant, regional director of the Bureau of Reclamation, California-Great Basin region, the federal agency that overseas dams, canals and water allocations in the Western United States."We simply don't have enough water to supply our agricultural users," said Conant. "We're hopeful some water can be moved sooner than October, but there's no guarantees."Water scarcity threatens Del Bosque's watermelon crop, which is due to be harvested in August. But it also has dire consequences for those planting it."If there is no water, there is no work. And for us farm workers, how are we going to support the family?" said 57-year-old Pablo Barrera, who was planting watermelons for Del Bosque.Woolf said as the state continues to restrict water access, he's exploring ways to generate income off the land he can no longer irrigate, including installing solar arrays and planting Agave, normally grown in Mexico to make tequila."You've got to absorb all of your farming costs on the few acres that you're farming," he said. "How do we maximize the value of the land that we are not farming?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/big-risk-california-farmers-hit-by-drought-change-planting-plans-101622569219150.html
01-06-2021||World||Miami-area shootings mark bloody Memorial Day weekend||Gunfire that wounded two people in Miami Beach wrapped up a violent Memorial Day weekend in the Miami area, which included a mass shooting that killed two and injured 21 others, law enforcement authorities said.Miami Beach police received multiple 911 calls reporting a shooting just after 11:30 p.m. Monday. Officers found one person struck in the shoulder and another in the leg, spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez said in a social media post. Both were taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital.During the investigation, the heavily traveled MacArthur Causeway was shut down in both directions. It had reopened by early Tuesday.Rodriguez said “several possible suspects" had been detained.Meanwhile, a manhunt continued Tuesday for three masked suspects who opened fire early Sunday outside a Miami banquet hall. On Monday, police released a surveillance camera video that showed a white SUV driving into an alley at a strip mall housing El Mula Banquet Hall in northwest Miami-Dade County, near Hialeah.The video showed three people getting out of the vehicle, one gripping a handgun while the other two carried what police described as “assault-style rifles.” They began spraying bullets indiscriminately into the crowd, though police said the assailants had specific targets in mind.In addition to the two fatalities, three others were hospitalized in critical condition. Police did not release the victims' names, citing privacy laws.The SUV used in the shooting was found Monday submerged in a canal about 8 miles (13 kilometers) east of the banquet hall. Police said it had been reported stolen two weeks ago.Miami-Dade Police said Sunday’s shooting was unrelated to a drive-by shooting Friday night that killed a person and injured six others outside another venue in the Wynwood area. Some witnesses likened the scene to a “war zone” after a barrage of dozens of bullets sent people scurrying for cover.“This is a weekend when we should be out remembering, enjoying time with loved ones, and instead we’re here mourning,” Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said during a Monday press conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/miamiarea-shootings-mark-bloody-memorial-day-weekend-101622568299473.html

The BRICS is a bloc of major emerging economies comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.Wang said, “At this trying time, China stands in solidarity with India and all BRICS countries. As long as it is needed by India, I believe all BRICS partners including China will provide further support and assistance at any time. We are fully confident that India will certainly overcome the pandemic.”Monday’s meeting was chaired by India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar. The foreign ministers’ meeting was attended by Brazil’s Carlos Alberto Franco Franca, Russia’s Sergey Lavrov, and South Africa’s Grace Naledi Mandisa Pandor.The Chinese minister lauded India for conducting its role as the BRICS chair despite the raging pandemic.“Since the beginning of the year and despite the impact of the Covid-19, India as BRICS chair has worked vigorously focusing on the theme of BRICS@15: Intra BRICS Cooperation for Continuity, Consolidation and Consensus,” he said.“China commends India for its efforts and we are ready to work with BRICS countries to support India as the chair and ensure tangible outcomes in this year’s BRICS cooperation,” he added.Wang said the five-member bloc faces profound and complex ramifications of the pandemic.“This is a challenge to the BRICS countries, but opportunities could also emerge from a crisis. We believe that with all of us joining forces, BRICS will surely display its unique value and play a due role,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-and-brics-stand-with-india-in-its-fight-against-the-pandemic-chinese-fm-101622568719892.html
01-06-2021||World||‘Stop resisting’: Video shows Alabama police officers stomping, assaulting man at local store||The American police force is again at the centre of a controversy due to a Facebook video, in which some of its officers are seen kicking, punching and trying to overpower a man in a store in Alabama. The video, recorded on Monday, shows a police officer trying to overturn the man and handcuff him as he scremas for help. A few seconds later, another police officer is seen approaching the scene and kicking and stomping on the man’s leg while shouting “stop resisting” repeatedly.A few other officers joined the two officers and the man was eventually subdued, the 90-second video showed. It was broadcast as Facebook Live by Bruce Turner, who lives in Huntsville, Alabama, and has been viewed more than 13,000 times. The man who was lying on the floor of the store has been idenfied as 22-year-old Kemontae Kentarieus Hobbs by news agency AP and other local media outlets.“We are aware of the video and investigating at this time,” Captain Michael Johnson of the Huntsville Police Department said in reply to queries regarding the incident, local media company al.com reported on Monday.After the incident, Hobbs was booked into the Madison County Jail on charges of resisting arrest and obstructing government operations, AP reported earlier in the day. The report also said that he was released later on Monday afternoon (local time).Kimberlyn Heyes, mother of Hobbs, condemned the use of such force by the officers in the video. “It didn’t take all those officers when he was already down. How was he resisting when he was already on the ground and you are stomping on him like a dog? That’s not how you handle things,” AP quoted Heyes as saying.Meanwhile, a group named Huntsville Bail Fund also confirmed the release of Hobbs in a Facebook post, in which it had earlier sought donations to secure his release. “Kemontae Hobbs was brutalized by Huntsville Police last night. Police were called because Kemontae was panhandling outside a gas station, leading to the viral video of an officer attempting to break his leg. Kemontae has had several run-ins with the cops. They are aware that he has schizophrenia, and is sometimes known to wander when he isn't able to access treatment. After his arrest and brutalization, Huntsville Police called to tell his mother that they had her son, and knew he was mentally ill. They treated him like this anyway,” the group’s Facebook post said.The incident comes a month after William Darby, a 28-year-old officer of the Huntsville Police Department, was convicted of murder in a 2018 shooting incident, according to a report by the Washington Post. Darby was found guilty of shooting a man who had sought help from 911 for his suicidal thoughts and had a gun to his own head, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-resisting-video-shows-alabama-police-officers-stomping-assaulting-man-at-local-store-101622567986972.html

01-06-2021||World||Canada decides to mix and match different Covid vaccines for easier roll-out||Canadian health authorities have announced that Covid-19 vaccines will be mixed and matched in order to ensure a quicker roll-out of the national vaccination programme.The announcement from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) was based on an updated guidance from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), which recommended that a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, including the Covishield version manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, could be followed by a second dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine. It also recommended that the doses for the two mRNA vaccines can be switched if necessary.In a statement that accompanied an official release, NACI chair Caroline Quach-Thanh said, “We know that the question of which vaccine will be used for second doses, in particular for individuals who had received the AstraZeneca/Covishield vaccine as their first dose, has been a question for many people in these last few months.“NACI has seen additional data on the safety of using mixed Covid-19 vaccine schedules and NACI has also seen some data on the immune response following this mixed schedule. “Based on that evidence, but also on the risk of the rare but serious adverse event called VITT that is associated with the viral vector vaccines, we are recommending that someone who received a first dose of the AstraZeneca/Covishield vaccine may receive an mRNA vaccine for their second dose.”Quach-Thanh added, “The committee strongly recommends that if one mRNA vaccine was used for the first dose, the other mRNA vaccine can be used as the second dose if needed. Second doses are important for more robust and long-term protection. These NACI recommendations on mixed schedules will provide flexibility for provinces and territories in the move towards second doses.”Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, said, “This rapid response on the interchangeability of authorised Covid-19 vaccines will guide decision-making by provinces and territories as we continue to roll-out Canada’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign.” The NACI release stated that current evidence suggested that mixing the viral vector first dose with an mRNA second had a “good safety profile at shorter (four-week) and longer (8 to 12-week) intervals” and that there is “evidence that providing an mRNA vaccine after AstraZeneca vaccine will boost the immune response, which is what we expect from a second dose”.NACI’s earlier position had been that the second dose administered had to be from the same inoculation applied for the first. However, in light of emerging evidence of interchangeability, primarily from research in Spain and the UK, Canadian health authorities updated their stand on Tuesday.NACI underscored that this was not an unusual step, as it noted that was “not a new concept” and similar vaccines from different manufacturers have been used to complete a vaccine series for influenza, Hepatitis A and others.In fact, on Monday, the province of Manitoba had already announced that those who received the AstraZeneca vaccine as their first dose could get another for their second. Canada has so far given emergency authorisation to four vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Astra Zeneca/Covishield, and Johnson & Johnson, with the last one requiring a single dose.Among the issues that health authorities could resolve with the new recommendation is that of lack of availability of the AstraZeneca vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-decides-to-mix-and-match-different-covid-vaccines-for-easier-rollout-101622567039914.html

The company, the world's largest meatpacker, said it was working to resolve the incident, which has stopped livestock slaughter in JBS plants in several U.S. states."On Sunday, May 30, JBS USA determined that it was the target of an organised cybersecurity attack, affecting some of the servers supporting its North American and Australian IT systems," it said in a Monday statement.The company has not responded for additional request for comment on the nature of the attack or why meat production is being impacted. JBS controls about 20% of the slaughtering capacity for U.S. cattle and hogs, according to industry estimates.JBS reported the incident a few weeks after a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States, crippled fuel delivery for several days in the U.S. Southeast.The attack also comes at a time of rising meat prices as China increases imports, food costs rise and plants continue to face labor shortages that started during the Covid-19 pandemic.The cyberattack could push U.S. beef prices even higher by tightening supplies, said Brad Lyle, chief financial officer for consultancy Partners for Production Agriculture.The average unit price for U.S. fresh beef in April rose by 5% from March and was up about 10% from a year earlier, according to NielsenIQ data. Pork and chicken prices are each up about 5.4% from last year.U.S. inventories of frozen beef at the end of April were 5% lower than a year earlier, while frozen pork supplies were down 26%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Also Read | World's largest beef and pork supplier JBS hit by cyberattackAny impact on consumers would depend on how long production is impacted, said Matthew Wiegand, a risk management consultant and commodity broker at FuturesOne in Nebraska."If it lingers for multiple days, you see some food service shortages," Wiegand said. "The good thing is that this happened after Memorial Day. You are on the downhill side of summer demand and summer bookings."Two kill and fabrication shifts had been canceled at JBS's beef plant in Greeley, Colorado, due to the cyber attack, representatives of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 7 said in an e-mail. JBS Beef in Cactus, Texas, also said on Facebook it would not run on Tuesday -- updating an early post that had said the plant would run as normal.The United States Cattlemen's Association, an industry group, said on Twitter that it had reports of JBS redirecting livestock haulers who arrived at plants and were to unload animals for slaughter.Last year, cattle and hogs backed up on U.S. farms and some animals were euthanized when meat plants shut due to COVID-19 outbreaks among workers.JBS Canada said in a Facebook post that shifts had been canceled at its plant in Brooks, Alberta, on Monday and one shift so far had been canceled on Tuesday.JBS, which has its North American operations headquartered in Greeley, did not respond to additional questions about the cyberattack. A representative in Sao Paulo said the company's Brazilian operations were not impacted.A JBS beef plant in Grand Island, Nebraska, said only workers in maintenance and shipping were scheduled to work on Tuesday due to the cyberattack."We continue to work through the situation and will keep you informed regarding production on Wednesday," the Facebook post from Grand Island, Nebraska, said.The JBS cyberattack spurred a new round of support for improved cyber security.Congressman Rick Crawford, an Arkansas Republican, called for a bipartisan effort to secure food and cyber security."Cyber security is synonymous with national security, and so is food security," he wrote on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/large-north-american-meat-plants-stop-slaughter-after-jbs-cyberattack-101622566088630.html

01-06-2021||World||China’s Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine gets WHO’s emergency-use approval||The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that it has approved a Covid-19 vaccine made by China’s Sinovac Biotech for emergency use, making it the second Chinese-produced shot to get the UN health agency’s endorsement.The WHO’s approval gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities the assurance that it meets international standards for safety, efficacy and manufacturing, a statement from the WHO said.It is the second Chinese vaccine to be approved by the WHO after it gave the green light to Sinopharm’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, approving the vaccine to be rolled out globally, in early May.The WHO’s emergency-use listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for the global Covax vaccine supply and international procurement. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer Covid-19 vaccines. “On the basis of available evidence, the WHO recommends the vaccine for use in adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of two to four weeks,” the WHO statement said.Vaccine efficacy results showed that the jab prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of those vaccinated and prevented severe Covid-19 and hospitalisation in 100% of the studied population.Few older adults, over 60 years of age, were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age-group. The WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because data collected during subsequent use in multiple countries and supportive immunogenicity information suggests that the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons.“The decision further demonstrated that China not only has the willingness and the means to help in the global anti-pandemic fight, but the capability to do so,” Feng Duojia, president of the China Vaccine Industry Association, told Global Times on Tuesday.The EUL procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies. The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency, while adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy and quality.Over 661.4 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines had been administered across China as of Monday, the national health commission said Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-gets-who-s-emergency-use-approval-101622565719631.html
01-06-2021||World||UK reports zero daily Covid deaths for the first time since July||Britain on Tuesday reported zero daily deaths from Covid-19 for the first time since July 30 last year despite a recent rise in cases linked to the Delta variant.According to the latest government figures, 127,782 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test since the start of the pandemic -- the worst death toll in any European country.The UK has had 4.49 million cases in total.Tuesday's zero daily deaths came after the government reported just one Covid death across the UK on Monday, a public holiday.Official death figures are typically lower at weekends and holidays because of a lag in reporting.The milestone comes after Britain moved forward with plans in recent months to unlock its economy.The government imposed a tough lockdown in January during a second wave of cases and deaths that followed the emergence of a more transmissible variant.The UK was one of the first nations in the world to begin a mass innoculation campaign.Since the rollout in December, it has administered two doses of vaccine to more than 25 million people -- almost half the adult population.Experts have warned, however, that Britain could face a third wave of cases driven by the Delta variant of concern first identified in India.On Tuesday, Britain recorded over 3,000 coronavirus cases for the seventh straight day, putting in doubt plans by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government to completely lift restrictions on June 21."We will continue to assess and monitor the data daily," a UK government spokesman said, adding that the roadmap for removing Covid measures was "based on data, not dates".Last week, Johnson said there was nothing in current data that suggested England's roadmap would have to be delayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-reports-zero-daily-covid-deaths-for-the-first-time-since-july-101622565056310.html

Donald Trump, his Republican predecessor, did not officially recognize Pride Month during his four years in office."For all of our progress, there are many States in which LGBTQ+ individuals still lack protections for fundamental rights and dignity in hospitals, schools, public accommodations, and other spaces," Biden said."We will not rest until full equality for LGBTQ+ Americans is finally achieved and codified into law."Biden cited what he called a tragic spike in violence against transgender people, especially transgender women of color and LGBTQ youth who face bullying and harassment in academic settings and run the risk of self-harm and death by suicide.Biden recognized the service of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the first openly LGBTQ person to serve in the Cabinet, and Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine, the first openly transgender person confirmed by the Senate.Activists describe the Biden administration as the most pro-LGBTQ in U.S. history.On his first day in office, Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to protect LGBTQ people under all federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex. Biden also reversed a ban on transgender people openly enlisting and serving in the military.The Biden White House also reversed an order issued by Trump's then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on flying the Pride flag and some U.S. embassies, including in India and Australia, are highlighting their support for LGBTQ people.In Florida on Tuesday, Governor Ron DeSantis, who is closely aligned with Trump, signed into law banning transgender women and girls from participating in school sports, part of a campaign in statehouses nationwide this year that equal rights activists assail as discriminatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-says-14-of-his-1-500-agency-appointees-identify-as-lgbtq-101622563982238.html
01-06-2021||World||When Fauci likened Trump supporters to 'crazy people in this world'. Here's what happened||Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci’s friction with the previous administration under President Donald Trump is no secret. While Fauci, in the early days of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, pushed for masking and warned against the sudden reopening of businesses, Trump showed reluctance in wearing a face mask and termed protesters demanding to end stay-at-home orders as “great people.”At one point, Fauci, who was on the White House coronavirus task force, even acknowledged that he was no longer in frequent contact with Trump after their contradictory stance on easing of restrictions. The latest trove of emails, obtained by The Washington Post as part of a Freedom of Information Act request, shed more light on Fauci’s response to thousands of requests and queries between March and April 2020.Even as Trump frequently attacked China for not containing coronavirus after detecting it first in Wuhan, Fauci and top Chinese health official, George Gao, sought to maintain ties with each other. In one of the emails, published by the Post, Gao gave clarification to Fauci after Science magazine quoted the Chinese scientist saying that the US and other Western nations were making a “big mistake” by encouraging people to mask up.“I saw the Science interview, how could I say such a word ‘big mistake’ about others? That was journalist’s wording. Hope you understand,” Gao, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), wrote to Fauci, according to the Post.“I understand completely. No problem. We will get through this together,” Fauci replied.Also Read: Anthony Fauci reveals ‘disturbing’ incidents under Trump administrationIn an interview with the New York Times, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases talked about the death threats he had started receiving in mid-March last year. Fauci revealed that one day he received a letter in the mail with a powdered substance in it and he accidentally got it all over his face, calling the incident “very, very disturbing”. After he faced threats from Trump supporters, Gao emailed him again, according to the report.“I saw some news (hope it is fake) that [you] are being attacked by some people. Hope you are well under such a irrational situation,” Gao, a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, wrote on April 8, reported the Washington Post.“Thank you for your kind note,” Fauci replied, as per the published correspondence. “All is well despite some crazy people in this world.”The security detail for the infectious disease expert was expanded to full time after the threats from the “crazy people”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-fauci-likened-trump-supporters-to-some-crazy-people-in-this-world-101622562606448.html
01-06-2021||World||Emerging countries press for Covid-19 vaccine supply in poor nations||Five of the world's biggest emerging economies Tuesday called for the development and delivery of Covid-19 vaccines to be sped up, reiterating that measures such as waiving intellectual property rights over jabs could help poorer nations battle the pandemic.The joint statement by the so-called "BRICS" group -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- followed an online summit chaired by India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.The foreign ministers said "extensive immunisation" would help bring the pandemic to an end, highlighting the "urgency for expeditious development and deployment of Covid-19 vaccines, especially in developing countries".They also expressed support for the global campaign led by South Africa and India at the World Trade Organization to temporarily waive IP rights for Covid-19 vaccines.Sharing vaccine doses, technology transfers, developing local production and supply chains as well as price transparency would also boost the fight against the infectious disease, the statement added.South Africa's Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor earlier Tuesday reiterated Pretoria's position that "none of us are safe until all of us are safe".Securing a waiver agreement "will allow use of intellectual property, the sharing of technologies and technology transfer," Pandor told the BRICS meeting, enabling "the production of vaccine therapeutics and wider distribution".Supporters of the move argue it will spur production of low-cost generic vaccines, helping poor countries that are struggling to immunise their people.The US under President Joe Biden has thrown its weight behind the bid alongside China, but other pharmaceutical heavyweights including the EU, Britain and Japan are reluctant.Opponents argue waiving patents will damage intellectual property rights and erode the profit incentive, ultimately affecting pharmaceutical research and development.Pharmaceutical companies also point out that manufacturing a vaccine requires know-how and technical resources which cannot be acquired at the flip of a switch.Pandor, speaking by video link from Pretoria, said "millions of people in wealthier nations have been vaccinated, while billions of people in poorer countries still wait and are still vulnerable to infection, disease and death".Just two percent of global vaccines have been administered in sub-Saharan Africa, according to WHO figures -- a situation that Pandor described as a "global gap of vaccine access".Sixty-three countries have backed the Indian-South African proposal, but unanimity among all 164 WTO member states is needed for agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emerging-countries-press-for-covid-19-vaccine-supply-in-poor-nations-101622563164380.html

I was particularly inspired to hear how you have helped children with special needs enjoy the activity you enjoy and excel at," Johnson said in a personal letter to Sharma.The schoolboy's free online classes were already proving a success before the start of the coronavirus pandemic but expanded even further in recent months.His virtual sessions were seen as even more vital as he is passionate about promoting both the mental and physical health benefits of practising Yoga."I am honoured and humbled by this recognition. There have been unprecedented mental health issues amongst children due to the pandemic. I feel it is a recognition for Yoga as a discipline, which helps in balancing mental and physical health,” said Sharma.“This award has motivated me to continue my endeavour to spread the message of Yoga all over the world. I do hope that Yoga and meditation will be included in the national school curriculum in the future," he said.Ishwar Sharma is the 1,646th person to receive the UK Prime Minister’s daily Points of Light award, which was first launched in April 2014 to recognise outstanding individuals making a difference where they live.Each day, an inspiring person is selected to receive the award to celebrate their remarkable achievements, including hundreds of volunteers who have been recognised for how they have served their communities through the pandemic.The UK Prime Minister makes daily announcements of the winners to celebrate, encourage and promote volunteering and the value that it brings to the country.The public are encouraged to write to 10 Downing Street with their suggestions for deserving candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/11yearold-indian-origin-yoga-prodigy-wins-uk-pm-award-101622561522249.html
01-06-2021||World||Tulsa race massacre: Why 'Black Wall Street' prospered||In a century-old family story about a teenage aunt who liked to drive her luxury car down the trolley tracks of Tulsa, Kristi Williams still savors a tiny, lingering taste of how different life could have been for all Black Americans after slavery.On Monday, Tulsans commemorated the 100th anniversary of a two-day assault by armed white men on Tulsa's prosperous Black community of Greenwood, known around the country as Black Wall Street, calling attention to an era of deadly mob assaults on Black communities that official history long suppressed.But Williams, and other descendants of the freed Black people enslaved by Native American nations who once owned much of the land under Tulsa, say there's another part of Black Wall Street's history that more Americans need to know about.It's one that has important lessons for contemporary racial issues in the United States, including the long debated matter of reparations, descendants and historians say.That bit of the story: where much of the seed money that made Black Wall Street boom came from.Unlike Black Americans across the country after slavery, Williams' ancestors and thousands of other Black members of slave-owning Native American nations freed after the war “had land,” says Williams, a Tulsa community activist. “They had opportunity to build a house on that land, farm that land, and they were wealthy with their crops.""And that was huge — a great opportunity and you’re thinking this is going to last for generations to come. I can leave my children this land, and they can leave their children this land,” recounts Williams, whose ancestor went from enslaved laborer to judge of the Muscogee Creek tribal Supreme Court after slavery.In fact, Alaina E. Roberts, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, writes in her book "I’ve Been Here All the While: Black Freedom on Native Land,” the freed slaves of five Native American nations “became the only people of African descent in the world to receive what might be viewed as reparations for their enslavement on a large scale.”Why that happened in the territory that became Oklahoma, and not the rest of the slaveholding South: The US government enforced stricter terms for reconstruction on the slave-owning American Indian nations that had fully or partially allied with the Confederacy than it had on Southern states.While US officials quickly broke Gen. William T. Sherman's famous Special Field Order No. 15 providing 40 acres for each formerly enslaved family after the Civil War, US treaties compelled five slave-owning tribes — the Choctaws, Chickasaws, Cherokees, Muscogee Creek and Seminoles — to share tribal land and other resources and rights with freed Black people who had been enslaved.By 1860, about 14% of the total population of that tribal territory of the future state of Oklahoma were Black people enslaved by tribal members. After the Civil War, the Black tribal Freedmen held millions of acres in common with other tribal members and later in large individual allotments.The difference that made is “incalculable,” Roberts said in an interview. “Allotments really gave them an upward mobility that other Black people did not have in most of the United States.”The financial stability allowed Black Native American Freedmen to start businesses, farms and ranches, and helped give rise to Black Wall Street and thriving Black communities in the future state of Oklahoma. The prosperity of those communities — many long since vanished —“attracted Black African Americans from the South, built them up as a Black mecca,” Roberts says. Black Wall Street alone had roughly 200 businesses.Meeting the Black tribal Freedmen in the thriving Black city of Boley in 1905, Booker T. Washington wrote admiringly of a community “which shall demonstrate the right of the negro, not merely as an individual, but as a race, to have a worthy and permanent place in the civilization that the American people are creating.”And while some tribes reputedly gave their Black members some of the worst, rockiest, unfarmable land, that was often just where drillers struck oil starting in the first years of the 20th century, before statehood changed Indian Territory to Oklahoma in 1907. For a time it made the area around Tulsa the world's biggest oil producer.For Eli Grayson, another descendant of Muscogee Creek Black Freedmen, any history that tries to tell the story of Black Wall Street without telling the story of the Black Indian Freedmen and their land is a flop.“They're missing the point of what caused the wealth, the foundation of the wealth,” Grayson says.The oil wealth, besides helping put the bustle and boom in Tulsa's Black-owned Greenwood business district, gave rise to fortunes for a few Freedpeople that made headlines around the United States. That included 11-year-old Sarah Rector, a Muscogee Creek girl hailed as “the richest colored girl in the world” by newspapers of the time. Her oil fortune drew attention from Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Dubois, who intervened to check that Rector's white guardian wasn't pillaging her money.The wealth from the tribal allotment also gave rise to Williams' family story of great-aunt Janie, “who learned to drive by going behind the trolley lines” in Tulsa, with her parents in the car, Williams' uncle, 67-year-old Samuel Morgan, recounted, laughing."It was real fashionable, because it was one of the cars that had four windows that rolled all the way up,” Morgan said.Little of that Black wealth remains today.In May 1921, 100 years ago this month, Aunt Janie, then a teenager, had to flee Greenwood's Dreamland movie theater as the white mob burned Black Wall Street to the ground, killing scores or hundreds — no one knows — and leaving Greenwood an empty ruin populated by charred corpses.Black Freedmen and many other American Indian citizens rapidly lost land and money to unscrupulous or careless white guardians that were imposed upon them, to property taxes, white scams, accidents, racist policies and laws, business mistakes or bad luck. For Aunt Janie, all the family knows today is a vague tale of the oil wells on her land catching fire.Williams, Grayson and other Black Indian Freedmen descendants today drive past the spots in Tulsa that family history says used to belong to them: 51st Street. The grounds of Oral Roberts University. Mingo Park.That's yet another lesson Tulsa's Greenwood has for the rest of the United States, says William A. Darity Jr., a leading scholar and writer on reparations at Duke University.If freed Black people had gotten reparations after the Civil War, Darity said, assaults like the Tulsa Race Massacre show they would have needed years of U.S. troop deployments to protect them — given the angry resentment of white people at seeing money in Black hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tulsa-race-massacre-why-black-wall-street-prospered-101622560414150.html

They will be additional inoculation options for Covax, a program backed by WHO and other global health groups dedicated to ensuring every country has access to vaccines -- notably poorer nations that have been shut out as wealthier ones snap up most of the world’s existing supply.Already cleared for emergency use by the WHO are vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, AstraZeneca Plc, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna Inc.Key SupportThe WHO’s green light bestows global legitimacy on a Chinese shot that has battled concerns about its efficacy after divergent data was reported from trial sites. It could provide assurance for developing countries that lack their own regulatory bodies and rely on the organization’s advice on which shots are safe to use. Sinovac has shipped 380 million doses to countries and region ranging from Hong Kong to Zimbabwe since late last year.China Sinovac Shot Seen Highly Effective in Real World Study The shot, dubbed CoronaVac, has the lowest efficacy rate reported from clinical trials among the frontrunner wave of vaccines: it was found to be just 50.7% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid in a trial in Brazil, barely crossing the minimum threshold required by drug regulators around the world. But real world evidence is emerging that it’s far more effective on the ground: In a recent study of around 130,000 Indonesia health workers, it protected 94% against symptomatic infection, 96% against hospitalization, and 98% against death.Infections are also on the rebound in some countries that have rolled out Sinovac locally like Chile, fueling doubt on its effectiveness, though hasty reopenings and the spread of virus variants also play a part in the renewed outbreaks.The World Finally Accepts a Much-Maligned Covid ShotThe WHO nod also paves the way for countries to allow travelers who have received Sinovac shots, even if the vaccine isn’t approved for use locally. Ahead of a planned reopening to vaccinated tourists this summer, the European Union said that member countries can consider opening up to people who have shots approved by the WHO. The company has also started submitting data on a rolling basis to drug regulator the European Medicines Agency.The Sinovac vaccine contains the inactive forms of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which are injected to stimulate an immune response against the pathogen. Two other similar shots have been developed by China’s Sinopharm, including the one already cleared by WHO. They have all been widely used in the mainland since mid-2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-approves-china-s-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-for-global-use-101622560684737.html

Only the girl was wearing a life jacket.“I felt really scared,” Chase told the station.Their father jumped in the water to grab her. Chase then began swimming toward shore.“I told them I loved him because I wasn’t sure what’s going to happen,” their father told the station. “I tried to stick with both of them. I wore myself out. She drifted away from me.”Chase kept swimming, doggie paddling and floating on his back to keep from tiring out. “The current was going the opposite way of going to the boat and the shore so it was very hard to swim that way,” Chase said. It took him about an hour to reach land. He ran to the nearest house for help.Crews from the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission found the father and daughter about a mile from their boat.“I screamed for help at the top of my lungs and waved my arms and sure enough someone heard us,” Poust said. “Little man also made it to shore and got help and that’s what saved our lives.”According to Eric Prosswimmer of the fire department, neither the 7-year-old nor the father were required to wear a life vest. The law applies to children age 6 and under for a vessel under 26 feet (8 meters) long.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7yearold-boy-swims-an-hour-to-rescue-his-dad-and-little-sister-101622557311891.html

We accepted," Giovanni Apolone, scientific director of one of the lead institutions, the Milan Cancer Institute (INT), said.The WHO's request has not previously been reported."WHO is in contact with the researchers that had published the original paper. A collaboration with partner laboratories has been set up for further testing," a WHO spokesman said.The spokesman said the WHO was aware that the researchers are planning to publish a follow-up report "in the near future".He said the UN agency has contacted all researchers who have published or provided information on samples collected in 2019 that were reported to have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but does not yet have the final interpretation of the results.The Italian researchers' findings, published by the INT's scientific magazine Tumori Journal, showed neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in blood taken from healthy volunteers in Italy in October 2019 during a lung cancer screening trial.Most of the volunteers were from Lombardy, the northern region around Milan, which was the first and hardest hit by the virus in Italy."None of the studies published so far have ever questioned the geographical origin," Apolone told Reuters."The growing doubt is that the virus, probably less powerful compared to later months, was circulating in China long before the reported cases," Apolone added.Also Read | Covid-19 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’, created in Wuhan lab, new study claimsDUTCH TESTThe WHO chose the laboratory of the Erasmus University in Rotterdam for the re-test, Emanuele Montomoli, co-author of the original study and professor of Public Health at the Molecular Medicine Department in the University of Siena, said.The Erasmus University did not reply to requests for comment.Italian researchers sent the team in Rotterdam 30 biological samples from October-December 2019 that they had found positive, 30 samples from the same period they had tested negative and 30 samples from as far back as 2018, negative."We sent them blind, that means our colleagues did not know which samples were positive and which negative," Apolone said."They rechecked our samples with commercial tests, which are much less sensitive than the ones we devised and validated," Montomoli said.Despite the differences in the two detection methods, both Italian scientists said they were satisfied with the results, delivered to them in late February, adding that they could not comment further until the team of Italian and Dutch scientists have published their findings."We did not say in our study that we could establish without a doubt that the coronavirus, later sequenced in Wuhan, was already circulating in Italy in October," Montomoli said."We only found the response to the virus, namely the antibodies. So we can say that this coronavirus or a very similar one, perhaps a less transmissible variant, was circulating here in October," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-re-checks-research-on-when-coronavirus-first-surfaced-in-italy-101622555871452.html

I think that people are not saying we should abandon the June 21 date altogether, but just to delay it by a few weeks while we gather more intelligence and we can look at the trajectory in a clearer way,” he said.Prof. Gupta warned that the country may be in the early stages of the third wave."Of course the numbers of cases are relatively low at the moment; all waves start with low numbers of cases that grumble in the background and then become explosive, so the key here is that what we are seeing here is the signs of an early wave," he added.On Monday, 3,383 new COVID-19 cases were reported in the UK, making a total of 23,418 over the past week – an increase of 28.8 per cent over the previous week. There was one new death from the deadly virus, with the weekly tally of 58 up 45 per cent on the previous week.Professor Adam Finn, the expert scientist on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) which determines the vaccination rollout cohorts in the country, warned the UK remained vulnerable as there were still large numbers of unvaccinated people."The idea that somehow the job is done is wrong – we've still got a lot of people out there who have neither had this virus infection nor yet been immunised and that's why we're in a vulnerable position right now," he said.Prof. Finn also echoed other scientists in the view that it was "so much better to delay slightly than to go around with another cycle" of lockdown restrictions."It's a different virus, it could be a real problem and it's only by taking it seriously now that we can get where we want to be as soon as possible," he said.The UK government's Former Chief Scientific Adviser and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), Professor Sir Mark Walport, noted that it was “not impossible” that Britain was at the tip of a third wave of the pandemic due to the Delta variant.“It is a quite perilous moment, but we’ve just got to keep our fingers crossed that the measures work,” he said.“It’s clear that the B.1.617.2 variant is taking over – it accounts for about 75 per cent of those cases which have been typed – the numbers of infections are getting up, but we would expect that. On the much better news side is the fact that hospital admissions are not surging. If anything, overall they’re coming down, though in some parts of the country where the B.1.617 is at its worst they are increasing slightly, so it is genuinely very, very finely balanced,” he said.According to official data, the B.1.617.2 variant renamed as Delta by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is thought to account for up to three quarters of new cases in the UK and is linked to the current surge in different parts of the country.A final decision on whether and to what degree restrictions will be lifted on June 21 will be reached on June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-in-uk-urge-caution-over-lockdown-end-amid-covid-19-3rd-wave-fears-101622553590413.html

A government minister said it might be days before production resumes.JBS is also Australia's largest meat and food processing company, with 47 facilities across the country including abattoirs, feedlots and meat processing sites. JBS employs around 11,000 people.JBS USA said in a statement from Greeley, Colorado, on Monday that it was the target on Sunday of an “organized cybersecurity attack” affecting some of its servers supporting its North American and Australian IT systems.“The company's backup servers were not affected and it is actively working with an Incident Response firm to restore its systems as soon as possible,” the statement said.Australian Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said the government and Australian Federal Police were working with JBS to resolve the problems and to pursue those responsible.“Despite the fact that JBS accounts for around 20% of our processing production here in Australia, we're not expecting there to be significant impacts on exports so long as this isn't a protracted shutdown,” Littleproud said on Tuesday.“We're also working with JBS right here in Australia to make sure that we can get some limited capacity up and going in the next couple of days. JBS have been very proactive in that,” he said.Littleproud said it was too early to say whether it was a ransomware attack or who might be responsible.Australian staff learned of the attack when they were turned away from their workplaces on Monday.JBS exports about 70% of what it produces in Australia. But Australia and New Zealand account for only 4% of the company's global revenue.Several consignments of cattle in Queensland state were cancelled at short notice and cattle trucks were turned around, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.“We had to send them up on Sunday afternoon and then we got the message in the morning that they'd have to cancel the train because the meat works was going to be shutting for an indefinite amount of time,” Queensland cattle rancher Colin Baker told ABC.“We had a wasted day . . . because mustering the cattle, sorting them out and then trucking them up there and then we had to bring them home today and let them all go again,” Baker added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-largest-beef-and-pork-supplier-jbs-hit-by-cyberattack-101622552546470.html

There have been no significant numbers of human infections with bird flu since the H7N9 strain killed around 300 people during 2016-2017.The NHC further said that no other cases of human infection with H10N3 have previously been reported globally.(With inputs from previous HT stories and Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/avian-influenza-all-you-need-to-know-about-first-human-case-of-h10n3-bird-flu-in-china-101622550226266.html

It began commercial launches in 2018.Rocket Lab founder Peter Beck, a New Zealander, said signing the accords was testament to the country’s growing role in the space industry and opened the door for collaboration and mission opportunities with NASA.There could also soon be a second New Zealand launch site. The government announced Tuesday it was partnering with Indigenous Maori to buy land in the Canterbury region to develop a space launch site.Estimates indicate the New Zealand space industry is worth 1.7 billion New Zealand dollars ($1.2 billion) and that space manufacturing generates about NZ$250 million a year.NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement that New Zealand was one of seven nations that helped craft the principles in the accords and he was delighted they had signed up.“Outer space is getting crowded," said Kevin Covert, the acting U.S. ambassador to New Zealand. “As more countries establish a presence in outer space, via research stations, satellites, or even rocket launches, these accords provide a set of principles to create a safe and transparent environment that inspires exploration, science, and commercial activities.”The other signatories to the accords are the U.S., Australia, Britain, Canada, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, and Ukraine. Brazil also said it plans to sign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-latest-nation-to-sign-space-agreement-with-nasa-101622545491373.html

With the revised Covid-19 death toll, Peru has reached the sombre milestone of having the highest death rate per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University data.Peru’s official death toll is now 180,764, up from 69,342, in a country of about 33 million people. The revised data makes more than 500 Covid deaths per 100,000 people.While Peru has been one of the hardest-hit Latin American countries, its official death toll was continuously under scanner because the scenes of cemeteries and unprecedented use of refrigerators as makeshift morgues contradicted the government data.Announcing the revised coronavirus-related death toll, Peruvian Prime Minister Violeta Bermúdez told a news conference on Monday that they “think it is [their] duty to make public this updated information.” He said that the Covid death toll was revised on the advice of Peruvian and international experts.“What is being said is that a significant number of deaths were not classified as caused by Covid-19,” Peru health minister Óscar Ugarte said, adding that the criteria for assigning Covid as a cause of death have been changed.Also Read | Peru: Artist portrays pain and suffering from Covid-19 pandemic in 100 drawingsPreviously, Hungary, with around 300 Covid deaths per 100,000 people, had the highest per capita death toll, followed by the Czech Republic and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Human rights bodies and media organisations have rejected the Pakistan Media Development Authority (PMDA) ordinance 2021, which proposes to repeal all media-related and merge them, and establishment of tribunals.The ordinance also proposes to nominate a bureaucrat to head the PMDA - a provision which is being widely being criticised as coercive censorship.The opposition parties as well as media organisations have called the ordinance "martial law". Those against the proposed law have vowed to resist such draconian steps by the government by taking trade unions, academia, political parties and citizens' organisations on board.Strong objections"Plans to centralise media oversight under one draconian authority, annual NOCs to remain operational, suspension/ penalties on way," said Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Sherry Rehman. After the new ordinance, media outlets will "either become state mouthpieces or go under", she added.Pakistan Muslim League (N) spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb on Twitter called the ordinance a "draconian, authoritarian, repressive and punitive" instrument to "suppress constitutional freedom of expression of print media, electronic media and online citizen journalism.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), an umbrella organisation of all journalist unions in the country, condemn the proposed law in a statement.The civil and rights bodies have raised serious objections to the draft of the ordinance, stating that the proposed law reflects a "mindset hostile to the concept of people's freedom of expression and right to information".What are the provisions?The ordinance proposes to repeal all current media-related laws in the country and wants them to be merged under the PMDA. Pakistan has several media-related laws like the Newspaper Employees, (Conditions of Service Act), 1973; the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority Ordinance, 2002 (amended in 2007); and the Motion Pictures Ordinance, 1979.These laws govern different mediums and the way content is present there. But the Imran Khan government now wants a single authority for the entire media sector - a move which is being vehemently opposed by various bodies.The ordinance also proposes to establish media tribunals to hand down punishments of up to three years in jail and PKR 25 million in fines to content producers for violating the repressive new provisions.Local reports said that the government has also proposed that the proposed authority will be headed by a bureaucrat of level Grade-22 - the highest rank for a civil servant in the country.Past instancesPakistan's senior media editors raised alarm in April over a new directive by Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) that advised satellite television channels not to report on government meetings under progress.The editors said that Pemra was turning into a 'censorship tool' instead of acting as a regulator.The EU Chronicle had reported in October 2020 that Journalists and the media are a priority target of Pakistan's military and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), adding that such actions of intolerance towards independent journalism have increased dramatically since July 2018 when Imran Khan became prime minister.A large number of journalists and social media activists became targets of the draconian Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016, accordign to Annual Pakistan media legal review 2020 report, launched by the Institute for Research, Advocacy and Development (IRADA) in April.Several journalists and rights activists faced inquiries, abductions, investigations and arrests related to their online/social media activities and posts, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/martial-law-pakistan-opposition-rights-bodies-condemn-new-media-ordinance-101622542267106.html
01-06-2021||World||US President Joe Biden to honour the forgotten victims of Tulsa race massacre||US president Joe Biden will take part in a remembrance of one of the nation’s darkest — and largely forgotten — moments of racial violence when he helps commemorate the 100th anniversary of the destruction of a thriving Black community in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Biden’s visit Tuesday, in which he will grieve for the hundreds of Black people killed by a white mob a century ago, comes amid a national reckoning on racial justice. And it will stand in stark contrast to the most recent visit to Tulsa by a president, which took place last year.Biden will be the first president to participate in remembrances of the destruction of what was known as “Black Wall Street.” In 1921 — on May 31 and June 1 — Tulsa's white residents and civil society leaders looted and burned to the ground the Greenwood district and used planes to drop projectiles on it.Up to 300 Black Tulsans were killed, and thousands of survivors were forced for a time into internment camps overseen by the National Guard. Burned bricks and a fragment of a church basement are about all that survives today of the more than 30-block historically Black district.America's continuing struggle over racial justice will continue to test Biden, whose presidency would have been impossible without overwhelming support from Black voters, both in the Democratic primaries and the general election.Biden has pledged to help combat racism in policing and other areas of life following nationwide protests after George Floyd’s death a year ago that reignited a national conversation about race. Floyd, a Black man, was killed by white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes.After Chauvin was convicted in April, Biden said the country’s work was far from finished with the verdict, declaring, “We can’t stop here.”He called on Congress to act swiftly to address policing reform. But he has also long projected himself as an ally of police, who are struggling with criticism about long-used tactics and training methods and difficulties in recruitment.Despite its horror, the Tulsa massacre has only recently entered the national discourse — and the presidential visit will put an even brighter spotlight on the event.“This is so important because we have to recognize what we have done if we are going to be otherwise,” said Eddie Glaude, chair of the Center for African American Studies at Princeton University. Biden's visit, Glaude said, "has to be more than symbolic. To tell the truth, is the precondition for reconciliation, and reconciliation is the basis for repair.”Biden, while visiting the Greenwood Cultural Center, is set to announce new measures to help narrow the wealth gap between Blacks and whites and reinvest in underserved communities by expanding access to homeownership and small-business ownership.The White House said the administration will take steps to address disparities that result in Black-owned homes being appraised at tens of thousands of dollars less than comparable homes owned by whites as well as issue new federal rules to fight housing discrimination.The administration is also setting a goal of increasing the share of federal contracts awarded to small disadvantaged businesses by 50% by 2026, funneling an estimated additional $100 billion to such businesses over the five-year period, according to the White House.Biden will also discuss ways his jobs plan — still a subject of negotiation with Congress — can help create jobs and build wealth in communities of color.Historians say the massacre in Tulsa began after a local newspaper drummed up a furor over a Black man accused of stepping on a white girl’s foot. When Black Tulsans showed up with guns to prevent the man’s lynching, white residents responded with overwhelming force.A grand jury investigation at the time concluded, without evidence, that unidentified agitators had given Tulsa’s African Americans both their firearms and what was described as their mistaken belief “in equal rights, social equality, and their ability to demand the same.”Tensions persist 100 years laterOrganizers called off a headline commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre, saying no agreement could be reached over monetary payments to three survivors of the deadly attack. It highlights broader debates over reparations for racial injustice.Reparations for Black Americans whose ancestors were enslaved and for other racial discrimination have been debated in the U.S. since slavery ended in 1865. Now they are being discussed by colleges and universities with ties to slavery and by local governments looking to make cash payments to Black residents.But some of Tulsa’s Black residents question whether the $20 million spent to build the Greenwood Rising museum in an increasingly gentrified part of the city could have been better spent helping Black descendants of the massacre of residents of the city’s predominantly Black north side several miles away from Greenwood.Disagreements among Black leaders in Tulsa over the handling of commemorative events and millions of dollars in donations have led to two disparate groups planning separate slates of anniversary events.Biden, who was vice president to the nation’s first Black president and who chose a Black woman as his own vice president, backs a study of reparations, both in Tulsa and more broadly, but has not committed to support payments. He recently declared the need for America to confront its ugly past, saying, “We must acknowledge that there can be no realization of the American dream without grappling with the original sin of slavery and the centuries-long campaign of violence, fear and trauma wrought upon African American people in this country.”He issued a proclamation designating Monday as a “day of remembrance” for the massacre.Biden's predecessor Donald Trump visited Tulsa last year under vastly different circumstances.After suspending his campaign rallies because of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump chose Tulsa as the place to mark his return. But his decision to schedule the rally on June 19, the holiday is known as Juneteenth that commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, was met with such fierce criticism that Trump postponed the event by a day. The rally was still marked by protests outside and empty seats inside an arena downtown.Trump arrived in Tulsa during a highly charged moment, days after he had ordered the forcible clearing of Lafayette Square across from the White House, with federal officers pushing out those peacefully protesting Floyd’s death. Trump reflexively embraced law enforcement throughout his presidency and was frequently accused of using racist rhetoric when painting apocalyptic — and inaccurate — scenes of American cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-to-honour-the-forgotten-victims-of-tulsa-race-massacre-101622540461417.html
01-06-2021||World||China's new three-child policy draws scepticism, cost questions||China's decision to allow families to have up to three children was met with scepticism on Tuesday, with doubts expressed on social media whether it would make much difference, and calls for details on what promised "supportive measures" will include.On Monday, Beijing announced that it was lifting the two-child limit in an effort to encourage more child-bearing, weeks after census data confirmed rapid aging and a decline in fertility that puts China on track to see its population, the world's largest, begin shrinking.The major policy shift will include supportive measures "conducive to improving our country's population structure," the official Xinhua news agency said."I don't quite understand. What's the meaning of supportive measures?", asked one Weibo user in a post that received more than 128,000 thumbs-up, the most popular comment on Xinhua's post on the three-child policy.Social media participants cited the high cost of raising children in urban China, where housing can be expensive and children undergo private tuition in addition to public schools amid a fiercely competitive education system, as deterrents to having kids.Also Read | China’s three-child policy is an admission of failureWomen in China already face a widening gender gap in terms of workforce participation and earnings, and have borne a growing share of childcare duties as state-supported childcare has declined, according to a report last year by the Peterson Institute for International Economics."Working women in the big cities will be further discriminated against, and it would be harder for women over 30s to find jobs," said another Weibo user.The Xinhua readout from Monday's Politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping said that in conjunction with the new policy China would lower educational costs, step up tax and housing support and guarantee the legal interests of working women, but did not give specifics.James Liang, a professor at Peking University's School of Economics and founder of online travel giant Trip.com Group, last month urged China to give parents of each newborn 1 million yuan to lift a fertility rate of just 1.3 children per woman in 2020. That rate is in line with countries such as Japan and Italy and far short of the 2.1 replacement rate.He said this week that China would need to spend about 5% of GDP, compared with "practically 0% now", in cash, tax breaks, housing subsidies, day care and other incentives in order to get the fertility rate up to about 1.6, and expects the government soon to step up building day-care centres and kindergartens.Developed counties typically spend 1% to 4% of GDP on such support, he said."The one I'd really like to see is the housing subsidy, especially in large cities," he said. "If the local government can return (land tax) or give discounts to couples with a third child or second child," it would be helpful, he said.Also Read | Explained: China’s family planning laws over the yearsUptick and DeclineWhen China scrapped its one-child policy in 2016 there was a brief uptick in births followed by a decline that has steepened as costs continue to rise.Yi Fuxian, a University of Wisconsin scientist and longtime critic of Chinese birth policy, said the decades-long one-child policy entrenched attitudes.In Japan, he noted, costly policies such as free childcare and education, housing subsidies for young couples and free medical care for kids helped lift the fertility rate from 1.26 in 2005 to 1.45 in 2015, only for it to drop to 1.36 in 2019."Having just one child or no children has become the social norm in China. Social and economic patterns cater to the one-child policy, so the inertial effects linger on," he said.The Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, acknowledged the difficulty of having three children in big cities but also said economics was not the only factor."It is equally important to change some habitual views of children and family values in a society with a declining birth rate, and to form new expectations and acceptability, as well as views on happiness," it said in an editorial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-new-three-child-policy-draws-scepticism-cost-questions-101622537155467.html
01-06-2021||World||North Korea sets up second-in-command post under Kim Jong Un: Report||North Korea's ruling party has amended its rules to create a de facto second-in-command under leader Kim Jong Un as he looks to revamp domestic politics, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said on Tuesday.Citing an unidentified source familiar with North Korea, the agency said the holder of the new post of "first secretary" would chair meetings on behalf of Kim Jong Un.Kim cemented his power at a congress of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) in January, when he was elected its general secretary, taking a title last held by his late father, Kim Jong Il.Now Kim wants a greater role in government for the party, as compared to the more-military centred administration of his father, the news agency added."The term 'military-first politics', a major keyword in the Kim Jong Il era, is known to have been scrapped from the preface of the party by-laws," it said.In a statement, South Korea’s Unification Ministry said new party by-laws were publicized in North Korea after the January meeting. But the ministry responsible for relations with the neighbouring nation said it could not disclose details.Kim Jong Un himself used the "first secretary" designation from 2012 to 2016.The new post, the most senior of the party's seven secretaries, is likely to have been taken by Jo Yong Won, who is a member of the politburo’s five-strong presidium, Yonhap said.Also Read | 'Shameful double-dealing': North Korea slams end to US guidelines limiting S Korea missile rangeJo, considered one of Kim's closest aides, was seen by analysts at the time of the January meeting to hold the government's No. 3 position, after Kim and Choe Ryong Hae, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly."This seems to be the broader trend of North Korea delegating and redistributing some of Kim Jong Un's duties to others, not necessarily his powers, and streamlining the party leadership structure," said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a fellow with 38 North, a U.S.-based programme that monitors North Korea.The change is likely to affect Kim's public profile and how leadership guidance is provided to the public, she said, adding that Jo had already taken a role in leading party sessions.Kim Jong Un has wielded almost absolute power in North Korea's dynastic system since taking over after his father's death in 2011.Last year a South Korean lawmaker said the country's intelligence agency believed that Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, was serving as his "de facto second-in-command" but had not necessarily been designated his successor.\||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-sets-up-second-in-command-post-under-kim-jong-un-report-101622537163330.html
01-06-2021||World||South Korea summons Japan envoy over Tokyo Olympics map showing disputed islands||South Korea summoned Japan's deputy ambassador on Tuesday to protest over a map on the Tokyo Olympics website that showed a set of South Korea-controlled islands as Japanese territory.The small islands, called Dokdo in South Korea and Takeshima in Japan, have been at the center of a decades-long territorial dispute between the two countries.A public uproar arose in South Korea after the islands were marked on a map of Japan on the Tokyo Olympics website showing the route of the torch relay. Tokyo has rejected Seoul's request to change the map, prompting some South Korean politicians to call for a boycott of the Games.South Korea's foreign ministry said it had summoned Hirohisa Soma, deputy ambassador at the Japanese Embassy in Seoul, to demand correction of the map."We were planning to strongly protest Japan's unjust territorial assertion over Dokdo and demand an immediate correction," ministry spokesman Choi Young-sam told a briefing ahead of the summons.Phone calls to the Japanese embassy for comment went unanswered.The islands, also known as the Liancourt Rocks, are 225 km (140 miles) off the east coast of South Korea. While South Korea controls the islands, Japan also claims sovereignty over them.Choi did not elaborate on the calls to boycott the Olympics, saying the government will closely watch the situation while contesting Japan's territorial claims.The two nations had a similar spat during the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, with Japan protesting the inclusion of the islands on a flag depicting a unified Korean peninsula used when athletes from South and North Korea marched together at the opening ceremony.Relations between Seoul and Tokyo remain icy amid disputes over the islands and the issue of compensation for victims who were forced to work in Japanese firms and military brothels during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-summons-japan-envoy-over-tokyo-olympics-map-showing-disputed-islands-101622536792258.html
01-06-2021||World||Covid-19: Heathrow Airport opens dedicated terminal for 'red list' countries including India||London's busy Heathrow Airport opened a dedicated new terminal on Tuesday for arrivals from countries designated as "red list", such as India, for a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission.Travellers on direct flights from such destinations will now go through Terminal 3 and then move directly to a government-approved quarantine facility booked at the passengers' own expense.Also Read | UK's Heathrow Airport refuses to allow extra flights from India amid Covid-19It comes after the London airport’s staff had raised fears for their safety because of overcrowding, amid concerns that travellers arriving from red list countries – from where travel is effectively banned except for British and Irish nationals or limited exceptions – were mixing with those from green and amber."Red list routes will likely be a feature of UK travel for the foreseeable future as countries vaccinate their populations at different rates,” a Heathrow Airport spokesperson said."We're adapting Heathrow to this longer-term reality by initially opening a dedicated arrivals facility in Terminal 3 from 1 June for red list passengers arriving on direct flights. While opening this facility will be logistically very challenging, our hope is that it will enable Border Force to carry out its duties more efficiently as passenger volumes increase in line with the green list. Until then, the current red list system will remain in place,” the spokesperson said.Currently, there are 43 countries on the UK government's red list to cover regions linked with high-risk COVID-19 variants such as India, Brazil and South Africa.Under the UK government's coronavirus rules, anyone who has been in a red list country is required to pay for hotel quarantine for 10 nights after their arrival.According to officials, the latest system has been designed with several layers of COVID-19 security, including mandatory negative COVID-19 tests for all international arrivals, mandatory use of face coverings, social distancing, segregation and enhanced cleaning regimes and ventilation in immigration halls."We will move this facility to Terminal 4 as soon as operationally possible," the Heathrow spokesperson said.A UK government spokesperson said the enhanced borders regime was to reduce the risk of new variants being transmitted."As we reopen international travel safely, we will maintain 100 per cent health checks at the border and the new dedicated terminal at Heathrow for arrivals from red list countries will enable passengers to be processed as safely and as efficiently as possible, before being transferred to a managed quarantine facility," the spokesperson said.The move comes as the UK coronavirus cases exceeded 3,000 on Monday for a sixth day in a row, with this figure not having been surpassed since April 12.The highly transmissible B1.617.2 variant, first identified in India and now named 'Delta' by the World Health Organisation, is believed to be largely behind this spike in infections with scientists advising caution before all COVID-19 lockdown restrictions are completely lifted as planned for June 21.The coronavirus has killed 128,045 people in the UK, along with 45,03,231 confirmed cases so far, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-heathrow-airport-opens-dedicated-terminal-for-red-list-countries-including-india-101622536707760.html
01-06-2021||World||Diaper, toys shares soar after China announces third-child policy||Shares in Chinese toy makers, diaper producers and infant food companies soared for the second day on Tuesday, as investors piled into stocks seen as benefitting from Beijing's new three-child policy.China's announcement on Monday to allow married couples to have up to three children - from the previous limit of two - also sent brokerage analysts scrambling to recommend stocks, despite a widely-shared perception that the policy shift won't have a sudden impact on the country's declining birth rate.Shares in toy maker Goldlok Holdings (Guangdong) Co jumped to their 10% daily limit for the second day, as did shares in Jinfa Labi Maternity & Baby Articles Co.Other baby-related stocks, including milk powder maker Beingmate Co, baby products maker Shanghai Aiyingshi Co and toddler care equipment maker Ningbo David Medical Device Co also soared.An index tracking the so-called "third baby concept" stocks, newly compiled by Hithink RoyalFlush Information Network Co, rose about 2.5% on Tuesday, while China's benchmark stock index was roughly flat.Hu Yunlong, a Beijing-based hedge fund manager, said the sharp gains in such stocks were the result of "short-term speculation," as he sees limited immediate impact on corporate fundamentals.China lifted the cap on births in a bid to stave off risks to its economy from a rapidly aging population. But analysts say the policy by itself is unlikely to boost many couples' willingness to have more children, given high childcare costs.Still, Xu Qi, investment adviser at Guosheng Securities, said Luolai Lifestyle Technology Co, which makes home textile products such as quilts and pillows, stands to benefit from the new policy. He also recommends Zhejiang Semir Garment Co, which makes children's clothes.Essence International suggested investors pay attention to China Feihe Ltd, a Hong Kong-listed maker of infant milk formula products.Meanwhile, Chinese listed companies fielded questions from investors anxious to learn how their businesses will be affected by the new policy.Thinker Agricultural Machinery Co Ltd, a maker of rice harvesters, was asked if the company was a "third-child concept" stock."Thanks for your humorous question," the company replied in an online investor relations platform.The indirect relationship is that "an increase in population will increase grain consumption...and demand for harvesters."But the precondition is...people are willing to have a third child."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/diaper-toys-shares-soar-after-china-announces-third-child-policy-101622535244161.html
01-06-2021||World||Nearly 500,000 killed in a decade of Syria war: Report||A decade of war in Syria has left nearly half a million people dead, a war monitor said Tuesday, in a new toll that includes 100,000 recently confirmed deaths.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the conflict has claimed 494,438 lives since it erupted in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.The previous tally, issued by the Observatory in March this year, stood at more than 388,000 dead.The war monitor has since confirmed an additional 105,015 deaths following months of documentation efforts supported by its network of sources on the ground."The overwhelming majority of these deaths occurred between the end of 2012 and November 2015," Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP, referring to the latest additions.Of the recently confirmed fatalities, more than 42,000 are civilians, most of them killed under torture in Syrian regime prisons, according to the monitor.Abdel Rahman said that a lull in the fighting allowed his organisation to investigate reports of deaths that had not been included in the overall tally for lack of documentation."It provided us with a window to document tens of thousands of cases for which we lacked evidence," he said.With government forces having reconquered large swathes of Syria and a ceasefire still holding along the main front line in Idlib region in the northwest, violence levels are at their lowest since the start of the conflict.PRISON DEATHSThe new figures published by the Observatory bring the total civilian death toll to 159,774, with attacks by Syrian government forces and allied militia accounting for the majority of deaths.The Observatory also documented a total of at least 57,567 deaths in government prisons and detention centres since 2011, up from the 16,000 confirmed deaths it reported in March.It also reported 168,326 deaths among Syrian soldiers and allied militia, with troops accounting for more than half of the tally.The conflict has killed 68,393 jihadists, most members of the Islamic State group or of organisations linked to Al-Qaeda, as well as 79,844 other rebels.A deal brokered by Turkey and Russia in March 2020 froze a government offensive on the rebel-controlled Idlib enclave which many feared would have caused human suffering on a scale yet unseen in the conflict.The attention on both sides has since turned to battling the Covid-19 pandemic and 2020 saw the lowest number of conflict-related deaths since the start of the war with 10,000, according to the Observatory.Today the Damascus government controls more than two-thirds of the country after a string of Russia-backed victories since 2015.President Bashar al-Assad, in power since 2000, was re-elected in May for a fourth seven-year term.The war has forced more than half the country's pre-war population to flee their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-500-000-killed-in-a-decade-of-syria-war-report-101622534903348.html

Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit also came under fire for allegedly collaborating and being “part of a plot against the rule of law” to send the fugitive diamantaire to India. Dominica’s House of Assembly's leader of the Opposition Lennox Linton said a “full investigation” should be made into the circumstances under which Choksi was brought to Dominica. The “obvious collaboration between Dominica, Antigua and India” and the officials who instructed or influenced the police to facilitate the inhumane transfer of Mehul Choksi to Dominica should also be investigated, he added.Choksi and his lawyers claimed that he was kidnapped and taken to Dominica against his will last week. On Monday, his lawyer Vijay Aggarwal also suggested that the businessman may have been honey-trapped by a woman he had known for six months. He had gone to her house when he was abducted and taken on a yacht to Dominica.Choksi faces multiple charges of embezzling funds from the Punjab National Bank (PNB) in India which is worth some ₹13,500 crore. He had acquired citizenship of Antigua under its Citizenship by Investment Programme (CIP) in November 2017, weeks before investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the PNB scam started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antigua-pm-says-he-had-no-role-in-mehul-choksi-s-abduction-101622522769372.html

While H5N8 only presents a low risk to humans, it is highly lethal to wild birds and poultry,” the news agency Xinhua reported on the outbreak.In April, a highly pathogenic H5N6 avian flu was found in wild birds in Shenyang, a city in northeast China’s Liaoning province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-human-case-of-h10n3-bird-flu-sends-out-advisory-101622524312651.html

"PPP rejects the decision to delay and rig the elections," he said.The former prime minister said that transparent, unbiased, and timely elections should be held in PoK and that the government would reap what it was sowing.Meanwhile, PPP leader and Sindh Education Minister Saeed Ghani said that the PoK Constitution was very clear and the elections could not be delayed, come what may, alleging that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) was once again being used as an "arm twisting tool", reported Dawn.Ghani remarked that all the by-elections in Pakistan were held on time and now postponing elections in PoK polls meant that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was running away from the democratic process of elections.Earlier on Sunday, PoK Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider had accused the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government of wanting to achieve its desired results in the PoK elections.He further remarked that no matter what the Prime Minister does, PoK will never become a province."Elections in PoK can only be postponed if there is external aggression," PM Farooq Haider said.He added that there is no reason to postpone the polls as by-elections were also held in the country despite the pandemic.Last year, the Imran Khan government had announced granting provisional province status to the region, which was not received well by most of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan who had protested against Islamabad's decision of integrating the illegally occupied region with the rest of Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-pakistan-pm-opposes-government-bid-to-delay-pok-elections-101622521117399.html
01-06-2021||World||'As a dad...': Trudeau vows 'concrete action' after mass indigenous student grave found||Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday expressed Canada's grief while pledging "concrete action" in support of indigenous communities after remains of 215 indigenous children were discovered at an old boarding school."As a dad, I can't imagine what it would feel like to have my kids taken away from me," Trudeau told a news conference. "And as prime minister, I am appalled by the shameful policy that stole indigenous children from their communities.""Think of their communities that never saw them again. Think of their hopes, their dreams, their potential, of all they would have accomplished, all they would have become," he said. "All of that was taken away."Trudeau, who has made reconciliation with Canada's nearly 1.7 million indigenous people a priority of his government since coming to power in 2015, said he would speak with his ministers to shore up "next and further things we need to do to support (residential school) survivors and the community."Excavating school burial sites across Canada, as many have urged, he also said, "is an important part of discovering the truth.""Canada will be there to support indigenous communities as we discover the extent of this trauma and trying to give opportunities for families and communities to heal."The Tk'emlups te Secwepemc tribe said last week it had used ground-penetrating radar to confirm the remains of the students who attended a school near Kamloops, British Columbia.The Kamloops Indian Residential School was the largest of 139 boarding schools set up in the late 19th century to assimilate Canada's indigenous peoples, with up to 500 students registered and attending at any one time.It was operated by the Catholic church on behalf of the Canadian government from 1890 to 1969, before Ottawa took over its administration and closed it a decade later.Official records showed only 50 deaths at the school, where a principal once pleaded for more funds to properly feed students.- Children shoes tiny tributes -As the nation mourned, flags atop government buildings were lowered to half-mast over the weekend.Row upon row of children's shoes were left in front of parliament in Ottawa and on steps outside government offices and churches in several cities, forming makeshift memorials.About 100 people, several in ceremonial attire, also marched Sunday in the Mohawk community of Kahnawake, near Montreal.National chief of the Assembly of First Nations Perry Bellegarde was quoted by the Globe and Mail as saying former students and families "deserve to know the truth.""A thorough investigation into all former residential school sites could lead to more truths of the genocide against our people," he added.The British Columbia coroner is helping the Tk'emlups te Secwepemc tribe establish the causes and timings of the student deaths in Kamloops.On Monday, opposition parties asked for -- and Trudeau agreed to -- an emergency debate in parliament on the "heart-breaking" discovery.Some 150,000 Indian, Inuit and Metis youngsters in total were forcibly enrolled in these schools, where students were physically and sexually abused by headmasters and teachers who stripped them of their culture and language.Today those experiences are blamed for a high incidence of poverty, alcoholism and domestic violence, as well as high suicide rates, in indigenous communities.A truth and reconciliation commission has identified the names of, or information about, at least 4,100 children who died from abuse or neglect while attending a residential school. It estimates the actual toll is much higher.The commission concluded in a 2015 report that more than a century of abuses at the schools amounted to "cultural genocide."Seven years earlier, Ottawa had formally apologized as part of a Can$1.9 billion (US$1.5 billion) settlement with former students.The National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation at the University of Manitoba, meanwhile, set up an online registry with the names of the thousands of children who never came home from the boarding schools, along with old class photos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-a-dad-trudeau-vows-concrete-action-on-mass-indigenous-student-grave-101622519241349.html

All waves start with a low number of cases... and then become explosive. So the key here is that what we are seeing are the signs of an early wave,” he said.PM Johnson, meanwhile, said he wants the G7 to reach a deal on Covid-19 vaccine passports and open talks on a “world treaty” to prepare for future pandemics in next month’s summit. He will host a June 11-13 G7 summit in Cornwall, England.In Brussels, the European Commission said fully vaccinated EU residents should be exempted from quarantine when travelling within the bloc. The EU executive’s update to its non-binding travel advisory was unveiled a week before EU legislation on a digital EU Covid certificate is set to be passed.The Pacific nation of Palau reported its first confirmed case on Monday.WHO members agree to strengthen global bodyWHO members have agreed to strengthen the global body at the heart of the pandemic response. The 194 member states, in a 14-page resolution on the last day of the virtual annual World Health Assembly, also agreed to “strengthen the WHO’s capacity to rapidly and appropriately assess disease outbreaks”.Japan, meanwhile, approved Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for those aged 12-15 years on Monday, the media reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-in-early-stages-of-3rd-wave-fears-top-scientist-101622516753676.html

It also said that the extension for the contractual pilots would be at the discretion of Air India in view of their satisfactory performance.A detailed judgment on the bunch of pleas by the pilots challenging the termination on August 13 is yet to be uploaded on the website of the Delhi High Court.The terminated pilots had initially moved the court in July last year seeking directions to Air India to accept the withdrawal of the resignations tendered by them. However, on August 13, 2020, Air India issued termination letters to several pilots including those who had wanted to withdraw their resignations.Subsequently, the pilots moved the High Court against the August 13, 2020, decision of Air India.Some pilots had initially tendered their resignations over delay by Air India in disbursing pay and allowances. They had also contended that neither were their notice periods reduced nor any no-objection certificate issued to them after receipt of resignation.They had further contended that the resignations were subsequently withdrawn, but the withdrawal was not accepted by Air India.Air India cited financial constraints and the impact of Covid-19 on the commercial functioning of the company for the decision taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hcquashes-air-india-s-decision-to-terminate-pilots-101622570720009.html

In a letter to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, Odisha health minister Naba Das said as the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech did participate in the pre-bid meeting, it is understood that at their present capacity they won’t be able to provide the required vaccines to the states.“There have been media reports that other states which have floated tenders are also facing non-response from vaccine manufacturers. It seems that the global vaccine manufacturers, like Pfizer and Moderna are concerned about indemnity related issues among others. Secondly, they are willing to deal with federal-level central procurement only. At this stage, global vaccine manufacturers will require the central government;s statutory clearances for supplying to the states,” said Das, stressing that it might be faster and economical if the procurement of global vaccines are made at the country-level rather than by individual states.Odisha last week extended the deadline for the global tender floated for procurement of Covid-19 vaccines till June 4 in view of cyclone Yaas. The tender was issued on May 14 for procurement of 3.8 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses to inoculate its 18-44 population. The global tender had liberal conditions with respect to performance security, penalties and advance payments.“Vaccination has been a game changer in most countries in saving both lives and the economy. It is important that we complete vaccination on a war footing before the onset of a possible third wave. In view of the urgency of the issue we look forward to early action in this regard and assure our continued cooperation to defeat Covid-19,” said Das, emphasising that states may be given the given flexibility to design and decide on the distribution of vaccines taking local factors into consideration.The Odisha health minister said the vaccine supply constraint has forced the state to vaccinate only 60,000 -70,000 people per day even though it has the capacity to vaccinate at 3 lakh people per day. So far, Odisha has vaccinated 77 lakh people with at least one dose.The health minister in his letter said Odisha would like to do priority vaccination for senior school students and their families.“States may be given the flexibility to design and decide on distribution of vaccines taking local factors into consideration (for eg. in many hilly terrains, internet connectivity is poor and we can’t make online registration mandatory in those districts,” Das said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-buying-vaccines-will-be-cheaper-faster-says-naveen-patnaik-govt-101622570160072.html

The assault, recorded presumably on a mobile phone, triggered a sharp protest from doctors and others.Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma called it a barbaric attack and ordered the Assam police to arrest the culprits.“Such barbaric attacks on our frontline workers won’t be tolerated by our administration,” Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted. GP Singh, special director general of police, responded to the chief minister, saying three people had already been arrested. Dr Seuj Kumar Senapati, who was posted at Udali CCC in Hojai district of central Assam was attacked by nearly 20 relatives of the patient including women.A video of the incident in which a group of persons is seen hitting the doctor with broom, utensils and kicking him while he lay on the ground has gone viral on social media platforms. Though a policeman is seen in the video, he’s not seen trying to stop the attack. According to a letter issued by the Hojai unit of Indian Medical Association (IMA) to the deputy commissioner of the district, the patient was admitted on Tuesday at 11am and died three hours later at 2pm.The letter said the mob damaged the building and also ransacked instruments at the CCC besides “brutally assaulting” the doctor. The IMA unit said unless all the culprits involved in the attack are arrested by 7am on Wednesday, all doctors of Hojai would boycott all out-patient duty (OPD) services. It also asked the government to provide all hospitals and CCCs with security cover, CCTV cameras and round the clock electricity. “Instructions have been given to superintendent of police Hojai to arrest all persons involved in the assault,” GP Singh tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-doctor-assaulted-after-covid-19-patient-dies-cm-calls-it-barbaric-attack-101622568541422.html

01-06-2021||India||‘Entire judgment focusses on...’: Goa govt substantiates appeal against Tejpal’s acquittal||The Goa government in its appeal filed before the Bombay High Court at Goa has assailed the judgement of Additional Sessions Judge Kshama Joshi calling it “perverse” and “influenced by extraneous inadmissible materials and testimonies, graphic details of the past sexual history of the victim.” Filing an amended appeal against the judgement, the Goa Police have said that the judgement, which was passed two weeks back, “was shocking in its apparent legal bias against the prosecutrix” (survivor) and that the judgement was “unsustainable in law and is coloured by prejudice and patriarchy” and that “much of the impugned judgment has been consumed by sexual gossip and alleged sexual fantasies related to the prosecutrix which were legally prohibited.”The former editor of Tehelka magazine was accused of raping a junior colleague in an elevator of a five-star hotel in Goa during the THiNK festival in November 2013. The complainant alleged that Tejpal had raped her in a lift in the hotel on November 7 and attempted to assault her again on November 8. Tejpal, who refuted the charges in court, was acquitted by the fast-track court on May 21. The Goa government filed an appeal against the verdict in the Bombay High Court last Tuesday. The appeal is scheduled for hearing on Wednesday, June 2. “The trial court in its 527-page-judgment has been influenced by extraneous inadmissible materials and testimonies, graphic details of the past sexual history of the victim, prohibited by law and has used the same for purposes of censuring her character and discrediting her evidence. The entire judgment focusses on indicting the complainant witness rather than trying to ascertain the culpable role of the Respondent Accused (Tarun Tejpal),” the appeal stated. The Goa Police also said that the trial court has completely discarded the testimony of the survivor despite “her statement given in court, gave a clear and cogent account of the incidents of sexual harassment, rape, sexual assault, outraging of modesty, use of criminal force, and wrongful restraint and confinement that she was subjected to at the hands of the respondent accused, the then Editor-in-chief of Tehelka magazine.”“When it suggests that it is unsafe to rely on her testimony as she is well educated, a good writer, proficient in English and above all conversant with the rape law, and was a capable, intelligent, independent person, the trial court, unfortunately, deploys the prosecutrix’s strengths and accomplishments to dispute her testimony,” the prosecution argued. “It appears that the victim’s work in the field of gender and an article on compensation for rape survivors authored by the prosecutrix and such other accomplishments have, in the eyes of the trial court, impacted her credibility,” the state’s appeal read. The state has also contended that the judgement should be set aside and Tejpal should be convicted on the offences he was charged off since “the Court disbelieved the version of the prosecutrix on the basis of a conception of how a victim is expected to behave while being sexually assaulted.” “The burden of expectation of “normative” behaviour is heavily and incorrectly placed by the trial court on the shoulders of the prosecutrix,” the state has argued, adding that the “trial court has drawn an adverse inference against the survivor for not looking sufficiently traumatised or appearing fearful after the two incidents and in the messages, she exchanged after the incidents.”“The discrepancies that the prosecutrix attributes to the shock and trauma that she endured at the hands of a person in a position of trust and authority, who had assaulted and violated her have been disregarded, and her reactions are incorrectly treated as implausible without any logical or lawful reason,” the prosecution has argued. “Not only do the above observations betray a complete lack of understanding of post-trauma behaviour of victims, they also demonstrate complete ignorance of the law as also of the directions and guidelines passed by the Supreme Court of India in such matters,” the state argued. The state also argued that the victim was subjected to a rigorous cross-examination extending to almost 700 pages, spread over eighteen dates of hearing but which was “nothing short of a brutal attack on her character and alleged past sexual history designed to shame and humiliate her.” “Not only should these questions have been disallowed while recording evidence, but the trial court has gone so far as to use these very questions and materials to discredit her, although they were neither relevant to the case, nor could they have been put to her under law,” the state has argued. Tejpal who was relieved at being acquitted thanked judge Kshama Joshi for his acquittal. “In November 2013, I was falsely accused of sexual assault by a colleague. Today, the Hon’ble trial court of Additional Sessions Judge Kshama Joshi, in Goa, has honourably acquitted me. In an awfully vitiated age, where ordinary courage has become rare, I thank her for standing by the truth,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/entire-judgment-focusses-on-goa-govt-substantiates-appeal-against-tejpal-s-acquittal-101622564460914.html
01-06-2021||India||J&K caps duration of online classes after girl’s ‘why so much work’ video||Lieutenant-Governor Manoj Sinha on Tuesday announced caps on the duration of daily online classes by schools in Jammu and Kashmir after a six-year-old girl’s video message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi went viral.In the video, the young Kashmiri girl, Mairoo Irfan from Srinagar’s Batmaloo locality, is heard talking about how she spends three hours in the online classroom every day. “Such a load of work is meant for big children. Why so much work for small children, Modi Sahab. What can be done?” she shrugs her shoulders as she ends her message.The ‘adorable’ complaint by the moved Lt Guv Manoj Sinha, responded to her video on Twitter, promising a review within 48 hours.Manoj Sinha was back with a policy 24 hours later, on Tuesday evening.Sinha said the school education department has decided to limit the duration of the daily online classes for all school students.The guidelines restrict the screen time of pre-primary classes to 30 minutes on a given day.Modi saab ko is baat par zaroor gaur farmana chahiye😂 pic.twitter.com/uFjvFGUisIFor classes 1 to 8 level, the online teaching can be undertaken for not more than two sessions of 30-45 minutes each while schools can have four sessions of 30-45 minutes each for students of classes 9 to 12.“Give 10-15 minutes break between two consecutive classes for students to freshen up, relax and re-energise themselves to focus on the next class,” the guidelines, issued by the school education department, said.Schools have also been told to avoid homework for primary students and plan “joyful learning experiences” that engage parents as well.“Our children need more time to play, interact with parents, the biggest learning experience a child can have,” Lt Governor Sinha said.The school education department has decided to limit daily online classes for a maximum one and half hours for class 1 to 8, spread across two sessions. For class 9 to 12 online synchronous learning will not be more than 3 hours. https://t.co/ihB3bkxUBaIncidentally, the Union education ministry did circulate guidelines in July 2020 that asked states to limit the duration of online classes. The new guidelines announced by Lt Governor Sinha are based on the same template.It is not clear why the J&K’s school education department officials did not implement the education ministry’s guidelines for nearly 10 months till Lt Guv Sinha took note of Mairoo Irfan’s SOS message to PM Modi.But she is happy. “There should be more time to play,” said the six-year-old.HT last week reported how unregulated online classes were affecting the health of schoolchildren in Kashmir. Private institutions have been conducting online classes for students as young as four. Government schools have been holding them mostly from Class 5 onwards.The sessions would extend up to 8 classes in a day, prompting experts to underscore that prolonged screen time of up to five hours was affecting both the physical and mental health of the children and leading to behavioural changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-caps-duration-of-online-classes-after-girl-s-why-so-much-work-video-101622564400332.html

We work with the Government of India and all State Governments. As a matter of fact, the vacuum due to the retreat of the political class has been deservedly filled by IMA," read the letter."Ramdev thought it fit to launch his tirade against the national Covid-19 treatment protocol andnational Covid-19 vaccination programme looking for an opportunity to market his commercialproducts. What he failed to realise is that in doing so he has irreparably damaged the efforts ofGovernment of India in containing the epidemic. Creating confusion in the minds of the peopleagainst the national Covid protocol and National vaccination programme is an anti-national act of heinous proportions. IMA has demanded to deem it as sedition and prosecute him under theDisaster Management Act," it said.Calling Ramdev's remarks a "criminal act", the IMA said, "Inaction from the government would seriously hurt the doctors who are fighting the pandemic. His supporters have attempted diversionary tactics of malicious attacks on IMA and its National President. Nothing will deviate IMA from its resolve to nail this anti-national.""The total number of Covid-19 patients in the country so far is 2.78 Crores and 2.54 Crores have recovered. Our case fatality rate remains 1.16 per cent. Even with the limitations of official statistics, it can be seen that Indian doctors, nurses and health care workers have fought tirelessly," the association said, reminding that 1,300 doctors have sacrificed their lives for the nation."Countless children and family members of doctors have been infected. To trivialise these martyrs and the warriors is a sacrilege," it said.Last week, the IMA had appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take appropriate action under sedition and other charges against Ramdev for allegedly "spearheading a misinformation campaign on COVID vaccination".The IMA had sent a legal notice to Ramdev over his alleged statements against allopathy and "defaming" scientific medicine.However, the Patanjali Yogpeeth Trust has denied allegations by the IMA that Ramdev has misled people by making "unlearned" statements against allopathy and defamed scientific medicine.On May 23, Ramdev had withdrawn his statements on allopathic medicine after receiving a strong-worded letter from Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan who called his remarks "inappropriate".According to the Haridwar-based Patanjali Yogpeeth Trust statement, Ramdev was reading out a WhatsApp forwarded message in the video that has gone viral on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1300-doctors-sacrificed-their-lives-ima-launches-fresh-tirade-against-ramdev-101622560452277.html

The nominated members are drawn from fields such as literature, science, sports, art, and social service.Swapan Dasgupta, who was first nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 2016, resigned after he was named as the Bharatiya Janata Party candidate from Bengal’s Tarakeswar assembly seat on March 14. The Congress promptly wrote to the Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu, complaining that Dasgupta hadn’t resigned from the House before contesting election nor had he joined any party.A nominated MP has the option to join a political party within six months of taking oath. But Dasgupta hadn’t declared his affiliation with the BJP within the six months of being nominated in 2016.Dasgupta eventually announced his resignation on March 16, declaring that he intended to “commit myself totally to the fight for a better Bengal”. The BJP, which had hoped to capture power in the state, however, ended up with just 77 of the 292 assembly seats on which elections were held.Swapan Dasgupta also lost the Tarakeswar seat to the Trinamool Congress’ Ramendu Sinharay by a margin of 7,484 votes.On Sunday, the government had notified the nomination of noted lawyer Mahesh Jethmalani to the Rajya Sabha on Sunday. Jethmalani’s nomination will fill the vacancy that arose after the death of Raghunath Mohapatra who succumbed to Covid-19 earlier this month. His term will end in September 2024.His father Ram Jethmalani, also a renowned lawyer was also a Rajya Sabha member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swapan-dasgupta-quit-rajya-sabha-to-contest-bengal-polls-gets-his-seat-back-101622555638710.html

We handed over Prashant to his family members," Sajjanar said at a press conference.Prashant thanked the Telangana government and External Affairs Ministry for their efforts to bring him back.I did not expect that I would come back to India so soon. I owe a lot to the Telangana government and the Centre," he said.Replying to a query, he claimed he was beaten up by the Pakistani Police, but did not want to find fault with them as they were suspecting him initially.He said he was treated well in the Lahore prison by Jail authorities and inmates.Prashant said there is a land route to Switzerland via Pakistan which will take about 60 days.To another question, he claimed he was subjected to questioning for several days by Pakistani army personnel who suspected that he was an Indian spy before being produced in court.According to a press release by the Cyberabad Police, Prashant boarded a train to Bikaner and from there he went to the Indo-Pak border and jumped the fence there.The release said he wanted to go to Pakistan for "personal reasons".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-releases-hyderabad-techie-after-jail-term-for-crossing-border-illegally-101622554522461.html
01-06-2021||India||No use debating over allopathy, ayurveda: NITI Aayog member VK Saraswat||There is actually "no use" in debating over allopathy and ayurveda as both are different and useful medicine systems, renowned scientist and Niti Aayog Member VK Saraswat said on Tuesday even as he emphasised that more research needs to be done in ayurveda to ensure it is more acceptable to the society.Saraswat, who was associated in the development of an anti-Covid drug by DRDO, also made it clear that the drug does not have anything to do with Patanjali Ayurved, amid reports that the medicine is connected with the research done by Patanjali Ayurved.The Niti Aayog Member's remarks on allopathy and ayurveda comes against the backdrop of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) raising strong objections to yoga guru Ramdev's comments that questioned the efficacy of allopathic medicines in treating Covid infections. Ramdev also steers Patanjali Ayurved.In an interview to PTI, Saraswat said India has got traditional medicine systems for thousands of years and that ayurvedic medicine has been responsible for improving the immunity of people."I think ayurveda and allopathy, they are two streams of medicine and they survive together... one has a particular role and other has a different role," he said.Amid the ongoing debate in certain quarters over allopathy and ayurveda, he said, the debate "is actually of no use", adding that both the streams are useful."My opinion is that the ayurvedic system of medicine should research more and more to bring (itself) at par in understanding of the scientific methods to become more acceptable by the society, which has been done in the allopathy," he emphasised.Last month, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had called Ramdev's statement on allopathic medicines "extremely unfortunate" and had asked him to withdraw the remarks, saying it disrespects 'corona warriors' and can break the morale of healthcare workers. Later, Ramdev withdrew the remarks.When asked whether the anti-Covid drug 2-DG developed by the Defence and Research Development Organisation (DRDO) is connected with research done by Patanjali Ayurved, Saraswat replied in the negative."It (2-DG) has nothing to do with Patanjali. Patanjali does not know anything about it. It is not their work," he pointed out.Saraswat, a former chief of DRDO, said he was the scientific advisor when that drug was developed."When the drug was developed, it was basically for supporting the treatment of patients who suffer from radiation-induced cancer... for doing that cancer treatment we do radiation therapy," he explained.According to him, during a radiation process, not only the cancer cells die but also the healthy cells die, which results in collateral damage to the human body."So, we created this drug in such a manner because you know the cancer cells are hungry for energy, so they take energy from our body. Our body gives energy in the form of glucose. Instead of taking body sugar, we started injecting. This drug is like a glucose but actually it is not glucose, it does not have any energy," he said.Elaborating further, Saraswat said cancerous cells would absorb the drug and then become weak. Once they become weak, lower doses of radiation can be given to kill the cancerous cells and that will not be harmful for healthy cells, he added.According to Saraswat, the same theory is now being utilised for treating Covid infections.DRDO's 2-DG has been approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) as an oral drug for emergency use as an adjunct therapy in moderate to severe coronavirus patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-use-debating-over-allopathy-ayurveda-niti-aayog-member-v-k-saraswat-101622553568476.html
01-06-2021||India||At BRICS foreign ministers meet, focus on Covid-19 pandemic, access to vaccines||The BRICS grouping on Tuesday endorsed an India-South Africa proposal for patent waivers for Covid-19 vaccines and called for sharing of doses, transfer of technology and development of vaccine production capacities to turn the tide in the fight against the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff, members of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) grouping reaffirmed the importance of territorial integrity and sovereignty of states and the need to resolve problems through peaceful means.A virtual meeting of foreign ministers of BRICS states, which was chaired by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, also resolved to combat all form of terrorism, including cross-border movement of terrorist, terror financing networks and safe havens.Jaishankar and his counterparts from the four other countries – China’s Wang Yi, Brazil’s Carlos Alberto Franco França, Russia’s Sergey Lavrov and South Africa’s Grace Naledi Mandisa Pandor – focused on the response to the Covid-19 crisis and equitable access to vaccines during their deliberations.India and South Africa have been pushing for a waiver of patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization (WTO) since last year, and all the BRICS members agreed to support this measure as part of efforts to ensure timely, affordable and equitable access to diagnostics, vaccines and essential health products and technologies and their components to combat the pandemic.Also read: WHO approves China's Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine for global use“The ministers reaffirmed the need to use all relevant measures... including supporting ongoing consideration in WTO on a Covid-19 vaccine intellectual property rights waiver and the use of flexibilities of the TRIPS agreement and the Doha Declaration on TRIPS Agreement and Public Health,” said a joint statement on reforming the multilateral system that was adopted at the meeting.The ministers reiterated the need for sharing vaccine doses, transfer of technology, development of local production capacities and supply chains for medical products, and promotion of price transparency, and sought “due restraint in the implementation of measures that could hinder the flow of vaccines, health products and essential inputs”. They also called for timely operationalisation of the BRICS vaccine research and development centre.This was the first time the BRICS’ foreign ministers agreed on a stand-alone joint statement on strengthening and reforming the multilateral system. They agreed that such reforms have to cover all key multilateral institutions, including the UN and its organs such as the Security Council and General Assembly, global financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the multilateral trading system including WTO, and the global health system with the WHO at its core.The foreign ministers also agreed on six principles that should guide such reforms, including making instruments of global governance more inclusive and representative, changes based on inclusive consultations while respecting sovereign independence, making multilateral organisations more responsive and transparent, and strengthening countries and global organisations to better respond to emerging and non-traditional challenges such as terrorism, cybersecurity and fake news.Though there was no official word on whether the India-China standoff figured in the discussions, Jaishankar said in his opening remarks that BRICS strives for an inclusive and equitable multi-polar international system that respects the territorial integrity of all states.Such a multi-polar system is “based on international law and the UN Charter, that recognises the sovereign equality of all states, and respects their territorial integrity while displaying mutual respect for interests and concerns of all,” he said.Asked about the India-China differences at a press conference after the meeting, Russian foreign minister Lavrov said the BRICS members had reaffirmed the principles of the UN Charter, including respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries, and the need to “resolve any problems with peaceful means”.Also read: Patent waiver will help in wider access to technologies to produce vaccines - SAPeople familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Indian side was able to get BRICS members to agree to strong language on counter-terror cooperation, including the reference in a joint media statement to “cross-border movement of terrorists, terror financing networks and safe havens”.The BRICS members referred to the counter-terrorism strategy adopted at the grouping’s summit last year, and reiterated their commitment to finalise a “result-oriented action plan” by the Counter-Terrorism Working Group in 2021.The statement on reforming the multilateral system said the foreign ministers reaffirmed the sole authority of the UN Security Council for imposing sanctions and called for “further consolidation and strengthening of the working methods of UN Security Council sanctions committees to ensure their effectiveness, responsiveness and transparency”.On the issue of Afghanistan, the other BRICS states echoed India’s consistent stand and underline the need to preserve gains made over the past 20 years in the war-torn country. They stressed the need to protect the rights of all Afghan nationals, especially women, children and minorities, and called for an immediate ceasefire. They also stressed the “urgent necessity of the elimination of the threat of UNSC proscribed terrorist groups to lasting peace in Afghanistan”.Chinese foreign minister Wang avoided contentious issues in his opening remarks and said China and other BRICS members stand with India amid the second wave of Covid-19 infections. “BRICS cooperation now faces the profound and complex ramifications of the pandemic and changes unseen in a century,” he said.South Africa’s foreign minister Pandor said, “We have a global dilemma – millions of people in wealthier nations have been vaccinated while billions of people in poorer countries still wait and are still vulnerable to infection, disease and death.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-brics-foreign-ministers-meet-focus-on-covid-19-pandemic-access-to-vaccines-101622554080380.html

However, according to the 10th schedule of the constitution, with disqualification of MPs, “A nominated member of a House shall be disqualified for being a member of the House if he joins any political party after the expiry of six months from the date on which he takes his seat after complying with the requirements of article 99 or, as the case may be, article 188.”I have resigned from the Rajya Sabha today to commit myself totally to the fight for a better Bengal. I hope to file my nomination as BJP candidate for the Tarakeshwar Assembly seat in the next few days.The two articles relate to oath-taking of the lawmakers.Dasgupta, who was nominated to the Upper House in April 2016, is yet to formally join the BJP.

ICMR chief Balram Bhargava, while speaking at a health ministry press briefing, also said that there is no shortage of vaccine."By mid-July or August, we will have enough doses to vaccinate 1 crore people per day. We are confident of vaccinating the whole population by December," said Bhargava.He also said that gradual lifting of lockdown-like curbs will not lead to a massive surge in Covid-19 cases. "However, we have to ensure that vaccination is prioritised. The vaccination rate must be up to 70%. Also, Covid-appropriate behaviour should be followed," said Bhargava.The ICMR chief's comments come in the wake of demands made by several health experts that vaccination needs to be scaled up in India. Several states too have complained about vaccine shortage, and a few of them even floated global tenders to directly get the supply.The health ministry had said on Sunday that nearly 120 million vaccine doses will be available for the ongoing nationwide Covid vaccination programme in June. "Vaccination is an integral pillar of the comprehensive strategy of the government of India for containment and management of the pandemic, along with test, track, treat and Covid-appropriate behaviour," the health ministry said in a statement.The vaccination drive began in January this year with two vaccines - AstraZeneca's Covishield manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin. The Russian-made Sputnik V is the third vaccine to get approval from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for emergency use and is being used in a few private hospitals.Both SII and Bharat Biotech said on Sunday that they are looking at ramping up their production capacity to 110-120 million doses from the existing 75-80 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-chief-says-india-will-have-enough-covid-19-vaccines-by-july-to-inoculate-1-crore-people-a-day-101622551514492.html

Limiting vaccination against Covid-19 only to employees is not going to help the process,” the letter dated June 1, read. Air India lost five of its pilots to Covid-19 last month. The airline began vaccinating its pilots on May 15. “Pilots are being quarantined, testing positive, and succumbing to Covid at an alarming frequency.

The equivalent price in the U.S. financial center is $0.79, according to Bloomberg calculations based on figures from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.Indian fuel prices have soared in the past year as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration has repeatedly raised sales taxes to cushion worsening public finances. Levies now make up around 60% of the retail price and federal taxes on gasoline and diesel have surged nearly six-fold since 2013.The steep increase in taxes on the two fuels, which account for more than half of India’s oil consumption, comes as the Covid-19 pandemic pummels demand in the world’s third-biggest crude importer. Sales of the two fuels in May are about a third lower than pre-virus levels in 2019 as large parts of the nation remained under local lockdowns to battle the world’s worst coronavirus wave.Oil Demand Recovery in Virus-Ravaged India Tough to Predict“I pray for the prices to soften or the government to reduce the taxes,” said N.

Please do not spread misinformation regarding this,” he added.Reports on a one-dose regimen surfaced on Monday after the chairman of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), Dr NK Arora, told reporters that scientists will be looking into dosing intervals of vaccines to figure out if a single dose works better.“Dosing intervals will also be examined, that includes whether a single dose or a dose followed by a booster shot or so on works better,” said Arora.Arora also told reporters that a feasibility study will also be conducted in the country to study the effects of mixing two different vaccines.“We will be looking at the feasibility of testing a two dose Covid-19 vaccine regimen but with different vaccines, for which testing may start in a few weeks,” he added.The health ministry today confirmed that a study on mixing of different vaccines will indeed be conducted but it will strictly be an unresolved scientific question for now, and no vaccines will be mixed until robust data supports such an action.“It’s a scientific curiosity and science will settle it until then there will be no mixing of vaccines,” Dr Paul said at the press briefing on Tuesday.“There is research going on in other countries, this is a scientific topic. Until it's sorted out we will call it an unresolved scientific question,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-to-be-administered-in-2-shots-no-change-in-schedule-says-govt-101622548937395.html

01-06-2021||India||India's economy to grow at 9.3% in FY22, risks persist: Moody's||India's economy will rebound in the current financial year to mark a growth of 9.3 per cent but the second Covid-19 wave has increased risks to the country's outlook with potential longer-term credit implications, Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday.The economy rebounded quickly from a steep contraction in 2020, it said. But risks to India's credit profile including a persistent slowdown in growth, weak government finances and rising financial sector risks have been exacerbated by the shock of coronavirus second wave."We expect a decline in economic activity in the April to June quarter followed by a rebound, resulting in real, inflation-adjusted GDP growth of 9.3 per cent in the fiscal year ending March 2022 (fiscal 2021) and 7.9 per cent in fiscal 2022," said Moody's.It said the reimposition of lockdown measures along with behavioural changes on fear of contagion will curb economic activity. However, the impact is not expected to be as severe as during the first wave.A small shortfall in budgeted revenue and a redirection of spending toward the response to the pandemic will result in a general government fiscal deficit of 11.8 per cent of GDP and a rise in the general government debt burden to 90.3 per cent of GDP in fiscal 2021.Debt-to-GDP will edge up to 92 per cent by fiscal 2023, largely driven by relatively slow economic growth.Moody's said India's financial sector is the main driver of potential event risk to the sovereign. Whether the feedback loop between the real economy and the financial sector settles in a credit-supportive or credit-hindering mode will shape India's credit profile.So far, the second wave has increased financial risks to households and small businesses, which may hurt bank profitability.New loan forbearance and liquidity measures by the central bank, and government plans to set up an asset reconstruction company to take over stressed loans along with modest recapitalisation of public sector banks will mitigate, but not eliminate sector risks.Moody's said the impact from potential subsequent Covid waves remain a risk to forecasts. The government's ability to limit the spread of the virus and materially increase the rate of vaccinations will have a direct impact on the trajectory of both health and economic outcomes.India began the third phase of its vaccination campaign for those aged 18 to 44 on May 1, making vaccines available to the entire adult population. However, as of late May only around 15 per cent of the country's population had received at least one dose of the vaccine.A shortage of vaccines and logistical challenges reaching a large rural population (about two-thirds of the population) have complicated the vaccine rollout, said Moody's.The international community has recently contributed to India's efforts with increased medical and vaccine supplies to help address shortfalls. Moody's expects the pace of vaccinations to pick up this summer, with substantial progress by the end of 2021.Moody's said longer-term risks to India's economy will increase if the second wave extended beyond June and the pace of vaccinations was slower than it expects."This could contribute to more scarring if it caused a permanent loss of jobs and business closures, particularly in more productive sectors of the economy outside of agriculture in and around urban centers, resulting in a fundamentally weaker growth dynamic."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-economy-to-grow-at-9-3-in-fy22-risks-persist-moodys-101622547744186.html

The paediatric population is generally asymptomatic. They often get infections but their symptoms are minimal or nil. If they do get Covid, the infection has not taken serious shape in children and the need to hospitalise is very less,” Dr VK Paul, member (health) of NITI Aayog, said in a press briefing.“But the virus may change its behaviour in the paediatric population and there may be changes in epidemiological dynamics. The impact of Covid-19 may increase in children…The data has shown that a low number of children are being admitted to hospitals. We are are pushing preparedness by the day,” Paul added.Also read | ‘Third wave of Covid might not impact children, however...’: AIIMS director"I am happy to report to you that we are working very systematically, comprehensively to address the problem of paediatric Covid disease for now as well as in the future.

He also said that children are not immune from this infection and they can infect others but children do not generally suffer from severe infection.Experts have apprehended that this possible third wave may impact children even as the ongoing second wave of the pandemic is gradually coming under control.

01-06-2021||India||‘Tantamount to refusing lawful directions’: Centre to ex-Bengal chief secretary||The Centre has cited former West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay’s absence from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting on Cyclone Yaas last week and issued a show-cause notice to him, saying it was “tantamount to refusing to comply with the directions of the Central government and is thus violative of Section 51(b) of the DM [Disaster Management] Act.” The section provides for up to two-year imprisonment in case the refusal to comply with orders results in loss of life or imminent danger thereof.The Union home ministry issued the notice hours after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday attacked Modi over the transfer of Bandyopadhyay, who was ordered to report to Delhi amid a face-off between the state and the Central government. Banerjee appointed Bandyopadhyay as her chief adviser for three years while refusing to release the bureaucrat in defiance of the Centre’s direction. She said she permitted Bandopadhyay to retire on his last working day on his request and named HK Dwivedi as his successor. Banerjee called Bandopadhyay a bold officer and accused the Centre of victimising him and practising vindictive politics while calling Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah heartless.Also Watch | ‘Those who are scared..’: Mamata Banerjee quotes Sholay dialogue; slams PM ModiLate on Monday, the Centre issued the show-cause notice to Bandopadhyay and an official in Delhi said that “suitable action is being contemplated by the department against the official for defying the [transfer order of] DoPT [department of personnel and training]”.The notice has asked Bandyopadhyay to explain within three days in writing “why action should not be initiated against him” for “acting in a manner tantamount to refusing to comply with the lawful directions of the Central government”. “By this act of abstaining himself from the review meeting taken by the Prime Minister, who is the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in the aftermath of the cyclone Yaas as part of his visit to the affected areas in the state of West Bengal, Shri Alapan Bandyopadhyay, chief secretary… has acted in a manner tantamount to refusing to comply with the directions of the central government and is thus violative of section 51(b) of the DM Act,” said the notice, a copy which HT has seen.As per the section, the punishment for obstruction under it covers those who “refuse to comply with any direction given by or on behalf of the Central Government or the State Government or the National Executive Committee or the State Executive Committee or the District Authority.” It says in case of conviction, the obstruction will be “punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine, or with both”. If such obstruction or refusal to comply with directions “results in loss of lives or imminent danger thereof, it shall on conviction be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years”.The notice said Modi and his entourage waited for nearly 15 minutes for the officers of the state government to arrive for the meeting. “In view of the absence, the chief secretary was called by an official as to whether they wanted to participate in the meeting or not. Thereafter, the CS [chief secretary] arrived along with the chief minister [Banerjee] and left immediately.”The fresh face-off between Banerjee and the Centre began last Friday when she skipped the meeting on Cyclone Yaas with Modi. The Centre hours later ordered Bandopadhyay to report to DoPT by 10am Monday.On Saturday, Banerjee refused to release him and urged the Centre to reconsider its order. She wrote a five-page letter to Modi two days later, questioning the legality of the transfer order and questioned if it was linked to Friday’s meeting. Banerjee maintained she took Modi’s permission before leaving the meeting after objecting to the presence of Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of Opposition, who defeated her after defecting to the Bharatiya Janata Party in the March-April assembly elections. Later in the day, Banerjee said the Centre again asked Bandopadhyay to report to Delhi and insisted the officer cannot join a new office without the state’s permission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tantamount-to-refusing-lawful-directions-centre-to-ex-bengal-chief-secretary-101622548379975.html
01-06-2021||India||Chhattisgarh police sees conspiracy behind continuing protests against CRPF camp||Fifteen days after three men were killed in an alleged exchange of fire between security personnel and suspected Maoists at the CRPF camp in Silger village, protests against the camp continue with villagers erecting a structure of rocks in the shape of a memorial pillar to honour the dead. The Chhattisgarh police has alleged Maoists’ hand behind the protest.In the meantime Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Tuesday formed a committee of public representatives, headed by Bastar’s MP Deepak Baij, to find facts about May 17 Silger firing and the subsequent protests. The committee also includes tribal leader Lakheshwar Baghel and it will report to the chief minister’s office after talking to the local people. Others on the committee include Sant Ram Devti Karma, Shishupal Sori, Anup Nag, Vikram Mandavi, Rahman Baijam and Chandan Kashyap.The villagers, however, threaten to stay put until the CRPF camp at Silger village is removed, however, police allege the protest is backed by Maoists and legal action against the 17 “outsiders” at the protest site is under consideration for their alleged role in fuelling the unrest.“Villagers in the area are being pressured by Maoists and their sympathisers to continue the protest against the security camp in Silger. ...Sukma and Bijapur district administration have issued numerous appeals... to end the protest...,” IG Bastar P Sunderaj said on Tuesday.Three people were killed on May 17 when security personnel opened fire on thousands of violent protestors including suspected Maoists on the fifth day of protests against the setting up of a CRPF camp in Bastar’s Silger village- a Maoist stronghold along the border of Sukma-Bijapur districts in Chhattisgarh. Villagers said they feared the presence of CRPF personnel in the camp would lead to harassment of innocent tribals.The villagers also claimed that the firing was unprovoked but the police said they retaliated to firing by armed Maoists, who had infiltrated the protesting crowd, and planned to set the CRPF camp on fire.Later, a magisterial enquiry was also ordered into the firing but it has not finalised its report yet.A few days back, the Communist Party of India (Maoists) Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee issued a statement in support of the protest against the CRPF camp and called for a strike on June 5. On May 29, the villagers claimed that a pregnant woman, Poonem Somli, 25, who was injured in the stampede during the firing on May 17, also died.The Bastar IG on Tuesday said that police have seized photos, video, documents, mobile call detail records indicating 17 persons, including 6 women, were instigating the villagers to violence on the behest of Maoists.“The main Maoist cadres operating in the area are Irpa Jagdish, Manila, Shankar, Deva and Vinod. We are gathering more evidence against the entire conspiracy behind the incident and will take appropriate legal action against those who are directly or indirectly supporting the banned CPI Maoist formations,” the IG added.Human rights activists in Bastar have asked for removal of the camp in support of the protestors’ demands.“What is needed is to break this stalemate democratically. It can be done if the government suspends functioning of this camp and... any new camps in the area during the Covid crisis. The Maoists too should... cease military action and concentrate on getting the population under their influence vaccinated. Let Corona times be peaceful times,” said Bela Bhatia, a human rights activist.Bhatia in her fact-finding report, which was released on May 27, claimed there was no evidence to support police claim that an armed group of 3,000 agitators, including Maoist cadres, took over the peaceful protests on May 17 and intended to burn down the CRPF camp, leaving the forces with no choice but to open fire.The security forces maintain that the Maoists were opposed to the CRPF camp, set up for construction of a key road, as it would lessen their influence in the area. Chhattisgarh government too issued a press release last week to say 28 camps of security forces had been set up in the Maoist-affected areas of Bastar in the last two years to support developmental works.“Since the progress of Bastar is being looked at as a hurdle by the Maoists, they are regressively opposing these camps. These camps are often ambushed. The Maoists even attempt to create misunderstanding among the native villagers and trick them to go against the security forces,” the release said.The government also claimed that the surge in the Maoist activity in Bastar was also due to lack of communication and dialogue between villagers and the district administration, which was being addressed by measures including these camps.Ravindra Chaubey, government spokesperson and a cabinet minister said it was pretty clear who was opposed to the CRPF camp and was behind the protest. “People need roads in that area and hence camps are established. For the development of people, roads are important and if needed more camps will be established,” Chaubey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-police-sees-conspiracy-behind-continuing-protests-against-crpf-camp-101622548378515.html

Many state government imposed strict curbs to check the spread of the infection when second wave of Covid-19 was at its peak.Now, as the number of daily cases have come down, there have been announcements from some chief ministers about removing a few restrictions and allowing limited activities.According to new guidelines announced by the Union health ministry, unlocking would depend on less then 5% positivity rate in the district being considered for opening up. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the positivity rate should remain below 5% for at least two weeks before an outbreak can be considered to be under control.The ministry guidelines further say that 70% of the vulnerable population - those above the age of 60 and 45 and above with comorbidities - must have received vaccination doses. The rules also call for community ownership of Covid-appropriate behaviour.India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh announced relaxation in Covid-19 curbs on Sunday. After chairing a review meeting, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that districts where less than 600 cases of the coronavirus disease are reported, can see shops opening for longer time.On Monday and Tuesday, the list of such districts were expanded to include nine more zones. The revised order came into effect from June 1.Similarly, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar announced on Twitter on Monday that some extra concessions will be made in the 'corona curfew' for business activities.As per the revised guidelines, which would come into effect from June 2, shops dealing in essential items like grocery, vegetables, dairy products, meat and fish, will be allowed to do business from 6am to 2pm.Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan too have announced relaxations from June 2. The unlock process began in national capital Delhi from May 31, with easing of restrictions on industrial units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-fresh-guidelines-for-district-wise-unlocking-govt-list-3-main-criteria-101622546781628.html

Though the interaction remained "inconclusive," Nishank said after the meeting that an "informed" and "collaborative" decision will be taken by June 1.

01-06-2021||India||Andhra CM says he hasn’t threatened or influenced any witnesses in CBI case against him||Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) president and Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday told a special court for Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) cases in Hyderabad that he had not threatened or influenced any witness directly or indirectly in the alleged disproportionate assets being probed by the CBI.“All the allegations made by the petitioner are baseless and do not warrant any consideration by the court,” he said in a 98-page counter-affidavit filed in the CBI court.The affidavit was filed by the chief minister in reply to a petition filed by rebel YSR Congress MP K Raghurama Krishnam Raju on April 29, seeking cancellation of the bail granted to the former in 2013.In the affidavit, CM Reddy asserted that he never violated the conditions imposed by the court nor did he, in any manner, threaten or influence any witness directly or indirectly.The CBI also filed a separate counter affidavit saying that it was leaving it to the court to decide on whether to continue or revoke the bail granted to CM Jagan. The court posted the case to June 14 for further hearing.The chief minister said the petition seeking his bail cancellation was purportedly filed by Raju in the capacity of a third party. “It was misconceived in law and not maintainable, as Raju was trying to bring in personal political issues and personal vendetta into criminal justice administration,” he said.He pointed out that the CBI, a central government agency, was investigating his case and Raju, being a third party, had no locus standi in seeking the cancellation of bail. He did not show any overwhelming circumstances to review the procedure of granting bail, he argued.“The Supreme Court has stated in several cases that any criminal process is between the state and the accused and no third party can intervene in such process,” he reminded.Jagan also pointed out that Raju had filed a false affidavit before the court stating that he had no questionable antecedents of whatsoever in nature. But the fact was that Raju was accused of two crimes registered by the CBI concerning fraudulent dealings with the banks and siphoning of over ₹900 crore.He pointed out that his party had already made an appeal to the Lok Sabha Speaker seeking disqualification of Raju from the Lok Sabha membership for various misdeeds and acts of misconduct.“Raju’s petition clearly shows he is seeking to use criminal justice machinery for personal abusive purposes,” he said and requested the court to dismiss the petition in the interest of justice.Raju told reporters in Delhi that the counter filed by Jagan in the CBI court lacked any substance. “The allegations levelled by him against me are all baseless. I am confident that the court will go by the merit of the arguments,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-cm-says-he-hasn-t-threatened-or-influenced-any-witnesses-in-cbi-case-against-him-101622545733642.html

Aaliyah was found dead, allegedly by suicide, in her one-room rented apartment on May 4.Teja Vishnu, president of Liberty Rebellion Organization in Visakhapatnam, which works for the rights of sexual minorities in India said Covid-related lockdowns have caused financial and mental trauma to the community.“Due to lockdowns, most of these people, who would otherwise be seen on trains, traffic signals, wedding parties, have been restricted to homes. While those who are living on their own are struggling to manage their rents and food, the ones staying with families have been under severe mental stress. They are constantly being bullied. When they stepped out during the day, they had a sense of community and would meet people like them but lockdowns have alienated them. Being stuck at home with people who judge them, they feel abandoned. This has led to suicidal tendencies among most of them,” Vishnu said.Hailing from West Bengal, Aaliyah was disowned by her family and moved to Jharkhand in 2010. “She managed for 10 years. She would get around three hundred rupees a day by begging in trains, but after trains were suspended last year, she starved for days,” Aaliyah’s friend Amarjeet, who is also a member of the community, said.Also Read | India’s tax burden shifted from boardrooms to petrol pumps during Covid-19Once the rail service was suspended, Aaliyah begged at traffic signals, but a complete lockdown meant she couldn’t even step out of her room, Amarjeet said. “All her savings were exhausted.

As if this wasn’t difficult enough for her, her mother called her up from Bengal and sought her help as her brothers had been rendered jobless.”“She called me up on April 28, saying there was no ration left and she had no money... I have been struggling to feed my own family, all I could offer was emotional support. On May 4, I got a call from her neighbour that she had died by suicide,” Amarjeet said.The financial constraints are being felt across the board, but the more vulnerable communities are the worst hit.Vaishnavi, a 28-year-old transperson from Vijaywada in Andhra Pradesh worked in the private sector but was laid off during the first Covid wave last year, forcing her to return home from Bengaluru. “Though both my brothers would still taunt me for the way I talked, I was used to it since childhood so it didn’t affect me much. But things deteriorated once my father died of Covid in March this year,” she said.Since her father died without leaving a will, her brothers started pressuring her to move cities, Vaishnavi said. “They wanted me to go away so that they could get dad’s property transferred in their own name. When I protested, they threw me out of the house.”Vaishnavi approached the police which did not register her complaint but tried to broker peace between her and her brothers. “They let me in again. But they still harass me. I have been to the police thrice but every time they just offer a compromise which doesn’t even last for a day,” she said.“My [fear is that my] brothers will kill me for the property, and I will be counted as another suicide by a transgender person,” she added.She said she has nowhere to go and she could afford to stay on her own when she had a job. “At a time when companies are laying off more people, who would offer me a job,” she said.Hyderabad-based transgender rights activist Rachna Mudraboyina said that in absence of family and social support, a large number of transpersons have been living isolated from society. “People hesitate to even give us accommodation and now even if they do, they charge us double the normal rate. It is because of who we are. Since many of our people have been sharing rooms, how do you isolate someone who contracts Covid?” she said.Mudraboyina offered the instance of a recent case when a transperson’s condition deteriorated after contracting Covid. “We took him to the hospital, but he could not make it. We had collected ₹10,000 for his treatment. His family cremated him only after we gave them that money,” she said.Ashwini, another transgender person from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand, recounts how she had no money to get home which is two hundred kilometres from Asansol, West Bengal.Also Read | Grief, suffering, financial distress—how the second wave devastated households“I had no money to buy my ticket so I sat on a train to go back to my home. Once the train started moving, two railway police constables asked me for my ticket. The train was largely empty, and I told them that I did not have enough money to purchase the ticket. They started abusing me,” Ashwini said. She alleges that they told her she could travel for free in exchange for sex.While the Centre announced a ₹1,500 one-time subsistence support for members of the community on May 23, it mandated that the beneficiary’s identifying documents should indicate that they are a transgender person.“They have long been abandoned by their families. Most of them don’t even have Aadhar cards or any other document. Those who do, have been identified as males or females. They are not in touch with their families or someone in their states who can help them to get it changed. The conditions set by government for Rs1,500 will make most of them ineligible for the support,” Vishnu pointed out. They further said that the amount should be increased, and made a monthly aid, at least till the crisis lasts.Vicky, a Mumbai-based transperson said that for members of the community who are HIV+ regular medication is costly. She said the government should provide free medicines to all transgender people at their door step. “While the government is giving some medicines free of cost and a few NGOs also do that, a transperson suffering from HIV or diabetes is scared to go to hospital for medicines as hospitals are hubs of infections and they are already vulnerable,” Vicky said.She said that getting medical help is also a problem for the community as “we are seen through a different lens by doctors as well as patients. While many of us are gasping for breath, other patients and their attendants judge us,” she said. There should be separate quarantine centres for them and hospitals should also have dedicated rooms for them, she said.She added that there should be a documentation drive where members of her community can go and get their documents updated so that they can avail of the government schemes.Aruna from Vizag, another transgender person, said his family got him married to a woman. “While my spouse has been very cooperative, it is difficult to survive...we have a child now. I cannot even think about gender reassignment surgery when I don’t have enough to feed my baby,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-pushes-transgender-community-to-brink-of-poverty-101622543153876.html
01-06-2021||India||Grief, suffering, financial distress—how the second wave devastated households||Anupam Sharma (48) hasn’t had the time to process the grief of losing her sister Alpana Sharma and brother-in-law Kamal Kumar to Covid-19. Her primary worry, at the moment, is how she would find the resources to repay their relatives for loans accrued during the process of treatment of her loved ones. While Anupam Sharma is working with a private university, her sister’s family lost all sources of income during the pandemic.“The total expenses are in the range of ₹7-8 lakh. My sister’s family lived in rented accommodation and had rented a shop to run an apparel store, which mostly stayed shut during the lockdown. Whatever little savings they had were exhausted. They do not have any assets that can be used to repay the loan. We are struggling and don’t know how we will support my nephew’s education,” she said.Her nephew, Ekansh (18), was aiming to become a physiotherapist after his graduation. However, with the death of his parents within a span of two weeks last month, the teenager is planning to drop out of college.“How can I continue my education when we are struggling to pay the loans? We had to borrow money from various relatives and acquaintances for the treatment of my parents, especially my mother who had undergone a kidney transplant and developed complications after contracting Covid-19. We had to mortgage my mother and aunt’s jewellery to foot the hospital bill,” he said.Also Read | Sustaining and scaling up the response to Covid is key to saving livesThe story of Anupam and Ekansh is likely to resonate with many families, who have been ravaged by the second wave of the pandemic and have lost all their savings in trying to save their loved ones.Amid the second wave of the pandemic in the country — the fourth in Delhi — between the end of April and middle of May, patients and their families struggled with shortages — of beds, oxygen support, medicines. And at each step, costs escalated, with implications for household savings and indebtedness.Savings exhausted, families in financial trouble Dildar Singh, a 38-year-old businessman from Delhi who recently lost his uncle to Covid-19, and his family are now in dire financial straits. He fears that the private hospital, where his uncle was admitted, may take legal action if his family fails to clear the outstanding dues of ₹22 lakh.“My uncle was into social work and did not earn a lot. He was dependent on his brothers and had medical insurance of around ₹7.5 lakh. We thought that his health insurance would cover his medical treatment but the hospital charged ₹22 lakh. When we couldn’t pay the amount, the hospital refused to release the body,” he said.“Eventually, the hospital made me sign an undertaking while releasing the body on May 15, which states we would have to pay the amount within two weeks. We are now worried if there will be any legal action in the matter,” said Singh.According to a State Bank of India research report published on May 17, health expenditure could rise by 11% in the family consumption budget amid the pandemic. “We believe health expenditure will rise significantly because of the pandemic…Based on current trends, if 30% of the infected people get hospitalised and amongst them, 30% opt for private hospital and taking a conservative ₹1.5 lakh as the cost of entire treatment (including medicines, hospitalisation charges, PPE kit, etc) total expenditure of hospitalisation comes around ₹35,000 crore because of increased consumption of health services,” the report said.The report also pointed out the loss of income during the pandemic will affect health expenditure. This was reiterated by several families HT spoke to who said that the lockdown had already depleted the savings of the families. The burden of medical bills is just making matters worse.Minal Janai (20) is a third-year engineering student from Nagpur. Her father, a private cab driver who had already witnessed huge financial losses amid the pandemic, suffered from an infection in his lungs due to Covid-19. She has been running pillar to post for the past month to arrange funds for the treatment of her Covid-19-infected family.“We managed my mother and grandfather’s treatment by taking loans from relatives. But my father’s condition deteriorated at home. Since we did not get any beds in the government hospitals, we had to admit him to a private hospital. He is the sole breadwinner of our family. We have somehow arranged to pay ₹80,000 but still need ₹1,80,000 to pay the remaining amount to the hospital,” said Janai, who has also taken an educational loan.Several families lost their loved ones to Covid-19 even after spending their entire savings on hospital bills. Kumar Mangalam, a resident of Nashik, said his father Chitragupta Sinha, 58, who worked as a supporting actor in some movies, was suffering from Covid-19 pneumonia. “My family of five tested positive for Covid-19 early in May. After my father’s condition deteriorated, we admitted him to a private hospital after failing to get a bed in a government hospital. His condition started worsening after he got pneumonia and had to be put on a ventilator. The hospital was charging ₹90,000 to ₹1 lakh a day.”The family paid over ₹10 lakh to the hospital. “We could hardly raise ₹35,000 through online fundraisers. My father succumbed to the infection on May 20,” said Mangalam, who works in a private company in Ahmedabad.The government response Amid the unprecedented surge in cases, social media platforms were flooded with desperate pleas for help to find vacant hospital beds, ventilators, oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, and medicines such as remdesivir. While there are many citizens who have stepped up to help, some exploited the situation. People ended up paying amounts as high as ₹50,000 to ₹2 lakh for oxygen concentrators, and ₹10,000 to ₹50,000 for a vial of Remdesivir.This forced several states across the country to take several measures to put caps on health services. For instance, in Maharashtra, according to the government guidelines, it is mandatory for the private Covid-19 hospitals to bill Covid-19 patients as per the government’s fixed rates. In Uttar Pradesh, government officials said they too had issued guidelines capping prices of various health services and medicines related to Covid-19 – such as Covid-19 beds (different prices for ventilator and non-ventilator beds), tests, scans, ambulance, medicines, etc.The Delhi government, over the past month, has streamlined the availability and costs of a number of essential medical items ranging from oxygen to medicines. On May 25, the Delhi government capped the charge of transportation of oxygen cylinders, while mandating that such cylinders would have to be sold only at MRP. Similarly, the government also fixed the rates for hearse services provided for deceased Covid-19 patients. The treatment cost in private hospitals was capped in June last year itself, government officials said.Delhi Police also launched a crackdown against those involved in black marketing of Covid-19 resources. So far, Delhi police have arrested 366 people on charges of black marketing and cheating people by charging inflated prices and registered 600 cases in this regard.The systemic deficiencies Experts, meanwhile, say strict measures should be taken to implement these orders. Malini Aisola, who is associated with the Campaign for Dignified and Affordable Healthcare and works on public health advocacy, said that proper grievance redressal mechanisms have to be put into place and checks have to be introduced for implementation. One of these ways could be regular audits of Covid-19 bills, she said.“For instance, in Delhi’s case, the current order does not specify which authority the patients can approach with their complaints, the manner in which they can file, the process that will be followed by relevant authorities to investigate the complaints, and the timeframe within which the complaints have to be addressed. Emphasis should be on swift redressal of grievances to the extent possible and the government may appoint empowered government officials to help patients to resolve issues in real-time in respect of overcharging and non-compliance with the orders, and the consequences of it,” she said.Rama V Baru, a professor at the Centre of Social Medicine and Community Health at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said that despite scientists predicting a second wave, the Centre did not coordinate with the state governments. “Basically there was no planning. There was no effort to rein in the private sector in terms of price capping and ensuring that standard treatment protocols were given and followed. Indiscriminate and irrational use of CT scans, drugs, plasma therapy added to the fear and expenditure.” she said.Sonali Vaid, a public health professional in Delhi, said there have been several instances when people ended up paying “catastrophic health expenditure” pushing families into poverty.“In normal times, people who can’t afford private hospitals can go to public health care services. But during a crisis, people do not have any choice. When the system is saturated, people will have to go wherever they get the beds. In such a situation, when people cannot exercise choice between whether they go to a public or a private facility, there should be some financial protection,” she said.As the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic is expected, Baru said that “revamping of vaccination” should be done on priority. “We need centralised procurement and distribution of vaccines with fixed prices. This will prevent the severity of illness and deaths...We have to learn from the tsunami of the second wave. The public sector facilities that have been created must not be closed down. Standard treatment guidelines must be put in place and price capping of all commodities that are required for treatment,” she added.Vaid said that there is a need for “universal health coverage” to address the issue. “None should face financial hardships to access good quality healthcare — whether it’s the private or the public sector. We need to push for a better quality public health care system so that not only the poor but even middle and upper-class people can comfortably walk into government hospitals and get the care they need,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/grief-suffering-financial-distress-how-the-second-wave-devastated-households-101622542854505.html

"Ideally, 2DG should be prescribed as early as possible by doctors for moderate to severe COVID patients for a maximum duration of up to 10 days," DRDO said.Patients of uncontrolled diabetes, severe cardiac problem, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe hepatic and renal impairment have not been studied yet with 2-DG, and hence caution should be exercised, DRDO said. It added that 2-DG should not be given to pregnant and lactating women and patients below 18 years.Also read | DRDO's anti-Covid drug priced at ₹990/ sachet; Centre, states to get discounts"Patients and attendants are advised to request the hospital to contact Dr Reddy's lab Hyderabad for medicine supply at email: 2DG@drreddys.com," the organisation said in a tweet.The 2DG medicine can be given to Covid-19 patients under the care and prescription of doctors.

For all queries regarding #2DG, please write to 2DG@drreddys.com pic.twitter.com/x19ayBoToGThe oral drug 2-DG, developed in collaboration with Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL), was approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on May 8 as an adjunct therapy – one that supplements regular treatment – for Covid-19. On May 18, defence minister Rajnath Singh launched DRDO’s 2-DG, calling it “a new ray of hope in these challenging times” even as experts called for more scientific data.Also read | DRDO lab develops Covid-19 antibody detection-based kit DipcovanThe 2-DG drug comes in powder form in the sachet and has to be dissolved in water. The drug works by accumulating in virus-infected cells and prevents virus growth by stopping viral synthesis and energy production. According to the Union home minister, the Covid-19 drug reportedly reduces a patient's average recovery time by two and a half days and oxygen demand by upto 40 per cent.2-DG has been used as a possible cancer therapy for decades as research has shown that it hampers cell growth by blocking cellular glucose supply, leading to its use as a tumour therapeutics. The hypothesis in its use in treating Covid-19 is that it could impair replication of Sars-Cov-2 by a similar mechanism of action. It has still not been approved for regular cancer therapy.Dr Reddy's Laboratories (DRL) has said that DRDO’s anti-Covid-19 drug will be sold at  ₹990 per sachet that it will provide the medicine to Centre and state government at a discounted price.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-issues-directions-for-use-of-2-dg-its-drug-for-covid-19-patients-101622540560596.html

01-06-2021||India||La Niña phase ends, neutral conditions likely to support good rains in India||The 2020-2021 La Niña event has ended and neutral conditions (neither El Niño nor La Niña) are now likely to prevail over the tropical Pacific in the next few months, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Tuesday.In India, this would mean conditions are favourable for a normal monsoon and normal temperatures. “We generally associate neutral ENSO conditions with a normal monsoon in India. Most ENSO neutral years have brought us normal monsoon in past years,” explained M Mohapatra, director general, IMD. Earlier on Tuesday, IMD in its second stage long range monsoon forecast said the country is likely to be normal at 101% of long period average.El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Niña is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters. Also Read | Monsoon likely to be normal across the country: IMDAir temperatures globally are expected to be above average between June and August, especially in the northern hemisphere, WMO said in its statement. There is a 78% chance of neutral conditions in the tropical Pacific until July, decreasing to 55% by August-October, and with more uncertainty for the rest of the calendar year, according to WMO’s El Niño/La Niña Update.“La Niña has a temporary global cooling effect, which is typically strongest in the second year of the event. This means that 2021 has got off to a relatively cool start – by recent standards. This should not lull us into a false sense of security that there is a pause in climate change,” said WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas.“Carbon dioxide concentrations remain at record high levels and so will continue to drive global warming. According to new predictions issued by WMO, there is a 90% likelihood of at least one year between 2021-2025 becoming the warmest on record. This would dislodge 2016 – a strong El Niño year - from the top ranking,” added Taalas.The end of La Niña and widespread above average sea-surface temperatures because of global warming mean that air temperatures over land are forecast to be warmer than average from June to August 2021 over almost the whole northern hemisphere, in particular over the central western part of North America, the far northern part of Asia, part of central Asia, and far eastern Asia, the Arabian Peninsula and the northern Caribbean. Exception to recording above normal temperatures is likely in north-western Europe, south Asia, and the northern part of South America, extending into the southern Caribbean, according to the Global Seasonal Climate Update. This also means India may record moderate temperatures during the ENSO neutral phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/la-nin-a-phase-ends-neutral-conditions-likely-to-support-good-rains-in-india-101622540033506.html
01-06-2021||India||UP BJP holds review meeting, deputy CM says will win 300 seats in 2022||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national general secretary (organization) BL Santosh met senior party leaders of Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday as part of two-day review exercise on functioning of the party. The meeting holds significance as the state is set to witness elections next year.Santhosh earlier met deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, and labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya. He is scheduled to meet ministers of state later in the day."We will win 300 seats in 2022 polls," Keshav Prasad Maurya said after the meeting.On Monday, Santhosh, along with Union minister Radha Mohan Singh, had met ministers and key functionaries before holding a dinner meeting with chief minister Yogi Adityanath at the latter's official residence in state capital Lucknow.He reached the BJP's state headquarters in Lucknow on Monday. He was accompanied by Uttar Pradesh BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh, his party colleagues JPS Rathore and Govind Narayan Shukla, and minister Mahendra Singh.Shukla said that during his visit, Santhosh and state BJP leaders will also review the helpdesk started during the Covid-19 pandemic and other programmes.The Uttar Pradesh government is giving relaxation in the restrictions imposed in 75 districts of the state where the number of active cases of Covid-19 are below 600. On Tuesday, three more districts were added to the list of zones where curbs have been eased.With this, the number of districts in Uttar Pradesh which are free from 'corona curfew' rose to 64.However, there will be no relaxation in Meerut, Lucknow, Saharanpur, Varanasi, Ghaziabad, Gorakhpur, Muzaffarnagar, Bareilly, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bulandshahr and Jhansi districts where active cases are over 600.Uttar Pradesh is due to go Assembly elections in early 2022.

01-06-2021||India||It is not just WhatsApp. Digital media rules face multiple legal challenges||The Central government’s social media and intermediary guidelines, which came into effect on May 25, were challenged by the messaging platform WhatsApp last week over privacy concerns with regard to mandatory traceability requirements that the company says represents a “dangerous invasion of users privacy”.But that isn’t the first time the highly contested rules have been taken to court.The new guidelines that direct companies such Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook to regulate content, appoint officers who will be liable for compliance, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification have been challenged in six other instances ever since they were notified on February 25 by the Union government.While two petitions have been moved in Kerala high court (HC) against the guidelines, three others are in front of the Delhi HC, aside from WhatsApp’s latest challenge, contesting part II and III of the guidelines. The last petition has been filed in front of the Karnataka HC, by a Kannada news portal against the rules as they refer to digital news media platforms.Also Read | Twitter will have to comply with new IT rules: HCThe guidelines also cover over the top platforms (OTT) such as Netflix, Amazon and Hotstar, which will have to implement a rigorous three-tier self-regulatory mechanism, with the apex body being headed by an official from the information and broadcasting ministry.Twitter is at loggerheads with the central government over compliance with the new social media guidelines. It is yet to share details of its compliance officer with the ministry. Twitter last Thursday raised concerns regarding “intimidation tactics by the police” and with the “core elements” of the new social media and intermediary guidelines, prompting a strong response from the government which called the remarks an “attempt to dictate its terms”.WhatsApp, although it has shared details of its compliance officer, sued the Union electronics and technology ministry over the new rules in Delhi HC last Wednesday.As the impasse between the government and some of the social media companies continues, HT reviewed all the other petitions which have been filed and the concerns raised.LiveLaw Media Private Limited and others vs Union of India and others With the ambit of the government’s takedown powers extended to cover news media, LiveLaw, an online legal reporting website, with the help of digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation on March 9 moved the Kerala HC, stating that the new rules impose an “unconstitutional three-tier complaints and adjudication structure” that is arbitrary and violated the rule of law and the separation of powers.“Part III of the impugned Rules impermissibly extends the scope of the IT Act to publishers of online news, current affairs, and online curated content, and is thus ultra vires the parent statute, which does not contemplate the regulation of Digital News Media,” the petition states. “In substance, Part III imposes an unconstitutional three-tiered complaints-and- adjudication structure upon publishers, which makes the executive both the complainant and the judge on vital free speech questions involving blocking and take down of online material. This is both arbitrary and violates the rule of law and separation of powers, especially since there is no provision for the aggrieved publishers to appeal against the decision of the Inter-Departmental Committee consisting only of members of the executive, constituted under Rule.”The writ petition further added that the regulation of news media is beyond the scope of section 69(A) or section 79 of the IT Act, and the regulatory mechanism constitutes an “unreasonable restriction to free speech”.“The Intermediaries Rules 2021 violate Article 19(1)(a) and they cannot be justified as reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2) (i) Part II unreasonably restricts the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution,” the petition argued. It sought that the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 be declared illegal, as it is unjust, unfair, manifestly arbitrary, for colourable exercise of power and also contrary to the basic structure of the Constitution.On March 10, the Kerala HC issued a notice to the Centre, directing it to not take any “coercive actions against the Petitioner for non-compliance of Part III of the Rules”. It also ordered a limited stay on the implementation of the guidelines. The matter has since been adjourned.Foundation for Independent Journalism and others vs Union of India and anotherAnother petition against the rules was moved by the Foundation for Independent Journalism on March 6 in the Delhi HC. The Foundation challenged the new rules stating that they represented “overreach by way of subordinate legislation” and imposition of government oversight with the stipulation of “vague conditions”.“The present Petition challenges the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (“IT Rules, 2021” or “Impugned Rules”) as being ultra vires the Information Technology Act, 2000 (“parent Act”), in as much as they set up a classification of ‘publishers of news and current affairs content’ (“digital news portals”) as part of ‘digital media’, and seek to regulate these news portals under Part III of the Rules (“Impugned Part”) by imposing Government oversight and a ‘Code of Ethics’, which stipulates such vague conditions as ‘good taste’, ‘decency’ etc. - matters nowhere within the contemplation of the parent Act,” the plea states.“The Petitioners bring out wholly digital news and current affairs publications and are therefore directly affected by this overreach by way of subordinate legislation. The Petitioners’ digital news portals publish news and views, as distinct from curated content. The present Petition challenges the IT Rules, 2021 only in so far as they affect digital news portals, and is not with reference to ‘publishers of online curated content’, i.e., OTT media platforms or any other entities sought to be regulated by the Impugned Rules,” it adds.The petitioners sought that the rules be declared void and inoperative in so far as they apply to publishers of news and current affairs content.The HC directed the Centre to file a counter-affidavit in the case.Quint Digital Media Limited and another vs Union of India and anotherThe third organisation to move the court against the new rules was online news media website, The Quint, which on March 16, filed a petition in the Delhi HC saying that the rules were unconstitutional and went beyond the ambit of the IT Act.“Although the Journalistic Norms under the Press Council Act have been incorporated, the rationale of self-regulation, that is, that the State should be kept out, and that such supervision be merely recommendatory, has been flouted by the Rules,” states the petition. “Other democratic countries like the UK and Australia class online news with print news, to be self-regulated, free of State control.”The petition sought that part III of the Act that governs the rules be struck down as it vests “draconian powers” with the state.“Creating a differential classification by way of subordinate legislation, when not contemplated by the parent IT Act is an overreach by itself and this has been done to specifically target digital news portals, by subjecting them to an unprecedented regulatory burden and State interference, which no other form of news publication is subject to,” the petitions states. “This overreach is aggravated by a virtual legislation by reference, inasmuch as the Rules incorporate the Journalistic Norms under the Press Council Act, the Programme Code under the Cable TV Act, and vest draconian powers and control in the State.”The matter is pending before the court.Sanjay Kumar Singh vs Union of India and othersAdvocate Sanjay Kumar Singh has also challenged the new rules for being far too disproportionate and against the doctrine of parliamentary democracy as they were not vetted by the legislative body and introduced as a subordinate legislation.“It is hard to imagine that mere tweets on Twitter or posts on other social media platform can pose any worthwhile threat to matters of integrity, security or sovereignty of India. The rules as they have been framed are far too disproportionate to any threat capable of materialising to security, integrity or sovereignty of India from tweets on Twitter or posts on other social media platforms,” states the petition.The petition further added that the rules seem to be “far too hastily and casually drafted which is untenable especially when it deals with a matter of such paramount importance as freedom of speech and expression to a democracy”.The matter is pending before the Delhi HC.Truth Pro Foundation of India vs Union of India and othersThe Foundation, a non-profit company that runs Pratidhvani — an independent Kannada news portal, has moved the Karnataka HC against the contentious rules stating that they introduce new concepts and regulations and legislate on the conduct of entities beyond the purview of the parent Act.“The present Petition challenges the… [IT Rules, 2021] as being ultra vires the new Information Technology Act, 2000… in as much as they set up a classification of ‘publishers of news and current affairs content’ (“digital news portals”) as part of ‘digital media’, and seek to regulate these news portals under Part III of the Rules… by imposing Government oversight and a ‘Code of Ethics’, which stipulates such vague conditions as ‘good taste’, ‘decency’, etc. – matter nowhere within the contemplation of the parent Act,” the petition states.It has sought a stay on the implementation of the guidelines in the “interest of justice and equity”.Praveen Arimbrathodiyil vs Union of India WP(C) 9647/2021An open-source programmer Praveen Arimbrathodiyil moved the Kerala HC against the guidelines on April 10, with legal assistance from Software Freedom Law Centre, India. The petition challenges the guidelines on the grounds that they “place unreasonable restrictions on users in expressing themselves online, thus impacting their right to free speech and expression and fundamental right to privacy”.“The Writ Petition argues that the IT Rules, 2021 are vague, exceed the bounds of delegated legislation, place unreasonable restrictions on the exercise of #freespeech & expression, and violate the right to carry out an occupation, trade or business,” SFLC posted on Twitter. “The Petition also stresses upon the impact of the Intermediary Rules, 2021 upon FOSS entities. The Intermediary rules, 2021 fail to draw an intelligible differentia between not-for-profit FOSS communities and for profit proprietary companies.”The petition further argues that the rules prescribe technology-based solutions such as automated tools which would “bring in inherent societal biases and prejudices leading to more problems than it intends to solve”.The matter is pending before the Kerala HC.The government’s responseThe government has defended the new policy regime.Union minister for electronics and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad said, on May 27, that the new social media and intermediary guidelines were designed to empower citizens and prevent the “abuse and misuse” social media.“The new Rules require the social media companies to set up an India based grievance redressal officer, compliance officer and nodal officer so that millions of users of social media who have a grievance get a forum for its redressal,” Prasad posted on Koo, the app which has come up as the Indian alternative to Twitter.The ministry further stated that WhatsApp’s challenge to the rules were a “clear act of defiance”, and Twitter’s refusal to comply was a way of “dictating terms to the world’s largest democracy”. The government has repeatedly asserted that the rules provide a “light touch” mechanism to regulate the virtual space, with a focus on self regulation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-is-not-just-whatsapp-digital-media-rules-face-multiple-legal-challenges-101622539613451.html
01-06-2021||India||Verghese Kurien: Know all about the man and the movement on World Milk Day||World Milk Day has been observed on the first day of June every year since 2001 by countries around the globe. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a United Nations body, commemorates this day to celebrate the contribution of dairy farmers and to recognise the importance of milk as a global food. The theme of this year is 'sustainability in the dairy sector with messages around the environment, nutrition, and socio-economic'.Any conversation around milk cannot ignore the contribution of Verghese Kurien, aptly named 'the milkman of India', and the 'Father of the White Revolution'. Every year on World Milk Day, Indians remember Kurien for his contribution.Who was Verghese Kurien and what did he do?In the late 1940s, after Independence, India was largely a milk deficient country where people survived on imports from abroad. That is before a man named Verghese Kurien arrived at the country’s only experimental creamery in Gujarat's Anand. Kurien had studied abroad on a government scholarship and had been deputed to the Anand plant as a dairy officer for five years. Indians were heavily reliant on imported milk powders from abroad as a popular belief during that time was that buffalo milk was unsuitable for producing any dairy products, be it skimmed milk, condensed milk, or cheese. The dairy industry was extremely euro-centric and Europe, unlike India, had a sufficient supply of cow milk. Indian dairy farmers were reliant on buffalo milk.Kurien wrote in his memoirs that the supposed impossibility of converting buffalo milk into powder was propagated by the west, which wanted other nations, like India, to continue to import its milk powder. However, Kurien with the help of his friend HM Dalaya, a dairy engineer, was able to turn buffalo milk into powder and condensed milk, and later to cheese, helping India compete against brands like Nestle and Glaxo. Through converting buffalo milk into powder Kurien was also able to solve the issue of milk wastage during flush seasons.Cutting the middlemanKurien’s stint at Anand also ushered in the elimination of the middleman as local dairy farmers were able to sell directly to consumers through the formation of dairy co-operatives. The first dairy cooperatives in Anand were formed in the early 1940s, and one of their leaders asked Kurien to help them expand which led to the formation of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, popularly known as Amul, whose mascot the Amul Girl, has been delighting and educating Indians on socio-economic and political events of the country.National Dairy Development BoardIn 1965, the government created the National Dairy Development Board to expand Anand’s cooperative model across the country. Kurien was the board’s founding chairperson. This came to be known as ‘Operation Flood’ and ‘White Revolution’ for it turned India from a milk deficient country to a sufficient one and on July 18, Amul’s turnover surpassed Rs. 52,000 crore.Kurien passed away on September 9, 2012, at the age of 90. He was born a Christian but remained a life-long atheist, and was cremated as per his wishes, according to his daughter Nirmala Kurien. The brand created by the man and his movement endured, and Amul girl continues to serve a taste of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/verghese-kurien-know-all-about-the-man-and-the-movement-on-world-milk-day-101622538471943.html

She was forced to sit with his body on a road in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior for hours until she somehow got in touch with Ramesh Khushwaha, a member of Project Arth, which has been helping people who cannot afford cremations, using the cell phone of a stranger. Khushwaha rushed to the location and had the body sent to the nearest cremation ground for last rites.Project Arth is an initiative launched by Enactus IIT Delhi, the student chapter of Enactus, an international organisation of student, academics, and business leaders, in New Delhi, Gwalior and Rajkot. It seeks to reduce deforestation by replacing wood used in cremations with material made of cow dung, wood dust, and crop stubble.The surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths triggered a shortage of wood needed for cremations.Also Read | India’s tax burden shifted from boardrooms to petrol pumps during Covid-19Project Arth said it sponsored over 200 cremations of the poor and unclaimed bodies. “Outside Delhi, we helped the poor and needy directly and in Delhi, we collaborated with crematoriums. We provided the cow dung logs to the six crematoriums in New Delhi free of cost,” said Ayush Sultania, the head of Project Arth.In Delhi, Project Arth has collaborated with Seemapuri, Green Park, Basant Gaon, Shahpur Jat, Haiderpur, and Chirag Dilli crematoriums.Jitender Singh Shunty, the founder of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Sewa Dal (SBSSD) that has been helping with cremations, said they used the material provided by Project Arth for the last rites in May. “They have given us three tonnes of cow dung logs free of cost which we use regularly. It reduces pollution and saves trees. It is a great initiative.”Sultania said crematoriums in Delhi were cremating about 250 bodies daily at one point and each body requires about 300kg of wood. “Delhi gets its wood from Uttar Pradesh and as a result, Uttar Pradesh’s forest cover is decreasing. Therefore, there is a need for an alternative fuel which is not only renewable but also minimises pollution,” said Sultania. “Cow dung logs not only minimise deforestation but also reduce carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide emission by 20%,” added Sultania, citing the research conducted by Project Arth.Sultania said they have conducted the last rites of many abandoned bodies of the elderly, who died of Covid, and street dwellers. “Within a month we aim to increase the number of machines manufacturing cow dung logs, develop better infrastructure at gaushalas and set up storage facilities. We are planning to provide 1,000 sponsored dignified cremations in Delhi,” said Sultania.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/student-body-helps-poor-conduct-last-rites-of-kin-with-eco-friendly-material-101622538713233.html
01-06-2021||India||Centre issues show-cause notice to former West Bengal chief secretary||The Centre has issued a show-cause notice to former West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay and is likely to initiate disciplinary proceedings against him for defying the order asking him to report to Delhi on Monday, an official familiar with the matter said.“Suitable action is being contemplated by the department against the official for defying the DoPT [department of personnel and training] order,” said the official, requesting anonymity.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee appointed Bandopadhyay as her chief adviser after allowing him to retire on his last working day on Monday while attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his transfer.Bandyopadhyay, a 1987-batch Indian Administrative Officer, was granted a three-month extension but he declined it. The Centre last week recalled him hours after Banerjee skipped a scheduled meeting on Cyclone Yaas with Modi.Also Read | Mamata uses Sholay dialogue to attack Centre, urge other CMs to uniteIn a second letter to Bandopadhyay, DoPT cited the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954, to recall the officer to the Centre. It asked the state government to relieve the officer with immediate effect with “directions to report to the DoPT by 10am on June 1”. HT has seen the letter dated May 31.According to the rules, an officer on the rolls of a state may be deputed to the Centre or another state or a Public Sector Undertaking with the concurrence of the concerned state. “In case of any disagreement, the matter shall be decided by the central government and the state government or state governments concerned shall give effect to the decision of the central government,” say the rules.On May 31, Banerjee wrote to Modi over the “unilateral order” to release Bandopadhyay on the day of his superannuation. “The unilateral order comes without any prior consultation with the government of West Bengal, without any volition/option of the officer, without meeting any of the pre-conditions of the Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 and other applicable laws under reference. The unilateral order/directive is legally untenable, historically unprecedented and wholly unconstitutional,” she wrote.“The government of Bengal cannot release, and is not releasing, its Chief Secretary at this critical hour, on the basis of our understanding that the earlier order of extension, issued after lawful consultation in accordance with applicable laws, remains operational and valid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dopt-issues-show-cause-notice-to-former-bengal-cs-101622538173476.html

In a statement, the company said at this stage, no definitive terms have been finalised and hence it cannot comment further.The statement came amid reports that Cipla was seeking fast-track approvals to bring Moderna’s single-dose Covid-19 booster vaccine into India expeditiously, and that it has requested the government for indemnification and exemptions from price capping, bridging trials and basic customs duty. It did not name the vaccine it planned to import.Also Read | US disease experts warn of more damage if Covid origin not foundNews agency Press Trust of India on Monday reported that Cipla is close to committing over $ one billion as advance to the US major for the import of close to 50 million doses.A government official confirmed the development while refusing to share more details of the planned deal. “The matter is being examined, and nothing has been decided as yet. The import as part of the deal, which if at all comes through, will happen only next year as their supply book is already packed for this year,” the official said, requesting anonymity.VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, last week said the government was in talks with Pfizer after the company indicated that it had vaccine doses available. The government experts were examining the company’s request for providing indemnity against serious adverse effects following immunisation.

The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah made the remark while hearing a consumer dispute case, which was wrapped up by the court in March but a fresh application was filed in the same matter.As soon as the case came up for hearing, justice Chandrachud observed that the final order had already been issued in terms of what the petitioner wanted, but he chose to come back with a trivial issue. “You are here now only because you want to vet some documents before you deposit the rest of the money for the house you have been allotted. What is this? This is how the Supreme Court is being made dysfunctional,” he said.Also Read | SC questions govt on its Covid-19 vaccination policyJustice Chandrachud added that the judges in the top court have not been able to spend enough time on serious matters because of the deluge of unimportant matters.“Yesterday, I had to finalise an order in the suo motu (on its own motion) matter on Covid-19 that I could not do because I had to read up the files for today’s hearings. And 90% of the cases were frivolous,” he rued.“We as an institution must not spend our time dealing with frivolous matters. This wastes the time of the court and suggests that we have a lot of time. Serious matters must be given time,” said the judge.As on May 1, the top court had as many as 67,898 pending cases, out of which more than 49,000 cases are fresh ones that were still to be considered for admission.

The government had, in April last week, diverted all the liquid oxygen meant for non-medical purposes and manufacturing industry for medical use as the number of Covid cases was rising and several states reported a shortage of oxygen to treat critically-ill coronavirus disease patients. The only sectors exempted at that time were defence, ampoule- and vial-making industry, and pharmaceuticals. Also Read | HC slams drug department’s clean chit to GambhirThe MHA has now exempted more industries for use of liquid oxygen to include continuous process industries/ plants such as furnaces, refineries, steel, aluminium, copper processing plants, etc; infrastructure projects and plants; Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); exporters of manufacturing sector requiring oxygen for production, and food processing units. In its order, the ministry said that “the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) may allow usage of liquid oxygen to the above-mentioned industries/ projects/ units on a temporary basis subject to ensuring an adequate supply of liquid medical oxygen to hospitals and other medical purposes as per demands of states/ Union Territories as well as adequate supply to industries/sectors such as ampoules and vials, pharmaceuticals, manufacturing of oxygen cylinders and PSA plants, neutral glass tubing and defence forces.” The industries had approached the DPIIT in this regard.

The 20-km Budhni-Barkheda railway track passes through the sanctuary.Pradeep Tripathi, the sanctuary’s field director, said the food attracted monkeys and other herbivores to the railway track and they, in turn, drove the big cats there. He added the food was dumped at around eight spots, where the track is very narrow and passes between mountains, and the animals ended up getting trapped and crushed under trains. “This is one of the major reasons behind the death of animals,” said Tripathi, who was among the officers, who prepared the report.Tripathi said some of the big cats were hit by trains around Gadariya stream, where they would go to have water, near the railway track. “...we are resolving this issue...” Tripathi said the other animals killed near the track include 90 monkeys, deer, and other herbivores over the last five years. He said this year a leopard and a sub-adult tiger died on the track.Principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Alok Kumar said they have written to the railways many times to stop the dumping of leftover food and food packets on the track, but nothing has been done about it. “We sought appointment of guards to check the dumping of food, especially at night so that action could be taken against the pantry car employees. The railways appointed a guard who worked for just two to three days,” he said. “We have suggested mitigation measures to railways to resolve this issue.”Bhopal divisional railway manager Uday Borwankar said they have rules for dumping leftover foods from pantry cars and their employees have to follow the rules. “ ...big cats have been hit by trains, but it is happening due to the design of the track.” He added they are making a bridge for animals, which will be the first of its kind. “Through the bridge, we will connect the mountains and animals will not need to come down to cross the track. [We are] working on this project. We are also putting fencing to stop animals from passing through vulnerable accident points.’Wildlife activist Ajay Dubey said that there are proper guidelines for railway tracks passing from a forest area, but both the railways and forest department have failed to follow them. “Blaming leftover food for deaths of animals is a non-serious observation of the forest department,” said Dubey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-forest-dept-blames-food-dumping-by-trains-for-deaths-of-12-big-cats-101622530732895.html

Assembly elections are due to be held in the BJP-ruled Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Manipur; and Punjab (Congress) next year.A functionary, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called the meeting a “routine affair” as the top leadership, which includes the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, meets at least once a month. The meeting in person, the functionary said, had been postponed because of the pandemic.Also Read | For PM Modi, the seven-year itchA second functionary said apart from discussing preparations the Sangh’s outfits will require to make for the relief works, the RSS leadership is also expected to reflect on issues such as post-poll violence in West Bengal and the fallout of the pandemic on the economy and employment.“The meeting will largely take stock of what is expected from the Sangh in terms of seva [relief works]. However, since the issue of targeted violence in West Bengal is of concern that is also likely to be on the agenda. There is a likelihood of discussing and conveying to the relevant authorities [government] what expectations there are vis-à-vis economic revival and scaling up the scope of social welfare schemes,” said the second functionary, requesting anonymity.The Sangh distances itself from electoral politics, but through coordination meetings with the government conveys to it the sentiments on the ground. There is speculation that the Sangh is particularly concerned about the developments in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh. Former RSS general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi and his successor Dattatreya Hosable have had a string of meetings with the state leaders.“Joshi... was in UP [Uttar Pradesh] to attend a Disha Pujan, and he met the local functionaries there. Dattaji too was stationed in Lucknow before his elevation to the post of general secretary, so he is also aware of the dynamics of the place and meetings were apolitical. The focus was largely on the current situation that is grim and what needs to be done to mitigate the problems,” said a third person, who did not want to be named.RSS has expressed concern over the Covid crisis but has largely thrown its weight behind the government. On Many 15, Bhagwat said the government and the people misread the situation after the first Covid-19 wave and resulted in the lowering of the guard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3day-rss-meet-this-week-to-discuss-road-map-for-possible-covid-19-third-wave-101622528212753.html

01-06-2021||India||Relook at Centre-Bengal government row over chief secretary’s transfer||The Mamata Banerjee government and the Centre have been at loggerheads over the sudden transfer order of former Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay to Delhi. The matter got complicated further after Mamata asked the top bureaucrat to stay put and shot letters to the Centre, following which Alapan, who attained superannuation age in May and had received a three-month extension, was given a go-ahead to retire by the Bengal government.The ongoing episode has raised certain questions on the rules surrounding the transfer of a senior official.What happens when an officer doesn't report to the DoPT?The officer concerned might be issued a showcause notice by the personnel ministry. A decision is taken on the basis of his response, and the matter regarding the official’s pension is decided only after the issues have been resolved.There are provisions as per the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969 applicable to IAS officers for penalties that can be imposed in case the Centre decides to pursue the matter. The penalties can range from censure, withholding of promotion, withholding increments among others. A major repercussion might even be compulsory retirement and removal from service of the officer.Controversy surrounding the latest orderThere have been cases in the past where the willingness of the officer and/or the state government is sought, which makes this order unusual, especially because neither party was keen on the transfer. Further, the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) granted the extension to the officer. The manner of its reversal, that too within a week, has created a flutter.Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee refused to relieve the officer and wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to rescind the May 28 order, which is yet to be cancelled. Meanwhile, Mamata announced that Bandyopadhyay has retired on Monday and appointed him as an advisor for three years, even as he was again asked to report to DoPT on Tuesday.What experts sayFormer IAS officer EAS Sarma told news agency PTI, “The IAS (Cadre) Rules no doubt empower the Centre to recall IAS officers from the state but such a recall should be based on justifiable grounds and for upholding the public interest. Even while taking such a decision, the Centre is required to hold prior consultation with the state and, in the event of disagreement, the Centre should cite the extraordinary circumstances that justify such a recall."Even otherwise, the relationship between the Centre and the States should be one of cooperation, not confrontation, he added.What the rule statesRule 6 (1) of IAS (Cadre) Rules, 1954 mentions that all officers of IAS are allocated cadre which are state or group of states and Union territories. "A cadre officer may, with the concurrence of the state governments and the Centre, be deputed for service under the central government or another state government or under a company, association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not, which is wholly or substantially owned or controlled by the central government or by another state government," Rule 6 (1) says."Provided that in case of any disagreement, the matter shall be decided by the central government and the state government or state governments concerned shall give effect to the decision of the central government," it says.However, officials said that Rule 6(1) is vague and that there exists a grey area in it as it doesn't make consultation with the state government mandatory and leave it open to interpretation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/relook-at-centre-bengal-government-row-over-chief-secretary-s-transfer-101622523549206.html

The protest was called by the Federation Of Resident Doctors’ Associations – an umbrella organisation for various associations – that has over 20,000 members across government hospitals in Delhi itself. The doctors will continue their routine work wearing a black ribbon to register their protest and services will not be hampered at any of the hospitals. “We would like to say that the protest is not against ayurveda, but against Baba Ramdev and his statements about allopathic doctors,” said Dr Manish Kumar, president of the resident doctors’ association of Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung hospital.

The controversy started after two videos of Ramdev went viral where he is seen calling allopathy a “stupid science” as lakhs died despite getting allopathic treatment for Covid-19. He also said that 10,000 allopathic doctors had died despite being vaccinated. The IMA clarified that the country lost 753 doctors during the first wave of the pandemic when vaccines weren’t available and 513 so far during the second wave of the pandemic. “None in the first wave could receive the vaccine and the majority who had died in the second wave also could not take their vaccine for various reasons,” the letter said. The IMA filed a police complaint, sent a ₹1,000 crore defamation notice, and a letter to the Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The health minister rapped Ramdev for his comments in a letter, following which the yoga guru had issued an apology. However, he followed it up with a set of 25 questions about allopathy, asking why it not have cure for diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart conditions. Later, he also claimed that he did not need a vaccine against Covid-19 as he had dual protection of yoga and ayurveda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/resident-doctors-begin-black-ribbon-protest-against-ramdev-for-comments-on-allopathy-101622523652515.html

01-06-2021||India||Row over move to allot school land in Bhubaneswar to IAS officers’ association||The move to build a transit house for Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers in Odisha on land belonging to a government high school in Bhubaneswar has made the school’s alumni and parents urge chief minister Naveen Patnaik to intervene, said people aware of the matter.Odisha’s general administration department has moved files for allotment of 1.5 acre land out of the 2.458 acre plot belonging to Unit 6 Government Boys High School in Bhubaneswar for construction of IAS officer transit house on the ground that it was “unutilised”. The 1.5 acre of land identified for IAS officers association is located in two different but contiguous plots allotted to the school several decades ago as homestead land in revenue records.Odisha Abhibhabak Mahasangh, a leading parents’ body and the alumni association of Unit 6 Boys High School has written to CM Naveen Patnaik, alleging the allotment of the school land to a private body like the IAS officers’ association was not just arbitrary, but smacked of high-handedness.“... The school land is reserved for a playground. Such attempts to convert school land for a transit house for a private body like [the] IAS Officers Association is not just illegal, but defeats the purpose of the Mo school Abhiyan started by the government,” said Basudev Bhatt of Odisha Abhibhavak Mahasangha.Girija Shankar Das, an alumni of the school alleged the bid to take away school’s plot has been afoot since January this year when Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) erected a wall on the land.“We were given to understand that the Capital Hospital would have some facility there. So we filed a case against the BDA in the court... in January this year and obtained a stay order. However, we were dismayed after learning that the land is being eyed for an IAS officer’s transit house,” said Das.Das said in a recent meeting, the school’s alumni association had collected over ₹25 lakh for constructing a volleyball court, badminton court and a basketball court in the school playground under Mo School Abhiyan, started by the state government.Among the school’s alumni are former IPS officer and the current chairman of Odisha Public Service Commission Satyajit Mohanty, principal of SCB Medical College Datteswar Hota, senior BJD leader Sanjay Dasburma and leading realtor Tapan Mohanty.“While on the one hand the state government is pushing for improvement of school infrastructure, on the other, it is going ahead with such a plan to allocate land out of a school. It is very unfortunate that the state government is doing this to a school that is also included in the smart school programme,” Das said.An IAS officer said the transit house was totally unnecessary as the existing Special Circuit House and the State Guest House were sufficient to house any bureaucrat who was transferred to Bhubaneswar. “Instead of setting examples in the time of the pandemic, it’s despicable that we are taking land from a school for building a transit house. The association is a private body and can easily buy private land from its own money. Why should the state government allocate land to it that actually belongs to a school,” the officer asked, refusing to be named.GA department secretary Sanjeev Chopra did not respond to the allegations. When asked for a comment, secretary of Odisha IAS Officers Association, Vishal Dev, said: “The land is not yet allotted. So, where is the question of using 1.5 acres of land?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-move-to-allot-school-land-in-bhubaneswar-to-ias-officers-association-101622521192534.html

A total of 22 districts have their positivity rate at less than 10%, but some of them account for over 40%, with respect to oxygen-bed occupancy.As a result, only 20 districts would be able to implement the relaxations.The state government has also identified 10 cities with over 1 million population where the high positivity and oxygen bed occupancy of the district will not affect their status vis-a-vis the relaxations. For instance, even if Pune district’s positivity rate is more than 10%, Pune city can still roll out the relaxations if it fits the criteria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-covid-lockdown-curbs-relaxed-in-20-districts-from-today-101622520052280.html
01-06-2021||India||India records 127,510 new Covid-19 cases, lowest in nearly two months||India reported 127,510 new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the past 24 hours, as displayed by the Union health ministry dashboard at 8am on Tuesday. The death toll, too, was pushed to 331,895 with 2,795 new fatalities recorded in this duration, it showed. The country's cumulative Covid-19 infection tally now stands at 28,175,044. The overall scenario depicts a declining trend in the number of new Covid-19 cases daily, with recoveries continuing to outnumber the single-day rise for nearly three weeks now.India last recorded 126,789 Covid-19 cases on April 8, after which the numbers kept climbing steadily, even reaching a peak of over four lakh daily coronavirus cases in the second week of May. But ever since then, the single-day spike has been showing a declining trend, leading to projections that suggest the second wave of the coronavirus is subsiding. This is also the first time in 36 days that India's daily Covid-19 death toll has fallen below the 3,000-mark.Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe country's recovery rate has been improving as well, with 25,947,629 people cured of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, as per the coronavirus dashboard at the Union ministry of health and family welfare. India's Covid-19 recovery rate now resides at 91.60%, it showed. Although there are 1,895,520 currently active cases in the country, the number has been declining steadily on par with India's ebbing second wave of the coronavirus.The health ministry said on Monday said that the decrease in the nationwide Covid-19 tally is directly linked to a sharp fall in cases seen in regions like Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat. To break the chain of transmission and gain control over the disease spread, states like Bihar, Uttarakhand, and Chhattisgarh have extended their respective coronavirus-induced lockdowns/curfews, even though there will be some relaxation in curbs.Also Read: Second wave left 1 crore Indians jobless; 97% households' incomes dipped: ReportOn the global front, the World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday announced a new nomenclature for the Covid-19 variants that were previously — and somewhat uncomfortably — known either by their technical letter-number codes or by the countries in which they first appeared.WHO said it will now refer to the most worrisome coronavirus disease variants — known as “variants of concern” — by letters in the Greek alphabet. This has been done in a bid to strike a fair and more comprehensible balance in the Covid-19 reportage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-127-510-new-covid-19-cases-lowest-in-nearly-two-months-101622515381247.html

The CM, too, had slammed Sidhu, calling his outbursts “total indiscipline” and suggesting that he might be leaving for the AAP.In the latest episode of contention, former Punjab minister Sidhu on May 21 challenged him to prove that he had not met any leader of another party for switching sides.Also read: Congress battle lines deepen in Punjab amid louder rumblings“Prove one meeting that I have had with another party’s leader.

The nationwide protests are aimed at condemning the “derogatory and distasteful statements” made by the Yoga guru, Forda said, adding that the protests will take place "without hampering the patient care..."At the root of the controversy is a video that started doing the rounds on social media, in which Ramdev calls modern allopathy "a stupid and failed science". He later raised 25 questions on the efficacy of modern medicine. He also questioned the effectiveness of the vaccines against the coronavirus disease while claiming that the fatalities caused by Covid-19 showed that allopathy was not 100% effective.Also Read | 'Nothing against Ramdev but': IMA chief on withdrawing complaint against yoga guruForda said that unless Ramdev issues an unconditional open public apology, action against him under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, will be taken, according to news agency ANI.The Doctors Association Jammu (DAJ) expressed solidarity with Forda and said it will also join the protest. In an appeal to Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha the DAJ said necessary action should be taken against Ramdev for his "irresponsible and despicable public statements".The India Medical Association (IMA), too, strongly objected to Ramdev's statement and demanded that Union health minister Harsh Vardhan initiate action against him.

The Yoga guru said he respected allopathic doctors and only disapproved of the big pharmaceutical companies.“I respect allopathy and allopathic doctors; their contribution is immense to the medical field and society. Our drive is not against them but those who sell medicines at exorbitant prices and treat patients as revenue-earning customers. We are against those who unnecessarily recommend medical tests, operations and costly drugs while the patient doesn’t require them at all,” said Ramdev.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctors-association-to-observe-black-day-to-protest-ramdev-s-remarks-today-101622509133120.html
01-06-2021||India||IMD to issue second stage monsoon forecast today||A detailed monsoon forecast with zone wise rainfall probability will be issued by India Meteorological Department (IMD) today.Apart from giving monsoon forecasts for the four geographical regions, IMD will also update its monsoon forecast for the season, covering June, July, August and September. It will issue a forecast for June separately.The monsoon for this year is likely to bring the normal amount of rainfall at 98% of the long period average (LPA), IMD had said on April 16.Monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to take place around June 3, IMD said on Monday, adding that monsoon presently was passing across Sri Lanka and had been there for two days. As per the latest meteorological indications, the southwesterly winds could strengthen further gradually from June 1, resulting in an increase in rainfall activity over Kerala.Also Read | Will never manipulate data to justify forecasts: IMD on monsoon forecast lapse“It has been raining over Kerala but we cannot announce monsoon onset until all parameters are met. They are likely to be met in the next couple of days. We are monitoring continuously,” M Mohapatra, director general, IMD said.“Monsoon is now over Sri Lanka. The very next point will be Kerala. Rains had reduced over Kerala in the past two days. Westerly winds are picking up now,” added DS Pai, scientist and head of climate research services at IMD Pune.A cyclonic circulation over eastcentral Arabian Sea off Karnataka coast is likely to meander over the region during the next four days. Southwesterly winds are also likely to strengthen during the next 2-3 days. Under the influence of these and other favourable meteorological conditions; scattered to fairly widespread rainfall or thunderstorm activity is likely over Karnataka and Kerala and Mahe and isolated to scattered rainfall or thunderstorm over the remaining parts of south peninsular India during the next 4-5 days.Moderate to extremely heavy rain was recorded over many parts of east and northeast India, including east Garo Hills (32cm); Bhalukpong (13 cm); Lakhimpur (11cm); Jamshedpur (17cm); Pollur, Tikrikilla, Dhemaji, and Kolar (9cm); Barpeta (8cm); Uthiramerur, Dharamsthla, Vellore, Matheran, Shanti Niketan, Itanagar, Cherrapunji, Kokrajhar, and Nongstoin (7cm) each. Extremely heavy rainfall (over 20cm) was recorded at isolated places over Assam and Meghalaya; heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over Jharkhand and Arunachal Pradesh and heavy rainfall over Gangetic West Bengal, north Konkan, coastal and south interior Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal.The monsoon season, which begins on June 1, is crucial for summer crops and brings about 70% of India’s annual rainfall. It is critical to the country’s agriculture, which is one of the mainstays of its economy. Monsoon spurs farm produce and improves rural spending. It is the lifeline for about 60% of the country’s net cultivated area, which has no irrigation. It impacts inflation, jobs, and industrial demand. Good farm output keeps a lid on food inflation. Ample harvests raise rural incomes and help inject demand into the economy.Nearly half of India’s population depends on a farm-based livelihood. The rains also replenish 89 nationally important reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-to-issue-second-stage-monsoon-forecast-today-101622516392119.html

Jaishankar on May 27 under the aegis of US-India Business Council and US-India Strategic Partnership Forum in Washington, even as they acknowledged the magnitude of India’s second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, most of their questions and concerns focused on the role of India in global economic recovery.Free from partisan views and knowledgeable about the actual ground situation, they looked beyond raw numbers and assessed the economic outlook after the second wave. Most agreed with the minister’s view that since lockdowns were local and intermittent and as supply chains were intact, its impact would be far less than last year.They took keen interest in the government’s efforts to vaccinate as many people as possible so as to get the economy back on track, according to diplomats who asked not to be named.Prominent among those who attended the meeting were: Ariel Mactavish, president, Respiratory Interventions Operating Unit, Medtronic Inc.; Ken Gilmartin, executive vice-president, Jacobs Engineering Group; Arvind Krishna, chairman and CEO, IBM; Raj Subramaniam, president and COO, FedEx; Julie Sweet, CEO, Accenture; and Seifi Ghasemi, chairman and CEO, Air Products.Also read: US business honchos express confidence in IndiaThe US CEOs spoke about similar American experiences last year. Many noted the logistics effort made by the Indian government, especially on oxygen supply. They highlighted that India had a key role as a global vaccine hub in restoring global economic confidence. Apart from its resident population, its large number of expatriates and services staff, including merchant shipping and airline crew were globally relevant. Many US firms also had large India-based staff whose health were central to their operations. The CEOs also believed that as the vaccine drive accelerated, connectivity and interaction between the two business communities will be fully restored.Till Sunday evening, India had fully vaccinated 44.4 million people and partly vaccinated 123.1 million—which means almost 18% of the eligible population of 940 million has been vaccinated. On Monday, the government told the Supreme Court that the country would vaccinate everyone in the age group by the end of December, something that will require a sharp acceleration to around 7.75 million doses administered a day for the rest of the year.Interestingly, many CEOs brought positive perspectives from their own company feedback on economic recovery. Experts have pointed out that while the onset of the second wave coincided with the economy’s return to normalcy, the fact that most states have ensured manufacturing and other business activities continued through localized curbs may mean a lower impact.RBI governor Shaktikanta Das on May 5 said the dent to aggregate demand on account of the second wave was moderate and disruptions in manufacturing were minimal compared to the first wave due to localized curbs. And most international and domestic forecasters expect the economy to still grow in excess of 10% in 2021-22.In fact, this was taken as such a given that the focus shifted to India hosting more supply chains to de-risk the global economy. In particular, the minister was quizzed in detail about PLI (performance-linked incentive) schemes to expand manufacturing. Many participants spoke about their plans to invest more in the coming year. There was strong interest in electronic manufacturing, digital, and health sectors.The mood in Washington political circles too was supportive, the diplomats added, with the Joe Biden administration assuring India of full support in medical equipment even as they sought to address New Delhi’s concerns over Indo-Pacific with the QUAD grouping now being placed on priority. As for China, it has been widely noted that the May 19 meeting between the foreign ministers of the US and Russia has resulted in a US-Russia summit on June 16 in Geneva, while the March 19 US-China meeting between foreign ministers and NSAs ended in a slanging match. India is a natural beneficiary of better ties between the US and Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/topusexecutives-agree-on-covid-19-2nd-wave-s-limited-impact-101622514665673.html
01-06-2021||India||Experts divided over park for lion, cheetah relocation||Cyclone Tauktae’s impact on Gujarat’s Gir national park, the country’s only home for lions in the wild, triggered a debate whether Madhya Pradesh’s Kuno Palpur wildlife reserve should take in some of the affected animals or go ahead with the planned relocation of cheetahs from Africa, conservation experts said on Monday.Most wildlife experts say Kuno should get lions from Gir as the habitat was originally developed for relocation of the big cats so that they could get a second home outside Gujarat, more so after the devastating Tauktae felled about 2.5 million trees in Gir. Though the Gujarat forest department said no lion died because of the cyclone, wildlife experts said Tauktae was a warning to governments that India needs a second home for the big cats.“You can relocate people to safer places before a cyclone comes. Not wildlife. You need a second home for them to ensure that the Asiatic lion species is not wiped out from the wild,” said a scientist from the Wildlife Institute of India, wishing not to be identified.The idea of finding a second home for lions was mooted in the early 1990s and the Madhya Pradesh government started developing Kuno as a second home for Asiatic lions. The Gujarat government refused to share lions with Madhya Pradesh, saying they were the pride of Gujarat.Environmental activists filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Gujarat government to provide lions to Kuno. The Gujarat government refused to give lions to Madhya Pradesh arguing that they were safe in Gir and the state would create a second home for them, if needed, within Gujarat.Lions did not get a second home even eight years after the Gujarat government told the Supreme Court this, despite almost 40% of the lion population in Gujarat living outside notified wildlife areas and being vulnerable to diseases from livestock. According to wildlife experts, 1,400sq km of Gir National Park has carrying capacity of about 250 or so lions and the park attained that level more than two decades ago.“It (the overpopulated Gir) has twofold implications,” said wildlife biologist Meena Venkatraman, who has worked in Gir for more than two decades. “First, for the animal himself, and second, for the people living around them.” The signs of these implications are visible.In September 2018, 27 lions in Gir died because of canine distemper virus (CDV) while 37 others had to be quarantined.Gujarat forest department data shows that lion deaths because of conflict with people are on the rise. As per information provided to the state assembly, 159 lions died in 2020 as compared to 154 in 2019 in and around Gir and about one-third of them were probably because of conflict with humans.Lions in a Hyderabad zoo contracting Covid-19 and Cyclone Tauktae revived the debate whether the animals need a new home. Wildlife biologist and conservation scientist Ravi Chellam said the possibility of the lion population getting wiped out because of a natural disaster is high though that of the cats in the wild contracting the virus from humans is “close to zero”.Also read: Experts fear biodiversity loss in Andaman, Nicobar IslandsIn the present circumstances, Kuno appears to be viable for translocation of lions as it was developed for them but it may not be readily available. A Supreme Court-appointed expert committee has decided to import cheetahs from South Africa in the green habitat, bordering Rajasthan’s Ranthambore tiger reserve. The central government earlier this month informed the Madhya Pradesh forest department that it could import eight cheetahs by November this year.“Since the beginning Kuno was developed to receive Asiatic lions and was never seen from cheetah perspective,” said Faiyaz Khudsar, a wildlife biologist.Those in favour of introduction of cheetahs such as MK Ranjitsinh said the project would help India in protecting some of its lost grasslands and create new wildlife habitats. Cheetahs were last spotted in India in the 1950s and Ranjitsinh first tried for their relocation from Iran in the 1970s. He was able to convince environment minister Jairam Ramesh in 2010 to get cheetahs and an expert committee headed by him was formed. The Supreme Court, however, imposed a stay on the project after wildlife conservationists approached the court.“...Conservation of cheetahs can help in conserving grasslands and protecting grassland species like the Great Indian Bustard that are now less than 200 in India. Kuno may not be perfect but it is a good option,” Ranjitsinh had said in 2020.Madhya Pradesh’ principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Alok Kumar, said, “We are leaving no stone unturned to develop Kuno as one of the best habitats for cheetahs. We have started construction of boundary wall and cutting thorny bushes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-divided-over-park-for-lion-cheetah-relocation-101622514215016.html

HC asks govts to pick whom to save first||Amid an acute shortage of Amphotericin-B, the only last-line drug used to treat mucormycosis, the Delhi high court on Monday asked the Centre and state government to put before it a policy on who should be given priority for the medicine to be saved — an elderly person or a young one.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said authorities will have to take the “cruel decision” of excluding certain age groups or classes till supplies of the drug are short.“We follow the practice of ‘Vasudev Kutumbakam’ which means the world is one family, but if there are two patients in a family who need the medicine and you have one dose, you have to chose one member... It is not an easy decision to take but this is a bullet you have to take,” the bench said, adding that the choice cannot be left to doctors.Citing an example, the bench said that if there are two patients who need the drug — one who is 80-years-old and another who is 35 — and there is only one dose of medicine, one will have to be excluded.Also read: At least 59 die of black fungus as fatalities outpace recoveries“If we have to make that cruel choice, we have to make it. We are faced with that situation. We will have to cross this bridge. Will you give it to the 80-year-old or to the 35-year-old who has two children to support?“Every life is important but we are trying to find a way forward. Every life is important, we are not for a moment saying someone’s life is not important or less important. But you have to take a decision. Every single life is important,” the bench said.The court asked the Union and Delhi governments to return on Tuesday with instructions on the matter, and said the decision can be taken only by the political leadership, in consultation with medical experts.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said they were following the Centre’s formula to allocate vials of the scarce antifungal, and said it will only change its system after the Centre does so.The central government standing counsel Kirtiman Singh said that for non-Central government-run hospitals, states have to take the decision and even states will know the patient load.To this, the bench said, “You have to prioritise.. You will have to make that list. You are making allocation from central pool.”Spokespersons from the Delhi government and the Centre did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cruel-decision-old-or-young-hc-asks-govts-to-pick-whom-to-save-first-101622512914462.html
01-06-2021||India||Twitter will have to comply with new IT rules: HC||The Delhi high court on Monday said that Twitter will have to comply with the Central government’s new rules for social media intermediaries since these have not been stayed by any court of law.“They (Twitter) have to follow it (rules), if it has not been stayed,” justice Rekha Palli said while issuing notice on a plea in which an advocate Amit Acharya said that the micro-blogging platform Twitter has not complied with the new information technology rules.The court gave three weeks to Twitter to respond to the plea which contended that the company has not followed the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Ethics Code) Rules 2021, enforceable from May 25.On Monday, senior advocate Sajjan Poovaya, for Twitter told the court that it has appointed a Grievance Redressal Officer, as required by the rules, on May 28, a stand which was disputed by Central government standing counsel Ripudaman Bhardwaj.Also read: Child rights body alleges Pocso breach on Twitter, lodges FIRThe Centre has said that only WhatsApp and Facebook have complied with the guideline of appointing three separate officers for the grievance redressal. The rules also seek to make social media companies more accountable and responsive to requests seeking the removal of posts.The court asked the counsel for Twitter to file the information on an affidavit and posted the matter for hearing on July 6.Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official spokesperson of the microblogging site said “As we have stated earlier, Twitter strives to comply with applicable law in India. We continue to be strictly guided by principles of transparency, a commitment to empowering every voice on the service, and protecting freedom of expression and privacy under the Indian law.”The Centre and Twitter have been at odds over the latter’s decision to label a tweet by a Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson as manipulated media.Last week, police visited the office of Twitter after its India head did not respond to a notice related to an investigation into this. The labelling was on a tweet showing parts of a campaign playbook (toolkit) allegedly created by the opposition Congress party to bad-mouth the government. The Congress claimed the document was forged, following which Twitter labelled the tweet manipulated media.Also last week, Twitter sought three more months to comply with the new rules.The court was hearing the plea filed by advocate Acharya who stated that the Information Technology Rules came into effect from February 25 and the Centre have three months to all social media companies, including Twitter, to comply with them.The petitioner contended that the three-month period ended on May 25, but till date no resident grievance officer has been appointed by Twitter to deal with complaints regarding tweets on its platform.In the plea, he claimed he came to know about the alleged non-compliance when he tried to lodge a complaint against some tweets.The petition has sought a direction to Twitter to appoint a resident grievance officer without further delay.

01-06-2021||India||Second wave left 1 crore Indians jobless; 97% households' incomes dipped: Report||Over 10 million Indians have lost their jobs because of the second wave of Covid-19, and around 97 per cent of households' incomes have declined since the beginning of the pandemic last year, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) chief executive Mahesh Vyas said on Monday.The unemployment rate measured by the think-tank is expected to come at 12 per cent at the end of May as against 8 per cent in April, Vyas told PTI, adding this signifies that about 10 million or 1 crore Indians have lost jobs in this period.Stating that the main reason for the job losses is "mainly the second wave" of Covid-19 infections, Vyas said, "As the economy opens up, part of the problem will be solved but not entirely."He explained that people who lose jobs find it hard to get employment, specifying that while the informal sector jobs come back quickly, the formal sector and better quality job opportunities take up to a year to come back.Unemployment rate had touched a record high of 23.5 per cent in May 2020 because of the national lockdown. Many experts opine that the second wave of infections has peaked and states will slowly start to ease the economic activity-impacting restrictions in a calibrated fashion.Vyas further said an unemployment rate of 3-4 per cent should be considered as "normal" for the Indian economy, hinting that the unemployment number will have to decline for longer before the situation improves.He said CMIE has completed a nation-wide survey of 1.75 lakh households in April which throws up worrying trends on income generation during the last one year -- which has witnessed two waves of the pandemic.Only 3 per cent of those polled said they have witnessed an increase in incomes, while 55 per cent said their incomes have declined, he said.An additional 42 per cent of the people said their incomes remained the same as that in the year-ago period."If we adjust for inflation, we find that 97 per cent of the households in the country have witnessed a decline in incomes during the pandemic," he pointed out.The labour participation rate, or the percentage of the working age population which is in the market, has come down to 40 per cent as of now from the pre-pandemic levels of 42.5 per cent, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-wave-left-1-crore-indians-jobless-97-households-incomes-dipped-report-101622507233717.html

01-06-2021||India||Covid-19 variants get new names: B.1.617.2 is now Delta||The Sars-Cov-2 variant first found in the UK will now be known as Alpha and the one sampled in India as Delta, according to a new nomenclature released by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday in an attempt to remove regional associations that experts have warned could lead to stigmatisation.The naming convention follows the Greek alphabet and the labelling is based on when these variants were designated as being of concern or under investigation.“They will not replace existing scientific names, but are aimed to help in public discussion of VOI/VOC,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, Covid-19 technical lead, WHO, in a tweet on Monday.Till now, these have most commonly been known by what is called the Pango lineage code: the one linked to the UK is called B.1.1.7 and the one linked to India is known as B.1.617.2. In common use, however, they have also been sometimes referred to the UK variant or the Indian variant, a practice that experts and officials have discouraged.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayIn a statement on May 12, the Union health ministry pointed out that the World Health Organization did not refer to the variant first found in the country as “Indian”, a day after WHO labelled it as a variant of concern. Later, on May 26, the Union government asked social media companies to scrub the words “Indian variant” from their services. In an advisory issued in 2015, the WHO cautioned against naming new infectious diseases in a manner that leads to negative effects on nations, economies and people.“In recent years, several new human infectious diseases have emerged. The use of names such as ‘swine flu’ and ‘Middle East Respiratory Syndrome’ has had unintended negative impacts... This may seem like a trivial issue to some, but disease names really do matter to the people who are directly affected. We’ve seen certain disease names provoke a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities, create unjustified barriers to travel, commerce and trade, and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals. This can have serious consequences for peoples’ lives and livelihoods,” the then assistant director-general for health security at WHO said.The variants B.1.351 (first sequenced in South Africa) and P.1 (first detected in Brazil) will be known as Beta and Gamma.At present, these four are the only variants of concern – the mutations seen in them appear to make the coronavirus more infective or more resistant to immunity triggered by a past infection or a vaccine. B.1.617.2, or the Delta variant, has shown signs of being more infective as well as more resistant.It is seen to have, at least partly, led to India’s devastating second wave of cases that began in the spring, and has now raised alarm in the UK, there government scientists see the early stages of a third wave of infections building in the country. Ravi Gupta of the University of Cambridge, who is a member of the UK government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, said although new cases were “relatively low” the B.1.617 variant had fuelled “exponential growth”, BBC reported.According to data on the global repository GISAID, the B.1.1.7 has spread the most around the world, found in over 700,000 samples sequenced across 137 countries since December. But B.1.617.2 is believed to now be spreading the quickest, spreading to over 50 countries in at least 9,320 samples over the past two months. Six more variants, at present under investigation, are also likely to be labelled under the new nomenclature. The first of these VUIs is the one found initially in US, California and has been known as B.1.427/B.1.429. This will be known as Epsilon. The latest of the VUIs included in the new naming conventions is the B.1.617.1 variant, which will be known as Kappa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-variants-get-new-names-b-1-617-2-is-now-delta-101622504583609.html
01-06-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The Indian economy expanded by 1.6% in the three months ended March 31, the fastest in a year, to end 2020-21 with an overall decline of 7.3%. This compares well with the 8% contraction of the year projected by the National Statistics Office.Much of the damage the economy suffered in 2020-21 was wrought in the first two quarters of the financial year. In Q1, the three months between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020, the economy contracted by 24.4%, the direct impact of a 68-day nationwide hard lockdown between March 25 and May 31. The federal government imposed this to slow the spread of the coronavirus disease, and strengthen health care and medical infrastructure to cope with the surge that, even then, was evident would follow. Even after May 31, restrictions on movement and activities were eased in phases, and returned to pre-pandemic levels only in the last quarter of the financial year (January-March).Also read: GDP shrinks 7.3% in FY21; Q4 growth 1.6%In Q2, July 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020, the economy contracted by 7.4%, the result of continuing restrictions. In Q3, October 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, GDP growth crossed over into positive territory and the economy expanded by 0.5%. Both the second and the third quarters saw pent-up buying – most people bought nothing but basics in the first quarter – and also benefited from the annual festive season (the period between September and December that sees sales of most consumer products increasing), although last year’s wasn’t as strong as such seasons usually are. The economy was expected to contract in the fourth quarter of the year, with the end of the festive season and the burning out of pent-up demand, but government spending and construction activity seem to have helped it grow in the fourth quarter too. Both the quarterly and the annual numbers bode well, although low private consumption numbers in the former are cause for concern, and there are two interesting things about the latest GDP number (the one for the three months ended March 31).One, it marks a turning point of sorts because the current quarter, as well as the three that follow, will see a beneficial base effect. Celebrations that can be expected to follow these numbers over the course of the year would do well to bear this in mind. For instance, the index of eight core industries for April was 126.7, which marks a 56% year-on-year jump over the previous year. But it was 149.2 in March, which means the index has actually declined 15.1% (which leads to...)Also read: SC questions govt on its Covid-19 vaccination policy...Two, given that the second wave emerged in mid-February, and likely peaked in early May, resulting in lockdowns through the second half of April, all of May, and, which may continue, at least in some parts of India, through the first half of June, the first quarter of the current financial year, 2021-22, is definitely not playing out to script. The Reserve Bank of India expects GDP growth to clock in at 10.5% for the entire year, which translates into 26.2% growth in the first quarter, 8.3% in the second, 5.4% in the third, and 6.2% in the fourth. It is now clear that the economy will definitely not grow by 26.2% in the first quarter (all high-frequency indicators point to this). It is also becoming clear that the effects of the bruising second wave of the pandemic, which is just beginning to ebb, will linger, perhaps well into the second quarter. And finally, even if vaccinations were to be accelerated to the 7.75 million shots a day that vaccinating everyone over the age of 18 years between now and December 31 entails – the government repeated this commitment in the Supreme Court on Monday – normal business will not resume before the beginning of the third quarter (October), and even that is an optimistic estimate.Interestingly, most economists, while cutting their estimates for 2021-22, still expect the Indian economy to expand at a low double-digit rate. The median of 11 estimates compiled by Bloomberg News came in at 10%, just marginally down from the 10.5% before the second wave. The economists argue that this is because of two reasons: one, the lockdowns this year were state-level ones that ensured manufacturing activities were not overly affected; two, the cost of the second wave is more human than economic.I disagree, and am not convinced the economy will expand by 10% without some serious intervention by the State.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101622502994093.html
01-06-2021||India||GDP shrinks 7.3% in FY21; Q4 growth 1.6%||The Indian economy contracted by 7.3% in the fiscal year 2020-21, according to the GDP statistics released by the National Statistical Office on May 31, the worst ever economic performance on record, but still better than expectations. The NSO put this number at 8% in its last release in February.The latest GDP numbers and provisional fiscal numbers suggest that the 2021-22 Budget presented on February 1 was conservative in its projections of the 2020-21 economic performance. Both the level of nominal GDP and Gross Tax Revenue are higher than what was projected in the Budget. The gross fiscal deficit of the government in 2020-21, as per the provisional estimates released by the Controller General of Accounts, is ₹18.21 lakh crore compared to the ₹18.48 lakh crore according to the revised estimates given in this year’s Budget. Which means it is 9.3% of GDP, not the expected 9.5%.Also read: US President looks to rebuild, expand legal immigrationThis relative improvement in 2020-21 GDP estimates is due to a better performance in the last quarter (January-March) of 2020-21 which saw GDP growth increase to 1.6%. GDP contracted by 24.4% and 7.4% in the first and second quarters of 2020-21, and grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.A fiscal push on capital spending and some green shoots in private spending seem to have played an important role in the faster than expected recovery in the quarter ending March 2021. To be sure, NSO has underlined the possibility of “implications on subsequent revision of these (GDP) estimates” as “the statutory timelines for filing the requisite financial returns of fourth quarter have been extended” due to the eruption of the second Covid-19 infections.That’s the good news.The bad news is that the second wave of Covid-19 infections might have led to a backsliding of the recovery seen in the March quarter. The index of eight core sector industries in the month of April 2021 fell to 126.7, the lowest since the 127.7 value of November 2020. This number was 149.2 in March. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI), which was 99.3 in the week ending February 21, fell to 60 by the week ending May 23. Large parts of the country are still under partial lockdown. Experts believe that the second wave of Covid-19 infections might have derailed the economic recovery seen in the quarter ending March and that the GDP numbers do not yet reflect the pain in the informal sector. A Bloomberg poll of economists has projected the median GDP growth for 2021-22 at 10%. RBI, in its Annual Report released on May 28, projected a GDP growth of 10.5% for the current fiscal year.An analysis of the Gross Value Added (GVA) data by sectors for the quarter ending March shows that construction (14.5%) and manufacturing (6.9%) saw the biggest sequential improvement in growth. The labour-intensive service sectors of trade, hotels, transport, communication and broadcasting services remained in contraction zone (2.3%) despite a significant improvement in mobility levels in the quarter. Agriculture grew at 3.1%, a moderation compared to the 4.5% growth seen in the quarter ending December 2020. Private final consumption expenditure came out of the contraction zone for the first time in 2020-21 in the quarter ending March 2021 with a growth of 2.7%. Government final consumption expenditure jumped by massive 28.3%. Gross Fixed Capital Formation, which measures investment , grew by 10.9%.“The better-than-expected growth print partly owes it to healthy corporate results in March quarter of FY21. We admit the situation is still in a flux, and it is too nascent to gauge the true impact of the second wave on macro variables. We believe that the impact is unlikely to be of the same magnitude as last year,” said Madhavi Arora, lead economist, Emkay Global Financial Services. But the numbers may have been overtaken by the second wave.Also read: US business honchos express confidence in India“The March quarter numbers have been rendered irrelevant because of the disruption due to the second wave of Covid-19 infections, as far as economic momentum is concerned. With most states extending lockdowns into June, the first quarter of 2020-21 will be disappointing”, said Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. “Also, NSO itself has flagged the possibility of revision on the last quarter’s numbers because extension of statutory filing deadlines could have introduced a favourable bias in the corporate sector performance statistics.” Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian admitted that momentum of economic recovery has been affected by the second wave and “continued monetary and fiscal policy support” are needed to boost growth.“Overall economic impact of the second wave is not likely to be very large” but “localised or statewide restrictions adopted to combat its spread, present some downside risk to growth” in the first quarter of 2021-22, he added. The wave has peaked, he pointed out, and “the pace of decline is as fast as the rise”. He, however, stressed on the need to enhance pace of vaccination coverage and strict observation of Covid-appropriate behaviour.Still, the impact could make itself felt in the overall GDP growth number for the year.“The combination of Covid’s second wave and the revised base effect may imply a lower GDP growth for the Indian economy for 2021-22, which may be in the range of 9-9.5%.” Indeed, as Alok Sheel, RBI chair professor in macroeconomics at Indian Council for Research in International Economic Relations (ICRIER) said, “the consensus number for this is now down to below 10% on account of the severity of the second wave of Covid 19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gdp-shrinks-7-3-in-fy21-q4-growth-16-101622502034709.html
01-06-2021||India||SC questions govt on its Covid-19 vaccination policy||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the central government to “smell the coffee” and modify its policy that requires states to pay more for Covid-19 vaccines, besides ensuring that the marginalised and rural population are not left out of the vaccination drive due to India’s digital divide.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the government, said the entire eligible population of the country would be vaccinated by the year-end.Resuming its hearing of the suo motu (on its own motion) case on handling of the second Covid-19 wave, the top court was emphatic that the Union government’s policy lacked a “vision” and it did not take into account several crucial aspects to tackle issues at present and in future.Also read| Close to committing $1 billion to Moderna for Covid-19 booster shot: CiplaThe bench, led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, remarked that “policy makers must have their ears to the ground” as it flagged several areas of concern, asking why states had to pay more than the Centre for the vaccine, and how the Centre planned to ensure people in rural areas could get the vaccine when registration on the CoWIN digital platform was mandatory. Appearing for the Centre, solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the court that the Centre expected to vaccinate the entire population of the country by the end of this year, as he also sought to justify the dual pricing of vaccines. About mandatory registration on CoWin, the SG said it was done in view of limited health infrastructure and to avoid overcrowding at centres.But the bench, which included justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, remained unimpressed with the submissions and regretted that the Centre did not seem to have paid heed to suggestions mooted by the court in its April 30 order on vaccine pricing and rural health care.“You smell the coffee and see what’s happening across the country and change your policies. It cannot be a day-to-day ad hoc response to as and when problems occur. Absent guidelines and absent policy, you will have ad hoc decisions. There has to be a clear-cut policy of decision making and a vision for the present and for the future, which is perhaps lacking today. We will like your policy to be amended,” it said. Asking the government to show a “little bit of flexibility”, the court said that it was not enough for the Centre to claim only it knew what was best for the people and that they must also remember that “our arms are strong enough to come down” if there was continued resistance to consider changes. “...Ability to recognise that we have gone wrong is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength. Our idea is to initiate a dialogue so that we can strengthen the arms of the nation,” said the bench, giving the government two weeks to come back with a detailed response. It emphasised that the Union government ought to negotiate globally and procure vaccines for the entire country “in a national crisis” rather than leaving states in the lurch.“What is the rationale behind this dual pricing policy? Centre procures at a certain price but does not want to tell the manufacturers at what price they should give it to states. If the Centre can justify its lower pricing due to block supply, why cannot it procure the vaccines for the states under the same rationale? Ultimately, you have to ensure everyone gets vaccinated at the same price for all sections,” it said.The bench added that the criterion of those aged above 45 years being the vulnerable class for Covid-19 has witnessed a change with many less than 45 losing their lives due to the virus in the second wave. “Can there be a justification for the Centre to now say that we will only take care of those who are above 45? We are aware that we don’t have time to enter the realm of policy making but your policy has to be logical and reasonable,” said the bench, asking the SG to get unequivocal instructions on the next date if the Centre was ready to act like a national body for procurement of vaccines.It further asked Mehta if it was realistically possible for all those in rural areas and the marginalised to register themselves on the CoWIN platform.Also read: 3 men bury Covid positive father’s body in field, probe ordered“What about the digital divide? You can keep saying Digital India, Digital India. Digital India is alright but can a poor migrant worker from Jharkhand or from Rajasthan get himself registered on CoWIN? Is that possible? How are you answering the digital divide? How are you going to ensure migrant workers can get themselves registered and get vaccinated?” it asked. While the SG said that walk-in registrations have begun in some circumstances, the bench pointed out there is no policy on record regarding this or to show how and why the Union government decided to usher in differential pricing of vaccines for the 18-45 age group.“You cannot say if you don’t register on CoWIN, we will not vaccinate you. Ground reality is that 70% of vaccination is only in urban areas. Vaccines are not reaching the rural areas. If there is a policy document, we want to see what is the policy in black and white. We don’t want to go by the affidavit to say it is evolving; it is dynamic, etc. We want to see what’s the rationale,” it told the SG. It added that no policy was carved in stone and that the government’s new policy had to meet the test of reasonableness and equality, apart from ensuring right to life that included right to public health.“You have to have a policy which is clear-cut, deal with all the issues and provide guidance to states and other institutions in terms of not only present but also in terms of the future. We will also request you to produce the policy document along with the file noting on it. So that we know what prompted you to change the previous policy. The only issue that we are seeing today is that of vaccination policy. The dialogue will continue. If you change the policy, well,” it said. The bench said it will issue an order on the proceedings but it was not released Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-questions-govt-on-its-covid-19-vaccination-policy-101622502614428.html

The apex child rights body has also filed an FIR, charging the social media giant for allegedly giving false information and violating the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.“There are many groups of paedophiles on Twitter as well as other content relating to child sexual abuse. There are also links to the dark web. NCPCR investigated and found that over 30 inappropriate websites could be accessed through Twitter,” said chairperson Priyank Kanoongo in a video statement.“We have written to the Centre requesting that children not be given access to Twitter until the platform is safe for them,” he added.HT reached out to the ministry for a reaction but didn’t get a response. Twitter, too, declined to comment on the matter.The US social media giant has been at loggerheads with the Indian government over compliance with the new social media guidelines. It is yet to share details of its compliance officer with the ministry.Last Thursday, Twitter raised concerns about “intimidation tactics by the police” and the “core elements” of the new social media and intermediary guidelines. This has prompted a strong response from the Centre, which called the remarks an “attempt to dictate its terms”.The exchange represents a snowballing controversy over new guidelines that direct companies such Twitter, WhatsApp, and Facebook to regulate content, appoint officers who will be liable for compliance, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/child-rights-body-alleges-pocso-breach-on-twitter-lodges-fir-101622500961490.html

01-06-2021||India||Firestorm over Mehul Choksi spills over to Dominica, PM Skerrit is new target||Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit on Monday came under a sharp attack from the Caribbean nation’s main opposition party over businessman Mehul Choksi, accusing the prime minister of being “part of a plot against the rule of law” to send the fugitive diamantaire to India.Lennox Linton, leader of the opposition in Dominica’s House of Assembly, also demanded a “full investigation” into the circumstances under which Choksi was brought to Dominica and into what he described as the “obvious collaboration between Dominica, Antigua and India” and the officials who instructed or influenced the police to facilitate the inhumane transfer of Mehul Choksi to Dominica.Indian-born Choksi mysteriously disappeared from Antigua and Barbuda, whose citizenship he holds, last Sunday, but was detained by Dominican police on Tuesday night on charges of illegally entering the island. The two islands are roughly 100 nautical miles apart.PM Skerrit is the second leader in the region to be targeted by the opposition over the tussle over Mehul Choksi. Antigua PM Gaston Browne has been severely criticised by the opposition who allege his government played a role in Choksi’s disappearance from the country. He has, on several occasions, suggested that Dominica shouldn’t send Choksi back to Antigua but deport him to India.Monday’s statement by Dominica’s lead opposition party accused PM Skerrit of playing along with Antigua PM.“We demand urgent remedial action to remove the stain from this unfortunate incident on the image of Dominica and restore our country’s reputation as a responsible member of the family of nations, diligently carrying out the rule of law responsibilities of international development,” Lennox Linton said.Choksi’s legal team has claimed that he was abducted from Antigua and taken to Dominica by Indian and Antiguan officials. On Monday, his lawyer Vijay Aggarwal suggested that Choksi may have been honey-trapped by a woman he had known for six months. Choksi had gone to her house when he was abducted and taken on a yacht to Dominica.The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court is currently hearing a petition on Choksi’s fate. The court will hear the matter on Wednesday when India is set to seek his deportation directly to New Delhi.UWP leader Linton’s statement on Monday demanded an immediate end to what it called “no law, no constitution” governance conduct that disgraces Dominica as a rogue element in the family of nations and endangers the rule of law foundation for the advancement of civility in the global community.“The presence of Indian born Antigua and Barbuda citizen Mehul Choksi in Dominica following allegations that he was kidnapped in Antigua, beaten, ferried to Dominica, and taken into the country against his will highlights once again the extent to which departments of government are involved in organized crime under the influence and/or direction of the regime of Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit,” he said.Asserting that Choksi’s citizenship issue is already pending in the High Court of Antigua and Barbuda, Linton said: “State actors under the leadership of the Prime Minister of Dominica appear to be part of plot against the rule of law protection guaranteed to citizens that is effectively undermining the judiciary in the jurisdiction of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court for the benefit of a foreign power.”The removal of Choksi from Antigua and Barbuda, (where according to Prime Minister Gaston Browne, he enjoys the constitutional privileges of citizenship) to Dominica, was intended to facilitate his transfer to India without having to wait on the outcome of the ongoing extradition proceedings scheduled for hearing in November 2021. To that extent, Dominica has been conscripted to unlawfully violate the constitutional rights of an Antiguan citizen for crass political purposes, the opposition leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dominicas-oppn-also-targets-its-pm-alleges-connivance-with-india-and-antigua-101622491322603.html

Such language (especially the part “... until further orders...” ) was never used in appointment of previous CBI directors, including Rishi Kumar Shukla and Alok Verma .The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) declined comment on the matter.“Neither in the SC directive nor the CVC act, it is mentioned that the two-year tenure can be altered. The SC judgment in Vineet Narain & Others vs Union of India was to insulate the CBI Director from any executive interference but this kind of language shows some ulterior motive,” Narain said. “This is contemptuous of the apex court’s decision and Hon’ble Chief Justice of India (N V Ramana) should take cognizance of the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/language-used-in-order-naming-jaiswal-as-cbi-chief-violates-sc-directive-activist-101622489869777.html

In the current scenario, a fresh sero survey can help the government decide when to ease restrictions on movement. “Quick rounds of sero surveys can be conducted to know the antibody prevalence that will help in opening up accordingly. I suspect that the positivity rate, which has gone down, is largely due to natural infection,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, professor, community medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.Experts also say that the fourth survey will be different from the other three surveys as apart from a sudden, massive surge, a section of the population has also been vaccinated in the past four months. “What we look for in a sero survey is the presence of antibodies against the virus, and at this stage the antibodies seen could be because of not only infection but also vaccination,” Dr Panda said.He also pointed out that among the infected are those who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and some who got seriously sick. “It will be a mixed kind that we will get this time, while earlier there was infection/disease transmission dynamics,” Panda said.Also read| Second wave left 1 crore Indians jobless; 97% households' incomes dipped: ReportBlood samples in a sero survey are tested for the presence of IgG (Immunoglobulin G) antibodies that determine a past infection due to the virus. Sero surveys are also important in determining whether the disease has entered the community transmission stage or not.ICMR’s National Institute of Epidemiology in Chennai has been the nodal agency for all past surveys and will most likely supervise the fourth one as well.The earlier sero surveys suggested that a significant size of the population was still susceptible to catching the viral infection, and India was far from achieving herd immunity. The first one was designed as a cross-sectional survey of adults aged 18 years or more from 21 states, where the districts were categorised into four strata according to the reported Covid-19 cases per million population.the second and third rounds, all other parameters were the same except for the age bracket — samples were taken from people aged 10 and above.The third sero survey, conducted between December 17, 2020, and January 8, 2021, found 21.4% of those aged 10 and above infected with the virus.In the second round, nearly one in 15 (6.6%) people above the age of 10 was found to be exposed to the virus till August 2020.The first survey conducted in May last year had found the infection rate to be 0.73% nationally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-plans-4th-nationwide-sero-survey-101622489809721.html

They had approached the court against the employer availing an exemption from the state government from the ongoing lockdown without complying with Covid-19 protocols, particularly social distancing.According to the workmen, the distancing norms cannot be maintained in the production procedure adopted by this employer, particularly in the assembly line, the court said in its orders on Monday.The workers did not turn up to work on Monday in protest. The employer, however, maintained that all precautionary steps are followed and was open to any surprise inspection.The court requested state advocate general R Shunmugasundaram to arrange for a senior official from the Directorate of Industrial Safety to visit the Sriperumbudur factory of Renault-Nissan by 10 am on June 1.“It is hoped that after the day off today, the workmen will resume their duties tomorrow, so that the inspection may be made and representatives of the workmen may interact with the concerned government official, along with the representatives of the management, to check the relevant parameters and arrive at some form of a solution,” the court said in its order. The official could also mediate between the management and the workers if required, the court said.The workers have suggested that social distancing norms can be followed between two cars in an assembly line by allowing three or four workmen to work on the vehicle at a time, instead of six or eight. They also suggested that a study that the management is undertaking to ensure that distancing norms are maintained at all times, should be completed expeditiously and corrective measures must be adopted, the court said.The court adjourned the case to June 4 hoping to hear an amicable solution and directed the employer to submit the number of workmen infected by Covid-19, how many are in the hospital and the ones getting treated at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-orders-inspection-of-renault-nissan-unit-over-covid-19-norms-compliance-101622489090277.html

With the death of 478 people -- 220 in private hospitals and 258 in government-run ones --the tally rose to 24,232. The total number of people testing positive till date increased to 20,96,516 and the number of active cases, including isolation, as on today remains at 3,01,781. The number of patients discharged today after treatment stands at 31,223, and the total recoveries rose to 17,70,503. Chennai accounted for 2,596 new cases, 3,990 recoveries and 91 fatalities. The metro's overall tally is 5,04,502 cases, with the active cases/those under treatment remaining at 33,922. The total recoveries in the city stood at 4,63,489 while the fatalities were 7,091. Coimbatore tops among the districts in reporting 3,488 new cases followed by Chennai 2,596, Erode 1,742, Tiruppur 1,373, Salem 1,157, Chengalpattu 1,138 and Tiruchirapalli 1,119. Deeply concerned over the non-replenishment of vaccine doses by the Centre, State Minister for Medical and Family Welfare Ma Subramanian claimed that the present stock would be used up inthe next two days. Tamil Nadu has only 5 lakh vaccines left, which will be enough for inoculation in the next two days, Subramanian told reporters today. The State was expected to receive 25 lakh vaccines from the Centre for vaccinating the 18-plus age group but got only 13 lakh doses, he said. Certain districts like Thanjavur and Tiruvarur have no vaccines, he said after inspecting the largest Covid care centre established at the Chennai Trade Centre with 864 beds. About 504 beds were added to the 360-bedded facility, with oxygen lines. In addition to 13 lakh doses, the State had earlier obtained 83 lakh doses from the Centre. So far about 87 lakh people have been vaccinated till Sunday and there was a wastage during the vaccination drive in the first coronavirus wave, he said. The Union government was informed about the current situation and that fresh stocks were expected, the Minister, who earlier inaugurated a Yoga and Naturopathy Covid care centre here, said. As on Monday, about 89,32,852 people were given both the Covishield and Covaxin shots, a release from the health department said. They include 12,85,159 in the 18 to 44 years age group and 32,23,935 people in the 45-60 age group besides 8,29,288 healthcare workers, 10,40,680 frontline workers and 25,53,790 senior citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-reports-27-936-new-covid-19-cases-active-caseload-remains-above-300000mark-101622486469056.html
01-06-2021||India||Vijayan writes to 11 states, seeks support on jabs||HT Correspondent  Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday wrote to all his non-BJP counterparts asking them to come together and put up a joint effort to get vaccines from the union government. The letter has been sent to 11 chief ministers of Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Delhi and Punjab.. “It is important that vaccine should be provided free of cost considering it as a public good, the access to which shall be denied to none due to lack of financial wherewithal,” his letter said. He said if the burden on vaccines is left entirely on states their fiscal situation will be affected. His letter assumes much significance in the light of the Supreme Court’s latest observation that there should be only one price for Covid-19 vaccines across the nation. Earlier, the Centre had proposed a three-tier price structure for vaccines. “It is learnt that the union government has taken a stand that the states should resort to their own measures to procure vaccines. The supply of the vaccines is scarce as compared to the demand for the same,” he said asking all his counterparts to jointly pursue the need of the hour. He said vaccine manufacturers were unwilling to enter into an agreement with states for procurement and that herd immunity will be effective only if a substantial chunk of the population is vaccinated. Vijayan also pointed out that the state had placed order for 10 million vaccines last month but it received only 8, 84,000 doses. After assuming power for the second time as chief minister he had sent at least four letters to PM Narendra Modi seeking more vaccines and oxygen. “When the nation is passing through the second surge, it is unfortunate the Centre is absolving itself of its bounder duty to provide adequate supply of vaccine. The impact of the second surge has been unprecedented, putting all of us in a state of alarm. Experts have warned about a third wave also. This necessitates our heightened preparation and vigil to meet that eventuality too,” he reminded his counterparts. Earlier, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh had written to the Prime Minister Modi requesting him to ensure that the Centre procures vaccines for all age groups and distribute it to the states. “We can pay the Centre for vaccination of 18-45 age group. But, instead of each state buying vaccines, the Centre should buy vaccines centrally and give to all states,” Gehlot had said in a letter to PM last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijayan-writes-to-11-states-seeks-support-on-jabs-101622487889659.html
01-06-2021||India||Vaccine stock left for just two days, waiting for allocation: TN govt||Tamil Nadu has vaccine stock remaining only for two more days, health officials told the media on Monday. The vaccination drive will be on hold unless the Centre either supplies 0.174 million doses pending in the May allocation or when the first consignment for June’s allocation arrives on the sixth. “We have directed officials in Chennai and other districts to complete administering of whatever vaccines are left. We will have to stop when there is zero stock, and we can only restart when we get the next supply,” health secretary J Radhakrishnan said. As of Monday morning, after wastage, Tamil Nadu had around 0.493 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines in hand. Out of this, 0.269 million doses are for the 18-45 age group, and 0.224 million doses are for those above 45 years. The state has informed the Centre of the shortage. “The Union government has allocated 2.043 million doses for May, and we have received 1.868 million doses,” Radhakrishnan said. “As of Monday, we are yet to receive a balance of 0.174 million doses from the allotment for May. We are not sure when it will reach Tamil Nadu, whether tomorrow or the day after. They (the Centre) have said that they will inform us in a couple of days. If we receive this soon, we will be able to continue vaccinating.”For June, the Union government on Monday informed the state that 4.258 million doses will be allocated. “The only catch in this is that the first consignment in this allotment will reach Tamil Nadu only by June 6. The next supply will reach by June 9,” Radhakrishnan said, adding that due to supply issues across the country, they can only make allotments step-by-step despite doubling the allocation for Tamil Nadu. Three lakh doses are expected to arrive on June 6.Tamil Nadu has received 9.618 million doses of vaccines to date, which were used to vaccinate 8.770 million people across age groups until May 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-stock-left-for-just-two-days-waiting-for-allocationtngovt-101622487715888.html

She also received the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar for her courage, and had a virtual interaction with Prime minister Narendra Modi on January 25.Kumari’s feat drew worldwide admiration, including a tweet from Ivanka Trump, daughter of then US president Donald Trump.She also signed a film titled, Aatmanirbhar, in which she will play herself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cycle-girl-jyoti-s-father-dies-of-cardiac-arrest-101622487715342.html
01-06-2021||India||‘No possibility’: AIADMK on Sasikala’s comeback, warns her of ‘retribution’||Chennai: A day after V K Sasikala’s audio clips leaked, signalling her intention of a political comeback, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (AIADMK) co-convener KP Munusamy suggested that Sasikala should keep away from the party for the sake of late J Jayalalithaa. “If Amma’s soul has to be in peace, it is better she (Sasikala) keeps quiet and keeps away,” Munusamy told reporters in Veppanahalli town. He also warned her of “retribution” if she chose to fight for regaining control of the party she headed briefly as interim general secretary after Jayalalithaa’s demise in December 2016.“There is no circumstance under which she can enter the party. There is no possibility... Every single AIADMK cadre is clear about it,” he added.After the AIADMK lost power to DMK in the assembly polls in the election results announced on May 3, Sasikala’s two audio clips speaking to party men went viral on Sunday. She is telling some party cadre that she will soon return to “set everything right”. The cadre responding to her suggested that a group within the AIADMK is still waiting for her.Munusamy claimed that some forces were trying to cause “confusion” in the AIADMK ranks by using Sasikala in the “forefront”, at a time when AIADMK was performing its function as the main opposition party in the Tamil Nadu assembly.“Not a single AIADMK cadre will fall for this confusion. Their intention will not come true. I also listened to the audio clips. No cadre has spoken to her. She is the one who is calling them,” Munusamy said. During her phone conversations, Sasikala is also heard saying that she will not watch the party they built with difficulties go to waste while referring to the rift between the party’s dual leadership —co-coordinator Edappadi Palaniswami and coordinator O Panneerselvam. Almost a month after elections are over in Tamil Nadu, the relationship between Palaniswami and Panneerselvam is bordering hostility. The decision to choose a leader of the opposition (LoP), which eventually went to Palaniswami unanimously as he was the chief minister candidate, renewed the friction between the duo. Panneerselvam signed a document declaring Palaniswami as the LoP and left the party headquarters on May 11. Hours later, Palaniswami drove to meet Panneerselvam at his official Chennai residence to drape a shawl over him and give him a bouquet, and photos were released. Since then, silence ensued in the party, which has not held a meeting due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and both leaders have been working individually. Palaniswami is his native in Salem district since the lockdown was imposed. “He is expected to come to Chennai only after lockdown norms ease, and he is overseeing Covid-19 work here,” said an associate in Palaniswami’s team. Panneerselvam reached Chennai on Monday after spending two weeks in his hometown in the Theni district where he has been since the death of his brother O Balamurugan on May 14. In the last few days, he too has been attending review meetings in the district. “Now that he is back we need to discuss the situation,” said a senior AIADMK leader not wishing to be named.The cold feud between the two leaders became more obvious after Palaniswami and Panneerselvam began issuing statements independently. While Palaniswami’s statements and letters are released by the party headquarters officially in his capacity as LoP, Panneerselvam’s statements come through informal channels such as Twitter and his office. Panneerselvam has been tweeting statements to chief minister M K Stalin to take action on several matters related to Covid-19 work and if it is addressed, he thanks them.On Monday Palaniswami’s letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for more drugs to treat mucormycosis was released by the AIADMK. “I don’t understand why they are issuing letters separately. Whatever may be the problems, what they are doing is wrong,” said a party functionary on condition of anonymity. “Only senior leaders can advise them on this.”However, party-related matters are released with the signatures of both leaders. Two joint statements on AIADMK’s letterhead have been issued recently – first to expel former labour minister Nilofer Kafeel from the party and another warning cadre against indulging in anti-party activities.Experts say that Palaniswami and Panneerselvam have to act together to keep the confidence of the party. “There are too many questions hanging in this situation,” says political commentator Durai Karunanidhi. “Munusamy’s comments aren’t enough. The leadership should hold a meeting or issue a joint statement on the lines of offering clarity to party men.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-possibility-aiadmk-on-sasikala-s-comeback-warns-her-of-retribution-101622487649570.html
01-06-2021||India||US President looks to rebuild, expand legal immigration||US President Joe Biden plans to rebuild and expand legal immigration by cutting processing time, costs and security hoops, clearing backlogs, and fixing the H-1B visa programme that allows US companies to hire foreign employees, which have been overwhelmingly from India, the New York Times has reported, citing a blueprint.This effort will run parallel to the White House-backed ambitious immigration reform legislation before the US congress, and the blueprint, titled “DHS Plan to Restore Trust in Our Legal Immigration System” — DHS is the Department of homeland Security, which oversees immigration, is only at a draft stage and will go through several versions before finalisation.Biden ran for the White House on the promise of “building a fair and humane immigration system” and undoing some of President Donald Trump’s “cruel” policies reflected in his obsession of a wall along the border with Mexico. Since taking office, Biden has undone some of his predecessor’s policies such as the Muslim immigration curbs.The central element, as the New York Times reported, of the new plan is to address backlogs in the immigration system, which had been building over the years and were only exacerbated by President Trump’ restrictive policies.It wasn’t clear from the report what specific backlogs will be targeted but the one that impacts applicants from India the most is the one for Green Cards. The US granted one million Green Cards in 2019, and that has been the general turnover annually. But because of a per-country limit of 7%, the queue of Indian applicants has kept growing over the year, with one conservative-leaning think tank estimating it to be more than 150 years.More than 300,000 applicants are currently in line, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services; but Immigration Voice, an advocacy group, says the number is as high as 1.5 million.The news report was not clear about plans for the H-1B visas — largest beneficiaries are Indian, accounting for more than 70% of the 85,000 granted annually — but the programme came in for harsh scrutiny and treatment from the Trump administration, which loaded it with restrictive measures, most of whom are either lapsed or rescinded.The blueprint will fast-track immigration applications by expanding virtual interviews and electronic filing, as well as limiting the requests for evidence from applicants, according to the New York Times. Domestic violence will because grounds for seeking asylum.Immigration opportunities will be expanded for LGBTQ refugees fleeing countries where they are persecuted or where same-sex marriage is not recognised.The blueprint proposes a revamp of a programme that allows undocumented immigrants to seek citizenship if they help law enforcement, and also allow protection to those who cooperate with police even before they make it to the official waiting list for immigrant visas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-prez-looks-to-rebuild-expand-legal-immigration-101622487590701.html
01-06-2021||India||Covid-19: Centre panel to study mixing doses, Covishield single shot||Government scientists will study various combinations of doses for coronavirus vaccines to see if the use of a different brands leads to better efficacy and look at how well they work if given only in a single dose or even as a shot after the booster dose to further aid the immunity of fully vaccinated people, a top official said on Monday.The vaccines India uses at present have a two-dose regimen. Similar studies have been carried out in other countries but independent experts said the one-dose approach, particularly for Covishield, should be made with caution since current evidence suggests it may not provide adequate protection.“We will be looking at the feasibility of testing two dose Covid-19 vaccine regimen but with different vaccines, for which testing may start in few weeks. Dosing interval will also be examined, that includes whether a single dose or a dose followed by a booster shot or so on works better, said Dr NK Arora, chairman, Covid-19 working group, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), Delhi.Arora said the exercise could be expanded to other vaccines like Covaxin or Zydus Cadilla’s ZyCov-D, which is in the trials phase at present. “The idea is to study and find the most appropriate dosing interval that provides maximum protection with the number of variants circulating around,” Arora said, adding that a single dose could be worked out too, “but that’s definitely not the only focus”.“Different type of beneficiary mix is currently available for us to examine in the form of what is called is the real-world data,” he added.Vaccine experts have welcomed the news but have reservations about testing a single-dose Covishield regimen. “For mixed doses testing, it is a good move. But for the single dose testing, it should not be tried outside a very careful evaluation where people can be closely monitored, and sequencing can be done quickly. I am encouraged by the Johnson & Johnson vaccine but wary of the B1.617.2 virus variant,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, physician-scientist at Christian Medical College, Vellore.Also read| 'Kappa' and 'Delta': WHO gives names to Covid-19 variants found in IndiaRecently, about 20 people in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharth Nagar district were accidentally given Covaxin shots as second dose after being given Covishield jabs. Experts have been following up with them, and so far, there seem to be no safety concerns.In the UK, an analysis of infections among people infected with the Delta variant, which was first found in India, showed a sharp drop in vaccine efficacy. The reduction was particularly stark among groups that had only one shot of Oxford-AstraZeneca (the same as Covishield) or Pfizer dose.A single dose of either vaccine, this data suggested, led to a mere 30% protection, down from 60% efficacy after two doses of AstraZeneca and 80% efficacy after two shots of the Pfizer vaccine.Dr Arora said that the county will have 200-300 million vaccines per month in the coming weeks as vaccine manufacturers are ramping up production. “By the end of July, we will have 200 million doses per month, and from August, we should get overall 250-300 million doses per month that would give us the capacity to inoculate close to 10 million people a day,” he said.The Union health ministry has said that efforts are on to increase the production capacity of Covaxin to 60-70 million vaccines in July-August. By September, the country expects to produce nearly 100 million doses a day of Covaxin.Production of Covishield that comprises almost 90% of the jabs given under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme so far is also being ramped up.Serum Institute of India’s chief executive officer, Adar Poonawalla, had said earlier that the monthly output will be raised to 100-120 million Covishield vaccines by July-August.SII locally manufactures Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine under the brand name Covishield. Covaxin, on the other hand, is co-developed by Bharat Biotech and Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-panel-to-study-mixing-doses-covishield-single-shot-101622487530874.html

01-06-2021||India||Maharashtra extends EWS quota to Marathas||Maharashtra on Monday allowed Marathas to avail reservation under the Economically Weak Section (EWS) category to accommodate around 6,000 people from the community in government service, roughly three weeks after the Supreme Court scrapped a separate quota for the influential group.The government said Marathas with annual family income of less than ₹8 lakh could avail the EWS quota, set up in 2019. The resolution also clarified that the EWS quota benefits will be applied with retrospective effect.The quota will be applicable from the period of interim stay (on Maratha reservation) on September 9 last year to the final Supreme Court verdict on May 5, the government order said.At present, a 10% EWS quota in jobs and education is given to sections of society not covered by any reservation. As Marathas no longer have quota, the government issued a fresh order making the community eligible.Also read| Battle for Maratha reservation to be fought in Delhi: Shiv SenaIn its May 5 order, the top court had said that admissions and appointments made under the 2018 Maratha quota law till September 9, 2020 (when the Supreme Court stayed the operation of the law), won't be disturbed but the candidates will not be able to avail any further benefit. But this didn’t help around 6,000 young men and women who completed various stages of government recruitment before September 9 but were not given appointment letters, said a state official on condition of anonymity.“The SC order does not give protection to the employees not recruited before September 9 last year. Though state government had taken the decision of accommodating community in EWS on September 22 but the order was issued only on December 23 because of the resistance of the community. There are people recruited during this period. With the help of this order, we can now consider accommodating such youth in EWS quota. Some of the candidates from EWS quota may get thrown out of the reservation, but we are considering to accommodate them by creating extra posts,” said the official.The law was passed in 2018 after months of violent agitation by Marathas, which makes up 32%of the state. The 2018 law was based on a state backward commission report and the window of “extraordinary situations” cited in the 1992 Indra Sawhney case. It provided 16% reservation in jobs and educational institutions to Marathas, taking the quantum of caste-based quota in the state to 68%.In 2019, the Bombay high court reduced the quota to 12% in admissions and 13% in jobs, prompting students and others to move the Supreme Court.On May 5, the SC scrapped the quota and called it unconstitutional. A five-judge bench lamented that the state government opted to give reservation to a class that was “socially dominant”, “politically dominant” and “in the mainstream of national life,” and thus, there was no justification to breach the 50% ceiling for a class that also had adequate representation in public employment.After the verdict, the state appointed a high-level committee under retired high court judge Dilip Bhosale to study the court order. On Monday, the panel was given seven more days submit its report. “Besides the legal recourse to find out the way out to get the reservation back, the committee is also expected to recommend alternative to safeguards the jobs of youth who could not be recruited in due time. The decision over it will be taken in days after the submission of the report,” the official quoted above said.Maratha leaders said they were unhappy with the decision. “We would not get even 4% share of the EWS quota as many other community from open category already have been getting these benefits,” said Rajendra Kondhare, general secretary, Akhil Bharatiya Maratha Mahasangh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-extends-ews-quota-to-marathas-101622487530290.html

01-06-2021||India||Kerala assembly passes resolution against Lakshadweep administrator||The Kerala legislative assembly on Monday unanimously passed a resolution condemning the controversial policies of Lakshadweep administrator Praful Khoda Patel and demanded their withdrawal as well as Patel’s recall.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan tabled the resolution, and said the UT has become the latest laboratory of Sangh Parivar outfits. All democratic forces should oppose this, he said.The resolution said that the people of Lakshadweep are in a tight spot. “Their culture and tradition are under threat following dictatorial measures being taken by the administrator ignoring local protests. Even their food habits and livelihood are under threat,” the resolution read.The original resolution had no direct attack against the Centre, but it was later incorporated after the Opposition sought amendments. “The administrator is taking many measures to alienate them. In the name of development their livelihood was threatened. Even coconut trees are painted with saffron colour in the name of beautification,” the resolution said.Lakshadweep has been on the boil for the last two weeks after UT administrator Patel, the former home minister of Gujarat and a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, brought in a new set of rules that include a proposed cow slaughter ban, a preventive detention law and sweeping changes in land development regulations.“Steps are being taken to eliminate beef which is an important part of the staple food... The administrator is taking the lead in gradually destroying the life and culture of the people of Lakshadweep,” the resolution read.The BJP shot back. “We condemn the resolution. Earlier the assembly had passed a resolution to free cleric Abdul Nassar Madani, accused in a bomb blast case. Later he was re-arrested and now he’s languishing in a jail in Karnataka,” said party’s Kerala president K Surendran.The BJP has said that people with vested interests have been spreading misinformation. It said that the administration was trying to develop the islands as a major tourism hub like the Maldives and had the full support of the locals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-row-kerala-resolution-hits-out-at-new-rules-administrator-101622487409600.html
01-06-2021||India||Bed allocation scam: ‘No common link’ says Bengaluru police, accused worked solo||Close to a month into the investigation into the controversial bed allocation scam in Bengaluru, the city police have arrested 14 persons including a doctor so far. While it was alleged that the scam was carried out by an organized syndicate, the investigation has revealed most of the arrested people were operating on their own.Out of these 14 arrested, 11 were made by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) and three by the central division police. The arrested were made under three different FIRs, two of which are handled by the CCB and one by the central division.The arrested suspects include a doctor, war room call attenders, a politician’s aide, private hospital staff and a contractor employed by the government. While the modus operandi of the arrested people has been the same, police have not been able to find a common link between all the arrests. In each arrest, either one person or a group of three, who had access to the bed booking system tried to sell beds.The common modus operandi was to call up the Covid-19 patients with BU number to find out if they are asymptomatic and in-home isolation. The beds are then booked against that particular BU number. This blocked bed automatically got unblocked if the patient does not turn up at the hospital within 12 hours. This bed is now manually re-allocated to the patients referred by the agents. Police say in the case, they had figured the loophole on their own.The first arrest in the case related to Covid war rooms in the Bengaluru was made on May 4. According to the CCB, the arrested suspects during the initial phase of the probe – Dr Rehan and Shashi Kumar – were working in the bed allotment section of the south war room and Bommanahalli war room respectively.During the initial investigation, the name of one Dr Suresh was on the suspect list of the police, however, he is currently not part of the 11 people under CCB custody.The next set of arrests were also made on May 4 but in the second FIR. The arrests were made by Jayanagar police, and the case was handed over to the CCB. The arrested persons were identified as Netravati, a social worker, and Rohith Kumar, her nephew. According to CCB, they were caught charging ₹20,000 to ₹40,000 for each bed.It was in connection with this case, on May 25, the CCB arrested Babu, who is alleged to be the aide of BJP MLA Satish Reddy. A senior CCB officer said that during the interrogation of Netravathi and Rohit, they got leads on Babu. The probe showed that using his links with doctors and telephone operators in the Bengaluru South war room, he got bed blocked and sold them to the aunt-nephew duo for a price.“Babu gained access to the war room claiming to be Reddy’s close aide. Since he was seen with the MLA at the centre before, it helped him” the officer said.Even though his name was available to cops as soon as the duo was arrested, but since he was Covid-19 positive, he could not be arrested, said the officer.Meanwhile, all other arrests were made in the first FIR. On May 9, CCB arrested Shashidhar, a contract employee with Arogya Mitra, which comes under the health department. “He was one of the many liaison officers deployed at various hospitals to oversee the allocation of bed. Using his influence in the hospital, he reserved some beds. He used the help of private hospital employees Uma Rani and Venkoba Rao for this. “Rao and Rani were working as staff members at Sparsh Hospital (RR Nagar) and Punya Hospital (Basaveshwar Nagar),” said the officer.Days after this arrest, on May 26, CCB arrested a marketing executive of Sapthagiri Hospital identified as Anthony after he took money for providing a bed in private hospitals. He has no associates as per the investigation.A day later, CCB arrested Varun S, a call attender at the south war room and his associate Yashwant Kumar. “Varun on a call promised a bed in a private hospital to those calling the BBMP helpline for bed. He could provide them Yashwant’s number and ask them to contact him for a bed,” the officer added.While the CCB probe was underway, based on a tip-off, the Central Division of Bengaluru City Police had earlier arrested three people, who were offering a bed for a price. MN Anuchet (DCP, Central) said that the arrested allegedly extorted ₹1.2 lakh from a person for an ICU bed. The complainant, whose father was admitted to Ramaiah Hospital, transferred ₹50,000 via Google Pay and handed another ₹70,000 in cash. Police identified those arrested as Venkata Subba Rao, Manjunath and Punith.Sandeep Patil, the head of CCB said that their teams have been arresting those people based on the information that is available to them. “So far, there is nothing connecting all those who have been arrested so far, except for the modus operandi. We can’t say at this point in time that all of them were operating for the kingpin, rather these are individual cases. We are continuing our probe,” Patil said.The CCB officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that they have not found any links or instances of the people for the different cases interacting with each other. “They are from different parts of the city. I think as the bed demand increases, those who knew how to rig the system tried to make some quick money is what we have learnt so far,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bed-allocation-scam-no-common-link-b-luru-police-rule-out-organised-crime-say-accused-worked-solo-101622487410204.html
