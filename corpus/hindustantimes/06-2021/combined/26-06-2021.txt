26-06-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: Mystery of the missing diary||Exotic dogs, cats and birds sell like hot cakes nowadays. While these breeds are derived from imported stock, the breeding and sale of such creatures by unregulated livestock entrepreneurs carries a collusive risk. Wild Indian species can be peddled under the guise of “legal business” in exotic species and advertised via the phenomenal though unmonitored reach of trans-national social media platforms. This came to the fore when a team of the Ropar wildlife preservation division raided Gill Farm situated bang on the busy Ropar-Nawanshahr highway and astride the biodiversity-rich Shivalik foothills. The raiding team seized 19 chicks of the Alexandrine parakeet, a near-threatened species. Among the assortment of exotic species reared at the farm for sale through Whatsapp deals, the raiding team unearthed two pieces of meat suspected to be of wild Indian species. The meats were later dispatched to the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, for forensic examination to establish if the species fell under the Wildlife (Protection) Act (WPA), 1972. The raids carried out on May 3, were a consequence of tip-offs provided by Nawanshahar honorary wildlife warden Nikhil Sanger and Parbhat Bhatti from the NGO, Jagriti, and not the outcome of intelligence developed by the wildlife department. The raids unearthed a very disturbing piece of evidence. A handwritten diary in Punjabi was seized from Gill Farm. It carried standard entries of sale proceeds from exotic breeds that went up to a few lakhs and the names of purchasers. Apart from that, it carried entries claiming that the author had killed 170 wild boars, and 60 bara singhas (sambars), including seven in one day. The diary notes the sale of two eagles for ₹1.25 lakh and mentions ‘teetar’ (wild partridges) also. However, follow-up investigations and challan preparations currently underway by the Hoshiarpur wildlife division have taken a mysterious turn: the diary has gone missing in a subtle indication of its explosive value.Hoshiarpur DFO (wildlife) Gursharan Singh told this writer: “We did not receive the diary from the Ropar raiding team. Neither is the diary mentioned in the seizure memo submitted to us.” However, this is contradicted by Bhatti. “We video-recorded the proceedings during the raid. Sanger handed over the diary to range officer Bhupinder Singh of the Hoshiarpur division, who was summoned to the spot following the raid. The diary was not mentioned in the memo due to an oversight,” Bhatti told this writer.Fearing a leak, the then chief wildlife warden, Punjab, VB Kumar, had reposed faith to get a secret raid conducted in a team constituted under the Ropar division rather than the Hoshiarpur division under whose jurisdiction Gill Farm actually falls. Only the raid’s follow-up was allotted to Hoshiarpur division. Seized of the matter now and noting the value of the missing diary, Ropar DFO (wildlife) Monica Yadav on Friday directed Bhatti and Sanger to furnish full evidence of the seized diary, including the photographs and videos of it, to the Punjab chief wildlife warden and herself. It was Yadav who had constituted the successful raiding team from the field staff of Ropar division.That the questionable practises indulged by Gill Farms were flourishing for a few years under the noses of multiple law-enforcement authorities is evidenced by numerous posts on the Facebook page of ‘Gill Farm Balachaur’, which (till the time of going to print) openly displays videos and photographs in captivity of banned Indian species such as rose-ringed and Alexandrine parakeets, black kites and a dead wild boar. The page advertises the sale of various non-veg pickles, including that of boneless meat of ‘soor’ (boar) and the price of a parakeet chick as ₹2,000. The owner of the farm, Gurvinder Singh Gill, was booked under Sections 9, 39, 49, 50 and 51 of the WPA, 1972, and is currently on bail. The case against him has been lodged at the court of judge Balwinder Kaur Dhaliwal, sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Balachaur, and is pending the filing of the challan by the Hoshiarpur division. The 19 parakeets seized from Gill Farm were released into the wild following an order from Nawanshahar sessions judge KS Bajwa on Tuesday. When contacted by this writer for his version, Gill responded by sending an expletive-laced SMS on Friday night. Gill later issued a threat on Saturday morning when this writer persisted in his efforts to secure his version: “You are not a journalist, you are a fake. You are trying to blackmail me. You come to my farm and I will teach you a lesson.” With these final words, Gill abruptly cut off the cellphone conversation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-mystery-of-the-missing-diary-101624731961793.html
26-06-2021||Gurugram||MCG official under probe for attempting to conceal inaction in drain cleaning work||An executive engineer (XEN) of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is under investigation for “concealing inaction” with regard to drain cleaning work in the run-up to monsoon, officials said on Saturday. The engineer undertook cleaning of a drain under the Public Works Department (PWD) in Ward 21 and tried to pass it off as the one assigned to him in Ward 20, officials said.The MCG commissioner, Mukesh Kumar Ahuja, gave the engineer a seven-day deadline to provide an explanation in writing, before disciplinary action is initiated.Ahuja, in his notice, stated that the executive engineer “was unaware of the works in progress in the area under his control” and questioned if the engineer made field visits to supervise the ongoing works. “You (XEN) failed to show any progress on the preparedness for the flood control and the measures undertaken by you to avert waterlogging in your area. In this way you have tried to conceal your inaction at the ground, to combat the flooding in your area and have tried to subterfuge the undersigned (a superintending engineer) by showing a spot not under your control,” Ahuja’s notice stated.The MCG’s engineering wing operates under eight different zones. The engineer in question was assigned to Zone 1.As per Ahuja’s show-cause notice, the engineer was issued orders earlier this month to clear all stormwater, sewerage lines, manholes under his jurisdiction, along with making necessary arrangements for dewatering flood-prone areas and completing the ongoing developmental works in this regard. The engineer was also directed to take all possible measures to prevent water stagnation and flooding at waterlogging-prone spots.However, when a superintending engineer (SE) was inspecting the work, it was found that work on the assigned drain was not done, while a drain under the PWD’s jurisdiction was being repaired.“Upon investigating further, the SE realised that the drain belonged to the PWD and the MCG had no authority or responsibility over maintaining the said civic amenity. It was further found that the stretch was in Ward 21 instead of Ward 20, and the XEN had taken the SE to another site than what was asked for,” a senior MCG privy to the matter said.Ahuja termed inaction as an “act of indiscipline, disobedience, and not discharging official duties honestly and diligently.” The notice stated, “(It) further shows your apathy towards the work involving danger to human life and property, which is a grave matter and putting the general public at the risk of inconvenience and throwing avenue to public tranquillity.”Another executive engineer pulled upAn executive engineer assigned to Zone 2 was also served a show-cause notice by the MCG commissioner on Saturday, for failing to undertake necessary monsoon preparedness measures. As per Ahuja’s notice, an MCG inspection found that the drains had not been cleaned, nor had any proper machinery and manpower deployed at flood-prone sites, despite repeated reminders in various meetings held since June 11.Ahuja sought an explanation within seven days, failing which disciplinary action would be initiated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-official-under-probe-for-attempting-to-conceal-inaction-in-drain-cleaning-work-101624731841789.html

District officials said that the case was reported from the ESI Hospital on Friday, following which a containment zone was created to prevent its spread. On Saturday, the state Home minister Anil Vij also directed that “100% contact tracing of the patient” should be carried out and a containment zone created. Yashpal Yadav, the deputy commissioner of Faridabad, said that a decision to screen the entire sector was taken immediately after the case was reported. “The patient has minor symptoms; he is doing fine and is being taken care of. The immediate family, relatives and entire neighbourhood will be tested to ensure that this variant doesn’t spread,” said Yadav, adding that a micro-containment zone is being created in the area. A release from the Faridabad district administration late Saturday mentioned that the patient, a 25-year-old male, had already tested positive for Covid-19 in May. He started exhibiting symptoms again this month after attending a wedding and travelling to Delhi for work through Metro. Five of his close contacts have also been traced and their samples taken for testing, said officials.Because of the threat posed by the Delta plus variant, the Faridabad administration decided to strictly implement Covid-19 safeguards. “Masks and Covid appropriate behaviour will have to be followed and strictly enforced as we don’t want the third wave to spread in the city or state,” said Yadav. Anil Vij, health minister Haryana expressed confidence that the state was fully prepared to fight the mutant virus. Directions have been issued to carry out contact tracing of the first patient infected with Delta plus virus in Faridabad, he said. Responding to the letter written by the Central government to the state to create a containment zone, the health minister said that the state has already asked the officials concerned to create a containment zone and also conduct testing on a large scale. On Friday, Rajesh Bhushan, secretary, department of health and family welfare, had written to the state chief secretary, intimating that a case of Delta plus variant of Covid-19 was found in a sample of a patient in ESI Hospital of Faridabad. The letter said that the Delta plus variant was highly transmissible, strongly bonded with lung cells and weakened antibody response. 10 cases, 10 recoveriesGurugram, on Saturday, recorded 10 new Covid-19 cases but also witnessed the recovery of 10 patients.

26-06-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay plans to revise UG curriculum, makes it flexible||The Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), on Saturday kicked off a survey seeking recommendations for revising and improving its curriculum for undergraduate (UG) courses.The institute plans to give students the option to train as a generalist in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) or as a specialist in a subject of their choice.The survey for feedback and suggestions will be extended to students, faculty, alumni networks, the industry as well as recruiters. “We are seeking inputs from all our stakeholders from students to recruiters,” said IIT-B, director Subhasis Chaudhuri.While the curriculum for courses are revised every 10-15 years and feedback is sought from all stakeholders, this time the institute plans to provide more flexibility to students in choosing their courses.“The broad philosophy is to give more flexibility to students to adjust their course work in tune with their interests. One direction of our pursuit is to allow students to shape themselves as a ‘generalist’ in STEM disciplines by taking electives from their own or other departments or as a ‘specialist’ in a particular discipline (as currently followed) by taking courses (including electives) from a chosen (sub)discipline. Even the curriculum for ‘Specialists’ is planned to be broadened in keeping with the current developments in various subject areas,” said Chaudhuri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombay-plans-to-revise-ug-curriculum-makes-it-flexible-101624727280158.html
26-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: 72% fall in Covid cases in June compared to May; city to remain under level 3||The city has recorded a 72% fall in the number of Covid-19 cases in the first 24 days of June, as compared to the first 24 days of May, reveals the state health department data. Further, the number of deaths has also gone down drastically in June, as compared to May. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has announced that the city will continue to remain under level-3 restrictions, a day after the Maharashtra government tightened lockdown norms.According to the data, between May 1 and May 24, 42,991 cases were reported in the city, which went down to 11,921 cases in June. Subsequently, in the same period during May, 1,356 deaths were reported that went down to 488 in June.In the same period, overall 1,282,906 tests were carried out in the city, of which, 658,210 were carried out in May and 624,696 were carried out in June.According to BMC officers, though the cases have gone down, they will have to remain on high alert owing to the detection of Delta plus variant of Covid-19. Owing to the same, Maharashtra tightened its lockdown norms on Friday deciding to impose stricter lockdown norms, reducing the five-level relaxation plan to three.The first two levels, which had maximum relaxations, have been removed till further order, according to a notification issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Friday.Post this, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal issued orders stating that Mumbai will continue to remain under level-3 restrictions until further orders. This, when the positivity rate in Mumbai (3.96%) and oxygen bed occupancy (26.04%).According to level 3 restrictions, essential shops and establishments can remain open till 4pm on all days, non-essential shops and establishments can remain open till 4pm on weekdays, restaurants are allowed to operate dine-in with 50% capacity, till 4pm on weekdays, and can allow takeaways and home deliveries after. Travelling via local trains is restricted for medical and essential services, gyms, salons and spas are open till 4pm, operational on 50% capacity without the usage of the air conditioner.Further, the BMC predicts that the third wave of Covid-19 will hit the city anytime by September 2021. The BMC has said it will scale Covid beds by over 10,000 and is in the process of setting up 16 oxygen plants across the city. On Saturday, the city reported 648 cases followed by 15 deaths taking the case tally to 719,610 cases and 15,383 deaths. The city’s recovery rate is 95% and the fatality rate is 2.13%. There are 19,943 active cases in the city.Dr Madhav Sathe, a microbiology professor at Nair Hospital’s college said, “The decreasing cases do indicate that the second wave is getting weaker day by day. In the country, we are vaccinating around 50 lakh citizens daily and if this same trend continues for the next 6 to 7 weeks, I feel that the effect of a third wave will be very mild. However, the effect of third wave will also depend on the covid appropriate behaviour being followed by the citizens. Until a substantial amount of the population is not vaccinated, we should avoid gatherings and going to crowded places.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-72-fall-in-covid-cases-in-june-compared-to-may-city-to-remain-under-level-3-101624727160171.html
26-06-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 hit finances at IITs as income from fees declined||The Covid-19 pandemic, the subsequent lockdown and a decline in receipt of fees affected the finances of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) across the country.At IIT-Bombay, the total income — recurring and capital — declined by ₹25 crore in 2020-21 compared to the year before. “Overall, the balance of finances was not affected much. Naturally, the expenditure on operations and maintenance, other than Covid-related ones, was correspondingly less due to regulated functioning of offices, departments and labs as per government orders, work from home, fully online teaching etc.,” said Prasanna M Mujumdar, deputy director, finance and external affairs, and professor in the department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT-Bombay. He said the overall reduction in total income was less than 10%. As the pandemic struck last year, internal revenues of IITs took a blow. The primary source of income at all IITs is the academic receipts of tuition fees, hostel rent and rent collected from commercial establishments on campus.“Due to Covid-19 we received less income from seat rent and commercial establishments and the grant from ministry of education (MoE) was also reduced due to budget cuts. Due to the reduction in operating costs such as lower electricity consumption, almost no travel and less consumables, the institute managed with the reduced funds,” said Bhaskar Ramamurthi, director, IIT-Madras. A senior official at IIT-Delhi, too, confirmed that income received in 2020-21 was less than the year before.Most IITs have been reporting a funds deficit in their annual reports for the past few years. IIT-Bombay, for instance, has recorded deficits to the tune of ₹100 crore a year.In a bid to make IITs self-sufficient, the Central government has been weaning grants. Instead, IITs now take loans from Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA) for infrastructure and other projects. The principal is to be paid by the institute while the interest is paid by the ministry of higher education.IIT-Bombay has so far sought loans worth ₹491 crore — ₹410 in the first phase — for various infrastructure projects. Of this, the institute has repaid ₹73.35 crore from its internal revenue. “The institute escrows ₹41 crore each year for Phase-1 loan. This is set to increase to around ₹49 crore from this year, as Phase-2A of the loan has started,” said Mujumdar.IIT-Madras, too, pays around ₹50 crore a year towards HEFA loans, said Ramamurthi. “The loan is paid off in 10 equal instalments over 10 years. So we are repaying about ₹50 crore per year. We have paid instalments since 2019,” he said.With reduced income, repaying HEFA loans has become a challenge. IIT-Madras availed of a moratorium in payment last year while IIT-Bombay sought a moratorium but eventually did not avail it. “A request was made by IIT-B. I think MoE had clarified that conditional moratorium can be provided in line with Reserve Bank of India circular and requested a confirmation to place the matter before HEFA board. However, on consideration of the financial position, estimates and projections, IIT-B did not opt for any moratorium,” said Mujumdar.Ramamurthi said, “IIT-M is growing rapidly in its research output, and with the increase in student population to 10,000 and more, the faculty strength is also steadily going up towards 1,000. We need to add infrastructure as well as launch global scale research efforts. We are also internationalising by admitting more foreign students, recruiting foreign faculty and entering into joint academic programmes with top universities worldwide. This is the time the institute needs more investment in infrastructure and research equipment. Our ability to grow will be determined to a significant extent on our ability to raise money for these investments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-hit-finances-at-iits-as-income-from-fees-declined-101624727040134.html
26-06-2021||Mumbai||Pandemic impact: Ground handling agencies appeal government to help, fear bleak future||It has been almost 15 months since India imposed a ban on regular commercial flight services to curb the spread of the pandemic which hit the country last March. Domestic operations, though suspended along with the overseas flights, resumed after a two-month hiatus on May 25, 2020. However, the prolonged suspension of international operations - considered bread-and-butter of ground handling agency operators - has had a profound effect on their business, with squeezing revenues and increasing losses.Ground handling is a key function of the aviation eco-system, involving activities such as passengers’ boarding and deboarding, their baggage and cargo, among others. The sector, which is dominated by four-five major players, who handle ground handling activities of various international airlines and some domestic carriers at the country’s major airports, employs around 70,000 workforces.Apart from independent ground handling companies, these activities are handled by some domestic airlines as well. With limited revenue generation owing to fewer flights, ground handling companies have been forced to take several mitigating measures such as layoffs and salary cuts, among others, to keep the business afloat. Moreover, with the looming threat of a possible third-wave and continued uncertainty around the resumption of regular overseas flights, operators are sitting with their fingers crossed over business prospects in the near future.‘In the worst situation’The second wave of the pandemic has hit this capital and labour-intensive sector harder at a time when the domestic travel demand had recovered almost 65% of a pre-Covid level, said Murali Ramachandran, president of the Ground Handling Association Of India (GHAI) and CEO- India, Celebi.“Aviation sector is in the forefront of the pandemic. Domestic demands started recovering from July-August last year, we were looking at a fair amount of recovery. We are in the worst situation. The impact of the second wave has dragged us back in time to July of last year,” Ramachandran said, who recently wrote to the government on behalf of the association, seeking financial succour for the loss-making sector.According to India head of aviation advisory and research firm, Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA), Kapil Kaul, ground handling companies at an industry level is estimated to have incurred losses to the tune of USD 125-150 million in the financial year ended March 2021, and that the impact of the pandemic on the ground handling firms is severe like all others in the aviation business.“Our dependency is more on international flights and less on domestic. As much as 75% flights handled by us are international which remain suspended,” said Ramachandran. Currently, limited international flight operations undertaken under the Centre’s air bubble agreement with various countries’ governments accounts for almost 15% of pre-Covid overseas flight operations.“All this has put financial pressure on us. We were already struggling from last year. The second wave has beaten us very harshly,” Ramachandran added.Ground handling employees lost jobsAccording to data shared in the Rajya Sabha by the minister of state for civil aviation Hardeep Singh Puri in February, a total of 19,247 people lost jobs at airports- 12,646 in the ground handling agencies department, 6,981 at airlines and 170 at cargo operators during March-September 2020.Going by this data, 33.5% employees working with the ground handling agencies lost jobs during the period. The major ground handling operators, who work across the major airports across the country include Celebi, Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited (AISATS), Bhadra Ground Handling Services, Indo Thai Airport Management Services. Flight volumes dropped by 58%The aviation sector is at the forefront of the pandemic. Domestic demands started recovering from July-August last year when the agencies had started looking at a fair amount of recovery.“ In FY2020-21, AISATS flight volumes dropped by 58% compared to FY 2019-20 and led to a significant drop in revenue while our cost of operations could not be reduced at an equivalent rate due to the government’s Covid-19 regulations as well as the need to maintain a base level of resources to be prepared for recovery. This led to significant financial loss and a tremendous strain on the finances of the company. Moreover, the increase in fuel prices, as well as costs of acquiring additional Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) created a further financial burden on our company,” said Ramanathan Rajamani, CEO of AISATS.The Ground Handling industry cannot afford any further cuts in its service rates as the cost of handling an aircraft has increased substantially due to a reduction in flight frequencies and greater workload, and related costs in the area of disinfection and cleaning owing to the pandemic. “AISATS is the first ground handler in India to have launched UV-C (Ultraviolet C Band) disinfection services for aircraft interior cleaning at Delhi and Trivandrum as we believe that introducing such innovative solutions will help boost passenger confidence in air travel and lead Indian aviation towards a faster path of recovery,” Rajamani added.GHAI seeks help from aviation ministryGiven this situation, GHAI recently wrote to the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) for help. “In the form of some support measures: we have asked the ministry for their support in the bank moratorium on interest charges on loans for a period of at least two years. We also asked them to consider instructing airport operators not to charge concession and rental fees until normalcy of operation is achieved and to consider a stimulus to sustain salary payments and allow subsistence allowances to minimize retrenchment,” Ramachandran said.“We have taken a lot of effort to build skill sets and it will be unfortunate if the industry is pushed to go through massive retrenchments,” he added.The association has also asked the government to create a structured plan and system to get international flight schedules back on track instead of reviewing them monthly as international business is their mainstay. Ramachandran said that their revenues have reduced to 15% of what they have been earning. “We need financial support from the airports in terms of reduction in rent, at least in proportion to the business we have been doing. The times ahead look very bleak for us. We had started rehiring when the second wave hit us, we don’t want to go for another round of reduction and retrenchment of people,” he said. The sector had around 70,000 employees working for them but each company had to downsize around 25% due to the pandemic.‘If there is no third wave, things may improve’Prem Bajaj, chairman and managing director of Bhadra International ground handling agency, said that vaccination was the only hope for the industry, for faster revival. “The vaccination drive seems to have picked up since last few days, but to reach a meaningful percentage of vaccination we are looking at, at least closure of FY 2021-22, which means that this fiscal is unlikely to be any better than FY 20-21. Certain estimate predicts a worse 21-22 compared to FY 20-21,” said Bajaj.The ground handlers unanimously said that another year of losses would cripple the entire sector substantially. However, they expect the recovery to the pre-Covid level to happen only in 2023.However, the industry fears the impact of a third wave, if any, on them. According to Ramachandran, if there is no third wave by September then things may start improving. If every company opens up and nothing changes, international flights could come back to 50- 60% of the pre-Covid level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pandemic-impact-ground-handling-agencies-appeal-government-to-help-fear-bleak-future-101624726980252.html
26-06-2021||Pune||CSR funds should be brought in for development of sports infrastructure: Sharad Pawar||In a review meet for the under-construction International Sports University at Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex, Balewadi, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar urged private firms to invest in development of sports infrastructure via corporate social responsibility funds along with government funding. “People from private firms should come forward and utilise the corporate social responsibility funding for the development of sports infrastructure along with government funding,” said Pawar. “The International Sports University, Maharashtra will be instrumental in creating technical manpower for sports management, job creation in the sports sector and sports training. Athletes should take full advantage of these upcoming advanced facilities,” added Pawar. While visiting the stadium, Pawar visited a renovated hockey stadium along with a swimming pool and shooting range. The government has sanctioned ₹400 crore for the International Sports University which is slated to be developed in a phased manner. In the first phase, courses for sports science, sports technology and sports coaching and training with capacity of 50 students for each course will begin. The construction of the university slowed down due to the second wave of Covid-19. Things slowed down with the eruption of the second Covid wave. We are focusing on speeding up the work on priority for this project,” said Sunil Kedar, state sports and youth affairs minister. Cars parked on track While the review meeting was underway in the main building of Shiv Chhatrapati sports complex, many officials parked cars in the main athletic stadium on the main athletic track. Even though the whole parking space in the front side of the stadium was vacant, officials opted to park their cars on the main stadium track. “Such incident will not happen in future. Once the international sports university starts, the grounds in the sports complex will be only used for the sports activities,” said Kedar. In the past, management has given the ground many a times for political function and marriage celebrations. “Officials always take such things lightly. Driving or parking a car damages the synthetic track. Already track has developed bubbles in between and such activities will make it worse for running,” said an athlete on the request of anonymity who trains at the main athletic stadium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/csr-funds-should-be-brought-in-for-development-of-sports-infrastructure-sharad-pawar-101624726200112.html
26-06-2021||Pune||Parents anxious due to delayed Class 12 result||The results of Class 10 and 12 students will soon be declared, after on Thursday the Supreme Court (SC) ordered all the boards to declare the results by July 31.However, parents are getting impatient due to the pending admission for graduate courses. Archana Gugale a parent said, “My son is in Class 12 and we had applied for couple of graduation courses in private universities but as the results are not yet declared we cannot confirm the admissions, the state government should now act promptly and declare results immediately.” On the other hand, Maharashtra state board is expecting to declare Class 10 results before July 15, while the assessment plans for Class 12 students for state board students is yet to be finalised. In all this delayed result process, students and their parents are losing their patience over further admission plans. Education experts are demanding more clarity over the state education department decisions. “This month is coming to an end and soon the month of July will start, this is a crucial period for admissions in the academic year and still results of Class 10 and 12 are not yet declared, lakhs of students and their future careers are at stake. The results should be declared as early as possible, so that further admission process will begin. Now SC has intervened into the Class 12 results giving an ultimatum to the boards which is a good thing. Even the state board should now work faster on declaration of results,” said Nitin Bhalerao, an education expert. Dhananjay Kulkarni an education expert and who had filed a PIL in Bombay High Court about conducting the Class 10 exams said, “There will be always a difference of opinion in the assessment and results declaration process, but it is delaying the academic year. In the declaration of class 12 results state government should not go along with the CBSE formula and either giving 50 per cent weightage to CET exam for admissions entire 100 per cent marks of CET exam should be taken into consideration. When the covid situation will normalise the exams should be conducted for the further admission process.” Due to the increase in the Covid positive cases in the state, Class 10 and 12 board exams were cancelled this year by the state government. While the assessment of Class 10 students’ formula is decided, but the issue of assessment of Class 12 is not yet decided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-anxious-due-to-delayed-class-12-result-101624725120066.html
26-06-2021||Pune||BJP demands to postpone elections until OBC reservation is restored||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday demanded to postpone polls for five Zilla Parishad (ZP) and 33 panchyant samitis until the OBC (Other Backward Class) reservation is restored. BJP on Saturday carried out state-wide agitations for the demand of getting back OBC’s political reservation which was scrapped by the Supreme Court. BJP state unit president Chandrakant Patil led the agitations at Kolhapur and BJP’s national secretary Pankaja Munde participated in Pune’s chakka jam agitations. Patil said, “The state election commission announced the elections for five Zilla Parishads including Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim and Nagpur and 33 panchayat samitis. They will be held without OBC reservation. We all should make aggressive agitations for postponing these elections.” Patil said, “It is the failure of the Maharashtra government which did not put proper stand in the court. Now they are blaming the Central government for it but OBC reservation was only scrapped in Maharashtra. If the Central government was responsible for it, the OBC reservation would get scrapped all over India.” Patil said, “BJP will continue the agitations till the OBCs do not get justice.” Munde said, “During the Covid-19 pandemic, some elections were postponed. On the same line, the ZP elections should also be postponed. The committee needs to get in between the ruling party and opposition, which would request the state election commission to postpone the elections.BOXNo conflict between Marathas and OBCs: MundeBJP leader Pankaja Munde on Saturday said, “The ruling Maha Vikas Agadi is trying to create conflict in between society on the issue of reservation. There is no conflict in both OBCs and Marathas. We are in support of both, the Marathas are demanding reservation in education and jobs. On the contrary OBCs are demanding political reservation. Both demands are separate.” Munde also criticised the ruling party and said the ministers from Mahavikas Agadi were also agitating for getting reservation for OBCs. “It’s sad that instead of taking any decisions they are agitating,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-demands-to-postpone-elections-until-obc-reservation-is-restored-101624725060089.html

The first information report has also been registered against 100 people, and fine was collected from 2,237 people. “Since the last three weeks, most of the fine is collected from tourists as they continue to visit the twin hill stations of Lonavla and Khandala even after the Section 144 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) is imposed,” said Dilip Pawar, senior police inspector in charge of Lonavla city police station. The first information report was imposed on those people who dodge police to visit viewing spots. “Many youngsters on two wheelers dodge police officials while they were collecting fines from other people, later they were caught when they reached the viewing sites,” added Pawar. According to Section 144, five or more than five persons are not allowed to gather in public places. “Recently, we also placed posters on Mumbai-Pune expressway to inform people that no viewing points are open in the city, still tourist traffic is not on decline,” added Pawar. The district administration has allowed outsiders entry to the main city who have booked their hotel and bungalows for the stay. However, with no restriction on tourist entry by administration, the situation becomes troublesome for police on duty. “Weekend is a tough job. We have allotted the extra police staff for two days to control the crowd. On a few occasions when there was a heavy rush to avoid traffic jams we left people even without imposing fines,” added Pawar. However, Lonavla’s traders’ association and Chikki association have requested Lonavla municipal council (LMC) not to ban tourists at the hill station. A member of the traders’ association on request of anonymity said, “Our 60 per cent income depends on the footfall of tourists, if LMC bans entry on them then we will face more economic crisis. We are ensuring social distancing rules are followed.” The Bhushi dam – one of the tourist attraction spots overflowed last week and an additional police check post has been created to avoid crowds of people. “Situation is improving as the number of tourists are declining steadily on weekends after we put up posters on the expressway. For police, the situation is becoming hard to control as there is continuous tourist traffic from both the sides (Mumbai and Pune),” Somnath Jadhav, chief executive officer (CEO), Lonavla municipal council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/lonavala-police-collects-fine-of-rs-12-30-300-in-may-and-june-101624724940156.html

Similarly, Burhi Gandak, which flooded Champaran districts, has jumped the DL at Rosera in Samastipur by nearly 30 cm.“We have heightened surveillance on the embankments on all rivers originating from Nepal, as they are maintaining a rising trend and exerting pressure on a certain stretch of the bund. All embankments are safe,” said an executive engineer of the water resources department.Villagers residing near the embankments on Kosi near Baltara in Khagaria and Basua in Supaul districts have been asked to relocate to safer places as the river was almost touching the DL on those spots.

26-06-2021||Patna||After Centre’s guidelines, Bihar takes steps to regulate SSA spending through one bank a/c||The Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC) has written to all district education officers (DEOs) to conform to Centre’s guidelines regarding modified procedures for spending and utilisation of funds meant for centrally sponsored schemes (CSS).The new mechanism for Samagra Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA), under which DEOs are required to operate through only one bank account mapped with public finance management system (PFMS) portal, will be effective from July 1, officials said. “For this, the multiple existing bank accounts have to be closed, and all the unspent money, along with accrued interest, from there has to be transferred to the single zero balance subsidiary bank account to be opened at different levels by June 26, 2021,” wrote BEPC director Sanjay Singh.Singh has directed the DEOs to prepare head-wise details (general head, capital head) of all the unspent money under elementary and secondary education and categorise them under general, SC and ST components before sending it to the state office. All the unspent amount after adjusting advanced has to be returned to the account of single nodal agency (SNA), as mandated, by June 28 so that the new integrated system could take off by July 1.The department of expenditure, Government of India, had issued the modified procedure for release of funds to states/ union territories for CSS and monitoring utilisation of funds released to ensure effective cash management and improve transparency in public expenditure management. Under it, each SNA, registered with the PFMS, has been designated for each CSS by every state government.According to the Centre’s guidelines, funds available in the bank accounts of the implementing agencies have to be transferred to the bank account of the SNA concerned with clear bifurcation of the central and state share.Singh said the direction was issued by the Union finance ministry with regard to all centrally sponsored schemes. “We will review it after 3-4 days, as it has to be followed,” he added.In keeping with the Centre’s integrated education scheme, the Bihar SSA, for tackling class 1-12 in a coordinated way, had also notified just one implementing agency at the state level, the BEPC.The decision to subsume the entire centrally sponsored scheme into one integrated school education scheme was done to rationalize institutional arrangements at all levels and adopt a holistic approach for administration of school education. As the scheme is outcome oriented, school effectiveness occupies the centre stage of its management framework.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/after-centre-s-guidelines-bihar-takes-steps-to-regulate-ssa-spending-through-one-bank-ac-101624724522844.html

Set up in 2019, the union sold vegetables worth ₹24 crore during the two phases of pandemic while ensuring handsome profits for farmers.According to officials, as against the requirement of 50 acres, 25 acres of land belonging to agriculture department has been identified near Kudiya agriculture farm in Chakiya subdivision and identification of remaining land is underway. “A proposal has already been sent to the state agriculture department after the identification of the land. Necessary formalities related to the transfer of land would be completed once the approval received,” said Shirshat Kapil Ashok, district magistrate (DM), East Champaran, describing it as a unique initiative aimed at ensuring assistance to farmers in form of assured income and quality for consumers. “We have also given them nod for opening their retail outlets in Motihari. Around 3,000 farmers from East Champaran district associated themselves with the cooperative during the second phase of pandemic and benefitted from facilities,” said the district magistrate. In an effort to ensure remunerative prices to farmers and standard quality vegetable at reasonable prices to consumers and eliminate middle men, the Tirhut cooperative was formed under a state government’s scheme called Tarkaari. A total of 7,460 farmers and vegetable growers from eight districts — East Champaran, West Champaran, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Chapra, Muzaffarpur, Siwan and Gopalganj — have already associated themselves to the cooperative society through 45 of its functional primary vegetable cooperative societies (PVCS), the first tier of its operational structure at the grassrootsLast year, the union launched its online services for home delivery of vegetables in Muzaffarpur and Motihari and retail outlets in Sitamahari. It aims to expand its operations in all 136 blocks spread over eight districts by this year. Vegetables can be ordered online in Muzaffarpur and Motihari by visiting www.tarkaarimart.in.TVPMCU’s chaiman Amit Kumar Shukla said the cooperative started the operations after the nationwide lockdown was enforced last year. “We have been able to register a robust business of about ₹24 crore from five districts as on March 31 this year. About 9285 metric tonnes (MT) of vegetables was sold after procurement from farmers and vegetable growers, which includes supply to Delhi-based cooperative societies too,” the chairman said. “Our 80-odd PVCS have already registered, of which 45 have become operational. We are looking forward to expanding our operations in all 136 blocks of eight districts by the end of this year, which is bound to create a win-win situation for both farmers and consumers,” he said.At the village of Kamaluwa in Areraj block of East Champaran, majority of residents are vegetable growers, and now they have no regrets. “The best thing about joining the cooperative is that we are saved the hard bargaining by local wholesalers who often indulge in finding fault in quality of our produces,” said Nitish Kumar, an associate of TVPMCU. “Moreover, the pricing is better with instant cash payment,” said Nipu Bhagat, another village. “The whole model has a huge potential to provide direct and indirect employment to a large number of people,” said Nayan Prakash, CEO, TVPMCU.Breaking new groundThe pandemic periodTirhut Vegetable Processing and Marketing Cooperative Union (TVPMCU), founded in 2019, sold vegetables worth ₹24 crore in fiscal 2021-22.Expanding footprint7,460: Number of affiliated vegetable growers 80: Primary vegetable cooperative societies registered45: Primary vegetable cooperative societies registered functional8: Number of districts associated (East Champaran, West Champaran, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Chapra, Muzaffarpur, Siwan and Gopalganj)Future roadmapVegetable processing unit to come up at Chakiya, 25 acres land belonging to agriculture department has been identified near Kudiya agriculture farm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-after-a-golden-maiden-year-veg-coop-set-to-get-land-for-processing-unit-101624724461268.html

During this pandemic-hit time, when many established firms are struggling to keep themselves afloat , Rajkishore, 32, is gearing up to expand his family’s vinegar business in a big way from his village located 20km from the Kaushambi district headquarters. Rajkishore worked as medical representative for a pharmaceutical firm till the world got hit by Covid-19. “Overnight I found myself without a job and struggling to even support my wife Renu, 27 and son, Abhi, 4,” he said.Luckily, his family owned three bighas (80,732 sq ft) land in his village, where his father grew sugarcane and made vinegar from its juice. “My father, Raj Khema, 56, had been making vinegar for the last 15 years, by the traditional method using the juice of our home-grown sugarcane and in which I often helped. He used to sell excess vinegar to ‘thelawalas’ at a cost of ₹40 to ₹50 per litre while using the rest for home use,” Rajkishore said.In this time of need, Rajkishore returned to his family business. “I decided to organise and expand this business. I started procuring sugarcane from Fatehpur villages like Dhata, Sonari and Pauli at a cost of ₹400 to ₹500 per quintal and started preparing vinegar in the traditional style, using my father’s recipe, but at a larger scale, using earthen pots and selling it to a few neighbouring districts like Kaushambi and Pratapgarh,” he added.His efforts paid off and soon, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) took note of this small family business and offered to support it. This saw Rajkishore joining hands with other few fellow villagers, also financially hit by the pandemic, like Shiv Ashish (40), Vijay Bahadur (52), Ajit Singh (31) and Uday Narayan (63) resulting in the birth of Anetha Farmers Producer Company Ltd, a Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO), befittingly named after their village.Soon, more farmers joined in and their count rose to over 300—all having a share in the FPO.In place of 10-12 quintals of sugarcane that Rajkishore and his father used for making the vinegar, they are now using 350 quintals of sugarcane for making their tasty and healthy vinegar using the money pooled in by ‘partner’ villagers. “Despite the present challenges of a sluggish economy, courtesy Covid-19, I sent many samples to different states last year and got a decent number of orders. Now, I am supplying the vinegar not just across UP but even to states like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal with NABARD support,” he added.Rajkishore, who is now also planning to improve the filtration process of his family’s vinegar-making technique to cut down on the wastage, said that he is confident that his efforts will not only benefit him and his father but also the villagers, making the name of his village known all across India for quality desi vinegar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hit-by-covid-downturn-ex-mr-makes-desi-vinegar-a-sweet-proposition-101624718160612.html

Singh is an MBA and used to work in a private factory in Faridabad. He came back to his village three years ago. Singh alleged that the local administration and officials of Jal Nigam, Hathras, failed to make the project a reality over the past 10 months. However, officials of the Jal Nigam claimed that the project would be completed by September 2021, the deadline set for it. “I have been struggling to resolve the issue of water scarcity in my village--Nagla Maya since long and recently my five-year-old daughter Nikunj Singh, with help of her cousins, wrote a letter to PM Modi in this regard,” stated Chandra Pal Singh. “Minister in UP cabinet Mahendra Singh had made efforts to address the water problem and the scheme was launched in August 2020 to supply water by pipeline to Mahasinghpur gram panchayat. But the local administration has failed to make it a reality in the past 10 months,” complained Singh. “For me PM Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath are like gods, and I trust them. I gave up food and water from today (Saturday) and sat in front of photos of Modi and CM Yogi by lighting a ‘akhand jyoti’, which will continue to be lit till every person of my gram panchayat gets potable water,” said Singh. Refuting Singh’s allegation, Jal Nigam (Hathras) executive engineer RK Sharma said work on the project was progressing at a fast pace. “The deadline for the completion of the project is September 2021, but we will complete the work before the deadline. This project would make potable water available for three villages of Mahasinghpur gram panchayat, including Nagla Maya,” he claimed. Earlier, Hathras district magistrate Ramesh Ranjan had said, “The work is on for providing water to the village of the complainant.There was disruption in work because of Covid restrictions/curfew, but the contractor has now resumed work and will complete the project as soon as possible.” However, Singh claimed that the pace of the project to lay a water pipeline, which would supply water to the three villages including his, was very slow. He alleged, “The area has been facing water crisis for the past three decades because underground water is not fit for drinking and a population of about 2 to 2.5 lakh living in 150 villages under 61 village panchayats have to rely on a water source in Haitha Raghunathpur village, around three kilometers away from my village.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-father-of-hathras-girl-who-wrote-to-pm-modi-sits-on-indefinite-fast-101624711982009.html

The issue can be solved through Centre Government's intervention, and our leader, Devendra Fadnavis can help with the same. The MVA leaders should come to him to take his help over the issue, but they would not come because they would rather delay it. It is a matter of credit taking for them," ANI quoted MLA Kalidas Kolambakar as saying hitting out at the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of the state for their incapacity to provide reservations."Today we are holding protests state-wide, at a 1000 places to pressurise the Government to expedite the process. Our demand is to restore the 27 per cent political reservation in all local body elections in the state," he added.The plan to hold a statewide protest demanding the political OBC reservations was announced by the BJP on Thursday.Also read: Fadnavis takes dig at Sena in lecture on EmergencyThe Supreme Court had observed that the reservation in the favor of OBC in local bodies should not lead to the surpassing of 50 per cent cap in reservation quota. The apex court had rejected the state government's review petition concerning the political reservation.The OBC had lost their political reservations in the local bodies of Maharashtra comprising of municipal corporations, municipal councils, zilla parishads, gram panchayats etc.Earlier this month, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray after a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that the Centre is expected to take positive decisions on matters of Maratha and OBC reservation.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/former-maharashtra-cm-devendra-fadnavis-other-bjp-workers-detained-during-protests-over-obc-reservation-101624702342165.html

We note that the nurses are confronting the same concerns faced by nurses across the state, including the demands for safe patient care staffing, adequate planning by the hospitals to ensure a safe environment to reduce workplace violence, and an end to government attempts to have more contract nurses.”Shinde said that since the past few days beginning from June 21, the nurses had started the protest.She said, “On June 21 and 22 we just had a two-day strike and then since June 23 we have been on a complete strike. We spoke with Deshmukh who has agreed to implement all our demands with immediate effect except those that need a nod from the finance ministry which too he has agreed to put up in our favour.”The nurses at government hospitals including BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospitals were on a strike shutting down all services except the emergency services.One of the demands of the nurses was also to provide ₹50 lakh as ex-gratia to the families of the deceased nurses on the same line as given to doctors and also jobs to the family members as per the qualification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/nurses-call-off-strike-after-govt-agrees-to-their-demands-101624704959681.html
26-06-2021||Pune||Study suggests correlation between high levels of pollution and Covid-19 deaths||A study involving various experts from across the country found a correlation between high levels of pollution and Covid-19 deaths. The study shows that Maharashtra has recorded the second-highest annual particulate matter 2.5 emission loads in India and has also recorded the highest number of Covid-19 related deaths which indicates a link between air pollution and Covid-19, both of which directly impact the respiratory system.The study titled ‘Establishing a link between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) zones and Covid -19 over India based on anthropogenic emission sources and air quality data’ also provided the first evidence about how people living in highly polluted areas are vulnerable to Covid-19 infection.It is authored by Dr Saroj Kumar Sahu, PG environment sciences and Poonam Mangaraj, PG environment sciences from Utkal University, Bhubaneswar; Dr Gufran Beig, senior scientist; Suvarna Tikle, a scientist from IITM-Pune; Bhishma Tyagi, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela and V Vinoj, IIT-Bhubaneswar.In the study, Covid-19 cases were observed between March 2020 to November 2020, while national PM 2.5 emissions load were estimated from the base year 2019.For the study authors divided specific areas into different hotspot zones across India. From 16 cities across 36 states, Pune and Mumbai were the two cities picked from Maharashtra (falling under zone 6) for the study. Also, Pune and Mumbai are among the Covid-19 hotspots in the country, where high air pollution from the transport and industrial sectors are having a visible relationship with a higher number of Covid-19 cases and casualties.Dr Sahu said, “Our findings suggest a significant correlation between the district level air pollution data and Covid-19 cases. We found that regions with huge amounts of fossil fuel such as petrol, diesel, and coal among others. combustion in transport and industrial activities, also experiences a lot more Covid-19 cases, PM2.5 are small-sized particles affecting the upper respiratory system, and Covid-19 too has shown similar health impacts.”Air has suspended particulate matter (PM) of different sizes. Many of these are a complex mixture of dust, pollen, soot and smoke and they are hazardous. Of this, PM 2.5 is the smaller kind, with a diameter, not more than 2.5 micrometres (fine particles). PM2.5 is considered to have a very significant health impact as it can stay in the air for days or weeks, and is small enough to invade the lung airways.The study found that out of the 16 cities captured in the study, Pune and Mumbai recorded the third and fourth highest ‘bad air quality days’ respectively. Pune saw a total of 117 bad air quality days. Similarly, Mumbai saw 165 bad air quality days out of the total.Parallelly, Pune recorded 3.38 lakh Covid-19 cases and 7,060 deaths, while Mumbai recorded 2.64 lakh Covid-19 cases and 10,445 deaths during this period, which was the highest in the country.Dr Sahu highlighted that the study revealed that while Maharashtra was one of the leading industrialised and developed states with a high quantity of PM2.5 emissions, district-level emission estimation showed Mumbai was experiencing more pollution than Pune.Apart from Mumbai and Pune, the study also presented two other hotspots - Nagpur and Chandrapur - in Maharashtra that witnessed high pollution as well as higher Covid-19 cases and casualties.“Though these cities were not directly part of our study, both locations have the presence of industrial units and power plants that aggravate air pollution making them hotspots in Maharashtra,” said Dr Sahu.The study identified that Maharashtra has emerged as a dominating polluting state where the road transport sector plays an important role followed by industrial, thermal power plants and biomass burning among others.Dr Sahu added, “Through our analysis, it has become clear that rising pollution load is becoming more of a catalyst to aggravate the Covid-19 cases.”Dr Beig, senior scientist and founder project director, System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and co-author of the paper, said that at hotspots within Maharashtra exposure to daily air pollution can make a person’s lungs weak.“When human-induced emissions are added combined with the double impact of the Covid-19 virus, the damage to lungs will be much faster and worsen health conditions,” he said.Ashok A Shingare, member secretary, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), said, “By and large we are aware that if there are more pollutants in the air, there is a predominance of more pneumatic diseases in those regions. Considering the coronavirus impacts the pulmonary system, there has to be and is a clear correlation for health ailments emerging out of both air pollution and Covid-19. Keeping the transport sector as the major source of air pollution in Mumbai and Pune, we have leapfrogged from BS-IV to BS-VI but implementation and adoption of these new vehicles are lacking. There is a need for building more awareness and to keep economics in mind for faster adoption of BS-VI.”KEY CONCLUSIONS FROM THE STUDY1) Higher numbers of Covid-19 cases are found in states like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat amongst others where exposure to the prolonged high concentration of PM2.5 is relatively high.2) Major cities such as Pune, Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad and others experienced the highest number of Covid-19 cases. The PM2.5 emission loads are also higher over these areas due to fossil fuel-based human-induced activities.3) The results demonstrated that Covid-19 and PM2.5 emission load are indicating a significant correlation with reported cases and with resulting deaths.4) Transport and industrial sector was the major PM2.5 contributor in Maharashtra and correlated with the rise in Covid-19 cases.5) Present finding is crucial to frame further preparedness under the current situation to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic in densely populated states like Maharashtra. The results are helpful to slow down the spread of the virus by providing more preventive steps and resources in areas with high pollution levels for present situations as well as for future possibilities.6) Among solutions, the study highlighted that there was a need to go in for cleaner technology, better transport emission norms like Bharat Stage VI at the earliest, and ensure better coal technology like ultra-supercritical power plants to reduce particulate emissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/study-suggests-correlation-between-high-levels-of-pollution-and-covid-19-deaths-101624704779583.html

Mohol, on the other hand, issued a rebuttal and stated it as a way of diverting the issue.On being asked about the allegations followed by the anti-encroachment action in Ambil odha, Sule said that a proper inquiry of the matter should be done and the mayor should provide proper answers.“Pune mayor should answer how and why the anti-encroachment action was undertaken. If he cannot handle the responsibility then he should resign,” she said.This remark by Sule did not go well with Mohol who issued a rebuttal. “The statement is a way of diverting attention from the real issue. The real issue is who pressured the administration into undertaking the action. We handled the responsibility of fighting the Covid war and Ajit Pawar also praised our efforts. Maybe Sule doesn’t agree with him (Pawar),” said Mohol.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Mukund Kirdat, said, “BJP is politicising the issue. When PMC issued the appeal to vacate the homes, they asked residents to contact the builder (Kedar Associate) for rehabilitation. And said if the citizens would not shift, PMC will take action against them without any notice. If PMC officially announced the residents to approach the builder, then how can it now politicise the issue.”PMC in a press statement said, “It planned the action much before. The Ambil odha got shrunk and is U shape at the site. It was suggested to make it straight. PMC only planned action against 130 homes.”Sule blames BJP for misusing powerSupriya Sule blamed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for misusing the central agencies for political vendetta after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday conducted search operations at the residences of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in Nagpur and Mumbai in connection with a money laundering case. ‘It is really unfortunate the way central government is using these agencies. It is a threat to democracy,” said Sule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/supriya-sule-pune-mayor-muralidhar-mohol-engage-in-war-of-words-over-ambil-odha-anti-encroachment-drive-101624704600545.html

A few days back, it was 12-13 per day. Maximum calls are related to bed availability.Dr Manisha Naik, assistant medical officer, PMC, said, “The number of calls has dropped from 1,500 to 12-13 calls per day. So, we have decided to curtail staff. We sent teachers and engineers back to their original department. However, the war room is operational and will continue to attend to calls.”PMC had set up a 24x7 war room in March-2020 (during the first wave) to allocate beds to Covid patients in PMC/government hospitals. If a patient wants to get admitted to a private hospital, based on data from the Pune division dashboard, the patient is guided to a private hospital based on the availability of the beds.PMC has given a contract to Indohealth Software Solutions Pvt Ltd to run the war room during the first and second wave. It appointed doctors and teachers (from government schools) and engineers. The manpower was 136. There were 25 lines in operation at the peak. Earlier, the war room received 3,500 to 4,000 calls daily, and the team was able to receive 1,500 to 1,600 calls in a day. Maximum calls were related to bed availability inquiry.Now, the corporation reduced manpower up to 32 which includes doctors and private agency staff members. The corporation issued an order and sent back all teachers and engineers to their earlier work. At present, PMC is operating 14 lines to handle calls.HC notice to PMC over bad management of war roomIn May this year, the Bombay High Court had slapped a notice to PMC over the bad management of the war room. The high court was hearing a bunch of petitions related to Covid-19 management in the state to consider imposing a strict lockdown in Pune due to the high number of active cases. Thus, the PMC had submitted an affidavit to appraise the court of the improved situation in the city.Helpline numbers: 020-25502110-67801500||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-covid-19-war-room-sees-drop-in-calls-civic-body-to-curtail-staff-101624704420124.html
26-06-2021||Delhi||Calling up the AC service person? Welcome home the man in PPE suit!||If your doorbell rings and you spot someone all covered in full PPE kit, disposable shoe cover, hand gloves and double masks - on a usual occasion you would be taken aback! But the minute this person at the door identifies himself as a service guy to check/fix the air conditioner, denizens are jumping with joy. The reason being the high demand of AC service providers who have been running from pillar to post in Delhi’s sultry weather to attend the sudden spike in booking post lockdown. “My phone just doesn’t stop ringing. Every day I’m getting 150-200 calls,” says Sunil Kumar Soni, an electrician from Gurugram, adding, “Koi na koi call waiting chal rahi hoti hai; itne busy hai hum. We’re doing about 25 home visits since the lockdown opened. Humara staff ab dheere dheere aa raha hai kaam karne, jo ladke gaon chale gaye they toh usse thoda sahara hai. Par phir bhi, ek din me ek ladka 3-4 ghar visit kar raha hai. Itni demand hai!” Those denizens who had been surviving somehow in absence of AC at home, during the lockdown, didn’t waste a nano second to dial up the service men as soon as the city unlocked. And many say that it hasn’t been easy to get through since they are in huge demand. Chandana Das, a resident of Dwarka shares how her husband has been trying to get hold of an AC servicing guy since quite a few days now! “Initially we were all caught up with the trauma that the second wave of Covid-19 brought. We lost a few family members and emotionally were so shaken. Slowly when we started to bring ourselves back to normal, we realised that both the air conditioners in the house had conked off! And we were jolted back to reality to get them repaired soon since the kids are feeling restless in this sweaty summer. But each time my husband calls up the service centre, the line is engaged.” “Garmi kaafi bad gayi hain kuch din se toh sabko servicing karwani hi hai ACs ki. Pehle lockdown tha aur sab ghar ke andar the, kisi ko aane nahin de rahe the, is liye ab demand bad gayi hai,” says Asif, an AC service provider in Delhi-NCR, adding: “We’re getting four to five confirmed leads among 10-15 calls every day. Still we have not increased the rates, jo pehle lete the wohi le rahe hain. Do paise kam ki kama kar rahe hai.”Gulam, who provides AC servicing for home and at gyms across Delhi-NCR, shares how his team is ensuring to follow the Covid-19 safety protocols. “We have provided our team PPE Kits, masks, sanitisers, and disposable shoe covers. Aise toh hum kahin jaate hi nahin. Log ghusne bhi nahin dete jab tak unko santushti nahi ho ki humne sare precautions liye hai. Jinke ghar medical condition wale patients hote hain, woh khud hi keh dete hain ki PPE kit pehen ke aana, and we don’t charge them extra for it. Ab ye bimari toh aisi hai ki sabke sath hai, aur garmi bhi bahut hai toh per day 12-15 service calls bhi lene padein to hum le rahe hain.” Some AC service providers say that denizens have been so paranoid that if the mask slips, they send them back! “They are very careful and don’t want to take any risk. Ek baar mera mask gir gaya gaya toh jinke ghar me tha unhone wapis bhej diya hain kyunki mere pas extra mask nahin tha,” shares Gulam, and Raj Singh Pana, but another AC servicing provider, opines that people have suddenly become less careful. “100 se zyada phone aa rahe hain because of the hot weather. Ab toh aisa lag raha hain ki Covid hain hi nahin. But we are very careful on our own, hume apna dhyan khud rakhna chahiye.” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/calling-up-the-ac-service-person-welcome-home-the-man-in-ppe-suit-101624702749401.html

The farmers' protest, also reported to be the largest in history, completed seven months on Saturday. They began the protest in the national capital by camping at the Singhu border between Delhi and Haryana and at the other two borders namely Tikri and Ghazipur.Also read: News of Rakesh Tikait's arrest 'incorrect’, clarifies Delhi PoliceIn view of protest and amped-up security, the Delhi Metro closed its three main stations on the Yellow Line for four hours on Saturday."As advised by Delhi Police, in view of security reasons, three Metro stations of Yellow Line namely, Vishwavidyalaya, Civil Lines and Vidhan Sabha will remain closed for public from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm tomorrow i.e, 26.06.2021 (Saturday)," the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) tweeted Friday night."Kheti Bachao, Loktantra Bachao Diwas" (save agriculture, save democracy) is being marked all over the country on Saturday to signify the completion of seven months of the farmers' agitation and 46 years after the promulgation of the Emergency in India in 1975, as per a statement by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 protesting farmers' union, reported PTI.Farmers across the country plan to march in rallies to Raj Bhavans in different states on Saturday and to express solidarity, one such rally is also being planned in Massachusetts, USA, PTI reported the statement as saying.Thousands of farmers from Saharanpur and Sisauli in western Uttar Pradesh reached Ghazipur gate led by the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Rakesh Tikait. While, farmers growing wheat, sugarcane, mango, apple, green gram, paddy, jowar and others continue to protest in different parts of the country for remunerative guaranteed prices, the statement added.Earlier on January 26, the farmers' protest took an unexpected turn after the march derailed from the planned route and a group of agitators took over the Red Fort leading to clashes in the national capital.Farmers have been protesting at the borders of the Capital against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020, passed by the Parliament in September 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-protest-delhi-police-amps-up-security-at-border-locations-101624698942382.html
26-06-2021||Bangalore||Three more mins ‘baby’ not cool! Exam invigilator remark — concern or brouhaha?||Even after completing her exam before time, a student of Bengaluru’s Christ University was shaking. It wasn’t due to the worry of how she would fare in her results, but the fact that when she informed her invigilator that she’s done writing the online exam and sought permission to leave, in reply she read the words “3 more minutes, baby”. The student, who then took to social media to share a screen grab of this incident, reportedly spoke to other professors in her college and even filed a complaint, but the college hasn’t issued a public statement yet. In fact, when other students started sharing their opinions on social media, and we approached them, many refused to comment saying they have “instructed by the college to not to talk to anyone” on this matter. So, on condition of anonymity, a student from the same college, tells us: “We use a software called mettle that assigns us a proctor (invigilator) who is there to monitor us while we write the exam. The problem with the software is that the proctor can see everything we’re doing while we’re writing our papers but we don’t know anything about who is there behind the camera. Even I’ve been told to lower my camera several times during exams but I never thought about it in a negative light till this incident happened.” The students who decided to speak to us, were disappointed with the way that the college authorities dealt with this concern even after a formal complaint. Stating how these events impact their mental health, many made several calls made to the university but to no avail. “The student we are talking about, first shared this anonymously and later revealed her identity. Then, more and more students came out sharing similar problems. Seeing how the college took no action initially, we had to bring it to the media and put it out there. After all this effort, the university finally decided to look into the matter. But I’m very disappointed that it took us so much of effort to actually get this case noticed by our university,” says another student at Christ, opining, “As a teacher, one needs to think before they speak and utter such words. Because it’s certainly not cool to talk like this!”Students across the country, from various universities, have been asking for the redressal of this issue, on social media. An undergraduate student of Delhi University, on the condition of anonymity, shares a similar experience, stating: “In one of my digital classes my professor made me and the girls in the class extremely uncomfortable by asking us to switch on the camera continuously. And not the boys, but only we were being asked to open the cameras. The way he talks to us and jokes with us in the class also made us extremely uncomfortable. It’s difficult when teachers behave this way as we see them as an authority source and feel scared and are unable to speak up because of the fear of repercussions.” Even the student unions are angered by the way the incident has been dealt with. “Students want their college to be a place of safety and demand transparency in the system. And this is not the first such complaint filed by students,” says Manish Govind Raj, state general secretary of NSUI Karnataka, adding, “The university settled the matter with the local authorities and the parents of the student who wanted to take this up further but were not allowed to. As a student and a youth leader, I don’t understand why this should be continued. When we asked them (the university) on what happens if we refuse to take the exams online in this way, all they say is take it offline without any clarity on when and how it will be facilitated. I’m sure they can be a little more sensitive that this.”Some opine that all this is just brouhaha considering it's common to use words such as “dear” when in a conversational tone. Nevertheless, it does leave a bad impression on a young mind. Gitanjali Lall, a psychologist, says, “For students to address such a concern or talk about such an incident takes a lot of courage. I feel the college should try to rehabilitate them and help them instead of shunning the subject... With digital media and online cyber bullying so common, students going through such cyber bullying must be taken care of immediately. It can have a lasting impact on their mental health and how they perceive themselves or their image.” (With inputs by Aprajita Sharad)Author tweets @somyasureshFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/three-more-mins-baby-not-cool-exam-invigilator-remark-concern-or-brouhaha-101624698960875.html

Officials said the scheme was launched in 2017-18 to improve security related infrastructure in these districts. The demand for its continuation was raised during a meeting the Union home ministry held with representatives of Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra and Telangana on Friday.“Though the scheme was intended for three years, the Chhattisgarh government requested its continuation. In the first year, Chhattisgarh got ₹5 crore for each district... ₹33.33 crore each for eight districts was provided in the second and third year. This year, we got ₹14.5 crore each for each district hence we requested continuation of the funds because many security-related infrastructures are being built in these districts,” said special director general (planning), Chhattisgarh Police, RK Vij. Vij added sectoral allocation of the money to eight districts includes around 35% for roads. “The fund is very important for a state like Chhattisgarh because we have a maximum number of Maoist affected districts and infrastructure is very important in these areas,” Vij added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chhattisgarh-seeks-continuation-of-special-assistance-scheme-for-maoist-insurgency-hit-districts-101624698719431.html

He has recovered from the infection,” said Mohapatra.A 62-year-old male from Deogarh district was among the 48 cases of Delta Plus in the country after genome sequencing of the virus was conducted by laboratories.Scientists at the Institute of Life Sciences in Bhubaneswar, where the genome sequencing was done in the second week of May, however, did not find any other case of Delta Plus variant even though 600 cases of genome sequencing were conducted after that.Delta plus (B.1.617.2.1/(AY.1), said to be a variant with increased transmissibility, is the latest in the long list of new mutant forms of the Delta strain with health experts warning that it may lead to a third wave of the pandemic in the country.So far, Maharashtra, which was the worst-hit state in the second surge of the Covid-19 pandemic, has detected 20 cases, the maximum number of Delta Plus positives. Tamil Nadu comes second with 9 cases and Madhya Pradesh with 7 cases.Director, health services, Dr Bijay Moahapatra said there was no cause for concern and the third wave of the Covid -19 pandemic can be predicted before it arrives in Odisha. “The effects of the first and the second waves were felt in Delhi and Mumbai first and later in Odisha. So, we can well predict the arrival of the third wave but we have to be cautious and prepared,” he said.On Friday, Odisha reported 2,912 fresh cases of Covid-19 as the TPR dropped to 4.53, indicating a decline in the Covid wave. Several districts, however, like Khurda, Jajpur, Balasore and Cuttack continued to report a test positivity rate (TPR) above 5.

Sukhbir appeared for questioning at the Punjab Police Officers’ Institute building in Sector 32, Chandigarh, amid a show of solidarity by the senior leadership of the party. All Shiromani Akali Dal core committee members and MLAs were present at the venue. Also read: 2015 police firing case: Officer who landed in controversy during Badal’s quizzing quits as SIT’s legal expertThe three members of the SIT, led by additional director general of police (ADGP), vigilance, LK Yadav are questioning Sukhbir, it is learnt. Initially, the police did not allow the senior SAD leaders to go inside the building where Sukhbir was to be questioned. Later, the security officials relented and allowed the core committee members and the MLAs to go inside the building, where they were seated in a hall, it is learnt. Badal Senior questioned on June 22 On June 22, Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal was questioned at his official MLA flat in Chandigarh on his role in the police firing case. The SIT had earlier summoned Badal for questioning at a rest house in Mohali on June 16, but he requested to put off the date of his appearance, citing ill-health and old age. The date of the questioning was rescheduled and it was decided that the SIT will question the five-time Punjab chief minister at his official MLA flat in Chandigarh. Parkash Singh Badal was the chief minister when the three incidents of sacrilege took place in Faridkot district in 2015, leading to resentment and protests and triggering the police firing. The state government set up the new SIT, led by Yadav, to probe the Kotkapura incident following the Punjab and Haryana high court’s directions on April 9 that quashed a report by the previous SIT. The previous SIT, led by special DGP Parbodh Kumar included then IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. It had also questioned Parkash Singh Badal in the same case in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-ex-deputy-cm-sukhbir-badal-questioned-for-kotkapura-police-firing-101624695418863.html
26-06-2021||Delhi||'Fight over, can we do some work?': Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal to Centre amid row over oxygen||A day after Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party sparred over an interim report by a Supreme Court-appointed panel to look into oxygen crisis in the Capital during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday hit back again. This time, Kejriwal called on the Centre to work together "so that no one is short of oxygen in the third wave.""If your fight over oxygen is over, can we get back to work? Let's make such a system together that there is no shortage of oxygen in the third wave. In the second wave, people suffered a severe shortage of oxygen. Now, this should not happen in the third wave," the Aam Aadmi Party leader tweeted in Hindi. "If we fight amongst ourselves then Corona will win. If we fight together, the country will win," he added.In the report on Friday, the Supreme Court-appointed audit panel said that the Delhi government exaggerated its oxygen requirement by four times in April and May. However, the Delhi government rejected the claims and, in turn, accused the BJP of misleading people. Manish Sisodia, Delhi's deputy chief minister, said that findings of the audit committee "do not exist." "We have heard of a so-called report that claims oxygen demand in Delhi was exaggerated. BJP leaders have been citing such a report against the AAP government. The truth is: There is no such report. The BJP is misleading people. No such report exists. The BJP is lying," Sisodia said in a video press briefing on Friday.BJP's Delhi unit president Adesh Gupta said that the Centre provided the Delhi government more than what was required. But "due to the mismanagement by the city government, there were instances when some places reported only 48 hours' oxygen left in stock, while somewhere else, it was just for 48 minutes," he claimed.On Saturday, Dr Randeep Guleria, the director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences who led the panel, said it would not be correct to say that Delhi "exaggerated" its oxygen needs. Guleria made the comments while speaking to television news channel NDTV. He also said that the oxygen audit is an "interim report," and we should wait for the final version, according to the NDTV report.Delhi faced an acute shortage of medical oxygen and other key supplies as the Covid-19 second wave created havoc in the country. Several big hospitals of the city sent SOS calls reporting a shortage of oxygen even as the Delhi government blamed the Centre for inadequate allocation of the gas by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fight-over-can-we-do-some-work-arvind-kejriwal-to-centre-amid-row-over-oxyg-101624695143045.html
26-06-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal administrative officer accuses MLA husband of torture||Oshin Sharma, a Himachal Pradesh Administrative Service (HPAS) officer, has accused her husband and Dharamshala legislator Vishal Nehria of physical and mental torture. Sharma, who is posted at the District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) office in Dharamshala, has lodged a complaint with the police and sought protection. Also read: India records highest weekly vaccination with over 3.3 crore jabs administeredIn an 11-minute video that is being shared widely on social media, the 2019-batch officer alleged that Nehria had slapped her thrice on Thursday in front of his family members. Sharma said it was not the first time that he has physically assaulted her but such things have happened several times even before their wedding. The couple tied the knot only two months ago on April 26. Sharma, who has now returned to her maternal house, said she was friendly with Nehria since their college days and he would often assault her even then. “Due to his violent behaviour, I broke up with him. After becoming MLA in 2019, he started pursuing me. I refused for two years. However, later I thought of giving our relationship another chance,” she said. Sharma alleged that Nehria had beaten her at a Chandigarh hotel in February and just four days after the marriage, he threw her out of the house when she was Covid-positive. She claimed that Nehria hurts himself in fits of rage. The woman officer alleged that Nehria was also pressurising her to have a child, while she told him that he was not mentally fit to be a father. She alleged that his mother also humiliated her parents several times, while Nehria made dowry demands, saying he was not happy with the gifts her family had given at the wedding. “My purpose for making the video is just that if he does something to himself, I should not be held responsible,” said Sharma, expressing threat to her and her parents’ safety. Kangra superintendent of police Vimukt Ranjan confirmed having received a complaint from the woman officer. “We will probe it and call them to record their statements,” he said. Despite repeated calls, Nehria did not answer the phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-administrative-officer-accuses-mla-husband-of-torture-101624694639225.html

He reached the Punjab police officers' institute at Sector 32 in Chandigarh at around 11am following a summons by the SIT.Badal was the deputy chief minister and holding the home portfolio when incidents of desecration of religious texts and the subsequent police firing at people protesting against it had taken place in Faridkot in 2015.Several senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders, including Bikram Singh Majithia, Balwinder Singh Bhundar, N K Sharma, and Daljit Singh Cheema, reached the Punjab Police Officers Institute in a show of support to Badal.On Tuesday, the SIT led by Additional Director General of Police (Vigilance Bureau) L K Yadav had questioned Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch and former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal for two-and-a-half hours.The Punjab government had formed the new SIT to probe the Kotkapura police firing incident following the directions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.The new SIT is investigating the two FIRs registered on October 14, 2015, and August 7, 2018, in connection with the Kotkapura incident.The high court had on April 9 this year quashed a report by an earlier Punjab Police SIT into the firing at people protesting in Kotkapura in 2015 over the alleged desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in Faridkot district.Police had also opened fire at a similar demonstration in Behbal Kalan, also in Faridkot, where two people were killed. A separate probe is underway in that case.Meanwhile, Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Saturday slammed Sukhbir Singh Badal and said the new SIT “inches closer to justice for Punjab's soul.”Sidhu tweeted, “6 Yrs since sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib Ji... No Justice in 2 yrs of your rule... No Justice in the following 4.5 yrs... Today, New SIT inches closer to Justice for Punjab's Soul & you cry of political interference... Political interference was that which delayed Justice by 6 yrs."Sidhu tagged the tweet of Sukhbir Singh Badal in which the former deputy chief minister accused Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh of implicating the SAD leadership in false cases at the alleged instance of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi."While farmers suffer, CM is busy keeping Gandhi family happy & has accepted @RahulGandhi's directive to implicate SAD leadership in false cases. New SIT formed after the old one was indicted over political interference, is being run by state vigilance dept, so nothing has changed,” Sukhbir had said in a tweet on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-chief-sukhbir-badal-appears-before-sit-probing-2015-kotkapura-firing-case-101624691483292.html

This amount was allegedly sent to companies allegedly directly linked to Deshmukh’s kin.Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya tweeted on Saturday: “#Vaze #Vasooli case #AnilDeshmukh Secrataries Sanjeev Palande & Kundan Shinde arrested by ED today. I am sure Anil Deshmukh will be arrested in next few days.”On Friday, the anti-money laundering agency raided five places including Deshmukh’s residences in Mumbai and Nagpur.Deshmukh again denied all the allegations levelled against him, calling them false.Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh has accused Deshmukh of ordering policemen to collect ₹100 crore from businesses in Mumbai. The allegation forced Deshmukh to resign as the state home minister.Deshmukh maintained Singh levelled the accusation against him after the latter was removed as the commissioner for his poor handling of the bomb scare outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house. He said he is cooperating with ED, which is expected to summon him for questioning.The money laundering case against Deshmukh was filed based on the First Information Report registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against him under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on April 21.The CBI started the probe against Deshmukh after Singh wrote a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in March and made the allegations.

The actor and MP was 'vaccinated' four days ago at a camp organised in the city's Kasba area, soon after which she became suspicious of the process and informed the police, eventually leading to the fraudulent operation being busted.Also Read | Fake vaccination drive: TMC MP Sen clarifies after photos with accused surfaceEarlier, the Parliamentarian had taken to her social media handle to assure people that the vaccines, albeit fake, were not harmful. Chakraborty informed that the vials being used at the camp have been sent to the lab for testing and results are expected in the next 4-5 days.The 'fake vaccine' case in Kolkata has been making the headlines for a while now. Impersonating as an IAS officer, one Debanjan Deb held two vaccine camps in the city where thousands of people, including TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty, are believed to have been taken their jabs. After the operation was busted, the cops seized fake labels pasted on several vials of an antibiotic injection used in place of the vaccines.Also Read | Kolkata vaccine fraud: BJP's Suvendu Adhikari demands immediate probeMimi Chakraborty fell ill on Saturday, four days after she received her jab at the supposed vaccination site. The actor-turned-politician's house physician was summoned to the residence early this morning, HT Bangla reports, adding that her medical complications include acute stomach ache and profuse sweating. Although she has received medical advice to get herself admitted to a hospital, Mimi has reportedly refused, opting for home treatment instead.It has been reported that the Trinamool MP had some previous medical conditions -- gallbladder sludge and a sluggish liver. However, it is not yet known if the 'vaccine' doses she received -- probable antibacterial injections -- triggered any adverse side effects.Mimi Chakraborty, who was invited to attend the camp earlier in the week, said she became suspicious about the vaccination process as she did not receive the customary SMS that is sent to people after they are administered a dose, and informed the police. However, she had already received her jab by then.The Kolkata police later said that Debanjan Deb, the person behind the fraud, had been impersonating as a joint commissioner of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) for the last four months and has duped a few people of several lakhs of rupees on the pretext of helping them get tenders of the civic body. It was with this money that he was organising the fake vaccine camps, the police indicated, adding that further investigation into the case is underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-mp-mimi-chakraborty-falls-ill-days-after-taking-jab-at-fake-covid-19-vaccine-camp-in-kolkata-101624683143632.html

The trees were felled on an order issued this month by the executive officer of the Tangla Town Committee to five residents. “The droppings of egrets nesting on bamboo trees in your property have led to unhygienic conditions and could lead to spread of Corona infection,” said the order issued on June 8. “Residents in the neighbourhood are living in unhygienic conditions (because of the droppings). Therefore, you are directed to cut the bamboo trees in your property, which falls in the town’s area, and help create a healthy environment,” the order added. After the residents did not cut the trees, the town committee went ahead and felled them on Thursday. This led to the destruction of the egret nests and many eggs, hatchlings fell on the ground. Photos and videos showing the hatchlings lying dead or injured on the ground went viral on social media prompting Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma to direct forest and environment minister Parimal Suklabaidya to inquire into the matter. On Friday, Udalguri deputy commissioner P Uday Praveen visited the area and took stock of the incident. He has directed the circle officer of the area to prepare a report on the incident. “We have not been able to ascertain how many hatchlings and birds died as local residents took away some of them from the site after the bamboo trees were felled. We were able to rescue 88 hatchlings on Friday and send them to the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) in Kaziranga,” Praveen said. “Instructions have been issued to local people to protect the birds and directions issued to the town committee not to carry out further felling of bamboo trees. We have kept a team at the spot to monitor the site,” he added. The birds that died were from three species, Cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis), Little egret (Egretta garzetta) and Little cormorant (Microcarbo niger). All of them are protected under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. “The death of the birds was due to sheer lack of education on the part of members of the Tangla town committee. It is ridiculous that they don’t know how Covid19 spreads,” said Rathin Barman, joint director of Wildlife Trust of India. Officials at CWRC, where the rescued hatchlings were taken, said the condition of nearly 60 of the 88 birds was precarious and many might not survive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nearly-200-egrets-cormorant-hatchlings-die-after-assam-town-committee-fells-bamboo-trees-over-the-fear-of-covid-spread-101624679698171.html

26-06-2021||Kolkata||BJP, TMC trade charges over fake Covid-19 jab drive, police form SIT||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the fake vaccination scam and the alleged links of the accused with the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders after photographs of the accused with the top TMC leaders went viral.“Kolkata’s outgoing mayor and other senior leaders including ministers are associated with this. All persons who are linked to this man should be arrested. There should be a CBI probe,” said Dilip Ghosh, BJP’s state unit president.Dismissing the allegation, TMC leader and outgoing mayor Firhad Hakim, whose photo with the accused went viral, said: “It is not possible to check the credentials of each and every person you come across in a public programme.”On June 23, the Kolkata Police busted a fake Covid-19 vaccination centre and arrested one Debanjan Deb (28), for posing as an IAS officer associated with the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and organising a few camps where at least 600 people, including Trinamool Congress MP Mimi Chakraborty, are suspected to have been inoculated. The number could rise. On Friday, the Kolkata Police formed a Special Investigation Team, headed by a deputy commissioner, to probe the case.Soon after Deb’s arrest, pictures of him with TMC ministers, including Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee and others went viral, triggering a slugfest.It was also found that the name of Deb, along with other TMC MPs, was engraved on the stone plaque of a bust of Rabindranath Tagore installed at a ward in Kolkata in February.TMC has denied the presence of its leaders at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-tmc-trade-charges-over-fake-covid-19-jab-drive-police-form-sit-101624663327026.html
26-06-2021||Dehradun||Char Dham limited to locals after HC rap||The Uttarakhand government has for now decided to open the Char Dham yatra only for the locals of the three districts where the shrines are located, hours after the high court reprimanded it for allowing the pilgrimage amid concerns that a third Covid wave is round the corner.The decision was taken by the state government during a cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Friday. “From July 1, locals from three districts where the Char Dham shrines are located, would be allowed to visit them. They would have to carry either RT-PCR report... there would a daily limit on the number of pilgrims to be allowed to visit the shrines. That would be decided in an SOP to be issued soon...,” said state government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal.“A special official would also be appointed for each of the four shrines in coordination with the respective district administrations and Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board to monitor the pilgrimage.” He added that all the priests of four shrines would be vaccinated.Earlier in the day, a bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Verma nudged the state to instead opt for live streaming of the ceremonies at the Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri shrines.“Perhaps the Char Dham Yatra needs to be postponed or cancelled, as already the Amarnath Yatra has been cancelled by the Jammu & Kashmir administration,” it said.“Considering the fact that large gathering invariably leads to a spike in the Covid-19 pandemic, this court is of the firm opinion that a catastrophe like Covid-19 pandemic should not be re-invited by holding and permitting large gathering at religious shrines, and by permitting the Char Dham yatra by the state,” the high court said.The Char Dham yatra, scheduled to start on May 14, was deferred on April 29 in view of the spike in Covid cases. On June 20, the state said the yatra would begin from July 1 for local residents, and pilgrims from other parts of the state from July 11.“Already holding of Kumbh Mela, and in permitting a large congregation of lakhs of people on Ganga Dussehra at Har-ki-Pauri at Haridwar are clear-cut proof of the failure of the civil administration... Once the devotees start gathering in large numbers, invariably the first victim is the SOP itself; the second victims are the people at large”, said the judges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/char-dham-limited-to-locals-after-hc-rap-101624662711333.html
26-06-2021||Delhi||Search on for relatives behind hate crime on Dwarka couple||In a suspected hate crime, a 23-year-old man was killed and his 19-year-old wife seriously injured after at least six men, including the woman’s three family members, opened fire at them in Amberhai village in Dwarka’s Sector 19 on Thursday night, police said. In all, at least 11 bullets were fired at the husband and wife from two pistols, they said.Police said the couple, Vinay Dahiya and Kiran from Gopalpur village in Haryana’s Sonepat, eloped in August last year and had a court wedding, despite their families strongly opposing the match as they belonged to the same village and the same gotra (lineage). Dahiya’s family members said a marriage between those of the same gotra is prohibited in the village as it is considered “incestuous”.A panchayat held in the village nearly 20 days after their wedding barred the couple from entering the village and their families were directed not to meet or contact the couple, Dahiya’s family said.Soon after their wedding, the couple approached the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking police protection as they feared for their lives. The court directed the Sonepat police to provide protection, but when HT checked, a senior Sonepat police officer, on condition of anonymity, said the couple never approached them for the protection. Sonepat SP Jashandeep Randhawa could not be reached for comment.The couple moved to Delhi and were living in rented accommodations in Amberhai village, police said. Dahiya owned a taxi and was employed by a private airline company. Kiran was pregnant but had a miscarriage two-three days ago, said Dahiya’s father Om Prakash.“Around 8.30pm Thursday, the two were in their first-floor apartment when three to four men came knocking and as soon as Kiran opened the door, they fired at her. At least four bullets were fired, three of which hit Kiran while one hit her husband,” said a police officer, quoting Kiran’s statement.“The injured couple ran for their lives. While Kiran ran towards the terrace, Dahiya rushed outside, with his attackers giving chase. On reaching the terrace, Kiran looked down to see her husband being chased down the lane and she began screaming for help,” said the couple’s landlady Jyoti Mudgal.“I too saw Dahiya running out and three men chasing him. Three or four more men were waiting outside. They chased Dahiya and shot him dead outside a boutique shop nearby,” said Mudgal, adding that Kiran scaled the terrace’s iron railing and crossed over to the adjacent building to save herself.Kiran climbed down that building and kept screaming for help. The building’s caretaker, Basanti, saw Kiran bleeding and alerted residents of that building. One of them called the police.“I was shaken to see the woman soaked in blood. She was pleading with us to save her and her husband. A police team arrived soon after and took her to the hospital,” said Basanti.One of the five cameras in the lane caught the men running down the lane. Although the footage is grainy, at least two men can be seen firing guns, police said.DCP (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said Dahiya was rushed to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital, where he was declared brought dead. He suffered four gunshot wounds to his chest and abdomen, while Kiran was shot three times in the neck and abdomen. “Kiran’s statement has been recorded. She said her brother Aman, cousin Vicky and uncle Shakti were involved in the attack,” said the DCP.“We have registered a case of murder, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy at the Dwarka Sector 23 police station and are looking for the attackers, who came in a Scorpio SUV owned by Kiran’s uncle Shakti. Her father and another uncle are being questioned,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/search-on-for-relatives-behind-hate-crime-on-dwarka-couple-101624660005219.html

26-06-2021||Delhi||Oxygen report fuels war of words in Delhi||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) not to call residents of the national capital “liars”, and said that when the party was busy with election campaigns, he was fighting to arrange oxygen for the people.His remarks were in response to a political battle over an interim report by a Supreme Court (SC)-appointed panel to look into Delhi’s oxygen crisis in April-May. The report said Delhi’s administrations and hospitals exaggerated the demand for medical oxygen, which the BJP drew on to attack the CM.Kejriwal on Friday tweeted, “My fault was that I fought for 2 crore (20 million) Delhi residents. When you [BJP leaders] were busy with election campaigns, I was awake all night arranging medical oxygen. I fought, I begged to ensure oxygen for people of Delhi. People have lost their dear ones due to oxygen shortage. At least don’t call them liars, they will feel terrible about it.”Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday also accused the BJP of misleading people and said that the purported findings did not exist as a legitimate, endorsed report of SC-appointed committee to audit the medical oxygen demand during the Covid-19 surge.“It is unbelievable to see that Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi government politicised oxygen supply when Covid was at its peak. This is such petty politics. The data presented by Oxygen Audit Committee in the report is shocking,” BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra said in a press conference on Friday.“How can someone politicise oxygen? How can someone play with life like this? This is criminal negligence. This is a conspiracy,” Patra said.He accused chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of creating a “false alarm and spreading panic across the country”. Patra blamed Kejriwal and his government for the lives lost in Delhi due to the oxygen shortage. “He should feel guilty of ruining lives.” Patra said Kejriwal will be held accountable and punished for “his criminal negligence and conspiracy”.Meanwhile, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “It is now clear that the government exaggerated the demand for oxygen in the city. It was a conspiracy and done to create panic among people during the peak of the second wave. The Delhi government did nothing to augment the oxygen supply. It didn’t get tankers on time and install oxygen plants approved by the Centre. It just blamed the Centre for everything.”However, deputy chief minister Sisodia said that the BJP’s statements were ‘misleading’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/oxygen-report-fuels-war-of-words-in-delhi-101624658623799.html
26-06-2021||Mumbai||Owner of tugboat that sank during Tauktae booked||A case of culpable homicide has been registered in Mumbai against the owner of Varaprada tugboat that sank in the Arabian Sea during last month’s Cyclone Tauktae, in which 11 persons were killed, an official said on Friday. Barge P305 and Varaprada -- both support vessels working for the state-run ONGC’s offshore oilfields near Mumbai -- had borne the brunt of the cyclone, which made landfall on Gujarat coast on May 17.“At least 11 personnel, who were working on the tugboat, had died in the incident. During the rescue operation, two of its workmen were rescued by the navy teams,” the official said.A first information report (FIR) was filed under sections 304(2) (culpable homicide) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the tugboat owner on Thursday at the Yellow Gate police station on the complaint of chief engineer of the boat and a survivor, he said.Nobody has been arrested in this connection so far and the probe is underway, he added.A total of 274 crew were reported missing on May 17 (261 from Barge P305 and 13 from Tug Varaprada). While 186 survivors from P305 and two from Varaprada were picked up at sea, 70 bodies were recovered by ships of the Indian Navy and coast guard. Besides, eight bodies were recovered along the coast in Raigad district of Maharashtra, officials had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/owner-of-tugboat-that-sank-during-tauktae-booked-101624657618459.html
26-06-2021||Delhi||Political row erupts over Delhi ‘O2 audit’||A political battle has broken out between Delhi’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over an interim report by a group under the Supreme Court-appointed panel to audit oxygen utilisation in the Capital -- even as questions remained about whether this version of the report was meant for submission to the court, and whether everyone in the panel had signed off on it.The report suggested there was “gross discrepancy” in recording the requirement of medical oxygen by 183 of Delhi’s hospitals, which asked for 1140MT as opposed to the actual requirement of 209MT. It also assessed the oxygen demand in a meeting on May 13 as 290-400MT at a time when representatives of the state government continued to seek 500MT of oxygen.The Delhi government has said that the report was invalid, and its findings incorrect.“The Supreme Court set up an oxygen audit committee. We spoke to members of the committee. They said that they have not approved or signed any report till now. Then what report is it? Where has it come from? I challenge the BJP to get a report which has been signed and approved by the oxygen audit committee,” Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said.The panel is technically a subgroup headed by AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria. Its other members are Subodh Yadav, a joint secretary in the Jal Shakti ministry, Dr Sandeep Budhiraja from Max Healthcare, Bhupinder S Bhalla, principal secretary, home, Delhi government, and Sanjay Kumar Singh, the controller of explosives at the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO).Dr Guleria could not immediately be reached for comment. In the annexures attached with the report, two of the members — Dr Budhiraja and Bhalla — submitted discordant notes on the procedure and details of the findings. They also could not be reached for comments, but an internal note by Bhalla on Friday evening suggested some of the members of the panel had not approved the report.The BJP was quick to respond to the leaked report. “It is unbelievable to see that Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi government politicised oxygen supply when Covid was at its peak. This is such petty politics. The data presented by Oxygen Audit Committee in the report is shocking,” party’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra said in a press conference.“The demand for four times more oxygen was made by the Delhi government, due to which the oxygen tankers remained on the road. Had this oxygen been used in other states, many lives could have been saved. This is a heinous crime committed by Arvind Kejriwal ji,” he added.Also read | Over 166,000 get Covid-19 jabs in Delhi as drive hits another one-day highThe Delhi CM shot back. “My crime — I fought for the breath of my two crore people. When you were doing an election rally, I was awake all night arranging for oxygen. I fought, pleaded to get oxygen for people. People have lost their loved ones due to lack of oxygen. Don’t call them liars, they are feeling so bad,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.The controversial report marks the latest chapter in a long-running spat between the Union government and the Delhi government that has been fought across the Delhi high court and the Supreme Court. The Delhi government’s position, in the arguments in court, held against the backdrop of the raging second wave of the coronavirus disease pandemic in the Capital, was that the Union government was not allocating it enough oxygen. The Centre’s position was that Delhi’s needs were overstated and that the local government wasn’t able to lift supplies that had been allocated to it.With social media filled with pleas of people and hospitals scrambling for oxygen, the courts stepped in. While the issue was resolved with Delhi finally receiving adequate oxygen, the apex court also constituted an expert panel to look into the usage of the precious medical commodity. The interim findings of the audit subgroup of that panel, now leaked, have become the subject of controversy.In a response in the report itself, the Delhi government describes the panel’s proceedings as “a perfunctory desktop exercise, conducted hurriedly” which resulted in “erroneous entries and even more erroneous conclusions”. Terming the allegation of excess supply “incorrect,” it told the panel that it was “sad and shocking” that the panel arrived as “sweeping conclusions” without lending it an opportunity to explain.The subgroup was constituted by the Supreme Court-appointed 12-member national task force. The task force was set up by the apex court on May 8 when the bench, led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, called for an immediate oxygen utilisation audit in Delhi. At the same time, the bench also directed that Delhi should get 700 metric tonne (MT) of the life-saving medical input every day despite the Union government’s reluctance.The interim report -- HT has seen a copy -- cited a study by PESO and responses, gathered via Delhi government officials, from 183 hospitals in the national capital regarding their oxygen requirement to observe that while this data claimed actual consumption of oxygen as 1,140 MT on May 12, it turned out to be just 209 MT after correcting faulty reporting by four city hospitals.If the Centre-recommended formula for oxygen allotment was employed, the requirement would have been 289MT and with the Delhi government’s formula, it would have been 391 MT, stated the report.It noted that four hospitals, Singhal Hospital, Aruna Asaf Ali Government Hospital, ESIC Model Hospital and Liferays Hospital erroneously claimed extremely high oxygen consumption with very few beds, “leading to extremely skewed information and significantly higher oxygen requirement for entire state of Delhi”.HT has reached out to the four hospitals and while representatives of two of them did not offer a comment, the others said they did not use liquid medical oxygen and were unaware of what was claimed in the report.The subgroup’s report was submitted to the court by the Union health ministry. An official, who asked not to be named, said the health ministry had no role in the drafting and only “played the role of a messenger”. “A committee cannot directly approach the Supreme Court to submit the report. It was submitted to the health ministry, which, through its appointed nodal officer for the purpose, helped place it before the Supreme Court,” the official said.This person said the committee decided its own methodology and designed the necessary template “that they approached hospitals directly to fill”.The panel met seven times between May 11 and May 21.The panel cited a PESO study that contended that actual requirement of Delhi during the peak of second Covid-19 wave was much less than what was demanded, making other states such as Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir “suffer badly”. The report, prepared after carrying out a study between May 5 and 11, also contended that AAP government was neither auditing its usage of oxygen nor was assessing its realistic demand.The interim report attached documentary replies of the Delhi government to the findings of the subgroup as well as to the PESO report.Disagreeing with the formula used by the subgroup to compute oxygen requirement, the Delhi government, in its communication to the panel, said: “The finding that Delhi received excess oxygen is incorrect. Delhi has never received excess oxygen. Only on May 5, it received 730 MT which was more than its requirement. Moreover, the oxygen requirement is dynamic and as soon as Delhi’s requirement decreased, a proactive communication was sent to the Central government restating its current requirement.”In another letter, it added: “The manner in which the proceedings of the subgroup have been conducted, suggests that the purpose of proceedings was to justify a preconceived and predetermined conclusion and narrative, to recommend a lower quantity of a LMO to Delhi, and to further portray an impression that the assessment by the GNCTD before the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi and the Hon’ble Supreme Court was exaggerated or not genuine.”The Delhi government also disputed the subgroup’s assumption that only 50% of non-ICU beds used oxygen which was not correct in the context of a respiratory disease like Covid-19. “The (audit) committee needs to begin with the GNCTD calculation of 568 MT, which is the scientifically modelled and data-driven estimate (arrived at by the Delhi government) and then points out where it feels that our requirements could be higher or lower. This fact cannot be determined through an armchair paper exercise but through an actual survey on the ground,” it said.It also disputed a minute of the meeting on May 13 when Guleria expressed “anguish” over the fact that the oxygen tankers in Delhi were not able to upload oxygen and were lying idle since oxygen tanks in various hospitals were completely filled. The Delhi government called Guleria’s observations “strange”, pointing out that several SOS calls had been received for tanker supplies for his own institutions, AIIMS-Delhi. “It is only when the system has stabilised that this strange narrative is finding place in the committee of experts,” it said.The Supreme Court is yet to hear this matter after May 6 and the court website, as on Friday, also did not indicate any next date of listing.An internal statement, signed by Bhalla, later refuted excerpts from the subgroup report that was leaked, and said the data on LMO consumption was a mere collation from hospitals and “was not claimed by government of NCT of Delhi”.The statement, which was accessed by HT, listed several other recommendations that Bhalla made as a member of the subgroup and cited examples to support Delhi’s position that the city needed more oxygen (such as supplies for people in home isolation). “Hence, the total oxygen consumption for Delhi was 550 MT around 12-13th May 2021, about 10 days after the peak of Covid-19 in the Capital,” he said. Dr Naresh Trehan, also a part of the 12-member overarching national task force, said he was unaware of the findings of the Delhi audit as the committee directly submits its reports to the Supreme Court without any overview from the National Task Force. “If Guleria did it, it must be reliable,” he said.(With Inputs from Rhythma Kaul, Anonna Dutt, Abhishek Dey and Malavika PM)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/political-row-erupts-over-delhi-o2-audit-101624654208064.html
26-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Congress leaders meet Rahul Gandhi, urge to resolve rift quickly||Amid uncertainty over the Congress high command’s peace plan for the faction-ridden state unit, former party president and Lok Sabha member Rahul Gandhi continued his meetings with Punjab leaders on Friday who urged him to resolve the rift quickly. Rahul held one-to-one meetings with state cabinet ministers Brahm Mohindra, Vijay Inder Singla and Balbir Singh Sidhu, Rajya Sabha member Shamsher Singh Dullo and MLAs Rana Gurjit Singh, Lakhvir Singh Lakha and Sukhwinder Singh Danny who were summoned to Delhi to share their views on the political situation and suggest steps the party and the government need to take in the run-up to the assembly polls due early next year. ‘No time to talk of change of general’ Mohindra, one of the senior-most Congress leaders in the state, is learnt to have told the former party chief that this is not the time to talk about changing the general as the assembly elections are round the corner and the party needs to devote all its energies on ensuring victory. “He said if the party leadership wanted any change, it should have looked at it two or two-and-a-half years ago. Now is not the time,” sources said on the local government minister’s 30-minute meeting with Rahul. The minister, who is number two in the pecking order in cabinet hierarchy, also conveyed his displeasure over former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s repeated statements bad-mouthing the chief minister and the government, telling the central leader that his (former minister’s) remarks have hurt the party’s image in the state. Dullo suggests surgical strike ‘without delay’ While most others said they urged the central leader to resolve differences among the leaders at the earliest, Dullo, a known detractor of Amarinder, told him that the high command will have to carry out a surgical strike without any delay to defuse the present situation and revive the party in the state. “This crisis is the creation of defectors who come with high expectations. The party needs to make use of the experience of traditional Congressmen who have been shoved into a corner, and not the party-hoppers. Also, to strengthen the party, Hindu leaders need to be given due importance, particularly in urban areas,” the former Punjab Congress president said after his meeting. Sharing details of his discussion with the Wayanad MP, Dullo said immediate steps are needed to control sand, illicit liquor and transport mafias, deliver justice in the sacrilege and police firing cases and timely provision of SC scholarships. “I also told him (Rahul) that the office of Punjab Congress has been under lockdown for the past three-four years,” he said. Rana Gurjit said he had a good meeting with Rahul. “I gave my views on what the party needs to do, but cannot share what we talked in the media,” he said, refusing to go into details. MLA Lakha is learnt to have told the former party chief that the high command should make everyone sit together and resolve the situation. “If the party is united, we are sure to repeat victory,” he said. Rahul had met more than 20 ministers, MPs and legislators and most of them from the dissenting group in the first three days of this week. Earlier, a three-member committee set up by Congress president Sonia Gandhi on the Punjab crisis held a series of meetings with 150-odd leaders and has submitted its report. On Wednesday, Rawat said that Sonia would take a decision on the government and organisational rejig by July 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-congress-leaders-meet-rahul-gandhi-urge-to-resolve-rift-quickly-101624652756449.html

26-06-2021||Chandigarh||First two cases of Delta plus variant surface in Punjab||Two cases of the ‘Delta plus’ variant – a mutated version of the more aggressive B.1.617.2 or ‘Delta’ strain of the Covid-19 that drove the second wave of infections in India – have surfaced in Punjab, according to the Union health ministry. There are 48 cases of this “variant of concern” spread across 11 states, the ministry said on Friday, adding that the maximum (20) cases had been reported from Maharashtra. “While nine case have been detected in Tamil Nadu, seven in Madhya Pradesh, three in Kerala, two in Gujarat, and one case each in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, and Karnataka,” says Sujit Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), that is involved in genome sequencing of the coronavirus in the country. Identified as B.1.617.2.1, this strain is characterised by the K417N mutation in the spike protein of the virus. The spike protein is what helps the virus infect human cells, and K417N has been associated with immune escape, or evasion, that leaves the virus more immune to vaccines or drugs. “We have received the reports of the samples sent for genome sequencing this evening. The presence of delta plus variant has been confirmed in one case that belongs to Ludhiana,” said state’s nodal officer for Covid Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, adding that the details of the other case are awaited. “The 68- year- old patient, a resident of Jand village in Pakhowal tehsil, had given his samples on June 13. These were sent for genome sequencing to NIV Pune which confirmed the presence of delta plus variant,” added Bhaskar. “The patient, who had no travel history and did not require any hospitalisation, was cured in home isolation. However, as per the Covid protocol, we had conducted the RT-PCR tests of the entire villages and the surrounding area. We have also carried out the vaccination drive in the entire village as well. As we have received the report, further action will be taken,” said Dr Kiran Ahliwalia, Ludhiana civil surgeon. The highly contagious delta variant was behind the second wave in the state. Of 478 samples sent for genome sequencing test in the month of May, the strain was found in 440 samples while the alpha variant (B.1.1.7) of the UK strain was found in 16 samples. Bhaskar said the delta variant was found in 92 % of samples, while alpha variant was found in only 3% of samples. As many as 30 samples have been sent for testing this month and the results are awaited, he added. Senior cardiologist Dr Bishav Mohan, who is a member of the Punjab government’s Covid taskforce said the state was hit by the two different variants of the virus. “At the beginning of the year, we saw UK variant. The delta variant was witnessed in April and May and it resulted in more hospitalisations.” (with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/first-two-cases-of-delta-plus-variant-surface-in-punjab-101624651918663.html
26-06-2021||Chandigarh||2015 police firing case: Officer who landed in controversy during Badal’s quizzing quits as SIT’s legal expert||Former director prosecution, Vijay Singla, on Friday resigned as a legal expert of the special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 police firing cases, three days after he landed into a controversy when ex-chief minister Parkash Singh Badal objected to his presence in the team that had come to question him. “I have nothing to gain from this mess. I have conveyed in writing to the SIT chief LK Yadav that I can’t be the legal expert of the team,” Singla told Hindustan Times. Singla had accompanied the three SIT members, additional director general of police (ADGP) LK Yadav, who heads the probe team, Ludhiana commissioner of police Rakesh Aggarwal, and DIG Faridkot Surjit Singh, as a legal expert attached to the SIT. There was high drama when Singla posed the first question to the SAD patriarch Badal.The senior Badal raised strong objections to Singla’s presence, which led to the former official leaving the room, a senior SAD leader claimed. Singla, on his part, had said that he did not ask any question to the former CM, and was stopped by the SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal and others before entering the room where Badal was sitting.“SIT has hired me as a legal expert through proper government orders. I accompanied SIT on the request of the SIT head, who wanted me to be there in case of any legal assistance,” he said. SAD leader Bikram Majihia said that the presence of the any person apart of the police officials during quizzing amount to the violation of the high court orders that mandated that the probe in the incident should be impartial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-police-firing-case-officer-who-landed-in-controversy-during-badal-s-quizzing-quits-as-sit-s-legal-expert-101624651377110.html

The state should take all necessary steps, as recommended by the expert committee, to tackle it, he added.“For a detailed and extensive probe of the Delta plus variant, the state should undertake maximum sampling and do genome sequencing of the variant,” he said to officials.He also asked them to “do sampling at railway stations, bus stations and airports of people coming in from other states. Districts should also collect samples.” In accordance with the results of the sampling, mapping of the Delta-Plus affected geographical areas should be done as it would help in protection from the virus, he said.“For genome sequencing, create facilities at KGMU (King George’s Medical University-Lucknow) and BHU (Banaras Hindu University-Varanasi),” Yogi Adityanath said to officials.He asked the officials concerned to consult the UP experts’ committee on Covid and take all necessary safety and other measures without delay. He also called for a public awareness campaign.Talking about the present status of Covid in the state, the chief minister said the daily infection rate in UP had gone below 0.1% and the recovery rate was over 98.5%. The total active Covid cases were 3,423 statewide of which 2,078 patients were in home isolation, he said.In the past 24 hours, 2.69 lakh (269,000) samples were tested and only 226 samples tested positive while 320 patients recovered.Make work plan to take doctors off admin duties: YogiChief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday asked officials concerned to make a detailed work plan to take doctors off non-medical duties and replace them there with non-medical youths trained in hospital administration and management.“Begin employing youths with masters in hospital administration/management or those with MBA degree in hospital management. Doctors should be posted only on medical duties. Putting them in other positions compromises their main responsibility and duty,” he said to officials at the Covid-19 review meeeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/deltaplus-variant-in-other-states-yogi-asks-for-maximum-sampling-in-uttar-pradesh-101624650717384.html
26-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chargesheet filed against 7 Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen terrorists in arms smuggling case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday filed a chargesheet against seven terrorists of the proscribed terror outfit Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen (TuM), who were arrested in a case of arms and explosives smuggling into India with the help of their handlers in PoK. The chargesheet was filed before a special NIA court in Jammu on Thursday against Mohammad Mustafa Khan, Mohammad Yaseen, Mohammad Farooq, Mohammad Ibrar, Mohammad Javid Khan, Sher Ali (based in Kuwait), and Mohammad Rafiq Nai alias Sultan (based in PoK). An official statement issued by the NIA said that they have been charged under various sections of the Arms Act, the Explosives Act and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The NIA had taken over the probe in March this year after the Jammu police filed an FIR in December 2020 relating to the arrest of Mohammad Mustafa Khan and recovery of six hand grenades along with ‘incriminating documents’ from his residence. NIA claimed that the seven accused named in the chargesheet were part of a deep-rooted criminal conspiracy by Pakistan-based handlers of TuM and their terror associates based in Poonch and Kuwait to execute terrorist activities and wage war against the Indian state. An absconding accused in the case, Rafiq Nai, and other handlers based in PoK, with assistance of Sher Ali and the other accused living on the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC) in Poonch ‘smuggled’ arms, ammunition, explosives, and narcotics into the Indian territory, the central probe agency said. NIA claimed they were taking advantage of the geography, affinities of religion, culture and other ties cutting across both sides of the LoC. “During the course of investigation, a large cache of arms, ammunition, explosives, narcotics along with flag, posters and other incriminating material belonging to terror outfit TuM, which was hidden at different places in Poonch was recovered,” the NIA said. Further investigation in the case continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chargesheet-filed-against-7-tehreek-ul-mujahideen-terrorists-in-arms-smuggling-case-101624650716296.html

26-06-2021||Chandigarh||BJP let Jammu down at all-party meet: Panthers Party||A day after PM’s all-party meet at Delhi, members of the Panthers Party led by its chairman and former minister Harsh Dev Singh on Friday staged a vociferous protest and called it a humiliation to the people of Jammu region. After raising slogans against the BJP, Harsh Dev Singh, said, “There was no result of the meeting and it appeared a mere formality. The BJP government had been talking about delimitation followed by assembly elections since 2019. The PM didn’t given any timeline for delimitation and elections. So, what was new in it.” “There was no assurance and timeline on statehood as well. Besides, nothing was said about Jammu region and its people, who had high hopes. The PM kept talking about Dil, Dilli and Dimag ki Duri and kept addressing separatists. It appeared that his sole motive was to hold a meeting with separatists and he did it. Undoubtedly, he decreased Dil and Dimag ki Duri with Kashmir but at the same time increased the wedge with Jammu,” he said. Harsh Dev Singh took a swipe at the BJP representatives from Jammu, who he said, “didn’t utter a single word for Jammu and kept showering accolades on the PM”. “Be it tourism, power or jobs, Jammu people want equal share. It is ironical that Jammu contributes 66% to the power revenue but gets only 40% of it,” he added. “The BJP leaders talk about youth of Jammu, who today feel let down. The way BJP representatives humiliated Jammu and its people, it will cost dearly to the BJP in the coming elections and the Panthers Party will stand with the youth to fight for their cause. We will vanquish BJP in the coming elections,” he added. J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina and former deputy chief ministers — Kavinder Gupta and Nirmal Singh represented Jammu at the all-party meeting. On Thursday evening all-party meeting drew sharp criticism from pro-Jammu parties, including the West Pak refugees, PoJK refugees and the internally displaced Kashmiri Pandits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-let-jammu-down-at-all-party-meet-panthers-party-101624650595814.html
26-06-2021||Chandigarh||An achievement for us that PM initiated a political dialogue: Altaf Bukhari||My stand has been vindicated, Apni Party president and former minister Altaf Bukhari tells HT’s Mir Ehsan as he talks about how only New Delhi and Prime Minister Modi can restore the statehood and other rights taken away from them. My stand has been vindicated that whatever we will get, it’s from New Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, neither Washington nor Islamabad. So our party opened the doors for dialogue with New Delhi without setting any conditions. The solution to all our problems lies in a democratic setup. From Day 1, we adopted an honest political approach wherein we expressed our belief that only two main forums — the Parliament and the judiciary — are the custodian of people’s constitutional rights, which were done away with in J&K unilaterally.We pleaded for early hearing by the Supreme Court on Articles 370 and 35-A, statehood, delimitation on merit, constitutional protection for land, jobs and natural resources for J&K residents, policies for youth, better interregional connectivity, and early assembly elections. Our stand has been the same from Day 1. When all other leaders were promising stars and moon to the people of J&K, we wanted restoration of statehood and jobs and land reservations. We were dubbed Kings Party or Team B of the Centre by all those political parties and leaders who now demanded the same things. It may happen by the end of 2021 and completion of delimitation process could be over by August or September end.For us, it’s an achievement that PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah initiated a much-needed political dialogue with all shades of the political spectrum in J&K. I hope this will lead us towards a sustainable and meaningful roadmap that is in the best interest and welfare of the people of J&K. Grant of statehood will restore faith among the people who are hurt after revocation of Article 370 and downgrading of the state to UTs. When Apni Party’s members met with the top leadership last year, that assuaged many pressing socio-political and economic issues and ensured the release of 718 people, including some top political leaders and workers. Even guarantees of jobs and land rights are there, but we want them as constitutional guarantees, and what was what I conveyed to PM Modi on Thursday.Safeguarding the natural resources besides augmentation of infrastructure in education, health, power, Jal Shakti, tourism, hospitality, agriculture, horticulture and industrial sectors.Yes, it should have never happened. The August 5 decisions have left indelible marks on the psyche of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, especially with regard to their special rights on employment under government services; acquisition of immovable property; settlement in the state and, of course, defining such residents.Do you think there is alienation among the people of J&K post-revocation of Article 370?The governor and administration in J&K may have tried their best to deliver, but people still feel alienated and one of the major and justifiable reasons is that they are deprived of their democratic rights to decide their own fate. No bureaucratic set-up can replace or prove to be a dependable substitute to an elected government.Are there any apprehensions on delimitation in J&K?Yes. Leaders wanted elections ahead of the delimitation process in J&K. Here, the process of delimitation is still being viewed as a politically motivated exercise which has raised many concerns in J&K. People are concerned that adjustment of boundaries and description of the extent of parliamentary constituencies have been thrusted to pit one region against other for some political mileage. This serious issue needs to be addressed and this exercise must be based on merit. We have been assured that all parties will get representation even if the party has a single DDC member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/an-achievement-for-us-that-pm-initiated-a-political-dialogue-altaf-bukhari-101624650540020.html

The SAD chief was here to install new Kharar municipal committee president Jaspreet Kaur Longia in her chair. Party constituency in-charge Ranjit Singh Gill and former MP Prem Singh Chandumajra were also present. Talking to mediapersons, Sukhbir said even as the top Congress leadership was engaged in an internal feud with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s chair on a rickety wicket, the farmers of the state had been left to their fate. He said farmers were barely getting four to five hours of power and that to in gaps instead of the promised eight-hour uninterrupted power supply. He said for the first time ever, the canal supply had been disrupted which can lead to destruction of paddy crop over the vast swathes in the Malwa region. Answering a media query, Sukhbir said the chief minister, who had recently approved a police job for the son of Congress legislator Fatehjang Bajwa on compassionate grounds for the alleged service done by late Satnam Singh Bajwa for the nation, should reflect on the letter he had written to Sonia Gandhi on the issue. “In the letter, Amarinder had stated that the Satnam Bajwa had been killed in a gang war connected with smuggling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farm-economy-endangered-by-massive-power-cuts-sukhbir-101624650537489.html
26-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra tightens curbs amid Delta Plus Covid cases||Amid cases of Delta Plus variants, the Maharashtra government has decided to impose stricter lockdown norms, reducing the five-level relaxation plan to three. The first two levels, which had maximum relaxations, have been removed till further order, according to a notification issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Friday.The state has found 21 cases of Delta plus variants covering six districts. Of them, nine cases are in Ratnagiri, seven in Jalgaon, two in Mumbai and one case each in Thane, Palghar and Sindhudurg.The change means, malls and theatres will be completely shut across the state again. Section 144 has been imposed and not more than five people can gather at a public place, while movements should be minimal post 5pm. Shops selling essentials can stay open till 4pm daily and those related to non-essentials are allowed to operate only on weekdays. Gyms and salons will be operational only till 4pm, with appointments and without air-conditioners. Restaurants can open till 4pm only on weekdays, after which, only takeaways will be allowed. The decision has been taken, considering emerging cases of Delta plus variants in the state. However, there won’t be any changes for Mumbai as the city already comes under level three category of restrictions, officials said.“Given that the virus causing Covid 19 is undergoing mutations in various geographies, and that these mutations are displaying more transmissibility and potential reductions in monoclonal antibody response, a state-level trigger mandating all administrative units, irrespective of values of the indices of weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy percentage, to remain at a level not below 3 is to be in operation till withdrawn by specific order of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA),” the notification issued by Kunte stated. “New variants like Delta, Delta plus etc. have come to spread and are fuelling the potentiality of imminent (4-6 weeks), more severe third wave with wider geographical area,” the notification said.The state task force and ministry of health and family welfare (MOHFW) have directed the state not to let its guard down, following which it was decided to cut down the relaxations, said Aseem Gupta, secretary, relief and rehabilitation department.“It simply means that of the five-level relaxation plan, we have removed the first two levels having maximum relaxations. It also means all the districts and cities will get maximum relaxations that are provided under the level 3 plan,” Gupta said.“Before the second wave hit the state, cases started rising in Amravati and then it spread across the state. This time we have decided to be more careful considering the Delta plus variant cases have been found in a few districts. We cannot be at peace when there is a threat of a possible third wave looming large,” the relief and rehabilitation secretary said.In its new order the state government further decided that the districts cannot reduce restrictions based on weekly positivity rate. They will have to observe the trend for two weeks, but for increasing restrictions they won’t have to wait for two weeks and the decision can be taken in a few days. “While coming down to a lower level, the district disaster management authority (DDMA) shall look into two weeks’ trend before accepting a lower level of restrictions. When there is an upward trend in the number of positive cases being identified daily and requiring a higher level of restrictions than the current one, DDMA however shall do so without waiting for two weeks’ trends,” says the notification.More importantly, weekly positivity rate, a major criterion for deciding on restriction levels, should be determined only on the basis of RT-PCR tests. This is being done as many districts were also conducting rapid antigen tests (RAT), which were less accurate than RT-PCR, and in that case, ground situation was found to be different from what the figures were saying, officials said. “There are districts which have a 12% positivity rate going by RT-PCR tests and less than 5% going by RAT, which is the reason the change has been adopted,” the relief and rehabilitation secretary said.The state further asked local administrations to push vaccinations in their districts or municipal corporations to 70 per cent of their population, especially of blue collar workers. The state has also emphasised districts to create flying squads to check whether people are following Covid-appropriate behaviour in malls, marriages, restaurants etc. Establishments have also been asked to put up proper ventilation due to the ‘air borne nature of the droplets of the virus’ and hence establishments have to have HEPA filters or proper exhaust fans.Meanwhile, the Thane Municipal Corporation has announced that it will now be a part of level 3 instead of level 2. On June 18, a notification was released by the TMC stating shops, malls and restaurants will remain open all day including weekends owing to the lower positivity rate. “As per the new restrictions, shops and restaurants that fall under non-essential category will be allowed to open only till 4pm on weekdays. Meanwhile, all essential services can remain open on all days including weekends till 4pm,” said Vipin Sharma, commissioner, TMC. Malls and theaters will also remain shut as per guidelines for level 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-tightens-curbs-amid-delta-plus-covid-cases-101624650482536.html
26-06-2021||Chandigarh||Power crisis in state due to PSPCL’s poor management, say engineers||The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) engineers have termed the power crisis during the ongoing paddy sowing season in the state a failure of the corporation management and have demanded that a career technocrat should be appointed as chairman-cum-managing director of the utility by removing the incumbent, an IAS officer. The Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) Engineers’ Association on Friday issued a statement criticising the management and the state government for going against the interests of people of Punjab and that of the power sector. Association president Jasvir Singh Dhiman said, “Due to gross mismanagement, engineers are facing the wrath of people on the ground over irregular supply of electricity. The wrong decisions being taken by the management will cost the consumers dearly as they will result in irregular power supply and higher tariffs.” “Our fears have come true as Punjab is facing an acute power crisis during the peak summer. Due to improper planning, neither sufficient manpower was arranged nor proper material was procured. Now, the management’s claims of adequate power availability stand exposed as recurring power cuts are being imposed. Besides, inadequate power is being supplied to farmers,” he added. “It was due to this mismanagement that two healthy units of the Rupnagar thermal plants have been closed. There is an urgent need to revive these two units. The state government decided to shut down the Rupnagar units without any alternate arrangements going against the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) guidelines and ignoring the warnings of power engineers,” Dhiman said. The association said despite an acute manpower shortage at both plants, all PSPCL thermal plants are providing power at full capacity to the state at this crucial juncture. The private thermal plant at Talwandi Sabo, despite knowing well in advance about the power demand during the paddy sowing season, failed to ensure timely repairs, further pushing the state into a power crisis during the peak demand, it added. A 660 megawatt (MW) unit of the plant has been non-functional for the last 4 months. PSPCL CMD A Venu Prasad said the failure of Talwandi Sabo plant to start its unit has caused the crisis. “Penalty was imposed on the plant for its failure to start the unit during the peak season. But we have made adequate arrangements by purchasing power from the grid. The PSPCL is committed to provide 8 hours power supply to farmers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-crisis-in-state-due-to-pspcl-s-poor-management-say-engineers-101624650481817.html

The vigilance department is practically running the SIT by deputing its officers in the SIT. The vigilance officials are part of the conspiracy and should also be booked.”“We will demand that the officials concerned be booked for disobeying the orders of the high court which specified that only the three-member SIT should be associated with the probe,” he said.Even as the SIT is probing the Kotkapura firing case, it is deliberately taking up the sacrilege case in its investigation, he added. SAD leader Virsa Singh Valtoha demanded that Jakhar, state cabinet ministers Sukhjinder Randhawa and Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa besides senior AAM Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders should be subjected to lie detector test to ascertain how many times they talked to then IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap who led a politically motivated probe into the Kotkapura firing incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-file-fir-against-rahul-jakhar-sit-for-conspiring-against-badals-sad-101624650480717.html
26-06-2021||Chandigarh||Fewer private hospitals booking vaccine doses in Punjab||Fewer private hospitals in Punjab are coming forward to buy Covid-19 vaccine as only 50,000 doses were booked by them in June, according to information procured from the state health department. Principal secretary (health) Hussan Lal said the central officials had informed that private hospitals in the state were expected to get 5.5 lakh doses in June as per the new vaccination policy that came into effect from June 21. “The Centre has asked us to motivate private hospitals to buy vaccines from the 25% quota fixed for them. But their response has not been very enthusiastic. This is probably due to the fact that free doses are increasingly made available,” he added. Under the new norms, the Union government is reserving 25% of the doses for private hospitals keeping in view the past consumption and demand. Another official said another major reason behind private hospitals not coming forward to book vaccines is the capping on the fee of not more than ₹150 per dose. “Earlier, there was no capping and the hospitals were charging ₹300-700 per dose,” he said. Indian Medical Association (IMA) vice-president Dr Navjot Dahiya said, “When the vaccine is easily available free of cost why would someone come to have it in a private hospitals. I urge the state and the Centre to involve us in the free drive as they have done in the first when we were given doses from the state quota,” said Dr Dahiya. On Friday, the state health department officials had a videoconference with the private hospitals in the state to motivate them to book the doses meant for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fewer-private-hospitals-booking-vaccine-doses-in-punjab-101624650476558.html

He had told the court that his account with Punjab National Bank was freezed without any intimation and he could not withdraw money even for the treatment of his daughter-in-law, who had contracted Covid-19 in May. Singh, a former sarpanch, has claimed that he was targeted as he belonged to the opposition party and for some time, he was being pressured to join the ruling party. His counsel GS Aulakh had told the HC that there was no court order for freezing of the bank account nor there was any FIR against him. The local station house officer, under whose instructions his account was freezed, had no jurisdiction to pass such an order, he said. Now, no reason is being given for the action even as he represented senior superintendent of police, Bathinda, in June, he had told the court. The response has been sought by July 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bathinda-man-drags-police-bank-to-court-over-freezing-of-account-101624649876167.html

Relief is tinged with sadness.Perhaps because the evening sky is particularly picturesque, with tiny puffs of clouds scattered about like cotton stuffing ripped out of a pillow, Lodhi Garden is permeated with a more intense beauty. Are we still in that same grief-stricken city of two months ago, where everyone seemed to know of at least one person who died to the coronavirus?A few joggers are showing up here and there in their athletic accessories, their fit figures swathed in sweat. On the Athpula bridge, a woman is photographing the sun setting behind the lake’s fountain.Further along, the famous pink pair of giant bougainvillea trees are in haughty bloom. In the falling darkness, they are looking like two bonfires. The green benches under them that would be filled with romantic couples, in between the two surges, are vacant.Under a far-off tall tree, a man and a woman are sitting on a bench. She’s in a dressy skirt with high heels. He is explaining something with great passion to her, the motions of his arms in synchronisation with the turns of his thoughts—maybe. With nobody around them for great distances, the couple are looking deeply by themselves, as if they were actors staging a play in an empty theatre.Meanwhile, the circular garden with rose beds in front of the tiny Mughal pavilion is empty, except for a large unusual bird with an extraordinarily long beak and a red dot on her head. She is hopping boldly on the grass.Oh, the grass. In some places it stands too tall, an attestation that the park was closed for a long time, and perhaps the gardeners couldn’t trim all the portions. Then there’s the legendary dead tree in front of the Sheesh Gumbad, raising its naked, spindly branches to the sky like the limbs of a mourner frozen in grief. This is the only sight in the sprawling park that appears to mark the tragedy our city is dealing with.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-beyond-familiar-solitudes-101624649717122.html
26-06-2021||Lucknow||Major vaccination drive to be launched in Lucknow’s rural areas from July 1||The Lucknow district administration is set to launch a mega vaccination drive in the rural areas of the state capital from July 1, officials said. The campaign will be similar to the one underway in the urban areas here.“Vaccination is the only way to break the chain of the deadly virus. It’s for the same reason that after the mega vaccination drive in the urban areas, we are now planning a mega drive in the rural areas as well,” Lucknow district magistrate Abhishek Prakash said.Initially, the Mal, Malihabad and Mohanlalganj development blocks would be chosen for the drive, the district magistrate said at a meeting held to discuss anti-Covid measures and preparations for the anticipated third wave.“It should be ensured that maximum people in the blocks get vaccinated at the earliest,” the DM said.He also directed the officials to administer around 30,000 vaccine doses in a day, which is 10,000 more than the initial target set early this month.In addition, the DM directed the contract tracing teams to carry out unique contract tracing in Mal, Malihabad and Mohanlalganj to carry out unique contact tracing in the rural areas to keep a check on the virus outbreak.Besides, the DM asked newly elected village heads to dispel the myths related to the Covid vaccine and to ensure strict implementation of Covid protocols.Dr MK Singh, additional chief medical officer/district immunisation officer (DIO), said the massive drive would be launched from July 1 onwards in the development blocks where walk-in vaccination would be facilitated.“We would set up the (vaccination) centres either at the tehsil office or the Panchayat Bhavan. Also, we have made arrangements to publicise the location of the vaccination centres among the people. We would run programmes to resolve vaccine related queries,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/major-vaccination-drive-to-be-launched-in-lucknow-s-rural-areas-from-july-1-101624649516275.html
26-06-2021||Delhi||Traffic back in Delhi, even in non-peak hours||Winding snarls are back in the national capital, with several arterial roads witnesssing heavy traffic even during non-peak hours, after lower road occupancy for nearly two months owing to the lockdown imposed during the second wave of the Covid pandemic.Senior Delhi traffic police officials said that, since the national capital started unlocking in phases early this month, the snarls on several arterial roads have broken away from their usual patterns, and are now continuing even during non-peak hours.For instance, during pre-pandemic days, and even after the reopening of the nationwide lockdown last year, traffic jams on arterial roads were usually confined to limited hours — from 9am to 12 noon and then from 4pm to 8pm. However, over the past fortnight, traffic jams on several major stretches have continued beyond the peak rush hours.Sample this: At the ITO intersection, among the busiest in the Capital, traffic volume during the pre-pandemic days was around 250,000 to 300,000 vehicles (during peak hours). Last year, when the city reopened after the Covid-19 lockdown the traffic volume increased marginally to around 325,000 to 340,000, but jams were still limited to the four hours in the morning and four hours in the evening, with relatively smooth flow during the rest of the day.Since June 10, however, when traffic movement resumed after the second lockdown, the traffic volume has been high consistently through the day. A short-period estimate shows that the intersection has been recording around 400,000 vehicles during peak hours, but jams now continue on the stretch for almost the entire day.Complaints received by the traffic department’s control room from June 1 to June 25 show that stretches such as the ITO intersection, Mukarba Chowk, Ring Road (from Hyatt Hotel to AIIMS flyover), Ashram intersection, Britannia Chowk, Kashmere Gate (near ISBT), Rajouri Garden crossing (Najafgarh Road), Dwarka Road (near the Palam flyover) and Outer Ring Road (near Hauz Khas metro station) see traffic jams continuing beyond peak hours. To be sure, some of these stretches have peculiar problems such as ongoing construction work.Officials said while traffic seems to have gone up on all these stretches, the average vehicular volume figures will be released after at least a month’s traffic recordings are studied.The higher volume at odd hours, they said, could be because of flexible work hours allowed by employers due to the Covid-19 pandemic; and it could also be a temporary trend since the lockdown has been lifted after a gap of two months.“Now that markets, offices and economic activities, in general, have come back to normal, traffic jams are expected. But since these are continuing through the day in certain stretches, it could be because people are now venturing out after a long gap. We hope things will normalise after a few weeks,” a traffic official said.The department is not viewing this as a trend yet. “There are some stretches where we have observed increased traffic volume but it will be unfair to say that this has become a trend. We will have to record and study traffic volume for at least a month before we can say for sure that the patterns have changed post-Covid,” another senior traffic official said.Traffic experts said what Delhi is witnessing now is an anomaly, primarily because other modes of public transport are not functioning at their optimum capacity, and people are still wary of using mass transit fearing infection.“Metro is operating only at 50% capacity and other modes of transport are also not very reliable. Anyone who can afford personal transportation would prefer travelling in a safe space, so it is normal to see some deviation in the usual traffic trends. The pandemic has changed the way people travel, but we will need to study it more before establishing trends,” said Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning, School of Planning and Architecture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/traffic-back-in-delhi-even-in-non-peak-hours-101624649355412.html

The complaint was made by Parveen Kumar, who is the owner of Jai Ambika Group and runs a real estate business in Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand. The accused have been identified as Harjeet Singh, alias Ganja, and Varinder Singh Goldy, both residents of Kharar. Police said Harjeet Singh and his wife had contested municipal elections from Kharar, but lost.In his complaint, Kumar alleged that the duo called him a few days back and demanded ₹1.5 lakh, claiming that they have links with gangsters and all builders are paying them monthly extortion. Even as Kumar paid the extortion amount, the duo threatened to kill him and again demanded ₹5 lakh. Following this, he contacted police.A trap was laid to catch the duo on Friday, when they came to collect the amount at Shivalik City in Kharar. The two were arrested and later sent to three-day police remand. They have been booked under Sections 384 (extortion), 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extor­tion), 388 (extortion by threat of accusation of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life), 506 (criminal intimidation), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-held-for-extortion-on-kharar-builder-s-complaint-101624649097708.html

I am working hard to win a medal for my country at the Tokyo games,” she said during her visit to Chandigarh University, where she is a student of Bachelors of Physical Education.Hailing from Dinod village near Bhiwani, Aruna got a wild card entry to Paralympics based on her exemplary and consistent performance over the past few years which included a bronze medal at World Para Taekwondo Championship 2019 in Turkey and another bronze medal at Asian Para Taekwondo Championship 2019 in Jordan.Taking note of Aruna’s achievements, Chandigarh University has introduced a special sports scholarship named after the famous international para-athlete and Arjuna Award recipient Ramesh Tikaram, also known as father of para-badminton. R Tikaram Sports Scholarship will be worth ₹1 crore for para-Olympic players from 2021. In addition, 25 seats under sports category would be reserved for the para-athletes who would be eligible for academic scholarship up to 100% and get access to free hostel accommodation, special diet along with training allowances.“Aruna has become a role model for many, especially girls who are not given equal opportunity as boys by their parents to showcase their talent and get empowered. We want to encourage para-athletes and boost their talent,” said Dr RS Bawa, pro-chancellor of Chandigarh University.Daughter of a driver, Aruna was accompanied by his father Naresh Tanwar and coach Ashok Kumar. Aruna is a recipient of Dhyan Chand sports scholarship which takes care of her academic fees, hostel fees, coaching facility and special diet.Ranked number four in the women’s 49 category, Aruna was born with deformity in both her hands. She was distressed as she couldn’t participate in the World and Asian qualifiers at Jordan due to travel ban owing to the pandemic. “It was really disappointing. But with the efforts of the Para Taekwondo Association of India and Paralympic Committee of India, I was given a wild entry. I am focused on winning a medal for India at the Paralympics,” said a confident Aruna, who is among the eight athletes from eight countries to have been offered the bipartite quotas for Tokyo by IOC and World Taekwondo.She took up the sport at the age of eight and competed in the normal taekwondo category for eight years. She shifted to para taekwondo in 2017 when she was declared not eligible to compete at the international level due to deformity in both hands.“I want every girl to learn martial arts and use it as a tool for self-protection and defend themselves against the bad elements of the society,” said Aruna.Seeing her daughter excel in the sport, Naresh said, “I work as a driver at a chemical factory, so it was difficult for me initially to support my daughter. But due to her willpower and eagerness to play, I decided to take loans apart from spending my savings to support her dream.”Chandigarh University also presented Aruna with a laptop along with a professional taekwondo kit. “In Tokyo, Aruna will face challenge from Ukraine, China and Chinese Taipei players and I am confident that she will win a medal,” said her coach Ashok.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/girls-should-learn-martial-arts-for-self-defence-says-para-athlete-aruna-tanwar-101624649039132.html

About 15 youths descended upon the locality around 1am, vandalising vehicles parked outside the houses and spreading panic among the residents. They even stole articles from cars after smashing their windowpanes and windshields. The incident was captured in CCTV cameras.Azad, a resident of Mauli Jagran Complex, put the blame on the Midha gang of Rajiv Colony, Sector 17, Panchkula.

26-06-2021||Lucknow||‘Ensure protection of witnesses for free, fair prosecution process’||The state home department has issued stern directives for proper protection of witnesses in criminal cases to ensure free and fair prosecution process and conviction of criminals, said senior home department officials on Friday.In a press note issued by the department, additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Awasthi said strict enforcement of ‘Sakshi Suraksha Yojana’ (witnesses’ protection scheme) was initiated in 2018 on the directives of the Supreme Court to ensure protection of witnesses.The press note further said the protection of witnesses should be ensured at any cost and the police officials concerned will be held responsible in case of any lapse in its compliance. It stated all district magistrates, police commissioners and district police chiefs had been issued stern directives in this connection.It said DMs and zonal level police officials had been asked to do monthly review meeting of witnesses’ protection applications. It said witness protection committees had been constituted under district judges in every district and district magistrates and police chiefs had been included in the committees as members.A senior police official said district level officials must ensure proper enforcement of witnesses’ protection measures through witness protection cells. Moreover, the protection applications should be disposed of within five working days after analysing security threat. He said it was mandatory to keep the entire proceedings of the committee a secret.The official said the committee could also decide to relocate the witnesses if they felt threat to witnesses’ life at their present whereabouts or locations after analysing the threat perception. Their new locations and identities should be kept a secret keeping in mind the security measures.The home department mentioned in the press note that the protection of witnesses was necessary for free and fair trial of criminal cases as there were major chances of witnesses turning hostile if they lived under fear or were threatened by the accused.The press note said witnesses were eyes and ears of the judicial process and so it was to be ensured that they were not being threatened and proper security cover should be given to them. The home department also asked for proper sensitisation at police station levels about the witnesses’ protection scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ensure-protection-of-witnesses-for-free-fair-prosecution-process-101624648918987.html

26-06-2021||Other||Debate: Beat the cheat, online exams no mean feat||Ethics matterFairness in online exams depends solely on the ethics that candidates carry in their lives. One’s true behaviour comes to fore when we think no one is watching. In these times, we have no option but to hold online exams. To ensure that students’ progress is properly assessed, questions should be framed in such a manner that their analytical and comprehension skills are put to use. Anju Mohan, PanchkulaStudents always find loopholesThere is almost no technological way to reduce or prevent cheating as students these days can always find loopholes to applications and programmes that are aimed at preventing cheating. The most straightforward and foolproof method of reducing or preventing cheating will be to include innovative questions, for which answers cannot be easily found anywhere. Avi Khurana, ChandigarhEncourage higher order thinkingThe Covid crisis has had an unprecedented impact on the education systems. With educations institutes forced to switch to online mode of teaching and assessment, fair evaluation has taken a back seat. Educators must come up with questions that require higher-order thinking to fairly assess students in online exams. Tanya Chadha, Ambala Leave no time for cheatingFor online assessment, students should be tested with multiple-choice questions. There should be a fixed time-limit in which students should be required to submit their answers. This won’t leave any time for cheating. Besides, the questions must be framed in a way that students will have to go through the entire syllabus and get their concepts clear to be able to answer these. Amanpreet Kaur Bains, KuraliSurveillance mustOnline exams are fraught with scope for cheating as a student sitting at home will have multiple means to copy, consult and get guidance from parents, tutors and others. In foreign countries, online exam are carried out under strict surveillance that keep tabs on the response time, eye movements of students etc. This almost negates the possibility of malfeasance. Raghunath Chhabra, ChandigarhInstitutes should care about students, not just imageFor many institutions, online exam protocols to minimise cheating only make it to the sugarcoated speeches of the authorities. Some of them don’t want to put any efforts to explore the options for fair assessment of students. All they care about is the image of their institution and thus turn a blind eye to the unfair means adopted by students so that they can score high marks. However, for the benefit of students, some form of invigilation is a must. Besides, institutions should set multiple sets of question papers, and frame high-order thinking questions to test the students for their intelligence. Prisha Gupta, ChandigarhUnfair means unavoidable even offlineThere is no denying the fact that online exams can hardly match the scrutiny that offline exams allow. But unscrupulous elements find a way to cheat be it online or offline. Many of them manage to cheat even in the presence of invigilators in examination halls. The only way out is to test the students in a way that their actual intelligence and progress is assessed.SC Luthra, Chandigarh No dearth of optionsIn the USA, many schools and universities take online exams through an app called Canvas which offers three main exam formats: essays, tests and online exams. When the exam is in process, the system automatically blocks internet search engines. In the UK, many colleges have been conducting the online exams for students by providing only 72 seconds to answer each question and therefore, it’s really hard for students to look up the answers on the internet within this time. Schools and colleges in India could hold open-book examinations instead of going ahead with normal online exams.Samay Seth, ChandigarhPop quizzes, viva voce for assessment The pandemic has forced us to explore new ways of solving our day-to-day problems. The same must be done in the arena of education. Classes have been shifted online since the pandemic outbreak last year. While there are many benefits of online classes, evaluations pose a challenge. To solve this, schools and colleges must adopt the secure browser technology so that students can’t open any other window when the exam is in process. Besides, teachers could hold pop quizzes and viva voce from time to time to assess the students. Aashita Sood, ChandigarhProctoring best, most common solution The most common solution to check cheating in online exams is to use proctoring software. It is specifically designed to enable students to take online exams securely with features such as automated monitoring, ID verification, and computer lockdown. Vijay Malia, ChandigarhCan’t give invigilation a go byThe only constant in life is change and we grow by adapting to them. Same way, this pandemic brought many changes in all the spheres of our daily lives, especially in the field of education. It has shifted from classroom teaching to online mode. Teachers have tried their best to adapt to new technology but the evaluation system is yet to get fool proof. In this virtual era, with invigilation given a go-by there is a question mark on the fairness of the exam. Arti Sood, ChandigarhObjective type questions for fair, quick assessment Online exams should be of short duration instead of the usual three hours. Students should be asked objective-type questions and be told to answer it within the given time frame. Real-time videography of the candidate while answering questions is a must so that no help can be taken from outside. This will not just make evaluation fair and transparent but also quick. Col TBS Bedi (Retd), MohaliIIT Goa shows the wayIndian Institute of Technology (IIT), Goa, surprised everyone by asking the students to frame their own questions based on what they had grasped through the semester and then it. The method was so unique that the image of the question paper went viral on social media. Our educators just need to get their thinking hats on to solve the problem of cheating in online exams.Khushboo Singla, MohaliConsult all stakeholdersPanjab University and its affiliated institutions are set to start their semester exams soon. This time too, the varsity seems to have done nothing to check unfair means during online exams. After wide-range consultations, the varsity is going ahead with the same old tried and tested method. The irony is that students, who are the most important stakeholders, were not even consulted. Surely, PU could do better.Usha Verma, ChandigarhStudents must self regulate, for their own goodStudents need to regulate themselves and study well before exams. They are our future nation builders. They must not forget their moral values and attempt their online exams in a fair manner. They ought to understand that they are nor preparing for an exam but for the future challenges. They should study and prepare for the future and envision the fact that their career and profession will not excuse them if they cheat.Karan Singh Vinayak, ChandigarhTech to the rescueThe Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to find new ways to run our education system. Many service providers have the know-how of holding online examinations but none can come up with a foolproof solution. So it is very difficult to ensure fairness in online examinations unless the student herself/himself behaves ethically in the process. There should be softwares which would log out the student once the camera detects any unfair activity. The integrity of the online examination can be further safeguarded by lockdown application, which prevents electronic corruption and a student obtaining an unfair advantage. So only advanced technology intervention can ensure a higher level of fairness in the online examinations.Anil Kumar Yadav, ChandigarhOnline exams best option in these timesCheating is everywhere, not only in online examination system. Online exam is the best option in these times of the pandemic. Determination is the key to success. Students should prepare well for their own good.Sumesh Kumar Badhwar, MohaliStrengthen the moral fibreThe main reason for cheating in exams is the non-serious attitude of students. Get them interested in learning, make them realise the value of education and they will themselves understand the need to put in hard work and not cheat. Apart from exploring various means of technology to check cheating, educators must work towards strengthening students’ moral fiber. Prabhjot Nagpal, ZirakpurTime each questionIn order to ensure that there is no cheating in an online exam, one must ensure that each question has a timer. This way, if the student doesn’t know the answer, she or he will have to move on to the next question without wasting time on unfair means. Gurnoor Grewal, ChandigarhTeach students to remain true to themselves Covid has taught humanity to the world. Along with that, it’s also time we learn how to remain true to ourselves. The exams are being held online to prevent the virus spread. If one does not study wholeheartedly and cheats, one is only cheating onself and one’s dreams and aspirations. Priyam Aggarwal, ChandigarhOnline exams have put integrity at stakeThe ongoing pandemic has badly affected the academic integrity of students. Many solutions can be offered to improve fairness in online tests. Some academic institutions give direct questions in tests, which makes cheating easy. However, in online tests, the questions given should require higher-order thinking. This practice could reduce cheating as answers to such questions are not easily available on the internet. Another great solution for this problem is using remote proctoring applications that have been specifically made to solve this problem and have been proven useful. Saihibb Kaura, via emailTest students on integrity, not on cramming skills There are many ways to assess a student. Merely testing them for their rote-learning abilities is not the way to go about it. Students should be examined for their sharpness, intelligence and also their character. They should be motivated to attempt the papers honestly without external help and made to sign a self-declaration, pledging to not use any unfair means.Subhash Nagpal, ZirakpurUpside to online evaluationAuthentication is at the core of an e-evaluation environment that includes allowing a student to secure access to his/her personal learning space while maintaining the confidentiality and rightful identification. Online portals ensure that a large question bank is compiled and these can be presented to students in a randomised manner. Additionally, it also saves time and effort to prevent paper leaks, as the logistics are automatically resolved due to the secure nature of online assessment. Sanjay Chopra, MohaliAddress the gapsThe pandemic has brought to fore the multiple gaps in our education system. It has helped us realise the need for reforms for the benefit of students. It’s not difficult to find sources teaching ‘How to cheat in online exams’ online. Such sites should be banned. Students should understand that they will only be cheating themselves by cheating in these exams.Abhishek Kumar, ChandigarhCheck duplicity, punish wrongdoersExams should be taken as a test of discerning and presentation rather than a test of memory. Students should be advised to adopt ABC (Accuracy, Brevity and Clarity) as a cardinal principle while writing their exams. There are different ways of ensure fair online exams. As per the strength of teachers in an institution, a group of students should be allotted to a teacher individually for the purpose of fair invigilation. Another method is to use softwares to check plagiarism-cum-duplicity. If the level of similarity exceeds the prescribed limit, then stringent action should be taken against wrongdoers.Vaibhav Sharma, via emailCurbing cheating difficult, not impossibleThe education sector has been badly hit by the pandemic. Universities and colleges across the country have been managing online teaching despite having limited resources and experiences. On the other hand, universities are grasping at a straw to control mass cheating during online examinations. It is a fact that bringing the cheating level to zero especially during online examinations is a tough row to hoe. However, a simple approach may improve the sanctity of online examinations system that includes. There are many open-source platforms available for the proctored examination which universities may customise to meet their requirements. Tejinderpal Singh, ChandigarhMarks shouldn’t be the ultimate aimA secure browser, remote proctoring such as audio or video capturing and IP-based audit logging, remote candidate authentication, data encryption during transit and an exam timer for each question must be incorporated in order to make online exams more secure and efficient in rooting out malpractices. Backtracking and retaking of the exam must be prohibited, score availability should be delayed and the test settings adjusted to end the exam when the student exits or if the time runs out. Varied types of questions that require higher order thinking must be created to allow them to authentically demonstrate their mastery of course content. Stress or fear of failure caused by a self-propelled desire to excel can lead to cheating. Getting a respectable grade or scoring magnificently high should not be the objective. We want our children to grow into adults who are vibrant, stable, creative, justly ambitious, can face life squarely, without inhibitions and complexes and can also celebrate the joys of life with zest.Komal Singh, ChandigarhReader of the weekMake use of technology to check the menace Educators must make use of technology to rein on cheating during online exams. There are a variety of options available. Remote proctoring, with the help of live video streaming or recorded video, can help examiners keep tabs on candidates. Image proctoring option can be useful where internet connectivity is limited. In this, a web camera can be used to capture images of candidates after periodic intervals. Besides, the option of multiple-choice questions (M​CQs) can also be explored. Examiners must randomise the order of questions as well as answers so as to not leave any scope for mass cheating. Setting a tight deadline will also leave students with no time to indulge in unfair means. Besides, Concurrent Login Prevention systems can be used to prevent malicious logins in the exam from different IP addresses. Also, there are mechanisms which let the online test occupy the whole screen, barring candidates from switching screens to hunt for answers during the exam.Utkarsh Khandelwal, Chandigarh What experts feelBetter planningPU should have either gone ahead with offline exams, as was done by GNDU, or have properly brainstormed the various options available to make the online exams foolproof. Mritunjay Kumar, President PUTAContinuous assessment The faculty of engineering carries out continuous assessment of students throughout the semester. All other faculty members can be advised to do the same and give timely feedback to students. Professor JK Goswamy, director, UIET.Innovative models I think universities should work on innovative questions which don’t have readily available answers on internet or in standard text books. It is imperative that the teaching fraternity comes out of the comfort zone of the traditional examination system and look for new innovative models.Parvinder Singh, former controller of examination, PUTest intelligenceDuring exams, real time answers need to be uploaded as is done in case of TOEFL, GRE or CAT. 30% of the question paper must include very difficult questions which require analysis and thorough knowledge of the subject.Nisha Aggarwal, principal, Post Graduate Government College for Girls, Sector 42Invigilation mustInvigilation is an integral part of the examination process and must be done regardless of whether it is an online or offline exam. Besides, educators should go for continuous academic assessment of students through assignments, quizzes etc rather than holding one exam at the end of year or semester.

26-06-2021||Bangalore||K’taka CM mandates Covid testing for travellers from Maha, Kerala||Bengaluru Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Friday said that passengers travelling from Maharashtra and Kerala should be subjected to Covid-19 tests and be closely monitored. “The Delta virus in the state is currently under control but (the chief minister) instructed that the situation be closely monitored,” according to a statement by the chief minister’s office (CMO), attributing it to Yediyurappa. Though Karnataka has shown a decline in new infections, the Delta Plus variant has raised alarm bells in the state and other parts of the country, adding to fears of another wave of infections. The chief minister also held a meeting with experts, members of his cabinet and other senior officials on the matter at his residence in Bengaluru on Friday. The developments come days after the state government relaxed lockdown restrictions after almost six weeks, facilitating the return to normalcy and kickstarting economic activity. “There are two cases of Delta plus variant, one in Bengaluru and the other in Mysuru. Both are having mild symptoms. The one in Mysuru has completely recovered. There was no severity in both the cases. Primary contacts of these cases have tested negative. Therefore, there is no need to panic about the virus. Genome sequencing is being done everyday to detect new strains,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said in a statement on Friday. The Karnataka government is concerned that travellers from Maharashtra and Kerala, who share borders in the north and south of the state, will spread the virus. “There is a surge in cases in Kerala. Positivity rate is more than 10% there. We need to be cautious as we share borders with this state. Same is the case with Maharashtra. We need to conduct more tests in border areas. We have instructed the district administration to do so,” Sudhakar added. The minister, however, added that there the borders won’t be closed down. Sudhakar also informed that six genome sequencing labs will be set up at Bengaluru, Mysuru, Shivamogga, Hubli, Mangaluru and Vijayapura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-cm-mandates-covid-testing-for-travellers-from-maha-kerala-101624648855711.html
26-06-2021||Chandigarh||Amrut Awards: Chandigarh adjudged best UT, second overall||Chandigarh has ranked best among the Union Territories and retained second position among all states and UTs, after Orissa, for effective implementation of the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) in the country. It has also bagged the smart city award for best UT. However, among individual smart cities, Indore and Surat are the joint winners for their overall development while Uttar Pradesh won the state award. According to information shared by the Chandigarh municipal corporation, the Amrut award ceremony was held online on Friday and presided over by Hardeep Puri, minister of state (independent charge), housing and urban affairs. Amrut is the first focused national water mission that was launched on June 25, 2015, in 500 cities, covering 60% of the urban population. Providing piped water supply and sewerage management is its main focus while stormwater drainage, non-motorised urban transport and green spaces are minor components. “About 20,000 new sewer and water supply connections have been released so far under Amrut projects. The Chandigarh MC has completed 10 out of 12 works and balance two works are likely to be completed by September 31. We have achieved all the reforms required to be carried out under the scheme every year since 2015 and have also been given cash incentive of ₹195 lakh for achieving the milestones with respect to reforms,” said MC commissioner KK Yadav. The 12 projects worth ₹54.09 crore, for which 100% funding was provided by the Centre, include laying of new water supply lines in uncovered areas, laying of additional sewerage system and establishment of water supply testing laboratory. “Through these projects, we are able to provide clean and safe drinking water and good sewerage network system to avoid contamination, especially in rehabilitation colonies, and increase the number of children-friendly green parks in the city,” said Yadav. Smart city awards: No. 1 in cultureThis is the first time when the ministry has given awards to states and UTs for overall performance of smart cities and for their proactive role. Earlier, only the cities were ranked and awarded for their performance under the smart city mission. Yadav, who is also the Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) chief executive officer, said: “Except for the 24x7 pan city water supply project, all of the major projects are in advance stages of implementation, which was achieved in the last one year.” There are 37 projects under the CSCL’s ambit. Of around ₹2,000-crore works planned under the mission, it has started implementing projects worth ₹1,225 crore. Among cities, the awards were given across the themes of social aspects, governance, culture, urban environment, sanitation, economy, built environment, water and urban mobility. Chandigarh managed to get the top award only in the theme of culture. It is a joint winner with Indore in the category. In rest of the themes, Chandigarh didn’t fare well and couldn’t break into the top three. Notably, the work of the restoration of the Capitol Complex, a heritage project, was carried out by the UT engineering department and not the MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amrut-awards-chandigarh-adjudged-best-ut-second-overall-101624648796199.html

So far, 4,08,353 (58%) residents have taken their first dose,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, Chandigarh.Also, 80,030 (11%) people out of the eligible population have completed their vaccination cycle after getting their second dose, till Friday. Besides, 94.48% of the total healthcare and 94.24% of the total frontline workers have received the first shot.In all, 4,31,853 vaccine doses have been administered to people in Chandigarh, who include a few non-residents, as the health department does not have specific data on locals vaccinated.“We focus on vaccinating people in the age group of 18-44 as their drive started only in May. So far, 1,61,429 beneficiaries in this age group have taken their first shot while 342 of them have already completed their vaccination cycle,” said Dr Kang, adding that the UT health department has started walk-in vaccination facility in all government hospitals and dispensaries to help those who could not book appointment on the Co-WIN app.The health department is also sending 15 mobile vaccination vans to various places in Chandigarh daily, including to urban clusters and rural areas where people can simply walk in and get inoculated. Door-to-door vax in AugustFor helping the elderly population who could not visit the vaccination centres due to their age or other illnesses, the health department will conduct door-to-door vaccination rounds from August 1 to 15.“So far, 79,590 elderly people (above the age of 60) have taken their first dose in Chandigarh, and still some population is left to cover. The door-to-door vaccination will help them in vaccinating the remaining elderly people,” said Dr Kang.Dr Kang also said that vaccines are easily available in government as well as private hospitals, and they are getting regular supply from the central government.“The central government has allocated 2 lakh doses for Chandigarh for July, of which 1.5 lakh will be given to government hospitals.

26-06-2021||Bangalore||As B’luru unlocks, air quality falls back to pre-pandemic levels: Data||Bengaluru: As the Covid-induced lockdown is lifted, pollution level in Bengaluru is back to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, thereby indicating vehicular movement as one of the biggest contributors of air pollution across urban centres, according to data. Experts say that lifting of curbs has ushered in a pattern of deceleration and acceleration that it now just takes weeks for a sharp difference in AQI (air quality index, a metric to report daily air quality) as against years earlier.Data from the KSPCB (Karnataka State Pollution Control Board) shows that AQI during the lockdown from April 26, resulted in an improvement of 35.26% as compared to regular days. The AQI on normal days was in the range of 77 to 113, the highest on Mysuru Road, as against a range of 41-55 in May, when the BS Yediyurappa-led government announced a lockdown to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.“While most people believe that traffic is the biggest source of pollution in Bengaluru, other activities like construction, destruction and the dust that rises with traffic is a huge problem that impacts AQI,” said a technical official at the KSPCB, on condition of anonymity.Bengaluru, at least in the last two decades, has been in a constant state of construction with unrelenting road works, mushrooming high-rise buildings and rising traffic that has resulted in erosion of green cover, lakes and rapidly declining quality of air and water.“There is an increase in the number of cars going to petrol stations as most of them have not been refuelled for more than a month,” said Madhusudhan Anand, the co-founder and chief technical officer (CTO) at Ambee, a start-up that builds hyperlocal environment data and intelligence in real-time globally.Data from Ambee shows that average AQI before lockdown was at 90 which came down to around 60 during the restriction period and has climbed back to 87.The AQI was marginally high even during the lockdown since there was a higher consumption of energy indoors, leading to emission.Places like Nerriga, Handenahalli, Dommasandra, Attibele, Yadavanahalli, Bellandur, Mayasandra, Kugur and Sarjapur have AQI’s as high as nearly 160 post the lockdown.According to KSPCB data, AQI is between moderate and satisfactory across all its real-time monitoring stations.Experts do have their concerns on this analysis as most of KSPCB’s monitoring stations are placed away from the actual high-density traffic.For instance, the air monitoring centre in BTM Layout, one of the most congested localities in Bengaluru, is placed around a canopy of trees near Madiwala lake and away from the main road, which is unlikely to capture the true extent of the pollution.According to KSPCB, in its revised action plan for the control of air pollution in Bengaluru, the city’s AQI has fallen from 107.1 in 2014-15 to 88.1 in 2018-19, that shows a decreasing trend in the five-year annual average.This data has been disputed even by elected representatives, apart from scientists and other experts on the subject.The 41-point KSPCB action plan includes implementation of LPG and bio-fuels, promoting battery operated vehicles, effective disposal of construction debris and operation of the metro among other measures to decrease the harmful pollutants entering the air.Bengaluru’s vehicle population is just shy of the 10 million-mark. The city also has almost all of its roads dug up in the guise of some project of the other, raising clouds of dust, reducing average speeds and keeping vehicles stationary for longer durations that adds to higher emissions, experts said.“Only when it rains, it brings the particulate matter down but the chemical pollutants like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide will be high. Every day we are seeing it increase,” Madhusudhan said.The state government is trying to promote non-motorised transport (NMT) like cycling and walking for short commutes but inadequate infrastructure and dug up footpaths and roads, among other factors, have added to its challenges.Bengaluru’s prowess in Information Technology (IT), start-up ecosystem, aerospace and other infrastructure has given rise to the middle and higher middle-income groups, spurring aspirational possessions like private vehicles, homes, electric appliances among other products that have added to its challenges.The delay in completion of metro, sub-urban rail and even increasing bus services has increased the dependence on private vehicles, which was exacerbated post the pandemic where people have steered clear of public transport for fear of contracting the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/as-b-luru-unlocks-air-quality-falls-back-to-pre-pandemic-levels-data-101624648615673.html

Merit and empathy should be the criteria for the appointment of new chairperson,” Kerala BJP chief K Surendran tweeted.Josephine drew flak from all quarters, including supporters of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Kerala, of which she is a central committee member.The incident unfolded when a woman called in the show, a special programme held by a Malayalam channel to lay attention on women experiencing harassment and abuse at home. The woman spoke about her husband and mother-in-law beating her up, and informed that she has not yet registered a complaint with the police or even told a single person about her ordeal at home. Josephine said, “Then you suffer, OK,” and snapped the line.While the state women panel chief attempted to justify her response, she later issued an apology after she and her party came under fire. “I was talking to her with motherly affection. If my words have pained anyone, I regret,” Josephine said, adding that she was angry about women suffering silently.Earlier today, she told news agency ANI that she didn’t make the remark. “There are women who aren’t listening to us. We suggest women file complaints, making the case stronger as we can’t reach everywhere,” Josephine added.However, soon after Josephine stated that she realised she shouldn’t have reacted to the woman’s plight in “such manner,” ANI reported.Both Kerala Congress and state BJP unit demanded action against her. While the women’s wing of state Congress burnt Josephine’s effigy to make their point, K Surendran called for registering a First Information Report (FIR) against her.The incident comes in the wake of three dowry-related deaths reported in one week in Kerala. In one case that happened on June 21, a 23-year-old woman, who married a government official last year, died by suicide. Initial police investigation suggest that her husband allegedly beat her up for months over scorn with the dowry she had brought.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-women-s-panel-chief-resigns-after-remark-stirs-row-101624648075697.html
26-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Decision to resume quarrying in Parsik Hill meets with resistance||The Maharsahtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s decision to reopen 102 stone quarries in Navi Mumbai’s Parsik Hill has been met with resistance from environmentalists, who have written to chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray cautioning him against the decision. They said the move is detrimental not just to the environment but also the public health of residents living in Vashi, Turbhe, Belapur, Ghansoli, Rabale and Nerul. Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde had, on June 23, publicly announced the decision after meeting with a delegation of local quarry operators and assuring them that the mines, which were shuttered five years ago, will be re-started to help settle the Navi Mumbai project-affected people (PAP) and float 40,000 jobs. Since 1972, Cidco had been allotting quarries to PAP in lieu of the land acquired for the development of Navi Mumbai.However, quarrying has since been halted on two occasions — once in the mid-90s at the intervention of late Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray, and again in 2016, after the forest department ascertained that mining has been done in significantly more than the permissible land. Against the 138 hectares allotted till the year 2026, around 248 hectares had been quarried, the forest department ascertained.“Allowing the mining to resume is simply irresponsible. There are many social welfare schemes under which PAPs can be settled, and we do not have to continue to blast these already plundered hills,” said NatConnect Foundation director BN Kumar, who has written a letter to the CM, suggesting to find alternative sites to fetch stone chips required for construction work.“The government could encourage quarrying on cooperative basis in other parts of the state which are not inhabited, and thus offer gainful employment to the project-affected families,” Kumar said in his June 24 letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray.Nandakumar Pawar, head of NGO Shri Ekavira Aai Pratishthan, has also appealed to the CM to intervene and ensure that the Parsik Hill range is conserved. “Some of the hills have almost entirely been flattened as contractors have overstepped their limits. Cidco is constructing affordable housing projects adjacent to some of the quarries, putting them at risk of landslides. The residents will be directly affected by fugitive emissions from mining activity,” said Pawar.Apart from environmentalists, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has previously opposed the resumption of Parsik Hill quarrying, citing air pollution concerns. In 2017, under the aegis of the then NMMC chief Dr N Ramasamy, the civic body had filed an affidavit in the National Green Tribunal opposing the Parsik Hill quarrying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-decision-to-resume-quarrying-in-parsik-hill-meets-with-resistance-101624647956372.html
26-06-2021||Other||Antilia case: NIA gets custody of 2 till July 1 to probe source of funds||The special NIA (National Investigation Agency) court on Friday extended the custody of Santosh Shelar and Anand Jadhav – arrested by the federal agency on June 11 in connection with the recovery of an explosives-laden SUV near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home and the subsequent murder of the car owner Mansukh Hiran – till July 1.Special judge Prashant Sitre extended the duo’s NIA remand after the agency informed the court that the two were in touch with the other accused in the case through social media. NIA also informed the court that Shelar and Jadhav were arrested from Latur, but before moving to the Marathwada district, had spent time in Delhi and other places outside Maharashtra. NIA’s counsel further said that the duo was provided funds by the other accused in the case, and the agency wants to find out how the money was routed, and with whom were they in touch during the period. The agency sought an extension of their remand claiming that it wants to interrogate Shelar and Jadhav to recover Hiran’s phone, watch, wallet, credit and debit cards.The special court on Friday also remanded former Mumbai Police inspector Sunil Mane, who too is arrested in the twin cases, back in judicial custody. Mane was arrested by NIA on April 23, and on May 13, he was remanded in judicial custody. He has been lodged in Taloja prison since then. He was again remanded in NIA custody on June 21, as the agency wanted to confront him with the other accused in the case.On February 25, an SUV was found abandoned near Antilia – Ambani’s home – with 20 lose gelatin sticks and a threatening note. On March 5, Hiran was found dead in creek near Mumbra, with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth and his face covered by a scarf. NIA took over both the cases and has arrested 10 people. The other accused include controversial ex-police officer Sachin Vaze, his former crime branch colleague Riyazuddin Kazi and ex-encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma. NIA has also arrested former constable Vinayak Shinde who is a life convict in a fake encounter killing case, cricket bookie Naresh Gor, and two others – Satish Mothukari and Manish Soni.Vaze was originally in charge of the investigation of the Antilia case, but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who had reported the SUV stolen on February 17. It subsequently emerged that Vaze had borrowed the SUV in November and returned it in early February. NIA has claimed that it was Vaze who had planted the explosives-laden vehicle near Ambani’s residence and the other police officers arrested in the case were allegedly involved in larger conspiracy. NIA further alleged that they got Hiran killed after he refused to take the blame for planting the SUV and getting arrested in the case.According to NIA, Soni was driving the car in which Shelar, Jadhav and Mothukari smothered the 48-year-old trader, along Ghodbunder Road. The Tavera car was owned by Shelar. The four later dumped Hiran’s body in a creek near Mumbra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/antilia-case-nia-gets-custody-of-2-till-july-1-to-probe-source-of-funds-101624647897386.html

No injuries were reported.The building was around 60-years old and the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) had given permission to the building for carrying out repair works. A Mhada official said, “There are around 50 tenants including commercial and residential. The building was over 60-year-old and we had given permission for conducting repair works. We will verify whether the repair work, which is ongoing, is being done as per the permission and if it caused the collapse.”Arun Dongre, chief of Mhada’s repair board, said, “The building was not a dilapidated structure and is identified as an A category building in our list. The structure was in a very good condition and we had given permission for repair works.”Local Shiv Sena corporator Sujata Sanap said, “A slab collapsed on the third floor around 6.45am. However, no-one was injured in the incident. We vacated all residents due to safety reasons. All commercial tenants are safe as shops were shut early in the morning.”According to MFB officials, initially 20 persons were rescued and later another 15 persons were vacated safely using the window as the staircase area was blocked. The rescue and evacuation operations were completed by noon, and the work of removing of debris is ongoing. Meanwhile, earlier this month Mhada had declared that in its pre-monsoon survey, 21 of the 14,755 dilapidated buildings in the island city are “extremely dangerous”. It has asked the residents living in the 21 structures to immediately vacate their houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-35-rescued-as-ceiling-of-building-collapses-in-fort-101624647895596.html

Interacting with media at NCP party office in Pune, he said, “The Central government is misusing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and ED for political agenda, and it’s not new for Maharashtra and other states.”ED on Friday raided Deshmukh’s residence at Nagpur. Reacting to the raid, Pawar said, “There’s nothing new about ED raids; such raids happened previously also. I am sure they would not find anything. As ED did not getting anything, out of frustration they are arresting someone.”Pawar said, “I have been in the political sphere for a long time, but never saw that any political party passed any resolution to start CBI inquiry against opposition party leader. Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) state president Chandrakant Patil passed such resolution in its state level meeting and demanded CBI inquiry against deputy CM Ajit Pawar.”He added, “The BJP is ruling in the Centre and CBI is under the Central government; as it is they are misusing it.”The NCP chief also welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with Kashmir leaders and said, “It is good that the Central government realised they did nothing in Kashmir despite the promises. Let’s hope that the PM would keep his promises given to all party leaders in Kashmir.”Meanwhile, Pawar is likely to bat for common leadership in the upcoming Lok Sabha election instead of giving single face from opposition parties. Pawar said, “I expressed my opinion very clearly that opposition parties should do alliance along with the Congress. There is a need to have common leadership.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/centre-misusing-cbi-ed-for-politics-sharad-pawar-101624647896222.html

He asked BJP’s national executive to pass a resolution seeking such a probe. “If CBI really wants to investigate, then it should investigate the land transaction conducted by the Ayodhya Mayor with the Ram temple trust. This is fit case for investigation,” he said.Raut accused the Centre of lowering the standards of the investigative agencies. “This is all part of vindictive politics. Are ED and CBI your party workers,” questioned Raut, adding, “This has only resulted in tarnishing the name of ED and CBI.”The Sena leader is also facing the ire of ED as his wife Varsha was questioned with regards to money laundering in the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank fraud case.Deshmukh has been facing the heat of central agencies. Last month, ED registered a criminal case of money laundering against him and CBI has already filed a first information report (FIR) against Deshmukh citing corruption charges.State Congress unit, too, slammed the Centre over the raid. “What is ED trying to search while raiding residence of Deshmukh, as even Sachin Vaze and Param Bir Singh who levelled allegations never said the money was given (to Deshmukh)? If ED feels money was given, why no raids on Vaze and Parambir who supposedly gave money,” asked state Congress spokesman Sachin Sawant. “All national investigative agencies have surrendered their independence before the Modi government and are being used as political weapons against opposition,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-raid-at-deshmukh-s-house-mva-partners-slam-centre-101624647836911.html
26-06-2021||Other||BJP, Cong to agitate today in Maharashtra for OBC quota||Maharashtra will witness state-wide protests on Saturday over the issue of reservation for Other Backward Classes’ (OBC). While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will stage ‘chakka jam’ (road blockade) and ‘jail bharo’ protests at various places, demanding the restoration of the 27% political reservation for the community, the Congress has declared to hold an agitation against the BJP-led Central government, holding it responsible for the quashing of the quota for the community in the Supreme Court. The party said that the Centre is not providing the census data, which led to the situation.OBCs are on the verge of losing their political reservation in local bodies across Maharashtra as it was quashed by the Apex court last month. The court has ruled that reservation in favour of the OBC community in local bodies should not result in exceeding the 50% cap in quota determined by it. It has also directed the state to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data, based on which, the reservation quota of the community be fixed. It means that no seat will be reserved for the OBC community in the upcoming local bodies comprising municipal corporations, municipal councils, zilla parishads, panchayat samiti and gram panchayats, at least for this year or until the state government completes the entire process. “The OBC community lost the reservation owing to the negligence of the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA (Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi) government. BJP has decided to protest against this government. Around 100,000 workers will hold the ‘jail bharo’ andolan in the state on June 26,” said state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil.Party’s national secretary Pankaja Munde said, “We will be holding ‘chakka jam’ at around 1,000 places on Saturday. The MVA government is misleading the people. The Centre has no role to play in this matter. They [MVA government] are dragging the Centre for political reasons.”To counter the claim, Congress’ state unit released a letter by BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis during his term as chief minister to Rajiv Kumar, the then vice-chairman of NITI Aayog, asking him to direct officials to provide district-level data of Maharashtra with geographical identification particulars, caste category and caste names. The letter was sent on August 1, 2019. “The target of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), BJP’s ideological front, is to abolish reservations, and the Narendra Modi-led Centre is working on the same lines. Fadnavis had sought the empirical data, which was denied by the Centre. We will hold an agitation against BJP’s anti-OBC policy on Saturday,” said state Congress chief Nana Patole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-cong-to-agitate-today-in-maharashtra-for-obc-quota-101624647836194.html
26-06-2021||Mumbai||ED traces link of ₹4 crore collected from Mumbai bar owners to Anil Deshmukh||The Enforcement Directorate on Friday claimed that it has traced the trail of ₹4 crore allegedly collected by dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze from some bar and restaurants owners in Mumbai. This amount allegedly reached companies indirectly linked to former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, ED said.ED officers on Friday raided five places including Deshmukh’s residences in Mumbai and Nagpur. They also questioned Deshmukh’s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande in connection with the money laundering case, at the agency’s south Mumbai office. Sources said that Deshmukh’s house at civil line area in Nagpur was raided at around 7.30am in the morning by a team of ED officers.Speaking to journalists at his Worli residence, Deshmukh said allegations against him are false and that Param Bir Singh levelled the accusation only after being shunted out from Mumbai Police chief’s post for poor handling of Antilia explosives scare case. Deshmukh said he is cooperating with ED.ED officers may also summon Deshmukh soon for questioning.The money laundering case against Deshmukh was filed based on the first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against him under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on April 21.CBI had started the probe against Deshmukh after the former Mumbai Police chief alleged that the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader ran an “extortion racket” in Mumbai. On April 21, CBI said it had found “prima facie evidence” against Deshmukh for allegedly misusing his position, and booked him for corruption and criminal conspiracy. Unlike CBI, ED can record statements of any person in a case under section 50 of PMLA and it is admissible as evidence in court.ED has also recorded statement of deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Raju Bhujbal whose name was mentioned by Singh in his letter to CM as witness to the alleged extortion by Deshmukh. Bhujbal is DCP of the establishment unit in Mumbai that keeps vigil on illegal activities in dance bars, pub, clubs, restaurants, hotels, etc.In past ED had also recorded statements of Dr Jaishree Patil, complainant in the CBI case, and some owners of bars, pubs, restaurants in Mumbai.Previously, on April 24, CBI had carried out raids at Deshmukh’s residences in Nagpur and Mumbai as well as Palande’s premises and seized digital devices.The NCP had previously dismissed ED’s case as politically motivated. The party said the allegations levelled by Singh are an attempt to defame the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government.CBI’s case came months after Singh accused Deshmukh of using the Mumbai Police for extortion from bars, hotels, and restaurants. CBI is probing Singh’s allegations as well as Deshmukh’s handing over of important cases to former assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and influencing transfers and postings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ed-traces-link-of-4-crore-collected-from-mumbai-bar-owners-to-anil-deshmukh-101624647835625.html

He also said people want an alternative and it is the responsibility of the political leadership to fulfil their expectations.The statement assumes significance in the backdrop of a meeting of leaders from many political parties and civil society members organised by Yashwant Sinha-led Rashtra Manch at Pawar’s Delhi residence early this week. There are speculations that the exercise was to assess possibility of a third front against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“We haven’t met over forming a third front but I am of the view that it can be only with the Congress as part of it. I also believe that a third (opposition) front is necessary and I have also expressed the same,” Pawar said in response to a question related to the meeting at his Delhi residence.He was interacting with reporters in Pune.“People want an alternative and the responsibility of fulfilling their expectation is on the political leadership,” he remarked in a response to a question.Pawar clarified that he has no plans on leading such a front but would work to help formulate it. “I was involved in such activities for many years. Now it’s enough. I will be working to help them, guide them, strengthen them and keep them united,” he said when asked if he would be leading a third front.He also said that the meeting was called to discuss a white paper over resolving farmers issues created after enactment of three contentious legislations. The white paper will be a road map on how to fix the matter as farmers have been agitating at Delhi borders for over six months.The NCP supremo also said it is the right of the Congress to work on strengthening the organisation. He made the statement in response to state Congress chief Nana Patole’s remarks over contesting the upcoming polls alone. “Every party has the right to strengthen its organisation, be it any. We have no complaints as we all say so to boost morale of party cadres. We will welcome it if the Congress is making such efforts. It is their right,” the veteran leader said.Earlier this week, Patole had said his party would fight all the forthcoming elections alone and that the Congress would be the single-largest party in 2024 Assembly polls. This led to friction among the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was upset with the remarks.Addressing Shiv Sena’s 55th foundation day, Thackeray had on Saturday said, “If we do not offer solutions to people’s problems but only talk about going it alone in politics, people will beat us with footwear. They will not listen to our party-centric, ambitious talk of contesting elections alone.” Though he chose not to name anyone, the remarks were clear that he is not happy with the stand taken by the Congress state unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-third-front-without-congress-says-sharad-pawar-101624647775631.html

The owners were well aware of the boat’s defective condition, he alleged.The police on Thursday night registered an offence under sections 304 (2) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code against Glory Shipmanagment Pvt Ltd, its managing director Rajesh Kumar Shahi and other unknown accused. Shahi said, “These are is baseless allegations. The vessel was certified by multiple government agencies such as Indian Register of Shipping, ONGC safety audit, Mercantile Marine Department, marine warranty surveyors etc. After their approval, the vessel was sent to ONGC field.”The police visited Simon’s home in Kerala and recorded his statement on Wednesday. He told the police that the tugboat was 34 years old, and it required substantial repairs and maintenance work. But the owner of the boat had allegedly ignored it.“We raised issues related to every defect of the vessel through emails to the owner firm and informed it about the urgent requirement for FSA (formal safety assessment) inspections. A detailed email about the need for urgent repair work of the defects was also sent to the company through the boat’s captain in first week of April, but they did not take cognisance of it,” said Simon.There were several repair and maintenance works on the boat, ranging from welding and painting work, repairing of machines and other parts, which were pending since long, he alleged.“As the rubber packing of the door frame of the engine room was not fixed, the door frame of the exit and steering rooms also had holes and rust and were not watertight. The engine room and steering compartment were flooded with sea water. The crew had to manually throw water out, but due to tidal waves, the two rooms got flooded in no time and the boat lost stability. The boat got tilted at the left side and ultimately sank,” Simon stated in the FIR, of which HT has a copy.“Because of the poor maintenance, the stability of the vessel got compromised and it sank. The company was well aware that the boat was not seaworthy, yet they put it on operation. They showed that the boat is seaworthy only on paper and didn’t carry out actual maintenance,” said the 50-year-old, who held charge as chief engineer of the boat.“Our (boat’s) FSA inspection was due on April 30. A 15-day extension was granted, and two days after expiry of this period, the boat met a tragic end. This is extreme level of ignorance. They did not bother about workers’ lives and also underestimated the power of the cyclone,” said Simon.The FIR stated that the company did not appoint a chief engineer for the tugboat and it was a violation of rules of directorate general of shipping and was also a safety threat. The boat’s renovation survey was not done for five years and the skeleton of the boat or the main part was badly rusted and had many holes. The tugboat’s proper maintenance was also not done as per the rules and standards of Indian Flag and Indian Registered Ship, Simon said in his statement.“Though the boat was 34 years old, it delivers good performance if maintained properly. Age is no factor, quality and regular maintenance are,” he said.The police are in process of contacting the email service provider to retrieve the emails the boat’s captain (died in the incident) had sent to the company raising issues about the defects of the boats and urgent requirement of its repairing. Suhah Hemade, senior inspector of Yellow Gate police station, said, “We have recorded the statements of the two survivors of Varaparada boat and will soon call the boat’s owner for questioning.”On the night of May 16, Varaparada had successfully tugged an engineless accommodation barge, Gal Constructor, with 137 people on board. The barge was approximately 90 nautical miles away from the shore, near an ONGC platform. Varaparada tugged it safely to Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT).After this, it came back near JNPT, but next day when the cyclone arrived, Varaparada’s anchor broke and it started drifting into the sea and later sank.Beside Varaprada, on May 17, a barge named Papaa305 also sank near the Heera Oil Field in the Arabian Sea, killing 75 of the 261 crew members, after Cyclone Tauktae passed by the Mumbai Coast. The Navy and Coast Guard had rescued 186 people on board. Yellow Gate police is investigating a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder in connection with the Papaa305 incident. The master of the barge, who died in the incident, has been named an accused in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tug-boat-that-sank-in-mumbai-high-was-unfit-for-voyage-survivor-101624647716230.html
26-06-2021||Other||TN cracks down on crimes against women, children||ChennaiThere has been a crackdown on sexual crimes against women and children and a spate of arrests recently in Tamil Nadu, which DMK leaders say have been done on a direction from chief minister MK Stalin’s office, citing the party’s election manifesto that focussed on women’s safety wellbeing. Political observers see the actions as an attempt to improve the DMK’s image for long-term political gains. The string of arrests began when a few school students and alumni began to share their trauma of being sexually abused by commerce teacher G Rajagopalan of Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan (PSBB) school. His immediate arrest and the school education department swinging into action helped in building confidence among survivors, and it snowballed into a crackdown on institutionalised child sexual abuse with complaints pouring in from across the state. On Friday, Chennai police invoked the Goondas Act against Rajagopalan to detain him for a year. For offences in cybercrime, the police also invoked the Goondas Act against prominent social media person Kishore K Swamy, who was arrested last week on a complaint filed by DMK’s IT wing for his defamatory posts against former chief ministers CN Annadurai and M Karunanidhi. He has been arrested previously including last year on charges of harassing women journalists and politicians, by targeting them on social media. He was out on bail.A day ago, one of Chennai police’s own personnel, a sub-inspector attached to the city’s Madhavaram police station, was arrested under Pocso Act after a girl Whatsapped her complaint directly to the Chennai police commissioner Shankar Jiwal against the accused for abusing her. Her mother was also arrested as an abettor. A few days ago, police arrested self-styled religious guru Siva Sankar Baba who is among half a dozen of teachers and coaches arrested on complaints of child sexual abuse made by school students and alumni. Former AIADMK minister for information and technology M Manikandan has been arrested on several charges, including rape, filed by a Tamil woman who is of Malaysian nationality. A popular Youtuber and gamer, Madan Kumar, was arrested after the cybercrime wing received more than a 100 complaints against his YouTube channel where he uploaded a banned game, PubG. It was accompanied by live commentary where he either verbally abused women players or made derogatory comments against women with other male players. His channel had more than 700,00 subscribers, including minors. Police have been swiftly acting against complaints even if they are made on social media and pursuing the victims to file a police complaint, so that an FIR can be registered to investigate the case against perpetrators. “Usually these accused come out on bail in 10 days. We are giving special attention to that, strengthening evidence and keeping these people away from the society,” said Jiwal. “We are fast-tracking these cases because it is not like a crime of passion. It’s almost like an organised crime where the victim is left with a lot of psychological scars. Even if we get multiple complaints against a single person, none are discouraged.”Two cases including that of Sankar Baba, the founder of Sushil Hari International School, have been transferred to the CB-CID. Investigating police officers of the crimes against women and children wing and the CB-CID have made their phone numbers public to help survivors file complaints by protecting their identity.“He (Stalin) has given a free hand to the police authorities to act on complaints of crimes against women and children and he is personally following it,” said a DMK leader not wishing to be named. “He doesn’t want any delays in taking action. The law enforcement has to take its own course, but he has asked for action to be taken against those who are stalling complainants also. He is personally following up on these cases.”Governor Banwarilal Purohit in his customary address during the 16th legislative assembly on Monday said that the DMK government will launch special initiatives to address all aspects of women’s wellbeing, development and empowerment. “Safety of women from harassment in the workplace, protection against cybercrime and prevention of domestic violence will be prioritised,” the Governor said. “To encourage greater work participation by women, working women’s hostels will be established in every district.”The DMK says that they are planning a legislation to strengthen existing laws on this issue but did not give more details at this stage. “The chief minister is very serious about this. We want to put a stop to this issue,” said DMK MP and spokesperson TKS Elangovan. “Nobody has the authority to insult, degrade another human being. The government will not be a mute spectator to this. The issue is prevalent in all sections, including at the higher officials and ministers level, which is bad for the society.”In the election manifesto, the DMK had announced a slew of welfare and development-related schemes for women, which included introducing special cybercrime police stations to investigate crimes against women. “Cyber police stations will be set up in all districts with technically qualified, trained employees to address the increasing prevalence of cybercrimes against women and children,” the manifesto read.On Monday, the government also released guidelines for ‘students’ safety & protection from sexual violence & protocol for online classes’ applicable to all schools belonging to all educational boards in Tamil Nadu. It includes measures, such as the school education department to set up a state-level “central complaint centre” to offer an alternative complaint mechanism and provide guidance so that all complaints received are addressed appropriately.Political observers say that through this issue, the DMK is reinventing its image. “The DMK is working to be in power for the next 10 years, much like how it was when Narendra Modi was elected in 2014,” said Ramu Manivanan, head of the political science and public administration department, University of Madras. “This is crucial for the DMK to draw the trust of the women vote bank which was cultivated by the AIADMK’s founder M G Ramachandran and his successor J Jayalalithaa.”In the immediate scenario it could help in the local body elections that will be conducted soon for which the DMK held a meeting Friday with their district secretaries as well as with its long-term vision, he said. DMK’s Elangovan, however, said that the party has always supported women. “When Kalaignar (Karunanidhi) was the chief minister, DMK was the first to bring in a legislation that women should have a share in the ancestral property,” he said. “We formed the women self-help groups, we brought in the legislation that 30% of government jobs go to women and we ensured financial empowerment so that they don’t have to be dependent on a man. Until 1976, when education was in the state list before Indira Gandhi amended it to be on the concurrent list, Kalaignar had made education free for women up to postgraduation.”Activists have welcomed DMK’s increased attention to these issues but often point out to selective action as the party continues to be closely associated with Tamil cinema lyricist Vairamuthu who has been accused of sexual harassment by a dozen women. No police complaint has been filed in his case although singer Chinmayi Sripaada registered a complaint with the National Council for Women. In May, after social media backlash against Vairamuthu being conferred the ONV Literary award and against Stalin for congratulating him, the lyricst returned his award. “A commitment to gender equality begins at home,” said Swarna Rajagopalan, political scientist and founder of gender rights-based advocacy group, The Prajnya Trust. “It is a good thing that the government is showing seriousness of intent in following up on specific abuse charges, and also in setting up systems for prevention. A publicly stated commitment is always a welcome point of departure,” said Rajagopalan. “However, this commitment should be demonstrated by the party distancing itself from alleged abusers within its ranks and allies, whether those who are facing harassment allegations or those who have made misogynistic speeches. As suggested by the Prajnya Gender Equality Election Checklist, they should not be nominated or supported again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tn-cracks-down-on-crimes-against-women-children-101624647715690.html
26-06-2021||Other||How did Mumbai civic body lose this drain of thought?||The condition of Everard nullah in Chunabhatti stands as one of the examples of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) claims that it has completed 104% of the pre-monsoon desilting work on nullahs across the city, said the panel of experts who participated in HT’s annual audit for monsoon preparedness earlier this week. Desilted, cleaned and widened with a free flow of stormwater, Everard nullah has got the maximum marks by HT’s experts’ panel. However, just 100 metres downstream, where a private nullah that runs through the premises of Somaiya Institute and merges with Everard nullah, the site breaks all illusions of Mumbai being ready to handle this year’s monsoon and preventing waterlogging. Clogged with garbage and hardened silt, this private nullah hardly has any flow of water. However, BMC’s explanation for its unkempt state is that this nullah runs through private premises, and hence, is the responsibility of the party concerned to desilt it every monsoon. Authorities claimed that they send the responsible party frequent reminders every monsoon to clean the nullah as well as to widen it, but to no avail. As the nullah caters to the areas of Kurla and Chunabhatti, its impact on waterlogging in these areas is high, according to HT’s panel of experts. A senior civic official from the stormwater drains department, said, “BMC has completed 100% of pre-monsoon desilting and cleaning work at Everard nullah. The other nullah is a private nullah, and the respective property [owner] has not done any work.”As part of HT’s monsoon audit that was conducted on Wednesday, a panel of three experts inspected two nullahs in the eastern suburbs as well as two chronic waterlogging spots – Gandhi Market and Hindmata Junction on Babasaheb Ambedkar Road – in the Island city and graded these spots an average of 1.7 marks out of 5. The experts graded Everard nullah the highest score, averaging 3.83 out of 5, followed by Hindamata junction (1.33). The private nullah got 1 mark out of the total 5, while Gandhi Market was given 0.5 rating. One of the experts on the panel, DK Pathak – who retired in 2009 as deputy engineer of BMC’s stormwater drains department after 33 years of service –said, “The intersection where the private nullah meets Everard nullah is a T junction. Hence the flow of water from the private nullah gets interrupted due to the smooth flow of Everard’s nullah at the 90° angle. If this was a Y junction, the flow from the private nullah would have been smoother.”After multiple projects over the years – since the 2005 deluge –have failed to mitigate waterlogging at Hindamata, BMC is now constructing two underground water-holding silos at the junction, and one at Gandhi Market to deal with the chronic problem. However, according to experts, this is unlikely to put an end to waterlogging at these two chronic flooding spots. Udaykumar Shiroorkar, a retired assistant engineer of BMC, who was a part of HT’s panel of experts, said, “The expenditure is unnecessary, and the civic body needs to weigh its usefulness against its cost. At the most, this will reduce the water receding time by a few hours.” According to Pathak, the storage capacity of tanks at both these places is meagre in comparison to the quantity of water accumulated after a heavy downpour. “Topographically, Hindmata is saucer shaped, and hence, prone to waterlogging. The water receding time from Gandhi Market entirely depends on the cleaning and widening of the successive drains and culverts,” said Pathak. While each of the silos at Hindamata will have a capacity to hold 1,000 cubic metres (1 million litres) of water, the one at Gandhi Market will be able to hold 1,200 cubic metres of water. Water from these silos will be channelled from underground pipes to two other bigger underground silos — one at Pramod Mahajan Udyan on Senapati Bapat Road near Elphinstone station, and one under St Xavier’s ground in Parel. As part of phase 1, construction of these silos and the underground water dispensing system will cost the civic body ₹60 crore. The entire project of construction of five water silos to provide relief from waterlogging, is likely to cost around ₹130 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/how-did-mumbai-civic-body-lose-this-drain-of-thought-101624647535612.html
26-06-2021||Lucknow||After June’s 10 million milestone, UP govt aims at 100 million Covid vaccine doses by Aug 31||The Uttar Pradesh government has raised the bar after having reached the milestone of one crore (10 million) Covid vaccine doses for the month of June six days ahead of schedule.It is now aiming to administer a minimum of 10 lakh (one million) doses each day from July 1 and cross the mark of 10 crore (100 million) doses by August 31. Till Thursday, the state administered 2.9 crore (29 million) vaccine doses, nearly 13% of the total population of the state, according to official statistics.If the state reaches the 10-crore mark by August 31, the total number of doses administered in the state would have covered 43% of the total population (at least one dose).The state government considers UP’s population to be 23 crore. (This includes 20 crore, according to the 2011 Census, plus three crore as per the decadal population rise calculated at the same rate at which population increased between 2001 and 2011).Experts say vaccinating such large numbers will certainly help in protecting people against the virus, even the mutations.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said at a high-level Covid review meeting on Friday: “Vaccination is an effective safety shield against Covid infection. The state government had set the target of giving one crore jabs in June and the target was achieved on June 24, six days ahead and the state has so far given 2.9 crore doses of the vaccine. Forty-two lakh people got both the doses. From July 1, the daily target is a minimum 10 lakh doses each day and we should work according to this target.”Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said that the state aimed to reach the 10-crore mark by August 31.With 42 lakh (4.2 million) people having got both doses, it means about 1.8% of UP’s total population is fully vaccinated.Prof Kauser Usman, head of the department of geriatric medicine at King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow, said: “We can hope that if a big number, like 1-12 crore, is vaccinated with even the first dose, it will certainly help develop antibodies. People, even if getting sick with Covid, shall have mild symptoms and recover faster.”Regarding the mutants (Delta or Delta-Plus variants of coronavirus), Dr Sheetal Verma, senior faculty at the department of microbiology, KGMU, said: “All vaccines are cross protective. Hence, if mutation happens in the virus, it will cover them also to some extent. We should hope that more people being vaccinated will help face the infection with better preparedness.”The state has already adopted a cluster system mainly in the rural areas and the urban municipal wards to saturate geographic regions with vaccination.“Under the cluster system, the idea is to put a group of villages in a cluster and (treat) a group of municipal wards as clusters and administer all in the eligible age groups in those clusters in a week’s time,” said a senior government official, explaining the system.Yogi Adityanath on Friday said that the cluster system was rolled out in one-third of the development blocks in the state. From July 1, it will be implemented in the entire state.Prelim results of sero-survey indicate high level of antibodies: YogiChief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday also mentioned the sero-survey done in UP early this month.He said: “The initial indications of the survey hint at good results. Preliminary results of the survey indicate the presence of a high level of antibodies in the people sample surveyed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/after-june-s-10-million-milestone-up-govt-aims-at-100-million-covid-vaccine-doses-by-aug-31-101624647176236.html

The work at the department remained suspended from 9am to 5pm.Employees in all branches like administrative and accounts raised slogans against the government and demanded a roll back of the pay commission.Their demands include that the government must cover employees recruited after 2004 under the pension scheme, immediate release of the dearness allowance instalment that has been pending for many months, filling all vacant posts in government departments to ease burden on existing employees, revival of all allowances of the ministerial staff that have been stopped and regularisation of jobs of all employees working on contractual basis in the department.Harminder Singh Romi, president of Sanjha Moracha Front, said, “The pen-down strike will continue till June 27 and if the government will not roll back the implementation of sixth commission, then we will intensify our stir.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sixth-pay-commission-recommendations-ludhiana-dist-education-office-staff-starts-4-day-pen-down-strike-101624647122187.html
26-06-2021||Chandigarh||Row over water-sewer tariff: Come Monday, BJP to gherao Cong councillors’ homes in Ludhiana||Demanding reinstatement of water-sewer bill exemption to buildings under 125 square yards, BJP leaders on Friday said they will stage an agitation outside the homes of Congress councillors unless the civic body rolled back its decision. Submitting a memorandum to mayor Balkar Sandhu at the civic body’s Zone D office on Friday, BJP councillors said they will stage protests outside the homes of 62 Congress councillors on Monday. BJP leaders, including councillors’ leader Sunita Rani, local bodies cell in-charge Inder Aggarwal, and councillors Om Prakash Ratra, Surinder Atawal, Yashpal Chaudhary and Annie Sikka, also demanded that the municipal corporation (MC) revoke the 60-70% hike in water-sewer tariff along with the decision of hiring a private firm to recover dues and taxes from residents. Aggarwal said, “Apart from rescinding the exemption, the MC has also increased the slab rates for different categories by up to 60%, which is unacceptable as residents are struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic. The tariff for houses with an area from 126 to 250 square yards has been increased from ₹2,520 to ₹4,200.”As per the MC’s decision at the start of the financial year, only houses with up to 50 square- yard area with only the ground floor are exempted from water-sewer charges. Owners of houses with an area ranging from 51 square yards to 125 square yards will have to shell out ₹2,400 as annual water-sewer charges.Sunita said, “The exemption given to 50 square yards houses is negligible as few houses that fall under the category. The decision to hire a private firm for recovering dues from the residents will encourage ‘gunda raj’ in the city.” District BJP president Pushpinder Singal said the civic body is claiming that the tariff had to be revised to avail a loan from the World Bank to commence surface-based water supply in the city. However, the government should have announced a subsidy, so that the extra burden was not shouldered by residents. “BJP will gherao Congress councillors on Monday, and if our demands are not fulfilled, we will take the agitation a notch higher,” said Singal.On June 17, the BJP had staged a protest outside the zonal office of the MC over the issue. Congress MLA Surinder Dawar and some Congress councillors had also demanded resumption of water-sewer exemption during a meeting with the mayor on Thursday. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said “The BJP is trying to gain political mileage. The proposal to hire a private firm for recovery of dues has already been put on hold. The water-sewer tariff has been approved by the MC general house, and if councillors have an objection they can table a resolution to revise the tariff in the next MC house meeting.” SAD submits memorandum as well Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillors led by leader of opposition in MC general house Harbhajan Singh Dang also submitted a memorandum with mayor Balkar Sandhu against revocation of the water-sewer exemption. SAD councillors also condemned the MC’s move to serve ‘absurd’ notices for illegal construction on the basis of new power connections availed by owner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/row-over-water-sewer-tariff-come-monday-bjp-to-gherao-cong-councillors-homes-in-ludhiana-101624647116677.html

Eighty-five vehicles have been challaned for carrying cargo beyond the permitted height or weight over the last two days. Joint commissioner of police (JCP, City) Deepak Pareek said, “We initiated a drive against overloaded vehicles on Wednesday. It has been seen that vehicles carrying iron rods that are protruding outside the confines of the truck usually catalyse road mishaps.” Ten vehicles were challaned on the first day of the drive, which was initiated after a passenger bus rammed into a parked truck on the Ludhiana- Delhi national highway. “As many as 16 challans were issued in Zone 1, 35 in Zone 2, 11 in Zone 3 and 13 in Zone 4, of which 44 challans were issued for the cargo exceeding the stipulated height and 31 for exceeding the weight on Thursday,” the JCP said, adding that the drive is being carried out in areas such as the Jalandhar Bypass, Focal Point, Industrial Area, Sahnewal Chowk, Shiv Chowk, Veer Palace, Samrala Chowk, Gill Road and Transport Nagar.Crackdown on illegal LED lights in cars next Those who have installed illegal LED lights on their vehicles may find themselves in the police’s crosshairs next. “There is a trend among youngsters to get extra LED lights installed in their cars to give their vehicles a fancy appearance. However, these lights could blind commuters for a few seconds, which may cause road mishaps,” the JCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/special-drive-in-ludhiana-75-overloaded-vehicles-challaned-in-one-day-101624646999419.html

The accused are Shweta, her brother Rahul and one Jatin Sharma. In his complaint, Davinder Kumar of GK Vihar of Manakwal Road, said his son had met Shweta on Facebook in 2017. The two became engaged soon after. After the engagement, the accused convinced him to invest in their transport business, which would be based in Nagpur. They assured him that they would send him a cut of the profit every month, the complainant said. Kumar availed a loan of ₹35 lakh to invest in the business. Initially, when the accused did not send him any money, he assumed that they would start sending it once the business was established. After a few months, the accused told him that they had to wind up the business. Upon realising that he had been duped, he lodged a police complaint on December 12. Assistant sub-inspector Kulvir Singh, who is investigating the case, said an FIR had been registered under Sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code against the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/woman-dupes-ludhiana-based-fianc-his-father-of-35-lakh-3-booked-101624646876110.html
26-06-2021||Other||Three govt medical colleges in Punjab to be networked for better healthcare||To ease access to medical facilities, including in investigation for diagnosis, the Punjab government will computerise and get three Government Medical Colleges (GMCs) at Faridkot, Amritsar and Patiala on a common network. This will centralise information for the GMCs, helping in improving health care delivery processes and systems. The state’s department of medical education and research has entrusted this responsibility to Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), Faridkot, and the project is expected to be completed in a few months. The computerised and networked system will provide fast access to information related to the patient and improve all levels of health facility. To diagnose and treat individual patients effectively, individual care providers and care teams must have access to at least three major types of clinical information. These are the patient’s health record, the rapidly changing medical-evidence base, and orders guiding the process of patient care.  BFUHS vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur said the project comprised three stages, passive, active and hardware installation. “The passive part of this system has already been completed by BFUHS at Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital (GGSMCH) at Faridkot as well as at GMC Amritsar. In GMC Patiala, the process is 75% complete. In the active part, tender work has already been materialised by the university and after completion of active phase we will purchase the hardware. The process will be completed in a few months. Respective GMCs are to bear the cost from user charges,” he added. Medical education and research minister OP Soni said that BFUHS was taking these steps to connect with the state-of-the-art e-hospital software of the National Informatics Centre (NIC). “This will provide fast access to information,” he added. NRI DONATES HIGH-END VENTILATOR TO  BFUHS A non-resident of India (NRI) Rajendra Singh Rai from Birmingham, UK, with her Indian associate Herminder Kaur Natt of Chandigarh have donated a high-end ventilator, costing around ₹11 lakh to BFUHS. Dr Raj Bahadur said, “ Sensitive souls like Dr Rai are guided by the almighty. This equipment will ensure that for not less than 10 years, adequate care can be provided to patients in life-threatening situations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/three-govt-medical-colleges-in-punjab-to-be-networked-for-better-healthcare-101624646756159.html
26-06-2021||Chandigarh||Allowance cut: Doctors’ strike in Ludhiana leaves patients in a lurch||Patients turning up at state-run hospitals in the district were forced to return without treatment on Friday as doctors participated in a statewide day-long strike against the recommendation of the sixth pay commission to de-link non-practising allowance (NPA) from basic pay.On the call of the Punjab Civil Medical Services (PCMS) Association, several services such as outpatient departments (OPDs), inpatient departments (IPDs), unique IDs for persons with disabilities (UDID), Ayushman Bharat - Sarbat Sehat Bima Yojana (AB-SSBY), and elective surgeries remained suspended as around 400 doctors employed at the civil hospitals in Ludhiana, Khanna and Jagraon, and 10 community health centres boycotted work. Government-run dispensaries remained closed as well.At Ludhiana’s civil hospital, members of the Joint Punjab Government Doctors Coordination Committee, comprising general physicians, specialists, rural medical officers, homeopaths, and ayurveda specialists, staged a protest and raised slogans against the government.Patients left high and dry Patients unaware of the doctors’ strike turned up at different hospitals, only to be left high and dry. One such patient, Puja Rana of Field Gunj, who was visiting the dermatology department of the Civil Hospital, said she was asked to return on Monday. A migrant worker, Durgesh Kumar, who had come to the Civil Hospital from Guru Arjan Dev Nagar near Samrala Chowk, complained of an acute stomach ache, but with OPD services suspended received no prescription for his pain. The disgruntled patient said, “I work at a factory and cannot take leave time and again. Why should poor patients pay the price for the government’s decision? They should deny treatment to government officials instead!” Dr Rohit Rampal, who was leading the protests in the district, said, “At a time, when doctors are expecting their allowances to be supplemented for bravely battling the deadly coronavirus pandemic, the government has decided to reduce our salaries.” “NPA comprised 25% of our basic salary. However, the sixth pay commission, which ironically aims to better our pay scale, has reduced the component to 20% of our basic salary and has de-linked NPA from basic salary,” he said. Widespread resentment against govt: Doctor Another member of the PCMS Association Dr Avinash Jindal said, “There is huge resentment against the government’s policies in the health sector. The clerical staff of the health department is already on strike, while employees of the revenue and transport departments are also on protest path against the government.”  “We were hoping that the government would honour us for our service during the pandemic. However, far from offering incentives, the government has deducted our salaries,” Jindal said. Rural Medical Services Association president Dr JP Singh Narula said 592 rural dispensaries had remained closed across the state. “With the issue of dynamic assured career progression (DACP) still pending with the government, the decision to de-link NPA from the basic salary has broken the back of health service providers.” The association’s office-bearers, including joint secretary Rohit Sharma and vice president Ashwani Singh, have handed memorandums to the deputy commissioners of each district of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/allowance-cut-doctors-strike-in-ludhiana-leaves-patients-in-a-lurch-101624646636964.html
26-06-2021||Delhi||Village will not take my son’s wife, but I will support, says victim’s father||Twenty days after Vinay Dahiya and Kiran eloped and had a court marriage in Chandigarh last August, against their families’ wishes, a village panchayat was held and it was unanimously decided that the couple be disowned and banned from entering the village again.Their “crime” was that they belonged to the same “gotra (lineage)”and the villagers considered an alliance between those of the same gotra “incestuous”. On Thursday night, at least six men fired on the couple at their flat in Dwarka, killing Dahiya and critically injuring Kiran. Three of the assailants were Kiran’s close family, said police.Dahiya’s father Om Prakash, the village postman, said for eight months since August, nobody in his family had any contact with Dahiya. “It was only in April this year that my son contacted me through his friend and we began talking,” he said.Even though the 54-year-old never approved of his son’s marriage nor considered Kiran as his daughter-in-law, he could not stop himself from meeting her on Friday morning at Venkateshwar hospital in Delhi, where she was admitted with three gunshot wounds.“I knew Kiran since when she was a child but never accepted her as my daughter-in-law because her marriage to my son was against our community’s law. But when she called me today (Friday) morning and said “Papa hume bacha lijiye (Papa, please save us)”, I could not stop myself. I met her at the hospital, touched her head, and blessed her with a speedy recovery. After all, she is my dead son’s wife and she is still unaware about his death,” said Prakash, while waiting outside the Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital mortuary to collect his son’s body after autopsy.On being asked if he and his family would accept Kiran, Om Prakash and his brother Rajender said they will never be able to take her home to the village, as going against the panchayat’s decision “would make their lives hell”.“I will bear all her medical expenses and make sure she lives. Once she is fine, I will respect her decisions and support her in whatever way possible. But taking her back to our village is not an option,” said Prakash.Prakash said nobody knew about their relationship till May-June of 2020, when people first started talking about it.“When I got to know of the affair, I told Kiran’s family that my son was not listening to me and that they were free to take any step. However, nothing was done and on August 12, my son eloped with Kiran. They got married in Chandigarh the next day,” said Prakash.Dahiya’s family said Kiran’s family never created any problems for them even after that. But, after the attack on the couple, they now fear for their lives. “We will approach the local police in Sonepat and seek protection. Kiran’s family may try to harm us,” said Rajender.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dwarka-hate-crime-village-will-not-take-my-son-s-wife-back-but-i-will-support-her-says-victim-s-father-101624646216917.html
26-06-2021||Delhi||84 held after police bust fake international call centre||Eighty-four people, including 12 women, were arrested for allegedly running a fake call centre in east Delhi’s Jagatpuri and duping thousands of the US citizens by reportedly impersonating employees of a leading e-commerce company and offering assistance in solving issues regarding the company’s services, police said on Friday.Police said they seized 93 laptops, four computers and two SUVs, in addition to ₹64.30 lakh cash, from the accused.Police identified Mannu Singh Panwar, who is presently lodged in Haryana’s Bhiwani Jail for his alleged involvement in a murder case, as the brains behind the operation. According to police, Panwar was a liquor vend contractor who was previously arrested in September 2020 for running a similar fake call centre in Gurugram. DCP (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said 30 people were arrested in the Gurugram raid.DCP Sathiyasundaram said that the district’s cyber cell and Jagatpuri police station teams had received information regarding the fake international call centre operating from near Jagatpuri tiles market.“We raided the premises and found that the fraudsters were engaged in using illegal techniques through VoIP calling, and thus causing wrongful loss to the government exchequer and wrongful gain to themselves. They were cheating innocent customers on the pretext of solving their queries. They also threatened the customers by telling them that their social security cards/numbers were hacked,” added the DCP.Explaining the modus operandi, DCP Sathiyasundaram said that the fraudsters used to send a fictitious message to the mobile and e-mails of unsuspecting customer, mentioning the deposit of USD 1,000 to their accounts. When customers called to enquire about the deposit, the accused allegedly informed them that their social security number was hacked and asked them to purchase gift cards to restore it.“Once the victims purchased the gift cards, worth a minimum USD 99, the accused immediately redeemed it and diverted it to their account... We have initiated legal action against the owner of the premises for allowing such illegal activities and violating DDMA’s Covid guidelines. Accordingly, proceedings have also been initiated to seal the premises as per law,” said Sathiyasundaram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/84-held-after-police-bust-fake-international-call-centre-101624646215520.html
26-06-2021||Delhi||Over 166,000 get Covid-19 jabs in Delhi as drive hits another one-day high||The state government on Friday administered over 166,000 coronavirus vaccine doses on Friday, the highest in a single day for the third consecutive time, days after the launch of the new phase of inoculations across the country, said a senior government officer.As of 8.30pm on Friday, the state government administered 166,102 vaccine doses, up from 157,086 on Thursday and 109,358 the previous day, showed data from the central government’s CoWin dashboard.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislator Atishi, while presenting the government’s vaccine bulletin in a video press briefing on Friday, said, “Increasing vaccine centres and providing walk-in options have increased turnout at centres. The younger population — in the 18-45 age group — is eager to get vaccinated and they often bring along the elders in their family, which is contributing to reduced hesitancy and greater turnout.”The Capital currently has 1,374 centres, all of which offer vaccines to all adults in the city, after the state government removed age restrictions for these sites. Most of these sites also allow on-spot registrations.Atishi, the party’s MLA from Kalkaji, however, added that Covaxin doses are limited to those due for their second shot, owing to a shortage of supplies.“Currently, due to limited availability of vaccines, we are offering only a second dose of Covaxin. Under this policy, the government-run centres in the city have 13 days’ stock of Covaxin. The centres also have five days’ stock of Covishield,” she said.So far, 5.45 million people in the city have received at least one dose of the vaccine, of which around 1.66 million have received both doses. Delhi has an adult population of around 15 million, showed government records.VACCINES FOR HOMELESSThe Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (Dusib) on Friday launched a vaccination drive for homeless people in the city, a large number of whom do not have access to requisite documentation to get inoculated.On Friday, a temporary vaccination centre was set up near Nigambodh Ghat in north Delhi, where 150 homeless people were given a dose of Covishield. The area has a cluster of homeless shelters in close proximity. The vaccine site will remain over the weekend too, said a senior official in the Dusib.“Most homeless people do not have documents, so we had to make a special arrangement. Caretakers of the Dusib shelters have been notified as nodal officers and their documents are being used to vaccinate homeless people, after registering them in the concerned shelters. Each nodal officer can provide documents for multiple beneficiaries. The current rules of the Union government allow such special arrangements aimed at boosting vaccination,” said Dusib chairperson Vijay Kumar Bidhuri.The official also said that the government will on Saturday start another centre for the city’s homeless at Dandi Park opposite the Hanuman Mandir in Kashmere Gate.While around 5,200 homeless people live in the 200-odd Dusib sites, the city, according to a survey by the shelters body in 2018, has at least 16,000 homeless people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-166k-get-jabs-in-delhi-as-drive-hits-another-one-day-high-101624645976073.html
26-06-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram wildlife dept rescues 23 turtles; one held||The Gurugram wildlife department rescued 23 turtles and arrested a man for allegedly trying to smuggle the protected reptile in to the city, said officials on Friday.“We were earlier informed that a man was supplying turtles in Gurugram. This week, we got a tip that this man would be coming from Delhi, posing as a delivery executive. We arrested the suspect from MG Road on Wednesday and seized 23 turtles,” said Rajesh Chahal, Gurugram wildlife inspector.“We are trying to find out from where he procured the turtles. From the information we collected so far, it seems that the suspect had been involved in the illegal trade for the past two years,” Chahal added.  An environmental court in Faridabad sent the man to 14-day judicial custody on Thursday, and a case was registered under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act.Officials said they rescued 13 spotted black terrapin turtles and 10 Indian tent turtles from the suspect, and later released them in the Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary. Turtles are protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Species that fall under Schedule 1 are given protection from poaching, trading and trafficking. If convicted, the man can face a minimum of three years in jail and a fine of up to ₹1 lakh.They said that cases of illegal trade of turtles and tortoises in Gurugram is not common, and the last case was reported in January 2017. Three Indian star tortoises were seized from a private resort in Sohna.Experts say that illegal turtle trading is usually reported from the Gangetic plains where the reptile is found, but they can also be found near freshwater lakes in the National Capital Region and Haryana.Tito Joseph, programme manager, Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), said, “Turtle trafficking is a big issue, and such cases are mostly reported from states in the Gangetic plains, and occasionally from Delhi-NCR. People usually catch turtles from the freshwater lakes in this region and sell them in the local markets for consumption purposes.”Turtles are also illegally sold as pets, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gurugram-wildlife-dept-rescues-23-turtles-one-held-101624645916597.html
26-06-2021||Delhi||IIT-Delhi launches affordable Covid testing kit priced at ₹50||The Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT-D) on Friday launched an affordable rapid antigen test kit to detect Covid-19 priced at ₹50, which was developed entirely by its Centre for Biomedical Engineering (CBME) led by professor Harpal Singh. The kit was launched by minister of state for education Sanjay Dhotre, who said the premier institute’s efforts have helped the country in becoming more“self-sufficient” in its fight against the deadly virus. “I am confident that this technology will revolutionise Covid test availability in the country. I am glad to know that the kit has been developed entirely using the internal resources of IIT-Delhi,” he said.IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao said, “IIT-Delhi first disrupted the RT-PCR market with a ₹399 probe-free RT PCR kit, launched in July 2020. Over 8 million high-quality PPE kits were supplied so far, using the technology developed at IIT-Delhi. Now, the institute is launching a rapid diagnostic kit, costing ₹50, for Covid-19.” “Professor Harpal Singh and his team from the CBME have developed this technology and it has been patented by IIT-Delhi,” he said.The minister also complimented professor Singh and Dr Dinesh Kumar and thanked IIT-Delhi for “helping the nation become atmanirbhar in fighting the pandemic using indigenously developed technologies and made in India products”. Explaining the features of the kit, professor Singh said the kit will be used for in-vitro qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen. “SARS-CoV-2 Ag Rapid Test is a colloidal gold enhanced double antibody sandwich immunoassay for the qualitative determination of SARS-CoV-2 antigen in human nasal swabs, throat swabs, and deep sputum samples. It is suitable for the general population screening and diagnosis of Covid-19,” he said.“The identification is based on the monoclonal antibodies specific to the coronavirus antigen. The results obtained are qualitative-based and can be inferred visually with the naked eye. A SARS-CoV-2 positive specimen produces a distinct colour band in the test region… The absence of this coloured band in the test region suggests a negative result,” Singh said.He said the test was “found to be suitable for early Ct values (Ct values between 14 to 32) with a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 100% and accuracy of 98.99%, and has been certified by the ICMR ( Indian Council for Medical Research)”.The institute in a statement said, “IIT-Delhi has filed a patent application for the developed technology and has awarded the licence to two companies in the country for its commercial roll-out. M/s Dia Sure Immunodiagnostic LLP is now entering the market with this kit, fixing the cost at ₹50 per test.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/iitdelhi-launches-affordable-covid-testing-kit-priced-at-50-101624645915518.html
26-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt advises private schools to adopt happiness curriculum||The Delhi government’s Directorate of Education (DoE) has advised all private schools in the national capital to adopt the happiness curriculum to release the anxiety, stress and depression that children may be suffering owing to the situation wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic.In a circular issued to all private schools on Wednesday, the DoE said a writ petition was filed before the Delhi high court last year, seeking directions to the Union government to provide online “mindfulness classes” combining meditation, yoga and relaxation techniques for the benefit of all government and private schools students .The DoE circular said, “The honourable court disposed of the petition with a direction to the Union ministry of education to take a decision, treating this petition as a representation. In pursuance of the same, the ministry constituted a committee, which recommended that for students’ holistic well-being, mini-modules on breathing exercises, mindfulness, meditation, and simple yogasanas may be developed and shared with schools to intersperse with the other lessons during online classes.”The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi had introduced the happiness curriculum in government schools in July 2018. Under the curriculum, nursery and kindergarten students twice a week and students from classes 1 to 8 spend once daily in meditation, storytelling, and activity sessions, followed by question-and-answer sessions.Currently, all schools are shut in the national capital in view of the pandemic and classes are being held online or in semi-online mode.The education directorate said since mindfulness is an integral part of the happiness curriculum, which is already being taught in government schools, private schools should also adopt the curriculum.The directorate has also provided links to the curriculum handbooks, containing sections on mindfulness, and also extended help to train teachers if required.Private schools have welcomed the recommendation.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said, “While we already have a happiness club in our school since 2016, introducing the Delhi government’s happiness curriculum is a welcome step as it will be beneficial to the overall well-being of students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-advises-private-schools-to-adopt-happiness-curriculum-for-students-wellbeing-101624645916036.html
26-06-2021||Delhi||Man shot dead, wife injured after six men fire on them for marrying against family wishes||In a suspected hate crime, a 23-year-old man was killed and his 19-year-old wife seriously injured after at least six men, including the woman’s three family members, opened fire at them in south-west Delhi’s Amberhai village in Dwarka’s Sector 19 on Thursday night, police said. In all, at least 11 bullets were fired at the husband and wife from two pistols, they said. Police said the couple, Vinay Dahiya and Kiran from Gopalpur village in Haryana’s Sonepat, eloped in August last year and had a court wedding, despite their families strongly opposing the match as they belonged to the same village and the same gotra (lineage). Dahiya’s family members said a marriage between those of the same gotra is prohibited in the village as it is considered “incestuous”.A panchayat held in the village nearly 20 days after their wedding barred the couple from entering the village and their families were directed not to meet or contact the couple, Dahiya’s family said.Soon after their wedding, the couple approached the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking police protection as they feared for their lives. The court directed the Sonepat police to provide protection, but when HT checked, a senior Sonepat police officer, on condition of anonymity, said the couple never approached them for the protection.Sonepat SP Jashandeep Randhawa could not reached for comment.The couple moved to Delhi and were living in rented accommodations in Amberhai village, police said. Dahiya owned a taxi and was employed by a private airline company. Kiran was pregnant but had a miscarriage two-three days ago, said Dahiya’s father Om Prakash. “Around 8.30pm Thursday, the two were in their first-floor apartment when three to four men came knocking and as soon as Kiran opened the door, they fired at her. At least four bullets were fired, three of which hit Kiran while one hit her husband,” said a police officer, quoting Kiran’s statement. “The injured couple ran for their lives. While Kiran ran towards the terrace, Dahiya rushed outside, with his attackers giving chase. On reaching the terrace, Kiran looked down to see her husband being chased down the lane and she began screaming for help,” said the couple’s landlady Jyoti Mudgal.“I too saw Dahiya running out and three men chasing him. Three or four more men were waiting outside. All of them chased Dahiya and shot him dead outside a boutique shop nearby,” said Mudgal, adding that Kiran scaled the terrace’s iron railing and crossed over to the adjacent building to save herself.Kiran climbed down that building and kept screaming for help. The building’s caretaker, Basanti, saw Kiran bleeding and alerted residents of that building. One of them called the police.“I was shaken to see the woman soaked in blood. She was pleading with us to save her and her husband. A police team arrived soon after and took her to the hospital,” said Basanti. One of the five cameras in the lane caught the men running down the lane. Although the footage is grainy, at least two men can be seen firing guns, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said Dahiya was rushed to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital, where he was declared brought dead. He suffered four gunshot wounds to his chest and abdomen, while Kiran was shot three times in the neck and abdomen. “Kiran’s statement has been recorded. She said her brother Aman, cousin Vicky and uncle Shakti were involved in the attack,” said the DCP. “We have registered a case of murder, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy at the Dwarka Sector 23 police station and are looking for the attackers, who came in a Scopio SUV owned by Kiran’s uncle Shakti. Her father and another uncle are being questioned,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-shot-dead-wife-injured-after-six-men-fire-on-them-for-marrying-against-family-wishes-101624645857513.html

They were arrested in a joint operation by the Intelligence Bureau, Kargil police, and the Delhi police special cell and brought to Delhi. Police have not officially mentioned the nature of the attack the four men were allegedly part of or were planning.The four men, who are being interrogated at the special cell’s office in Lodhi Colony, were supposedly traced and identified by the Intelligence Bureau after which the Delhi and Ladakh police were asked to join the operation.A Delhi Police official, who is privy to the case details but did not wish to be named, said, “They were in Delhi when the (Israel embassy) blast happened. After the explosion, their phones were switched off for two days. We are checking the records of the cell phone and interrogating them... We are looking at this and other evidence related to their stay in Delhi.”According to police, the four men were staying at a rented house in north Delhi reportedly to prepare for the civil service examination. One of them was also reportedly preparing for a job in the banking sector. They had returned to their home in Thang village, Kargil, during the start of the lockdown during the fourth wave of the infection, police said.The last terror attack in Delhi was a low-intensity explosion outside the Israel embassy on the evening of January 29, 2020. While no one was injured in the attack, the windowpanes of a few vehicles parked on the road outside the embassy were broken. Police had registered a case under the explosives Act but did not arrest anyone.The case is being investigated by the National Investigation Agency which, on June 15, released photographs of two men, who had allegedly placed the crude bomb on the road outside the embassy in the New Delhi area. The investigating agency also announced a reward of ₹10 lakh for information about them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-yet-to-find-terror-link-of-4-kargil-students-101624645855557.html
26-06-2021||Delhi||DMRC writes to DDMA to allow standing passengers in Metro to control crowding||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has written to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) requesting that standing passengers be allowed on trains so that the capacity of trains may be increased in an effort to avoid crowding outside Metro stations.In their correspondence with the DDMA, DMRC said after the reopening of the Delhi Metro, post the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, passenger intake on trains was limited to 50% of seating capacity. This, the Metro said, allowed the train system to function only at 10-15% of its overall capacity, leading to crowding and long queues outside stations.HT has reported that on Monday evening, long queues were seen outside the Rajiv Chowk, Janpath, Barakhamba, Janakpuri West and other Metro stations and commuters had to wait nearly 30 minutes to gain entry. Delhi Metro, via its social media handles, also confirmed that since reopening, and with offices, markets and other economic operations resuming, the waiting time for a Metro train has gone up to 45-50 minutes on some lines.“When the services resumed in September 2020, after the long lockdown, services were running as per detailed SOP (standard operating procedure) prepared based on guidelines MoHUA (Union ministry of housing and urban affairs). As per the SOP, necessary markings and signage were placed inside stations and on coaches and passengers were allowed seating on alternate seats and standing with social distancing,” the letter read.It added, “In view of the above, in the larger public interest, it is required that Metro services may be allowed to run in accordance with the SOP approved by GoI (government of India) as of now, and relax further once the situation improves.”DMRC also stressed that while these relaxations will help Metro function more efficiently, they assured that all other safety measures to control the spread of Covid, such as thermal scanning, hand sanitisation, wearing face masks, sanitising carry bags and articles, maintaining social distancing on station premises, both on concourse and platforms, regular disinfection of escalators, lifts, trains and handrails shall continue.Senior DMRC officials said under the new Covid guidelines, as passengers are allowed to sit only on alternate seats, Metro is carrying about 25-30 passengers per coach, as against its pre-pandemic capacity of 300 per coach.On Thursday, a delegation of traders also met with DMRC chief Mangu Singh to highlight how long queues outside stations was leading to crowding and traffic jams in markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dmrc-writes-to-ddma-to-allow-standing-passengers-in-metro-to-control-crowding-101624645796221.html

Taj Mahal, in Uttar Pradesh’s Agra, has, however, fared better, recording around 20% of its daily footfall numbers before the pandemic.Delhi has over 70 monuments under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), including Red Fort, Humayun’s Tomb, Qutab Minar and Purana Qila, which had reopened in July last year following the nationwide lockdown announced in March 2020. This year, they were closed for visitors in April amid a devastating second wave of Covid-19 — fourth for Delhi — that overwhelmed the health care system. ASI officials said they expect footfalls to increase “in the coming weeks”.As per ASI data, since reopening, Humayun’s Tomb saw an average 631 visitors daily. The footfall at Humayun’s Tomb stayed over 400 on seven out of eight days, recording the highest footfall of 775 and 1,770 on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. June 23 saw the lowest footfall, with 365 visitors visiting the tomb, as per data available with the ASI. “In pre-pandemic days, the daily footfall at Humayun’s tomb used to touch 6,000-7,000. On weekends, the number would increase up to 8,000-9,000,” said an ASI official, who did not wish to be quoted.Qutab Minar saw an average 743 visitors daily from June 16 to June 23, seeing 991 and 1,677 daily visitors on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. In the pre-pandemic days, the average footfall at the minaret used to be around 8,000-9,000 while close to 11,000-12,000 people visited the victory tower on weekends.Cumulatively, between June 16 and June 23, Qutab Minar saw the highest number of visitors during the week, with the total visitor count touching 5,947, against Humayun’s Tomb nearly 5,050 visitors.The Red Fort, which re-opened after five months last week, saw fewer visitors -- averaging 152 daily visitors -- compared to other monuments in the city. With the monument closed on Monday, the footfall remained below 200 on six out of eight days. The UNESCO world heritage site saw the most visitors on Sunday when the footfall touched 285.Before the Covid pandemic, the 17th-century fort saw around 6,000-7,000 visitors on a daily basis.The Taj Mahal, which stayed open only for five days due to the weekend lockdown in Uttar Pradesh, saw an footfalls ranging from 2,000-4,000 since it reopened. Before the pandemic, the monument saw around 16,000-17,000 daily visitors, which rose to 20,000-24,000 on weekends and holidays, said officials.“While the footfall was relatively low for the first week, we expect an improvement in the coming weeks. If the Covid situation stays under control, the numbers will go up in a month or two. This was the same scenario when monuments reopened last year after the nationwide lockdown,” said an ASI official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/footfall-at-monuments-remains-low-in-first-week-of-reopening-101624645795524.html

The customer, Rajesh Kumar Rathore, 35, was seriously injured and admitted to the district hospital while the guard was taken into custody, said police.Rathore, who is employed as a helper in Northern Railway, visited the bank in the Civil Lines area and entered without wearing face mask. The guard, Keshav Kumar, 45, a resident of Subhash Nagar area, objected to this, saying “entry without mask is not allowed.”A heated argument ensued, after which Rathore left the premises. However, after sometime, he returned to the bank, and this time also tried to enter without wearing a face mask. The duo again entered into heated arguments. And in a fit of rage, the guard shot at Rathore with his licensed double-barrel gun, leaving him badly injured, said cops.Rohit Singh Sajwan, SSP, Bareilly said: “We have arrested the guard and Rathore has been hospitalised. We are investigating the matter. It was found that the guard objected to Rathore’s entry into the bank as he was not wearing a mask. This led to the argument between them, after which the guard shot Rathore in his leg.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/guard-fires-at-customer-trying-to-enter-bank-without-mask-101624645015448.html

The train made two stopovers at Jhinjhak and Roora railway stations of Kanpur Dehat before reaching Kanpur Central around 8 pm. Here, the President and his wife Savita Kovind were greeted by UP governor Anandiben Patel, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and state industry minister and Kanpur MLA Satish Mahana. On June 28, the President will board a train at Kanpur Central railway station to reach Lucknow for his two-day visit there. On June 29, he will return to New Delhi on a special flight.As the special Maharaja Express chugged into the small Jhijhank railway station in Kanpur Dehat, the President went down the memory lane. He was humble and cordial with his friends and relatives who were waiting for him at the railway station, where a special pandal was set up. In his brief address at Jhinjhak and Roora railway stations where he met 164 people, the President expressed concern over the moral decline in the society and said it had impacted all areas and progress in life. He said the cover of modernity was an obstacle to the progress of people. “The relationships between son and father, brother and brother and wife and husband were no longer what they used to be earlier,” said Kovind. The President said he learnt a lot from Kanpur. “I am here to seek your blessings; I am from Paraunkh and have lived in Jhijhank. I still know each of the lanes,” he said while addressing the people. Kovind said there was no distance between him and the citizens. “The land of Uttar Pradesh is significant and sacred. Anyone from this land could become the First Citizen,” he said. The President emphasized that people needed to be aware about their rights and responsibilities and should not depend on MPs and MLAs who were there for them for only five years. At Roora railway station, the President said he had a close relationship with this town. “I wanted to come here since long and people kept calling me. But an hour of my visit costs ₹25 lakh and that is why I did not come,” he said. Referring to people calling him an intellectual, Kovind said: “I consider everyone of my district as an intellectual. When I visit central universities as a visitor, I am called an intellectual and then I feel everyone from Kanpur Dehat is an intellectual.” He urged the masses for maximum vaccination against the coronavirus and asked the district magistrate to hold more camps. The President also asked the divisional railway manager to gradually resume train services so that people did not face inconvenience. Officials of the Indian Railways said it was a matter of pride that President was travelling by train. Special arrangements had been made inside the coach so that he could handle his official work. A part of a coach was converted into an office for the President, they said. “Wi-Fi and other facilities are available in the train for the President. There is an office room and a communication protocol which has to be followed,” said an official. The last time a president travelled by train was in 2006 when APJ Abdul Kalam boarded a special train from Delhi to Dehradun to attend the passing-out parade of the Indian Military Academy (IMA) cadets.

26-06-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal BJP working group meeting begins in Dharamshala||The two-day Himachal Pradesh BJP working group meeting began in Dharamshala on Friday to discuss the party’s strategy for the byelections in a Lok Sabha and two assembly constituencies and 2022 general elections to the state assembly. The byelection to the Mandi Lok Sabha and Fatehpur and Jubbal Kotkhai assembly seats are expected to be announced soon. The byelection in Mandi was necessitated after MP Ram Swaroop Sharma was found dead at his Delhi residence on March 17. The Fatehpur and Jubbal Kotkhai assembly seats fell vacant after Congress legislator and former minister Sujan Singh Pathania and BJP MLA Narinder Bragta died on February 12 and June 5, respectively. The elections have to be held within six months of the seats falling vacant. Senior leaders, including national general secretary BL Santosh, Himachal BJP in-charge Avinash Rai Khanna, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, former chief ministers Shanta Kumar and Prem Kumar Dhumal, minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Thakur and state party president Suresh Kashyap are attending the meet. The party has chosen Dharamshala as the venue of the meeting due to the political significance Kangra holds in Himachal Pradesh politics. The largest district population-wise sends 15 members to the state assembly and plays a crucial role in deciding which party will form the government in the state. Addressing a press conference here, state BJP’s chief spokesperson Randhir Sharma said objective of the meeting was to prepare a roadmap for party’s functioning in next one and a half years. “Besides the discussion on byelections, the party would prepare an elaborate plan to accomplish the mission repeat in 2022 assembly elections based on the suggestions received during the party’s three-day meet held at Shimla earlier this month,” said Sharma. He said the meeting also reviewed the work done by the party and the government in last three and half years, especially during Covid-19. “The Himachal BJP as well as the state government were hailed by the central leadership for the exceptional services provided to people of the state during Covid under Seva Hi Sangathan programme,” he said. Replying to a query on the probable candidates in the byelections, Sharma said the decision would be taken in the election committee meeting. He expressed confidence that BJP will win the byelections and also the 2022 assembly polls. “The Congress is no challenge for BJP in 2022 polls as the party is a divided house,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-bjp-core-committee-meeting-begins-in-dharamshala-101624606074220.html
26-06-2021||World||UK records 18,270 new Covid-19 cases, highest single-day spike since February 5||The UK on Saturday recorded its most new coronavirus infections since early February as the National Health Service ran a “grab a jab” initiative to further drive up vaccination rates.Government figures showed that another 18,270 people tested positive for the virus across the UK, the highest daily number since February 5.Over the past week, nearly 100,000 have tested positive, a near 50 per cent increase compared to the week before. That has raised questions over whether lockdown restrictions will end as planned.Daily cases have risen fairly sharply over the past few weeks after fluctuating around the 2,000 mark earlier. The delta variant, which was first identified in India and is considered by government scientists to be between 40per cent to 80per cent more transmissible than the previous dominant strain, accounts for nearly all the new cases in the UK.Also Read| UK minister Matt Hancock, who broke Covid-19 rules by kissing aide, resignsMost of the new confirmed cases are among younger age groups which haven't yet received Covid-19 vaccines.The latest spike came as hundreds of walk-in vaccination sites, including at stadiums and shopping centers, opened in England over the weekend in a bid to boost vaccine numbers, particularly among those younger age groups."This is a phenomenal achievement and it's fantastic to see so many young people coming forward for their jabs, doing their bit to protect themselves and their loved ones," Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said.The spread of the variant upended the Conservative government's plans to lift all remaining restrictions on social contact in England this week.The plan is to lift those restrictions on July 19, but whether it will do so could largely depend on whether the vaccine rollout has created a firewall that protects the most vulnerable.The other parts of the UK — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — are following similar plans.The hope is that the link between infections and those needing hospitalization and subsequently dying has broken because of the rapid rollout of vaccines. As of Saturday, nearly two-thirds of the UK population have received at least one vaccine dose while 48per cent have had two.Also Read| B'desh to Australia: List of countries imposing fresh curbs due to Delta variantRecent analysis from Public Health England showed that two doses of the main vaccines the UK is using are highly effective against hospitalization from the delta variant — 96per cent in the case of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 92per cent for the AstraZeneca jab.Though the number of people in hospitals and dying have been edging up over the past couple of weeks, they haven't risen at the same rate as infections.On Saturday, the government said another 227 people have been hospitalized, taking the total to 1,505, nowhere near the 40,000 levels recorded earlier in the year during the peak of a second surge. Virus-related deaths also remained relatively low at 23, taking the death total to 128,089.Worries about the vaccines were heard as thousands of anti-lockdown protesters marched through central London on Saturday. Some even threw tennis balls into Downing Street, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has his office and residence. “Shame on you,” some chanted.Johnson meanwhile was facing widespread calls to fire Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who has apologized for breaching social distancing rules after a newspaper ran pictures of him embracing aide Gina Coladangelo.She's a friend of Hancock's from their days together at Oxford University and was appointed to his department last year.The Sun tabloid also late Friday published a video of the embrace, which has prompted the main opposition Labour Party to deem his position “hopelessly untenable." Some Conservative lawmakers have also called on Hancock to quit because he wasn't practicing what he has been preaching during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-records-18-270-new-covid-19-cases-highest-single-day-spike-since-february-5-101624730183572.html
26-06-2021||World||Johnson & Johnson agrees to pay $230 million to New York to settle opioid claim||Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay USD 230 million to New York state to settle claims that the pharmaceutical giant helped fuel the opioid crisis, Attorney General Letitia James said on Saturday.The drugmaker also agreed to permanently end the manufacturing and distribution of opioids across New York and the rest of the nation, James said in a statement announcing the settlement.The company “helped fuel this fire, but today they're committing to leaving the opioid business — not only in New York, but across the entire country,” she said.The deal involving a lawsuit brought by James in 2019 removes Johnson & Johnson from a trial that is slated to begin next week on Long Island — part of a slew of litigation over an epidemic linked to nearly 500,000 deaths over the last two decades.In its own statement on Saturday, Johnson & Johnson downplayed the attorney general's announcement. It said the settlement involved two prescription painkillers — developed by a subsidiary and accounting for less than 1% of the market — that are already no longer sold in the US.The settlement was “not an admission of liability or wrongdoing by the company," Johnson & Johnson said. It added that its actions “relating to the marketing and promotion of important prescription pain medications were appropriate and responsible.”The settlement was the latest development in the complicated universe of opioid-related lawsuits across the US that has drawn comparisons to the multistate litigation against tobacco companies in the 1990s. It reflects a path being taken by some big drug companies that see settling as in their best interests, in part because that route would likely not cost as much as losing in court repeatedly.Johnson & Johnson — along with distributors AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson — made public last year that they were offering a total of $26 billion over 18 years to settle all the cases they face, with the money going to abate the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-johnson-agrees-to-pay-230-million-to-new-york-to-settle-opioid-claim-101624729364098.html

The image was taken with a Hubble Space Telescope operated by Nasa and European Space Agency (ESA). The image shows two galaxies that are in the final stages of merging.The astronomers expect a powerful inflow of gas to ignite a frenzied burst of star formation in the resulting compact starburst galaxy, according to ESA. In 2008, The same interacting pair of galaxies, IC 1623, was captured by Hubble using two filters at optical and infrared wavelengths on the Advanced Camera for Surveys.The latest image of the interacting galaxy pair incorporates data from Wide Field Camera 3, Hubble's most technologically advanced instrument to take images in the visible spectrum, and combines observations taken in eight filters spanning infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths to reveal the finer details of IC 1623.Also Read | Mystery of ‘see-through’ galaxy deepens after new Hubble observation: NasaESA said that future observations of the galaxy pair using the James Webb Space Telescope, the world’s largest and most powerful space telescope targeted for the October 31 launch, will shed more light on the processes powering extreme star formation in environments such as IC 1623.Webb is Nasa’s next space science observatory, which will help in solving the mysteries of the solar system and probing the mystifying structures and origins of our universe. It is an international program led by Nasa, along with its partners ESA and the Canadian Space Agency.A team of scientists will train Webb on six of the most distant and luminous quasars, the active supermassive black holes that are millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun.

26-06-2021||World||World's 1st post-pandemic cruise to set sail with 99% passengers vaccinated||In a style reminiscent of Snowpiercer, the world is set to witness the first cruise ship start its engine after 15 months of pandemic-induced standstill from a US port. What will be the most unique part of this cruise is that nearly all - 99% - passengers aboard the ship will be vaccinated against the infectious coronavirus disease.Named Celebrity Edge, the cruise will depart from Florida's Fort Lauderdale at 6 pm on Saturday. The number of passengers on the ship has been limited to about 40% of the capacity. The cruise is meeting the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines which require at least 95% of the people to be vaccinated.On the Celebrity Edge, 99% of the passengers are vaccinated, according to Celebrity Cruises, a royal Caribbean cruise brand.In the set of restrictions for passengers on the Celebrity Edge, the authorities are asking for proof of vaccination, as prescribed by the CDC. A new Florida law also bans businesses from requiring customers to show proof of vaccination.Those who wish to join the cruise will be asked to share their vaccination status and those who do not show proof of being vaccinated against the disease will face additional restrictions.The cruise lines are returning to business signalling cheer for the sector which will see Carnival vessels slated to depart from other ports next month.Marking another first, the ship will be led by Captain Kate McCue - the first American woman to captain the cruise ship. The $1 billion boat offers a giant spa and multi floor suites.“Words can't describe how excited we are to be a part of this historic sailing today,” Elizabeth Rosner told AP. The 28-year-old moved from Michigan to Orlando, Florida, in December 2019 with her fiance just to be close to the cruise industry's hub.Scarred by the memories of ships and cruises forced to be stranded after finding Covid-19 cases and isolated without much assistance from the outside world, the industry officials are keeping their fingers crossed. They are hoping to move past the episodes from last year which saw many ships getting rejected at ports and passengers getting isolated when the world was still coming to terms with the disease outbreak.While some passengers died of Covid-19 at sea, others fell so ill they had to be carried out of the vessels on stretchers.Witnessing the crisis unfold, the CDC put no-sail orders repeatedly last year as the pandemic raged, and came up with strict requirements for the industry that have already been contested in court by the state of Florida.On Saturday, officials at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale said only that the port lost more than $30 million in revenue in fiscal year 2020 from the cruise shutdown.During that hiatus, Carnival, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean, the three largest cruise companies, have had to raise more than $40 billion in financing just to stay afloat. Collectively they lost $20 billion last year and another $4.5 billion in the first quarter of 2021, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.Couples are getting a second shot at designing special memories with vaccines playing the role of artillery. The pandemic forced Kurt and Carol Budde to cancel their beach celebration wedding aboard the world's largest ship, Symphony of the Seas, in March 2020. Covid-19 halted cruising six days before they were scheduled to tie the knot in St. Maarten. Kurt Budde's part-time gig as a travel agent also dried up.“It's a honeymoon make-up cruise,” said Kurt Budde, sporting matching shirts with the phrase “On Cruise Control."“We are living our best lives post Covid-19 today," he said.With inputs from AP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-1st-post-pandemic-cruise-to-set-sail-with-99-passengers-vaccinated-101624722305076.html
26-06-2021||World||Coronavirus outbreak struck East Asia over 20,000 years ago: Study||New research by the authors of the Australian National University has revealed that a coronavirus outbreak may have swept across East Asia more than 20,000 years ago. The authors in an article on The Wire said that the coronavirus left traces in the DNA of people in modern China, Japan and Vietnam.The research by Yassine Souilmi and Ray Tobler was published in Current Biology and found evidence of genetic adaptation to the coronavirus family of viruses in 42 genes in modern populations in the regions.Also read| Membrane proteins of bacteria and humans show surprising similarities: Research"Multiple lines of functional evidence support an ancient viral selective pressure, and East Asia is the geographical origin of several modern coronavirus epidemics. An arms race with an ancient coronavirus, or with a different virus that happened to use similar interactions as coronaviruses with human hosts, may thus have taken place in ancestral East Asian populations," the study said.It also said that by learning about the ancient viral foes, the research highlights the promise of evolutionary information to better predict the pandemics of the future.The authors in their article said that the coronavirus family also includes the related MERS and SARS viruses, both of which have caused significant deadly outbreaks in the past 20 years. The Covid-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far taken more than 3.8 million deaths and is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide, they added."We have had pandemics before. In the 20th century alone, three variants of the influenza virus each resulted in wide-ranging outbreaks that killed millions: the “Spanish Flu” of 1918-20, the “Asian Flu” of 1957-58, and the “Hong Kong Flu” of 1968-69," their article in The Wire read.According to the authors, the historical records of an outbreak due to the virus and other pathogens goes back thousands of years and that the adaptations of our ancestors from Africa to across the world and their introduction to new pathogens and other challenges may have improved their resistance to infection and helped them survive.Souilmi and Tobler said they applied cutting-edge computational analyses to the genomes of more than 2,500 people from 26 populations around the world and found signatures of adaptions in 42 different human genes that encode virus-interacting proteins (VIP)s.Also read: Study suggests correlation between high levels of pollution and Covid-19 deaths"These VIP signals were present in only five populations, all of them from East Asia – the likely ancestral homeland of the coronavirus family. This suggests the ancestors of modern East Asians were initially exposed to coronaviruses around 25,000 years ago," Souilmi and Tobler said.They said more testing revealed that the 42 VIPs are primarily expressed in the lungs, which is the tissue most affected by Covid symptoms. They claimed to have confirmed that these VIPs interact directly with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused the present pandemic.Further, they said that several VIP genes are either currently being used as drug targets for Covid treatments or are part of clinical trials as they said that independent studies have shown mutations in VIP genes may help mediate SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and the severity of Covid-19 symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-struck-east-asia-over-20-000-years-ago-study-101624723101286.html

While the majority of Republicans sided with Trump during his historic second impeachment, seven GOP senators and three House Republicans decided to vote against the party line, earning the wrath of the former president.Trump has decided to campaign against the Republicans who voted to impeach him on a charge of inciting January 6 riots that left five dead including a Capitol Police officer. One of them is House Representative Anthony Gonzalez, seeking re-election in 2022 and former White House aide Max Miller has emerged as his challenger for the primaries after Trump endorsed him.“We’re giving tremendous endorsements,” Trump told the conservative Newsmax channel on Friday. “Fake Republicans, anybody that voted for the impeachment doesn’t get it. But there weren’t too many of them. And I think most of them are being … primaried right now, so that’s good. I’ll be helping their opponent.”Also Read | Trump says India devastated by Covid-19, China must pay for its spreadIn his first public rally since the deadly attack on the Capitol, Trump aims to bolster allies, berate his enemies and cement his influence over the Republican Party.

The current resurgence could be worse than the second wave, the minister said.South Africa on Friday recorded another 18,000 infections with 215 deaths.While South Africa's second coronavirus surge was due to Beta variant, experts have said that the variant first found in India is a likely factor in the third wave. The continent's worst-affected nation in terms of coronavirus cases and deaths, accounts for roughly a third of confirmed infections and more than 40% of the deaths recorded across Africa.The South African government is expecting that the peak of the third wave would surpass that of the second wave in January, when more than 21,000 new daily cases were recorded.The Delta variant has been listed as 'variant of concern' by the World Health Organization (WHO).The Delta variant that’s been running rampant in South Africa is 30% to 60% more transmissible than other strains, including the Beta variant, first identified in the African nation last year, Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, said at the same briefing.At present, the Delta variant has been traced in other countries like France, Germany, Norway and Hawaii which are witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases.The highly transmissible variant which the experts have termed to be more infectious than other variants is responsible for at least 9-10% of the total new confirmed cases in France, officials said. This is in sharp contrast to 2-4% of the cases seen last week in France."A new variant seems to be not only arising, but it seems to start dominating the infections in South Africa," Professor Tulio de Oliveira at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, told a news conference."It completely took over," he said, adding that the Delta variant was more transmissible even than the Beta variant.De Oliveira said there appeared to be community transmission of the Delta variant in KwaZulu-Natal province and that scientists were analysing the data for Gauteng, the province where the biggest city Johannesburg is located.President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the country on Sunday evening on his planned response to curb the spread of the virus after a special cabinet meeting, the government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-india-delta-variant-driving-south-africa-s-covid-19-surge-scientists-101624715505430.html

Nasa engineer Vandi Verma explains||Nasa’s Perseverance rover captured the historic selfie beside the Ingenuity Mars helicopter on the Red Planet on April 6, which proved to be one of the most complex rover selfies ever taken. While selfies primarily allow engineers to check wear and tear on the rover, they can also inspire a new generation of space enthusiasts. Vandi Verma, Perseverance’s chief engineer for robotic operations at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California, bears testimony of this.Verma said that a picture from Sojourner, Nasa’s first Mars rover, sparked her interest in the US space agency. Verma worked as a driver for Nasa’s Opportunity and Curiosity rovers and helped to create Curiosity’s first selfie, which was taken on October 31, 2012. “When we took that first selfie, we didn’t realize these would become so iconic and routine,” she said.Also Read | Astronomers find out when first stars shone, could be seen by Nasa’s Webb telescopeSo how does a rover take a selfie?In a video posted by Nasa’s JPL, Verma said that the way the rover takes a selfie is a “little more complex” than taking a selfie from our smartphones. The rover uses the WATSON (Wide Angle Topographic Sensor for Operations and eNgineering) camera attached at the end of the robotic arm. But the WATSON camera was designed to take close-up images of rocks for scientific analysis and not wide-angle images.Since even the full extension of the arm can’t cover the entire rover in a single image, engineers had to command the rover to take dozens of individual images and then stitch them together to produce the selfie. To do that, the engineers try to hold the WATSON camera sensor in the same position to take different images.“The reason you don't see the robotic arm in the selfie is because it's moving between the different image frames that we are taking, and we include enough overlap between the images so that when we stitch them together, we don't have to include the arm,” said Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-perseverance-rover-took-historic-selfie-with-ingenuity-nasa-engineer-vandi-verma-explains-101624715860337.html
26-06-2021||World||Bangladesh to Australia: List of countries imposing fresh curbs due to Delta variant||The rapid spread of a more virulent version of coronavirus, B.1.617.2, also known as the Delta variant, has forced several countries to rethink their roadmap out of lockdown and many of them have started imposing fresh restrictions fearing another wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday revealed that the variant, first identified in India, is spreading in at least 85 countries, terming it the “most transmissible of the variants identified so far.” Britain has already extended the full reopening of businesses by four weeks after the country started reporting a surge in Covid-19 cases, with the Delta variant becoming the dominant strain.London mayor Sadiq Khan warned that the reopening scheduled for July 19 could be at risk unless enough people get vaccinated. “Unless sufficient numbers of Londoners have the jab it makes it more likely that we won’t be able to fully reopen on 19 July,” said Khan after attending a vaccine summit in London.Also Read | As Delta variant cases rise, WHO asks fully vaccinated to keep masks onHere’s the list of countries and territories that have announced fresh curbs:Taiwan: The self-governed island reported its first domestically transmitted case of Delta variant on Saturday. Six people in Pingtung county had been confirmed to have the Delta variant, of which one has been classified as a domestic infection, according to Taiwan health minister Chen Shih-Chung. The government will tighten border controls to keep out the Delta variant, requiring arrivals from five countries to be placed in centralised quarantine facilities.Australia: Australia’s New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced a two-week lockdown across all of Greater Sydney, including the Blue Mountains, Central Coast and Wollongong. The stay-at-home order will remain in effect until July 9. According to health authorities, expansion of curbs was needed after more infections were recorded, with exposure sites increasing beyond the initial areas of concern.Bangladesh: India’s neighbouring country announced a tougher lockdown starting Monday due to a “dangerous and alarming” surge in Delta variant cases. As per the fresh guidelines, all offices, government and private, will be shut for a week. The government said in a statement that no one can step out of their homes except in emergency cases.“It is a dangerous and alarming situation. If we don’t contain it now, we will face an India-like situation,” health department spokesperson Robed Amin told news agency AFP, referring to the catastrophic second wave of Covid-19 in India.Also Read | Can Indians travel to Germany, South Korea, US? Check latest visa, vaccine rulesIsrael: The country with around 60% of fully vaccinated individuals reimposed an indoor-mask requirement and other measures amid a sustained surge in Covid-19 cases attributed to Delta variant. Nachman Ash, the head of Israel’s pandemic response task force, said that the measures were reimposed after Israel reported more than 100 daily Covid cases for four consecutive days. “We are seeing a doubling every few days,” Ash told public radio.Portugal: The European nation has announced new restrictions in the Lisbon area and two other regions amid a spike in Covid-19 cases. More than 70% of coronavirus cases in the Lisbon area are from the Delta variant, which is said to be rapidly spreading to other parts of the country. Portugal is witnessing a surge in infections after the tourism-dependent nation opened to visitors from the European Union and Britain in mid-May. On Friday, the country reported 1,604 new cases, the biggest daily rise since February 19, when the country was still under lockdown.Indonesia: Indonesia on Thursday confirmed a daily high of 20,574 new Covid-19 cases, a jump of more than 5,000 from the previous day. The rise in cases prompted the government to announce the tightening of neighbourhood-level social restrictions in high-risk "red zones" for two weeks, starting last Tuesday. Offices, restaurants, cafes and malls have been allowed to operate at 25% capacity. Earlier this month, Indonesian officials revealed that more than 350 doctors and medical workers have been infected and dozens hospitalised despite being vaccinated with Sinovac, raising concerns about the vaccine against more infectious variants like Delta and Alpha.Russia: Moscow authorities have ordered bars and restaurants from Monday to serve people only if they can present a QR-code showing they have been vaccinated, had an infection indicating immunity or recently tested negative. Russia is facing a surge in coronavirus cases that authorities blame on the Delta variant and slow progress in vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-to-australia-list-of-countries-imposing-fresh-curbs-due-to-delta-variant-101624710650640.html

I have had love and respect from India [more] than any one because cricket is a big sport. It’s almost religion in both the countries,” the legendary former cricketer said.He expressed disappointment on being unable to normalise trade ties with India despite reaching out after assuming office, adding that a “civilised trading relationship” would be beneficial for both countries.“So when I assumed office, the first thing I did was I made this approach to Prime Minister Modi and said that, 'Look, my main objective for coming to power is to alleviate poverty in Pakistan.' And the best way would be if India and Pakistan had a normal, civilised trading relationship. It would benefit both the countries,” Khan said.“I think that it is a peculiar ideology of the RSS, which Narendra Modi belongs to, which just came up against a brick wall. And, therefore, the answer to your question is yes. Had there been another Indian leadership, I think we would have had a good relationship with them. And yes, we would have resolved all our differences through dialogue,” he added.Also Read: Pakistan fails to get out of FATF’s grey listKhan also spoke at length about the kind of foreign relation he envisions Pakistan having with the US after the process of withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan concludes, stating it is similar to the kind of relation the US shares with UK and India US. Which would be more “even handed” than the one both countries shared during the “war on terror”. During which the “US felt that they were giving aid to Pakistan, they felt that Pakistan then had to do US’s bidding,”"Now, after the US leaves Afghanistan, basically Pakistan would want a civilised relationship, which you have between nations, and we would like to improve our trading relationship with the US,” he said.Khan expressed uncertainty about the kind of military relationship that the two countries would share post US withdrawal from Afghanistan."Post the US withdrawal, I don’t know what sort of military relationship it will be. But right now, the relationship should be based on this common objective that there is a political solution in Afghanistan before the United States leaves," he said.On being asked if Pakistan will recognise a Taliban led government in Afghanistan Khan stated, “Pakistan will only recognize a government which is chosen by the people of Afghanistan, whichever government they choose."While pledging his full support to the President Ashraf Ghani-led government in Afghanistan, he asserted that Pakistan will not be taking “military action” against Taliban, and in case they try to take over Afghanistan then Pakistan “will seal the border, because now we can, because we have fenced our border (Durand line), which was previously [open], because Pakistan does not want to get into, number one, conflict. Secondly, we do not want another influx of refugees."Khan said that the signing of the deal in Doha on February 29, 2020 between US and Afghanistan which would allow US troops to return home diminished Pakistan’s leverage over the Taliban because “the moment the United States gave a date of exit, Taliban basically claimed victory. They’re thinking that they won the war. And so therefore, our ability to influence them diminishes the stronger they feel."Khan also commented on Kashmir during his interview stating "I think it’s a disaster for India because it will just mean that this conflict festers on and on … and (prevents) any relationship — normal relationship — between Pakistan and India."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/know-india-better-than-all-other-pakistanis-imran-khan-shares-his-vision-for-future-foreign-relations-101624706438515.html

Here’s what reports suggest||While Miami officials remain focussed on the search for dozens of people believed to be under the rubble of the residential building in South Florida, the speculations around the cause of the disaster have intensified. Referring to inputs from investigators, Miami-Dade fire rescue district chief Jason Richard told CNN that 12-storey Champlain Towers South, near southern Florida’s Atlantic coast, appears to have fallen in a “pancake collapse.”According to experts, the building experienced a “progressive collapse” which occurs due to the failure of the primary structural element and subsequently causes failure of adjoining members. In such cases, if one floor can’t support the floors above it, they collapse and “pancake” the floors below. However, evidence of other types of collapses is reportedly also present.Some reports suggest that the building was constructed on reclaimed wetlands and the unstable land could have caused damage to the foundations over time.Kenneth Direktor, an attorney for the building's condominium association, told CNN that “nothing like this was foreseeable”, but, according to a New York Times report, a consultant had sounded alarm over evidence of “major structural damage” to the concrete slab below the pool deck, almost three years before the deadly collapse.Photos: Families await news of survivors from Florida beachfront condo collapseThe engineer reportedly also highlighted “abundant” cracking and crumbling of the columns, beams and walls of the parking garage under the 12-storey building. “Though some of this damage is minor, most of the concrete deterioration needs to be repaired in a timely fashion,” Frank Morabito, the consultant engineer, wrote in his October 2018 report, as per NYT.Direktor said that extensive plans were drawn up for repair work which was just about to get started. But not before the deadly collapse that trapped sleeping residents in a massive heap of debris.Responding to the speculations over the cause of the collapse, Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said, “There’s no reason for this building to go down like that unless someone literally pulls out the supports from underneath or they get washed out or there’s a sinkhole or something like that, because it just went down.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-did-florida-beachfront-condo-collapse-here-s-what-reports-suggest-101624703747419.html
26-06-2021||World||Enid Blyton: Why seeing sexism, racism in her work should not make us unsee her||Enid Blyton, the beloved children's author who touched millions of lives with her writing, was never a stranger to controversy. Her work, though received with unprecedented love, was called out for its problematic aspects by critics.Blyton wrote over 700 books and 4,500 short stories in her lifetime. Her works were translated into 90 languages and sold over 600 million copies, moulding the childhoods of many children across the world, and in the process, shaping their fragile minds. Stories of Noddy and Sambo were engraved on the hearts of those who grew up reading them and the mark that they left gave a direction to the children's thoughts.Why now?Charity English Heritage, an organisation that installs blue plaques at sites that were once the working or living quarters of Britain’s canonical literary figures, recently updated the information associated with Blyton’s plaque.“Blyton’s work has been criticised during her lifetime and after for its racism, xenophobia and lack of literary merit. A 1966 Guardian article noted the racism of The Little Black Doll (1966), in which the doll of the title, Sambo, is only accepted by his owner once his ‘ugly black face’ is washed ‘clean’ by rain. In 1960 the publisher Macmillan refused to publish her story The Mystery That Never Was for what it called its ‘faint but unattractive touch of old-fashioned xenophobia’…” the update read.However, the organisation has confirmed it has ‘no plans whatsoever’ to remove the blue plaque.Instances of racism, xenophobia and sexism in her workOne of Blyton's most famous works, the Famous Five series, has been criticised for dividing the world into the domains of the feminine and masculine. In the 21-novel-series, characters have very defined gender roles. While George's mother Fanny remains the epitome of maternal love and is idealised in her kind and easy-going demeanor, George's father Quentin is a world-famous scientist, who is shown to lack tolerance for the children on school holidays. Such a dichotomy between the feminine and masculine is represented throughout the series.Meanwhile, in almost all her books, gypsies and foreigners are often cast as dishonest, leaving bare the tinge of xenophobia in her writing. For example, in her very famous and well-received series Noddy, the antagonists are almost always golliwogs — doll-like racial caricatures. The fictional character was created by cartoonist and author Florence Kate Upton and first appeared in children's books in the late 19th century. Upton's The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwog describes the doll as “a horrid sight, the blackest gnome”.Acknowledgement of shortcomings vs rejectionEven as Blyton's body of work was submitted to scrutiny over the decades, she remains a favourite with children; the reason being her ability to capture their world, and through it, their hearts.While it is important to acknowledge the shortcomings of her works, it is equally significant to put her writing in context. Take the Golliwog character for example. The Golliwog gained popularity in the 20th century as a children’s toy, but the later decades started associating it with racism. It began to be recognised as a crude depiction of people with African roots. The character is considered offensive today, but we cannot ignore its existence in context of the time in which it originated.Same goes for Blyton's work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/enid-blyton-why-seeing-sexism-racism-in-her-work-should-not-make-us-unsee-her-101624701380321.html

People need to continue to use masks consistently, be in ventilated spaces, hand hygiene ... the physical distance, avoid crowding,” Simao said during a news briefing from the agency’s Geneva headquarters, according to CNBC. "This still continues to be extremely important, even if you’re vaccinated when you have a community transmission ongoing," she added.Also read | Delta Plus cases now in 12 states, Maharashtra has maximum: GovtAccording to CNBC, WHO officials said they are urging fully vaccinated people to continue to “play it safe” because highly contagious variants, like Delta, are spreading in many countries, triggering outbreaks and a large portion of the world are yet to be given the shots against the coronavirus disease or Covid-19.“Yes, you can reduce some measures and different countries have different recommendations in that regard. But there’s still the need for caution. As we are seeing, there are new variants emerging,” Dr Bruce Aylward, a senior advisor to the WHO’s director-general, was quoted as saying by CNBC.Also read | Delta Plus variant: Health ministry writes to 8 states, alerts 10 districtsWHO's director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that the Delta variant, first seen in India, is “the most transmissible of the variants identified so far,” and warned it is now spreading in at least 85 countries. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the lack of vaccines in poor countries was exacerbating the delta variant's transmission.In India, Delta Plus, the more virulent version of the virus, has been reported from 12 states and there have been 51 cases and the maximum from Maharashtra. The government, however, has said their numbers are "very localised" and it cannot be said that it is showing an upward trend. Officials have said that the Delta variant has nearly 15-17 mutations and was first reported in October last year, and it was responsible for more than 60 per cent of cases in Maharashtra in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-delta-variant-cases-rise-who-asks-fully-vaccinated-to-keep-masks-on-101624687137709.html
26-06-2021||World||Canada eases Covid-19 restrictions||As Canada closes in on its targets to easing of restrictions in place since March last year due to the Covid-19, fully vaccinated individuals will be able to enjoy themselves in small groups outdoors and indoors without needing a mask or having to maintain social distancing. And, they’ll be able to share a hug, have dinner together or even play sports outdoors without those requirements.These were among the updates released by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) during a technical briefing that looked forward to a freer summer. But, the obstacle in getting there could be the Delta variant, which has health authorities calling for even higher vaccination targets to prevent a potential fourth wave of the pandemic later this year. “Our bottomline is that we just need to get as high as possible, as much as we can past that 75% goalpost for both first and second doses. We do know second dose is quite important in terms of strengthening your protection against that type of variant,” chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said during the briefing.PHAC’s targets for loosening restrictions were 75% of the population partially and 25% fully vaccinated. That appears to be imminent, as nearly 66% of Canadians have had at least one jab, including just over 19% with both doses.Earlier, in a statement, she warned Canadians to remain “vigilant” despite increase in vaccinations and get fully covered. “The second immune-boosting dose substantially lowers our personal risk of infection and serious harms, provides stronger protection against certain variants of concern, including the Delta variant, and may make immunity last longer,” she said.The new guidance released on Friday came in the form of an infographic. It noted that fully vaccinated persons could participate in small gatherings outdoors or indoors with others who are double-jabbed, without needing a mask or having to socially distance. They can even take part in outdoor activities like sports with those partially vaccinated or not at all, without those restrictions. However, it advised, “If you are at risk of more severe disease or outcomes, masking and physical distancing provide additional layers of protection that further reduce your risk in all settings. Your risk is always lower when outside.”PHAC said this advice was “based on the current state and will be updated as vaccination rates continue to increase and cases decrease”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-eases-covid-19-restrictions-101624684678445.html

He dismissed a US intelligence report that has forecast the fall of Kabul within six months of the departure of the last of US troops, scheduled for as early as July, saying such dire prediction “turned out false” in the past.Biden and Ghani, who was accompanied by Abdullah Abdullah, chairman of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation met at the White House amidst growing concerns about the fate of the current government, with continued escalation of violence by the Taliban, who have backed out of peace talks till the departure of US troops.SURGE IN VIOLENCEThe Biden administration has acknowledged being concerned by the violence but has shown no sign yet it might slow down the pace of withdrawal of troops or call it off. In the bluntest remarks on the issue yet, secretary of state Antony Blinken said in Paris on Thursday that the US is assessing the situation on the ground in Afghanistan and “whether the Taliban is, at all, serious about a peaceful resolution of the conflict”.But Biden gave no indication of a shift. “Our troops may be leaving but our support for Afghanistan is not ending in terms of support and maintenance of helping maintain their military as well as economic and political support,” President Biden said, seeking to assure the Afghan leaders.But, he added, “Afghans are going to have to decide their future, what they want, what they want”.Ghani welcomed Biden’s decision as “historic” but did signal unease saying, “It has made everybody recalculate and reconsider.”President Biden, who had run for White House one the promise, among others, of ending never-ending wars, did take the world by surprise when he announced that all US troops will be out of Afghanistan by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks that took US-led international forced to Afghanistan in search of al-Qaeda.The last of US troops are now expected to be out of the county as soon as July, way ahead of the schedule. And, there is growing concern that the Taliban are moving rapidly to take the country militarily and not through peaceful negotiations as envisaged under the deal they signed with the Trump administration in February 2020, which is backed by the Biden administration.NEW BEGINNING“We are entering into a new chapter of our relationship where the partnership with the United States would not be military, but comprehensive, regarding our mutual interest,” Ghani said. “And we’re very encouraged and satisfied that this partnership is taking place.”Ghani and Abdullah had a series of meetings starting with top Biden administration officials such as defence secretary Lloyd Austin, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, CIA director William Burns and several lawmakers.Ghani was asked about the US intelligence report forecasting the fall of Kabul in six to 12 months during his visit to the Pentagon to meet Austin. “There have been many such predictions, and they’ve all turned out false,” he said.Husain Haqqani, former Pakistan ambassador to the US and senior fellow at Hudson Institute, says both sides gained from the Friday meetings. Biden “wanted to signal that US military withdrawal is not abandonment of Afghanistan” and Ghani and Abdullah “wanted to show that Afghans are united against the Taliban and can defend their country with US economic support and military equipment. Both achieved their goal”.DETERIORATING SECURITY SITUATIONBut, Haqqani warned of the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, which he described as comparable to what happened in Iraq in 2011, after sudden withdrawal of US troops. Arming regional militias, CIA covert ops, and support for Iraqi forces changed things around and the same is possible in Afghanistan, he said, adding, “The Biden administration needs to recognise that the Taliban are not the partners in peace they were made out to be and that it is delusional to think that they will break from al-Qaeda.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-tells-afghan-leaders-your-country-s-fate-in-your-hands-now-101624682458487.html
26-06-2021||World||British health secretary Matt Hancock seen kissing top aide, flouting Covid-19 rules. Boris Johnson says 'matter closed'||United Kingdom health secretary Matt Hancock apologised on Friday for violating coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-related national restrictions after a British newspaper recently exposed photos of him 'kissing' his top aide. Even though the case raised a huge public outcry in the country, demanding the health secretary's resignation, UK prime minister Boris Johnson later accepted Hancock's apology and said that the matter was now "closed".British newspaper 'The Sun', known for its often explosive reveals, published photographs on its front page on Friday that showed Hancock kissing the woman - a friend hired for a taxpayer-funded role - in his office. The newspaper added that the photos, screengrabs from CCTV footage, were taken on May 6, that is, 11 days before the Covid-19 lockdown rules were relaxed."I accept that I breached the social distancing guidance in these circumstances," Hancock said in a statement. He added, "I have let people down and am very sorry. I remain focused on working to get the country out of this pandemic, and would be grateful for privacy for my family on this personal matter."Although British prime minister Boris Johnson stands in "full confidence" of Hancock, the opposing Labour Party said the health secretary should be removed from office for violating social distancing rules and demanded an investigation into whether he breached the ministerial code.The development comes as a hit to the 42-year-old Hancock's prestige, especially since the British health secretary has been at the forefront of the Boris Johnson-led UK government's fight against the coronavirus pandemic. He was there in the promotional materials all along, often appearing on television to tell the public to follow strict rules and to defend his department against criticism of its response to the crisis."Matt Hancock appears to have been caught breaking the laws he created while having a secret relationship with an aide he appointed to a taxpayer-funded job," said Anneliese Dodds, Chair of the Labour Party.Notably, Hancock was found in February to have acted unlawfully by not revealing details of contracts signed during the crisis. The health ministry said it had needed to move within very short timescales and against unparalleled global demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-health-secretary-matt-hancock-seen-kissing-top-aide-flouting-covid-19-rules-boris-johnson-says-matter-closed-101624680449781.html
26-06-2021||World||George Floyd death: Killer cop sentenced to over 22 years in jail||A US court on Friday sentenced Derek Chauvin, a former police officer, to 22 and a half years in jail for murdering George Floyd, whose death in May 2020 sparked the largest civil rights movement in America in decades and forced fresh light on historical injustices around the world.Chauvin, 45, will serve effectively only for 15 of those years; the rest, depending on good behaviour, will be supervised release.“I’m not basing my sentence on public opinion. I’m not basing it on the attempt to send any messages,” said judge Peter Cahill, explaining his order, which ran into 22 pages. “The job of a trial court judge is to apply the law to specific facts and to deal with individual cases.”A jury had in April held Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis police force, guilty on three counts of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder (unintentional murder caused by use of eminently dangerous act) and secondary manslaughter.President Joe Biden called the sentence appropriate. “I don’t know all the circumstances that were considered but it seems to be under the guidelines, that seem to be appropriate,” he said. Biden had met Floyd’s family at the White House in May and discussed provision of a policing reforms legislation named after Floyd.The sentencing came after emotional appeals and counter-appeals from Floyd’s family, including his seven-year-old daughter Gianna Floyd and Chauvin’s mother Carolyn Pawlenty, who professed complete faith in her son’s innocence.Chauvin spoke for the first time in court. “Due to some additional legal matters at hand, I’m not able to give a full formal statement at this time,” said Chauvin, referring to pending federal cases against him. “But, very briefly, I want to give my condolences to the Floyd family.”Benjamin Crump, who is Floyd family attorney, welcomed the sentence. “This is the longest sentence that a police officer has ever been sentenced to in the history of the state of Minnesota, But, this should not be the exception when a Black person is killed by brutality by police. It should be the norm.”Floyd’s death under Chauvin’s knee on May 25 last year triggered protests that had turned violent in the initial days with the National Guard being called out in various parts of the country, including in Washington DC, where then President Donald Trump had added to the unrest by seeking to draw political advantage.Protests - under the slogan “Black Lives Matter” - spread quickly beyond the shores of the US and led to the toppling of the statue of a slave-trader in Bristol, UK; targeting of a 150-year-old statute of King Leopold II in Brussels, Belgium for brutalities in Congo; and protests in Australia against the subjugation of its indigenous people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-killer-cop-sentenced-to-over-22-years-in-jail-101624680778198.html

The focus this year is to curb the spread of misinformation on the topic and to encourage the exchange of facts related to drugs."Do your part and combat misinformation by sharing the real facts on drugs — from health risks and solutions to tackle the world drug problem, to evidence-based prevention, treatment, and care," the UNODC website says.World drug reportEvery year, the UN body publishes a world drug report with statistics and data on how to tackle the global drug crisis. "The World Drug Report 2021 is aimed not only at fostering greater international cooperation to counter the impact of the world drug problem on health, governance and security but also, with its special focus on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, at assisting Member States in anticipating and addressing challenges that may arise in the near future," the UNODC website says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-day-against-drug-abuse-and-illicit-trafficking-2021-theme-history-significance-101624676206216.html
26-06-2021||World||Doubts about China's transparency on Covid-19 origins piling up: Report||Reports of deletion of some early sequences of coronavirus from Wuhan have surfaced, casting shadows over China's transparency on Covid-19 origin once again, news agency ANI reported. Data on the earliest cases of the coronavirus disease is integral to scientists getting closer to the spark that caused the pandemic.Jesse Bloom, a virologist and professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, discovered that early sequencing data of the virus were missing from the Sequence Read Archive, a public archive of high throughput sequencing data. It was possible that the Chinese researchers had deleted them "to obscure their existence," he said.According to an opinion piece in The Washington Post, called 'Doubts about China's transparency on the pandemic origins are piling up', Dr Bloom's discovery adds to the pile of questions about whether China is hiding something. "It is time to launch a serious, sustained investigation," it says.Evidence from the earliest patients "could suggest whether the virus jumped from an animal host to a human, in a zoonotic spillover, or whether the infection came from an inadvertent accident at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was actively studying bat coronaviruses and their potential to infect people. So far, the earliest cases have not been found," it adds.The article further says that the Chinese researchers didn't completely hide the data, but removed it from where people were most likely to look for it. "...they included some in an article published last year in an obscure journal, but the deletion meant that anyone looking for these early Wuhan cases would not find them in the most likely place, the Sequence Read Archive," it says.When Jesse Bloom asked the researchers why they did it, they did not answer, according to ANI. To this, The Washington Post article says, "China took offline a major database at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and imposed gag orders on medical workers and others. It has steadfastly denied that any kind of laboratory accident contributed to the pandemic and repeatedly suggested that the origins are outside its borders."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/doubts-about-china-s-transparency-on-covid-19-origins-piling-up-report-101624672071035.html
26-06-2021||World||Indonesia doctors fell sick, many died after taking Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine: Report||In an unfortunate turn of events, doctors and front health workers at the center of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) management in Indonesia are themselves turning sick, with many of them dead, after being administered the Chinese vaccine -- Sinovac. In a report carried by the New York Times on Friday, the Indonesian Medical Association attested that at least 20 doctors who have died in the country since the pandemic began were fully vaccinated with Sinovac Biotech, the Chinese-made vaccine. The vaccination status of as many as 31 others who passed away in the last five months is currently being looked into.Also Read | Countries dependent on Chinese Covid-19 vaccines reporting surge in casesAmong the public health professionals who died after being vaccinated with Sinovac was Dr. Suhendro Sastrowiwoho, a frontline medical worker at the town of Kudus in Java. Although he had received a double dose of the Chinese-made vaccine, he died just days after testing positive for Covid-19 on June 18, the NYT report stated. Two nurses and a nutritionist, all of who had been fully vaccinated, also died this month in the same town.Indonesia, it seems, is a case study for a nation where the new Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus confirmed some of the most morbid apprehensions of the scientific community -- the failing efficacy of certain vaccines in dealing with particular strains. An efficacy assessment earlier this year among Indonesia's health workers had indicated Sinovac's success against death from infection, but its effect on the Delta variant has not been studied much.Also Read | China approves Covid-19 vaccine for kids as young as 3As many as 358 medical workers, who were fully vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine, have tested positive for Covid-19 during a two-week span in the small town of Kudus, the NYT report stated, citing the risk mitigation team of the Indonesian Doctors Association. Less than 5% of Indonesia's total population has currently been vaccinated, although the inoculation campaign started way back in January. Of those who have been vaccinated, most received doses of Sinovac, which is now being believed to be less effective against certain Covid-19 variants.Not just Indonesia, other countries like Mongolia, Seychelles, and Bahrain who had relied on the easily accessible Chinese Covid-19 vaccines, are also battling a surge in infections now, reported NYT, adding that these are also among the top 10 countries with the worst Covid-19 outbreaks as recently as last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-doctors-fell-sick-many-died-after-taking-chinese-made-sinovac-vaccine-report-101624667601232.html

In that case, we identified the object as a large, deflating balloon. The others remain unexplained," the report read.Also Read: They are out there? US to release the most anticipated report on UFOsThe report, called 'Preliminary Assessment: Unidentified Aerial Phenomena', was released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.UFO report's objectiveIts objective was to provide an overview for policymakers of the challenges associated with characterising the potential threat posed by UAPs. It also aimed to provide "means to develop processes, policies, technologies and training for the US military and other US government (USG) personnel" when they encounter UAPs, "so as to enhance the Intelligence Community’s (IC) ability to understand the threat".Not enough dataThere was wide variability in the reports and the dataset that was available on UAPs. Though the data was too limited to allow for detailed pattern analysis, some clustering of UAPs was observed based on their shape, size, and, particularly, propulsion.Some UAPs demonstrate advanced technologyThe report also says that "unusual activities" were reported on several occasions, but mentions that this may be due to sensor errors. "In 18 incidents, described in 21 reports, UAP reportedly appeared to exhibit unusual flight characteristics. These observations could be the result of sensor errors, spoofing, or observer misperception and require additional rigorous analysis," the report said.UAPs lack a single explanationWhile UAPs could be airborne clutter or natural atmospheric phenomena, they could also be part of the industry developmental programs or foreign adversary systems such as technologies deployed by China, Russia, another nation, or a non-governmental entity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ufo-report-us-says-can-identify-1-of-144-flying-objects-with-high-confidence-101624665981693.html

His apology came after The Sun newspaper published two photos of Hancock and Gina Coladangelo seemingly kissing in his Whitehall office last month.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson stood by his health secretary amid calls from the opposition Labour Party for Hancock to be fired for breaking the government’s own coronavirus restrictions.“The prime minister has accepted the health secretary’s apology and considers the matter closed,” Johnson’s spokesman, Jamie Davies, told reporters on Friday. Johnson has full confidence in Hancock, he said.“I accept that I breached the social distancing guidance in these circumstances,” Hancock, 42, said. “I have let people down and I am very sorry. I remain focused on working to get the country out of this pandemic, and would be grateful for privacy for my family on this personal matter.”Labour Party accused Johnson of being “spineless” in choosing not to fire him. “This matter is definitely not closed, despite the government’s attempts to cover it up,” a Labour spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/matt-hancock-sorry-for-flouting-covid-19-rules-101624666385809.html
26-06-2021||World||2 finds in Israel, China shed new light on our origin||Bones belonging to a “new type of early human” - previously unknown - have been found in Israel, researchers said on Thursday, claiming to have shed new light on human evolution.In a similar breakthrough on Friday, scientists said a skull that was unearthed in China in 2018 is now known to be representing a newly discovered human species that they have named Homo longi or “dragon man”. Crucially, they say the lineage should replace Neanderthals as our closest relatives.In Israel, excavations in the quarry of a cement plant near the central city of Ramla uncovered prehistoric remains that could not be matched to any known species from the Homo genus. Researchers from Tel Aviv University and Hebrew University of Jerusalem dubbed the “extraordinary discovery” the “Nesher Ramla Homo type” after the site, in a study that was published in the journal Science.The fossils date back to 140,000-120,000 years ago.As for the other development, the “Harbin cranium” was discovered in the 1930s in the city of the same name in China’s Heilongjiang province, but was reportedly hidden in a well for 85 years to protect it from the Japanese army. The skull dates back at least 146,000 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-finds-in-israel-china-shed-new-light-on-our-origin-101624665905546.html

Reimposing the mask requirement is a setback for Israel, days after it was lifted on June 15.In Indonesia, over a dozen fully vaccinated doctors have died from Covid-19, a medical association said on Friday, as the country battles a rash of severe cases in inoculated medical workers.In the UK, the number of Delta variant cases has risen by over 35,200 since last week to a total of around 111,100, representing a 46% increase, health officials said on Friday.In Australia, around a million people in Sydney neighbourhoods were ordered to stay home for at least a week. New South Wales officials called it the “scariest period” since the pandemic began.Brazil president denies Bharat Biotech linkPresident Jair Bolsonaro has said Brazil didn’t pay for or receive any doses of a vaccine developed by Indian company Bharat Biotech, in response to allegations of irregularities in a deal that is being probed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-reinstates-indoor-mask-rule-amid-surge-101624665688734.html
26-06-2021||World||159 missing in Florida building collapse tragedy||About 160 people were still unaccounted for and four were confirmed to have died on Friday, a day after a large section of a seaside apartment building collapsed into a pile of rubble, with rescuers combing through concrete and metal in search of the missing.Scores of firefighters were working overnight to reach any possible survivors both from under and atop the remains of the building. Hopes rested on how quickly crews using rescue dogs and microphones to sift through the wreckage could complete their grim task.“Every time we hear a sound, we concentrate on those areas,” said assistant Miami-Dade fire chief Raide Jadallah.Three bodies were removed overnight after one person was initially reported dead. Miami-Dade police director Freddy Ramirez said authorities were working with the medical examiner’s office to identify the victims. Eleven injuries were reported, with four people treated at various hospitals.Officials are still saying that no cause for the building’s collapse has been determined.Miami-Dade mayor Daniella Levine Cava said rescuers themselves were at “extreme risk” going through the rubble. “Debris is falling on them as they do their work. We have structural engineers on site to ensure they won’t be injured,” she said.The work focused on what was left of the 12-storey Champlain Towers South, which drew people from around the world to enjoy life on southern Florida’s Atlantic coast, some only for a night, and some to reside there.State Senator Jason Pizzo of Miami Beach told Miami Herald that he watched as tactical teams of six worked on Friday to sift through the debris. He said he saw one body taken in a yellow bag and another that was marked. They were taken to a homicide unit tent set up along the beach.Many people remained at a reunification centre hastily set up near the site of the collapse on Friday, awaiting results of DNA swabs that could help identify victims.Video of the collapse showed the centre of the building appearing to tumble down first and a section nearest to the ocean teetering and coming down seconds later, as a huge dust cloud swallowed the neighbourhood. About half the building’s 130 units were affected, and rescuers pulled at least 35 people from the wreckage in the first hours after the collapse.Hit by gusty winds and rain, two heavy cranes began removing debris from the pile using large claws on Friday, creating a din of crashing glass and metal as they picked up material and dumped it to the side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/159-missing-in-florida-building-collapse-tragedy-101624665106235.html
26-06-2021||World||First Covid-19 case could have emerged in China in Oct 2019||The virus that causes Covid-19 could have started spreading in China as early as October 2019, two months before the first case was identified in the central city of Wuhan, a new study showed on Friday.Officially, the first Covid-19 case was identified on December 8 and linked to Wuhan’s Huanan seafood market. However, the new study by researchers from Britain’s University of Kent pins the most likely date to November 17, saying that it had probably already spread globally by January 2020.The paper was published on Thursday on the PLOS Pathogens journal.“Our results suggest that the virus emerged in China in early October to mid-November, 2019 (the most likely date being November 17), and by January, 2020, had spread globally,” the researchers said, adding that it suggests a much earlier and more rapid spread than is evident from confirmed cases.The research estimates that the virus spread beyond China by January 2020 with the estimated first case in Japan on January 3, 2020, followed by Thailand on January 7, 2020. The researchers said the coronavirus is likely to have left eastern Asia and arrived in Europe, with the first case estimated to have come on January 12, 2020, in Spain. It then appeared in South Korea on January 14.From Europe, the virus may have spread to North America with the first infection estimated to be in the US by January 16, the research suggests.China has maintained that it has shared all relevant data on the origin of Covid-19 during the investigation conducted by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The Chinese foreign ministry has been on a diplomatic overdrive suggesting that the WHO should investigate the origin in other countries, including in the US, which, according to the study, was the fifth country where the virus most likely spread to.Doubts over the origin, however, remain, and new studies have raised new questions.In a paper released on a preprint platform this week, Jesse Bloom of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle recovered deleted sequencing data from early Covid-19 cases in China, Reuters reported. The data showed that samples taken from the Huanan market were “not representative” of Sars-CoV-2 as a whole and were a variant of a progenitor sequence circulating earlier, which spread to other parts of China.“Why would scientists ask international databases to delete key data that informs us about how Covid-19 began in Wuhan?” said Alina Chan, researcher, Harvard’s Broad Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-covid-19-case-could-have-emerged-in-china-in-oct-2019-101624657849294.html
26-06-2021||World||How the Ever Given that broke global trade crashed||Captain Krishnan Kanthavel watched the sun rise over the Red Sea through a dusty haze on March 23, 2021. From his viewpoint, through winds of more than 40 mph, it was just possible to see outlines of the 19 other ships anchored in Suez Bay, waiting their turn to enter the narrow channel.Kanthavel’s container vessel, largest in the queue, was scheduled to be the thirteenth travelling north through the canal. The Ever Given is 400 meters from bow to stern and nearly 60 meters across. It was loaded with about 17,600 brightly colored containers.Soon after daybreak, a small craft approached, carrying the local pilots who’d guide the ship during its 12-hour journey between the seas.Bloomberg reported that according to documents filed weeks later in an Egyptian court, there was a dispute between the two pilots and the Indian captain and officers, about whether the ship should enter the canal given the bad weather -- a debate that may have been hampered by the fact that English was neither side’s first language.Like airplanes, ships carry voyage data recorders, or VDRs, black-box devices that capture conversations on the bridge. The full recording of what transpired on the Ever Given’s bridge hasn’t been released by the Egyptian government, so it isn’t clear exactly what the pilots and crew said about the conditions.From the bridge, Kanthavel could see about a half-mile ahead. The captain could still have refused to proceed, but with an all-clear from the agency that manages the waterway, and with everyone eager to get going, he carried on. The lead Egyptian pilot leaned into his radio and had a brief conversation in Arabic between bursts of static. Then he instructed the bridge crew to power forward.A few miles into the transit, Ever Given began to veer alarmingly from port to starboard and back again. In response, according to evidence submitted in legal proceedings, the lead SCA pilot began barking instructions at the Indian helmsman. The pilot shouted to steer hard right, then hard left, the Bloomberg report said. The ships hull took so long to respond that by the time it began to move, he needed to correct course. When the second pilot objected, the two argued.The lead pilot then gave a new order: “Full ahead.” The second pilot tried to cancel the order, and more angry words were exchanged. Kanthavel intervened, and the lead pilot responded by threatening to leave the vessel, according to the court evidence.Suddenly, it became clear the Ever Given was going to crash. According to a person familiar with the VDR audio, Captain Kanthavel reacted as anyone might in the same situation. “Shit!” he screamed.No one could have anticipated what happened next. The vessel was wedged diagonally across the channel.Below the waterline, the bow had been driven like a dagger deep into the rocks and coarse sand. Somehow, the back end had also run aground, lodging in the opposite bank and leaving the ship at a 45-degree angle to the shore. Nothing could pass.It took about 24 hours for the SCA to release a statement, in which it said the Ever Given had lost control in bad weather. Evergreen, which declined to make any of its executives available for an interview, blamed a “suspected sudden strong wind”, while one local maritime agent cited a “blackout”.The vessel was freed six days later on March 29, after round-the-clock efforts to move the massive vessel involved sucking sand from underneath its hull, as tugboats pushed and pulled the ship.The Ever Given has been anchored in a lake between two stretches of the canal since it was dislodged.The operator of a cargo ship on Thursday that it would take more time for the vessel to be released from detainment while a final agreement with Egyptian authorities was being concluded.The Japanese owners and insurers of the ship were locked in a compensation dispute with the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), but announced on Wednesday that an agreement in principle had been reached. “It may take some further time for the agreement to be concluded, for the vessel to be released from arrest and prepared for onward transit,” ship operator Evergreen Line said in a statement.Suez Canal Authority agreed to settle with the owners of the ship, having initially demanding $916 million in compensation, reputational damage and lost revenue before publicly lowering the request to $550 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-the-ever-given-that-broke-global-trade-crashed-101624657209460.html
26-06-2021||World||'Go to India': Philippines President threatens citizens who refuse Covid vaccine||Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, frustrated by the slow pace of Covid-19 vaccinations in his country, threatened people who refuse to get inoculated with jail or an injection of Ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug widely used to treat animals.Ivermectin has been touted as an alternative treatment for Covid-19 but US and European regulators and the World Health Organization (WHO) have recommended against it."You choose, vaccine or I will have you jailed," Duterte said in a televised address late on Monday, following reports of low turnout at several vaccination sites in the capital Manila."Go to India if you want or somewhere to America. But for as long as you are here and you are a human being, and can carry the virus, get vaccinated."Otherwise, I will order all the village captains to have a tally of the people who refuse to be vaccinated. Because if not, I will have Ivermectin meant for pigs injected into you."Duterte is famous for his bellicose rhetoric and his remarks on Monday contradicted those of his health officials, who have said getting vaccinated against Covid-19 is voluntary."Don't get me wrong, there is a crisis in this country," Duterte said. "I'm just exasperated by Filipinos not heeding the government."With over 1.3 million cases, the Philippines is fighting one of Asia's must stubborn Covid-19 epidemics.But as of June 20, just 2.1 million people had been fully vaccinated of the 70 million people targeted for this year.Duterte, who has been criticised for his tough approach to containing the virus, also stood by his decision not to let schools reopen.In the same televised address, he took a swipe at the International Criminal Court, after an ICC prosecutor sought permission from the court for a full inquiry into thousands of killings by police in a war on drugs ordered by Duterte.Duterte, who cancelled the Philippines' membership of the ICC's founding treaty, said he would not cooperate with the probe and described the ICC as "bullshit"."Why would I defend or face an accusation before white people. You must be crazy," he said.Human rights groups say authorities have summarily executed drug suspects, but Duterte maintains those killed had violently resisted arrest.Asked for comment, ICC court spokesperson Fadi El Abdallah said: "The court is an independent judicial institution, and does not comment on political statements".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/go-to-india-philippines-president-threatens-citizens-who-refuse-covid-vaccine-101624652730972.html
26-06-2021||World||George Floyd death: Former Police officer Derek Chauvin gets 22 years and 6 months in prison||Former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison for the murder of George Floyd, whose dying gasps under Chauvin’s knee led to the biggest outcry against racial injustice in the U.S. in generations.The punishment — which fell short of the 30 years that prosecutors had requested — came after Chauvin broke his more than yearlong silence in court to offer condolences to the Floyd family and say he hopes more information coming out will eventually give them “some peace of mind.”With good behavior, Chauvin, 45, could be paroled after serving two-thirds of his sentence, or about 15 years.In imposing the punishment, Judge Peter Cahill went beyond the 12 1/2-year sentence prescribed under state guidelines, citing “your abuse of a position of trust and authority and also the particular cruelty” shown to Floyd.Chauvin was immediately led back to prison. As with the verdicts in April, he showed little emotion when the judge pronounced the sentence. His eyes moved rapidly around the courtroom, his COVID-19 mask obscuring much of his face.The fired white officer was convicted of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck for up to 9 1/2 minutes as the 46-year-old Black man gasped that he couldn’t breathe and went limp on May 25, 2020.Bystander video of Floyd’s arrest on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store prompted protests around the world and led to scattered violence in Minneapolis and beyond.On Friday, Chauvin, who did not testify at his trial, removed his mask and turned toward the Floyd family, speaking only briefly because of what he called “some additional legal matters at hand” — an apparent reference to the federal civil rights trial he still faces.“But very briefly, though, I do want to give my condolences to the Floyd family. There’s going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest. And I hope things will give you some some peace of mind,” he said, without elaborating.In asking that Chauvin be left off on probation, defense attorney Eric Nelson called Floyd’s death “tragic” and said that Chauvin's “brain is littered with what-ifs” from that day: “What if I just did not agree to go in that day? What if things had gone differently? What if I never responded to that call? What if what if what if?”Floyd's family members took the stand and expressed sorrow about his death. They asked for the maximum penalty.“We don’t want to see no more slaps on the wrist. We’ve been through that already," said a tearful Terrence Floyd, one of Floyd's brothers.Floyd's nephew Brandon Williams said: “Our family is forever broken.” And Floyd's 7-year-old daughter, Gianna, in a video played in court, said that if she could say something to her father now, it would be: “I miss you and and I love you.”Prosecutor Matthew Frank asked the judge to exceed sentencing guidelines and give Chauvin 30 years in prison, saying “tortured is the right word” for what the officer did to Floyd.“This is not a momentary gunshot, punch to the face. This is 9½ minutes of cruelty to a man who was helpless and just begging for his life," Frank said.Chauvin's mother, Carolyn Pawlenty, appeared in court to plead for mercy for son, saying his reputation has been unfairly reduced to that of “an aggressive, heartless and uncaring person” and a racist.“I can tell you that is far from the truth,” she told the judge. “I want this court to know that none of these things are true and that my son is a good man." She added: “Derek, I want you to know I have always believed in your innocence, and I will never waver from that.”“I will be here for you when you come home,” she said.The concrete barricades, razor wire and National Guard patrols at the courthouse during Chauvin's three-week trial in the spring were gone Friday, reflecting an easing of tensions since the verdict in April.Ahead of the sentencing, the judge agreed with prosecutors that there were aggravating circumstances that could justify a heavier punishment than the recommended 12 1/2 years — among them, that Chauvin treated Floyd with particular cruelty, abused his position of authority as a police officer and did it in front of children.Before the sentencing, the judge denied Chauvin’s request for a new trial. The defense had argued that the intense publicity tainted the jury pool and that the trial should have been moved away from Minneapolis.The judge also rejected a defense request for a hearing into possible juror misconduct. Nelson had accused a juror of not being candid during jury selection because he didn’t mention his participation in a march last summer to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Prosecutors countered the juror had been open about his views.Philip Stinson, a criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University, said 11 non-federal law officers, including Chauvin, have been convicted of murder for on-duty deaths since 2005. The penalties for the nine who were sentenced before Chauvin ranged from from six years, nine months, to life behind bars, with the median being 15 years.With Chauvin’s sentencing, the Floyd family and Black America witnessed something of a rarity: In the small number of instances in which officers accused of brutality or other misconduct against Black people have gone to trial, the list of acquittals and mistrials is longer than the list of sentencings after conviction.In recent years, the acquittals have included officers tried in the deaths of Philando Castile in suburban Minneapolis and Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Two mistrials were declared over the death of Samuel Dubose in Cincinnati.“That’s why the world has watched this trial, because it is a rare occurrence,” said Arizona-based civil rights attorney Benjamin Taylor, who has represented victims of police brutality. “Everybody knows that this doesn’t happen every day.”Chauvin has been held since his conviction at the state's maximum-security prison in Oak Park Heights, where he has been kept in a cell by himself for his own protection, his meals brought to him.The three other officers involved in Floyd's arrest are scheduled for trial in March on state charges of aiding and abetting both murder and manslaughter. They will also stand trial with Floyd on the federal civil rights charges. No date has been set for that trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-former-police-officer-derek-chauvin-gets-22-5-years-in-prison-101624652124622.html
26-06-2021||World||Spot the tiny NASA astronauts deck up solar panels from 410 kms above Earth||Making for a spectacular way from up above, two NASA astronauts on Friday finished unfurling a new pair of solar panels outside the International Space Station. This was their third spacewalk in just over a week.In what would keep the space station running for the rest of this decade, two astronauts - NASA's Shane Kimbrough and France's Thomas Pesquet successfully installed the second in a series of powerful solar wings. This spectacle comes at the time space tourism ramps up with visitors beginning in the fall.“We have a lot of happy faces down here,” Mission Control radioed as power surged through the panel.In what should have been a two-spacewalk job, roadblocks like spacesuit and other problems hampered the astronauts’ work on June 16. This delayed the first solar wing's extension to its full length of 63 feet (19 meters) until Sunday. NASA added a third spacewalk for Friday to attach and unfold the second wing — this time everything went smoothly 255 miles (410 kilometers) up.Shortly after the panel was unveiled 410 kilometers above the Earth, NASA shared a tweet with a magical view.😎 How about that view? 255 miles (410 kilometers) above Earth, @Thom_Astro (suit with red stripes) and @Astro_Kimbrough continue making progress upgrading the @Space_Station's power supply. pic.twitter.com/KLBl4x2Qb9"😎 How about that view? 255 miles (410 kilometers) above Earth, @Thom_Astro (suit with red stripes) and @Astro_Kimbrough continue making progress upgrading the @Space_Station's power supply," the tweet read.Once Pesquet released the final bolt, the newest solar wing unrolled like a giant stretch of wallpaper, high above the Bering Sea.

Also, 90% of the new infections were caused by the Delta variant, the WSJ report showed citing Ran Balicer, who leads an expert advisory panel on Covid-19 for the government.Meanwhile, children below the age of 12 accounted for about half of the infections and most of them were not vaccinated against the disease, the report also showed.The outbreak has pushed the Israeli government to reimpose the indoor mask rule and other similar measures to prevent a flare-up in cases due to the highly transmissible strain. Earlier on Friday, the country’s health ministry reimposed the rule that required people to wear facemasks in enclosed public spaces following a spike in the number of daily new infections. The rule was dropped 10 days ago. However, the decision has been reversed after the country reported more than 100 new cases for the past four days. On Thursday, 227 people tested positive for the disease.Also read | Pfizer says its vaccine highly effective against Delta variant“The entrance of the Delta variant has changed the transmission dynamics,” WSJ quoted Prof Balicer as saying on Friday. The country’s vaccination program was widely regarded as one among the fastest and successful and around 80% of the adult population (age 16 above) have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.Nachman Ash, the head of Israel’s pandemic response task force, also said that the rise in cases is “likely” due to the highly contagious Delta variant. “We are seeing a doubling every few days. Another thing that's worrying is that the infections are spreading. If we had two cities where most of the infections were, we would have more cities where the numbers are rising and communities where the cases are going up,” news agency AFP quoted Ash as saying.Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, only weeks into office, said that the safety of the citizens was his government’s immediate priority. “Our goal at the moment, first and foremost, is to safeguard the citizens of Israel from the Delta variant that is running amok in the world,” WSJ quoted the Prime Minister as saying.The Delta variant or the B.1.617.2 was first identified in India during late 2020 and is now prevalent in more than 70 countries across the world. World Health Organisation director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the variant “the most transmissible of the variants identified so far,” according to a news report by the Associated Press.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/about-50-infected-adults-in-covid-19-delta-variant-outbreak-in-israel-fully-vaccinated-report-101624646120358.html

They added that enlisting them was “meant for some of those who are always unhappy with whatever your government does”.Besides listing the Centre’s initiatives towards J&K and praising the PM on conducting local body elections in the Union Territory, they also appreciated him for conducting “surgical strikes” on Pakistani militants and for striking a “terrorist training camp” at Balakot in Pakistan.The letter also lauded the government for “organising an impeccable system of managing external pressures” from western countries and the United Nations which it said was “interfering in India’s internal affairs regarding Kashmir”.It said that none of these international elements were able to create any “significant impact, except the appearance of articles in media of their choice.”Calling Pakistan a “permanent interloper”, the letter praised the PM for “boxing (Pakistan) into a difficult position”.“… Pakistan is now calling for the reinstatement of state-hood for J&K, which amounts to accepting J&K as part of the Union of India and reiterates the Union home minister’s announcement in Parliament to this effect,” the officers said adding that they hoped the Prime Minister would bring economic development to the J&K region with the “robust investment plans” that he has finalised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retd-ips-officers-write-to-pm-modi-praise-his-dynamic-approach-to-solve-kashmir-issue-101624728840877.html

Orders to this effect were issued by chief secretary Adityanath Das on Saturday.The state government recently announced that it would hire for 10,143 jobs during the year 2021-22. In the order, the chief secretary said the government had taken the decision to dispense with interviews for recruitments to be done by the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC) for all categories of jobs, including for Group-I Services.The decision was taken in an attempt to maintain utmost transparency and in order to ensure complete trust of the competing candidates in the entire selection process. “The order to dispense with interviews is applicable for all the recruitments notified on or after June 26,” the order said.The chief secretary directed the secretary of APPSC to take necessary action in the implementation of the order.’In 2011, the erstwhile combined Andhra Pradesh government abolished interviews for filling up of various posts, except for Group-1 services (deputy collector and revenue divisional officer posts etc) and for those posts which were executive in nature and where articulation and public interface was required.After the bifurcation, the government for the residuary Andhra Pradesh in 2016 and 2017 re-introduced the interview system for filling up a few more top positions in the state government.“However, at a review meeting conducted to introduce reforms in recruitment in October 2019, it was proposed to abolish interviews for recruitment of any posts notified by the APPSC,” the chief secretary said, adding that the government, after careful examination of the proposal, decided to implement it from now.Andhra University professor S Prasanna Sree welcomed the decision of the state government to do away with interviews. “It will help candidates from rural backgrounds, who fail to get through interviews, despite doing extremely well in the written tests,” she said, adding that communication skills do not matter much if they have administrative skills.Prasanna Sree also said abolition of interviews would also eradicate corruption in recruitments. “It will make the recruitments more transparent and merit-based,” she asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-scraps-interviews-for-all-recruitments-to-government-depts-101624724641463.html

26-06-2021||India||India crosses milestone of carrying out 400 million Covid-19 tests||India on Friday crossed the milestone of conducting 400 million tests for Covid-19 since the pandemic began, with the last 50 million tests being conducted over the last 24 days, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The number of tests conducted per day started increasing in April and May when the cases of the viral infection were on the rise across the country.In June, the country has been conducting around 1.8 million tests a day, even as the number of Covid-19 cases is dipping across states.“This has been enabled by rapidly increasing testing infrastructure and capacity across the country. ICMR has been enhancing Covid-19 testing capability across the country by expanding and diversifying testing capacity by leveraging technology and facilitating innovation in affordable diagnostic kits,” the country’s apex health research body indicated.To increase testing during the huge second wave of infections, ICMR had allowed increase in the number of less accurate but fast and cheap rapid antigen tests. Prior to that, the ICMR guidelines said that at least 70% of the tests should be conducted using the more accurate RT-PCR or other molecular diagnostic technologies.The number of laboratories conducting Covid-19 tests across the country has increased to 2,675, of which 1,676 are run by Central or state governments. Efforts were also made to start high-throughput testing and testing in remotest areas using the TB diagnostic machines like TrueNAT and CBNAAT.Recently, ICMR has also approved India’s first self-use Rapid Antigen Test. These self-test kits can help to reduce queues in laboratories, reduce costs, dissipate the burden on existing manpower for sample collection from homes, and provide results without delay.“We have effectively responded to the evolving epidemic through focused and collaborative efforts of the Centre, state and union territory governments. Exponential increase in testing has led to early identification, prompt isolation & effective treatment of Covid-19 cases. These have eventually resulted in a sustained low fatality rate. This testing milestone is testimony to the fact that India has been successful in implementing strategy of 5T approach “Test, Track, Trace, Treat and use of Technology” efficiently, which will enable us to contain the spread of the pandemic,” said Dr Balaram Bhargava, director general, ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-crosses-milestone-of-carrying-out-400-million-covid-19-tests-101624715160317.html

The meeting has been called by the Prime Minister to discuss the progress of the vaccination drive in the country.The meeting was held via video-conferencing and comes over a month after the Centre extended the free vaccination drive to cover everyone above the age of 18 years.The highly transmissible Delta Plus variant was first detected in three states - Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra earlier this week -- and in the following days, it has been traced in Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan.The meeting by PM Modi comes a day after the Union health ministry urged eight states and union territories to rush and impose immediate containment measures including preventing crowds, conducting widespread testing.The health ministry has also pressed on increasing vaccine coverage on a priority basis in districts where the Delta Plus variant of coronavirus has been detected.Among these states are Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Gujarat and Haryana.Leading health experts have sought a label of 'Variant of Concern' for the Delta Plus saying that even though there is no data as of now which shows that the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 is spreading faster than Delta but the former should also be treated as a "variant of concern"Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, former head scientist of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR, said the reason for terming it as a variant of concern emanates from Delta which is also clubbed under the same category."There is no data as of now that says Delta Plus is spreading faster than Delta, basically Delta plus will prevail across we still don't have evidence. But Delta has spread a lot and Delta is a variant of concern for sure, since it's a variant of concern, you have to also treat Delta Plus as a variant of concern, but now this mutation has how much efficiency and can we add attribute to this particular mutation, we don't know," said Dr Gangakhedkar told ANI.The Union Health Ministry has warned that the Delta Plus variant has increased transmissibility, causes stronger binding to receptors of lung cells and has the potential of reducing monoclonal antibody response.India has administered at least 31,50,45,926 doses of Covid-19 vaccines from the start of the vaccination drive in January. A total of 61,19,169 vaccine doses were given in the last 24 hours.Pegged as the world's largest vaccination drive, India kickstarted this initiative on January 16 this year in a phased manner which prioritised the healthcare workers first. In the next stage, India vaccinated frontline workers (FLWs) on February 2. The next phase of Covid-19 vaccination commenced from March 1 for those over 60 years of age and for people aged 45 and above with specified co-morbid conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-chairs-review-meet-on-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101624712471615.html

Though Dragon fruit is not a local product of India and grown mainly in Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, the United States and Vietnam, production of the fruit began in India in the early 1990s. Its production was limited to home gardens initially but then farmers across various states took up its production increasing the popularity of the fruit.Dragon fruit goes to Dubai: In a major boost to export of exotic fruits, a consignment of the fibre & mineral rich Dragon Fruit (Kamalam) sourced from farmers of Sangli, Maharashtra has been exported to Dubai.📖 https://t.co/WEwqSm5LMt pic.twitter.com/xW6c9vTQR4States which grow Dragon fruit include Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. "The cultivation requires less water and can be grown in various kinds of soils. There are three main varieties of dragon fruit: white flesh with pink skin, red flesh with pink skin, and white flesh with yellow skin," the ministry said.In January, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani said the state government has decided to rename the fruit as the word 'dragon' has a Chinese association. Since the fruit looks like the lotus flower, it was named Kamalam. Gujarat also applied for a patent to change the name, it was reported. The fruit is rich in fibre, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants and is also known for repairing cell damage caused by oxidative stress.In his Mann ki Baat in July 2020, PM Modi had congratulated the farmers of Kutch for the cultivation of the dragon fruit in his message for India's self-reliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dragon-fruit-cultivated-by-maharashtra-farmers-exported-to-dubai-101624711364768.html

He said this does not indicate that the third wave of Covid has begun and calling it the onset of the third wave would be misleading, reported news agency ANI."So far, only 49 cases of Delta plus variant have been reported from 10 states. This doesn't indicate that the third wave of Covid has begun. Calling it the onset of the third wave would be misleading," ANI quoted Dr Panda as saying.Reiterating the results of a study conducted by the ICMR in collaboration with the Imperial College of London, the head of epidemiology said that the third wave of the virus would not be as severe as the second wave. Large-scale vaccinations and Covid appropriate behaviour could play an important role in mitigating the impact of the waves, he said, adding that a study on the efficacy of vaccines against Delta Plus variant is underway, reported ANI."Third wave of Covid won't be as severe as the second wave. More vaccination and Covid-appropriate behaviour could play an important role in mitigating these waves. Study on vaccine effect on Delta plus variant of Covid is underway," Dr Panda told ANI.The study, based on mathematical modelling analysis, showed that the new variant is unlikely to generate a new wave unless it results in a complete loss of immune protection from the previous infection.Multiple cases of the Delta Plus variant have been detected in three states of Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra. The variant has also been traced in Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan, according to an ANI report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-plus-variant-cases-do-not-indicate-inception-of-third-wave-of-covid-icmr-expert-101624708819012.html

Farmers from Shamli and Bhagpat in Uttar Pradesh will be a part of the rally.“In today's meeting, we have decided to strengthen our movement. We have decided to hold two more rallies; a tractor rally will be held on July 9 in which people from Shamli and Bhagpat will be present; it will reach Singhu border on July 10,” ANI said quoting Tikait.Farmers have been protesting all over the country against the newly implemented farm laws, which completed seven months on Saturday. In the national capital, Ghazipur, Singhu, and Tikri-the three borders, farmers have been camping since last year.Tikait also informed of another rally which will depart from Bijnor on July 24 and reach Ghazipur on July 25 after a night halt at Meerut.“Another rally will be held on July 24, people from Bijnor and Meerut will be present in it. On the night of July 24th, they will halt at Meerut toll and on 25th July the rally will reach here (Delhi-Ghazipur),” Tikait said.Elsewhere in Punjab and Haryana, too, farmers took out protest marches on Saturday, heading for Raj Bhavan, where they had planned on submitting a memorandum to the governor. Stringent security measures consisting of a heavy police deployment and barricades were put up on their way to prevent them from reaching Raj Bhavan.Protesters braved water cannons and barricades to march on and farmer leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal Gurnam Singh Chaduni, and Yogendra Yadav were able to submit memorandums to Chandigarh Deputy Commissioner and other officials asking them to hand it over to the governor, after which the leaders requested the protestors to return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rakesh-tikait-announces-plans-to-strengthen-movement-as-farmers-protest-completes-seven-months-101624711795136.html

26-06-2021||India||Monsoon unlikely to progress for nearly two weeks: IMD||The monsoon is unlikely to progress to Delhi, Chandigarh, Haryana, remaining parts of Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab for nearly two weeks and is also likely to enter a “break spell” from June 29 onwards, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Saturday. Heavy rain will be confined to northeast India while rainfall will be subdued in the rest of the country at least till around July 5, it added. “Models suggest monsoon entering into a break spell from July 29. Heavy rains to be confined mainly over northeast India at least till July 5 with suppressed rainfall over rest of India. Active-break spells are part of monsoon dynamics and decides quantum of seasonal rainfall,” tweeted M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences. He added break spells normally last for a week. But in some years, they have lasted over 10 days. Longer breaks can affect agriculture.India receives about 70% of its annual rain during the four-month monsoon that is crucial for rice, soybean, and cotton cultivation. As much as 60% of the sown area does not have access to irrigation in India, where over 150 million farmers and nearly half of the population are dependent on a farm-based income.From June 1 to June 26, the country recorded 20% excess rain. There was 43% excess rain in northwest India, 36% in central India, 3% in the east and northeast India, and 7% in the south peninsula. Out of 36 subdivisions, seven recorded large excess rain (60% or more above normal), 14 recorded excess rain (20 to 59% excess), seven recorded normal rain (-19% to 19%) and eight recorded deficient rain (-20% to -59%).The northern limit of the monsoon continues to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala, and Amritsar. It has been in the same position for a week. IMD, in its bulletin, on Saturday cited the prevailing meteorological conditions, atmospheric features, and the forecast wind pattern by dynamical models and added they suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Punjab over the next seven days.It added subdued rainfall activity is very likely in the northwest, central, and western parts of peninsular India during the next five days. A subdued rainfall phase will merge into the break monsoon phase likely to begin on June 29.Under the influence of strong moist south-westerly winds, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall is very likely in West Bengal, Sikkim, and north-eastern states during the next five days. Subsequently, moist easterly winds are likely to pick up in strength, causing enhanced rainfall activity all along the foothill regions of north Bihar, north Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh around July 1 and 2. This will lead to increased inflow into the rivers which originate from these regions, IMD said.O P Sreejith, who heads IMD Pune’s Climate Monitoring and Prediction Group said normally break monsoon phase happens when the monsoon has already covered the entire country. “The monsoon trough moves to the foothills and wind flow is mostly westerly. There is little contribution from the Bay of Bengal and hence little convective activity. During break monsoon phases, rains are limited to northeast India. But this time the trough is not near the Himalayan foothills, but the monsoon flow itself has weakened.”He said up to July first week, there are no indications of monsoon revival. “The cross-equatorial flow has weakened, and the pressure gradient is less. Normally monsoon flow moves from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas. The monsoon current itself has weakened. Monsoon onset is unlikely over remaining parts of the country till monsoon revives. It may revive when a low-pressure system forms over the Bay of Bengal. We have no information on when a low-pressure area is likely to form.”K Jenamani, senior scientist, National Weather Forecasting Centre, IMD, said monsoon will not cover the remaining parts of the country until conditions become favourable. “Large scale features are not supporting monsoon progress and activity.” He said cross-equatorial flow has weakened and there is no convection over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal and wind is also unfavourable. Jenamani said mid-latitude westerlies have strengthened and the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is also not over the Indo-Pacific region.MJO location and amplitude strongly modulate the intensity of tropical convection and features like low-pressure systems over the north Indian Ocean. It is currently in east Africa with amplitude greater than one, which is not favourable for enhancing the convection over the north Indian Ocean region and hence monsoon rainfall activities, IMD said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-unlikely-to-progress-for-nearly-two-weeks-imd-101624707119886.html
26-06-2021||India||Can Indians travel to Germany, South Korea, US? Check latest visa, vaccine rules||Most of the countries are continuing their travel restrictions on India in the wake of the threat of the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This is the variant that was first reported from India and has now spread across the world. It is the variant responsible for 90 per cent of cases in the United Kingdom now. Given this situation, only a few countries are now welcoming travellers from India, leaving students in a lurch.Countries where Indians can travelRussia, Serbia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Ghana, South Africa, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Albania are the countries open for Indian travellers. People travelling from India do not need to be quarantined in these countries. Negative RT-PCR is all that a traveller will need to enter these countries.Turkey will require a negative RT-PCR test report and a mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone travelling from India.South Korea has lifted the travel ban on India and done away with the mandatory two-week quarantine for those vaccinated with both the doses of Covishield vaccine. However, those who are vaccinated with Covaxin, which is yet to get approval from the World Health Organization, will have to remain in quarantine.The United States has not lifted its travel ban on India but those who have students' visa can travel to the country. Some other national interest exception categories are also allowed to travel. Mandatory vaccination is not yet a requirement but educational institutes, companies may have their different set of vaccine rules.Germany is also another popular destination for Indian students but it is not yet open for Indian students. German ambassador to India Walter J Lindner recently tweeted that against the backdrop of Delta variant spreading rapidly, easing travel restrictions for "virus-mutation countries" is not an easy decision to make. "Numbers of Covid cases are falling in parts of Europe, so some measures are being relaxed. At same time, case-numbers of potentially more transmissible and vaccine resistent variants (esp Delta) are growing in many countries and cause fear of a 4th wave which could reverse the achieved. Against this backdrop, easing travel restrictions from virus-mutation countries not easy case to make. We try to find realistic solutions. We see and hear students' plights, who would not understand them? But also job of virologists and health experts to protect own citizens against next wave," he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-indians-travel-to-germany-south-korea-us-check-latest-visa-vaccine-rules-101624706050726.html

It demanded immediate restoration of the allowance.Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said the government should ensure that employees and pensioners receive the “actual real arrears”.The three instalments were due in January 2020, July 2020, and January 2021.Singhvi said the decision to cut the allowance until June 2021 would give the government only ₹38,000 crores at the cost of its employees, including armed forces personnel and pensioners.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has deducted ₹11,000 crore of the 15-lakh (1.5 million) serving armed forces personnel and nearly 26 lakh (2.6 million) military pensioners. What is their fault?”He said the cut was made retrospective in April. “But does not the government understand that people needed the money during the Covid-19 crisis?”He said the delay in the release of allowance is a reflection of the government’s “innate hypocrisy and double standards”. He said, on one hand, it talks about nationalism and on the other hand does not release the allowance and arrears of the employees serving the nation.He slammed the Central Vista project again. “They are cutting DA, but a penny would not cut from the Central Vista project budget or the bullet train budget because somebody’s ego is paramount.”Bhartiya Janata Party leader Gopal Agarwal said the government’s first priority is the welfare of the people. “The government will take an appropriate decision after considering all the aspects,” he said in response to the Congress demands.The Centre in March announced that central government employees and pensioners will receive full benefits of the allowance from July 1.

More data is required to comment on its virulence and probable antibody-escape characteristics, Dr Gangakhedkar said. On Saturday, Tamil Nadu reported the first death due to the Delta Plus variant o Covid-19 as a Madurai patient detected with the variant succumbed to the virus. At least 12 states in the country, including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, J&K, Haryana and Karnataka have reported this variant.The mutant alone may not prove to be very harmful, Dr Gangakhedkar said. "This mutant was also present in the variants found in South Africa. This particular mutation was also seen with a few other mutations. The most important mutation among them was N501y. Two together were able to evade the vaccine response and produce escape mutants but if K417N is alone, then it would not be so powerful to escape vaccine response," the scientist said.#WATCH | Raman Gangakhedkar, ex-Head Scientist of Epidemiology & communicable diseases, ICMR speaks on #DeltaPlusVariant.

26-06-2021||India||Military to go for indigenised clothing and equipment, time for gloves from Myanmar, rain bags from Sri Lanka over||The ministry of defence has a list of 209 items including cruise missiles, next generation corvettes, tank engines and towed artillery guns which have been placed under negative import list to boost Atmanirbhar Bharat programme of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Import restrictions on the second list of 108 items will progressively come into effect from December 2021 to December 2025. The first list of defence imports under negative category was issued in August 2020.While both the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) and Department of Defence (DOD) are on the same page as far as indigenisation is concerned, the fact remains is that Indian military still imports clothing and equipment from abroad despite a thriving textile industry in the country.The unsavoury truth is that Indian gloves for Siachen front is imported from a company in Myanmar, while the sleeping bags for the glacier are manufactured by a company in Sri Lanka. While a Kanpur based company is supplying military boots to Israeli army, the Indian Army is getting specialized boots made in Italy. The list goes on.During his tenure as secretary (defence production), the present defence secretary Ajay Kumar pushed for indigenisation of military clothing was back in 2018 but the Indian Army replied back with a long term indigenisation plan. Secretary Kumar told the military that since 100% FDI is allowed in defence sector, the companies from which the clothing and equipment was being imported should be asked to set up shop in India for impetus to the local textile and leather industry. He pushed for Indian shoe-makers for military as there was a thriving leather industry in Kanpur and Agra.With the military clothing now under department of military affairs (DMA), its secretary and present Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat is pushing for total indigenisation of clothing. In fact, recently the CDS visited a Bengaluru based clothing manufacturer to ask him whether he could supply sleeping bags, camouflage tents and jackets to the Indian military. The answer was that the qualitative and quantitative requirements of the military were designed in such a way that the Indian manufacturers found difficult to compete in an unfavourable environment. For instance, the heavy snow parkas were tested for being rain proof despite the fact that it never rains in Siachen Glacier with temperatures way below zero.“Even though military clothing budget would be between ₹200-400 crore for the Indian military, there is no reason for them to seek foreign manufacturers when the same quality is available with Indian textile manufacturers. Or, there is always an option of asking the company to set shop in India under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative,” said a senior defence ministry official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-military-to-go-for-indigenised-clothing-and-equipment-101624700078255.html

A more virulent version AY.1, also called Delta plus, is an offshoot of the Delta variant which has caused renewed concern about the capability to evade immunity built by vaccination or the previous infection.Ma Subramanian, minister for medical and family welfare of Tamil Nadu, on Saturday said that two of three identified cases of the new ‘Delta plus variant’ have recovered. The two recovered cases include a 32-year-old nurse from Chennai and another individual from the Kancheepuram district."After the death of the Madurai patient, the samples were collected, which confirmed that it was 'Delta plus' variant," Subramanian said.However, the patient's contacts have tested negative.Also Read | As Delta variant cases rise, WHO asks fully vaccinated to keep masks onAs of Friday, Maharashtra has reported maximum cases of Delta plus variant at 20, while nine people in Tamil Nadu tested positive for the new variant of concern. Nearly 30% of cases of Delta plus variant have been traced back to southern India in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.The concern over the Delta plus variant prompted the Union health ministry on Friday to direct seven chief secretaries to take immediate containment measures where cases of the Delta plus variant have been found. Tamil Nadu’s Madurai, Kanchipuram and Chennai have been asked to strengthen their response after the Delta Plus variant was found in those districts.Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to chief secretaries asking them to implement immediate containment measures and ensure proper adherence to Covid-19 measures. Based on data received from the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia, a forum set up by the health ministry to study and monitor genome sequencing of circulating virus strains, the Delta Plus variants have three main characteristics - increased transmissibility; stronger binding to receptors of lung cells; and potential reduction in monoclonal antibody response.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-reports-first-death-from-delta-plus-covid-variant-as-concern-grows-101624698944262.html
26-06-2021||India||'If you want elections in J&K...': Omar Abdullah says statehood has to be restored first||Former J&K chief minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah on Saturday said the political parties of J&K conveyed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah that they want the restoration of statehood to J&K to happen first. Any other timeline is not acceptable, Omar Abdullah said. "Azad sa'ab (Ghulam Nabi Azad) had spoken on behalf of all of us that we don't accept this timeline. We don't accept delimitation, election, statehood. We want delimitation, statehood and then the election. If you want to hold polls, you will have to restore statehood first," he said to ANI.Also Read: What J&K leaders said after meeting PM ModiAfter the cordial meeting between J&K leaders --- many of whom were imprisoned for a long time after August 2029 -- and PM Modi, People's Democratic Party leader Mehbooba Mufti said her party won't fight elections until Article 370 and 35A are restored.Echoing the same demand, the National Conference leader on Saturday said this is a demand of all the political parties in J&K. "Not only Mehbooba Mufti but Farooq sa'ab also said that it took 70 years for BJP to succeed in their agenda of abrogation of Article 370. We won't back off from our mission, even if it takes us 70 weeks or 70 months or more time," Omar Abdullah said.For the first time after the Union government scrapped Article 370 on August 5, 2019, and bifurcated the state into two Union territories, Jammu and Kashmir leaders were invited to Delhi for a meeting with PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah.Several issues, including elections, delimitation and the restoration of statehood, were discussed in the meeting. PM Modi and Amit Shah assured the J&K leaders that the Centre is committed to restoring statehood to J&K as the leaders conveyed to them that people were not happy. As PM Modi stressed bridging the gap between Dil (heart)/Dilli (Delhi) and J&K, he said delimitation has to happen at a quick pace so that elections can occur.After the meeting, now National Conference and People's Democratic Paty have raised question over the government's will to restore statehood to J&K. While Mehbooba Mufti said her party won't take part in elections if elections are held before J&K is given back its statehood, Omar Abdullah on Friday said it is foolish to expect the restoration of statehood from this government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-you-wan-elections-in-j-k-omar-abdullah-says-statehood-has-to-be-restored-first-101624695409542.html

They will be marking June 26 as "Save Agriculture, Save Democracy Day", reported news agency PTI.On the other hand, the Delhi Police has received inputs from intelligence agencies suggesting that the farmers' movement is likely to be sabotaged by Pakistan-based Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The officials have sent a letter to the police and the central armed forces, warning that ISI proxies based in Pakistan may try to sabotage the farmers' movement by instigating security personnel deployed at the site. Based on these inputs, the Delhi Police has beefed up security measures and deployed additional forces in and around reported sites of disturbance.The Chandigarh traffic police has also closed down as many as 13 entry and exit points in the city from 10am to 6pm as a precautionary measure.

26-06-2021||India||India records highest weekly vaccination with over 3.3 crore jabs administered in last 5 days||On June 21, India vaccinated over 80 lakh people beginning a new phase of the vaccination drive where the Centre provides free vaccines to states and Union territories depending on the population, the Covid-19 situation among other factors. The number of people India vaccinated on a single day (on June 21) was equivalent to Switzerland's population and was more than any of the Nordic countries. Now, as the week comes to an end, India breached all its past records of highest weekly vaccination as it administered over 3.3 crore doses between June 21 and June 26, Union health ministry data said. The earlier record was of 2.47 crore doses, administered in a week between April 3 and April 9.Maharashtra 1st state to cross 3 crore Covid vaccinationsMaharashtra on Friday became the first state to administer over 3 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses. Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, West Bengal are also between two crore and three crore doses.India's vaccination not fast enough to foil Covid-19 3rd wave: ReportWhat pushed the vaccination drive?On the occasion of International Yoga Day, which marked the beginning of this new phase of vaccination drive in India, several states organised mega vaccination camps, which pushed the figure on June 21 to over 80 lakh. Many politicians and experts have questioned the deliberate push and argued that the pace is not likely to be sustained in the days to come. From 80 lakh, the daily vaccination figure dropped to around 60 lakh, but still made the record of the highest weekly vaccination.What next? Private hospitals to joinThe government has said that the number of vaccination will actually go up as both Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India are ramping up their vaccine production aiming at a much larger production in July, August. Private hospitals too will start purchasing vaccines from the vaccine makers from its 25 per cent quota.December deadline: ChallengesThe government earlier said it will vaccinate the entire population by December 2021. According to experts, vaccine hesitance in rural areas and any shortage in the supply may throw a challenge in the way of this deadline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-highest-weekly-vaccination-with-over-3-3-crore-jabs-administered-in-last-5-days-101624691835640.html
26-06-2021||India||‘Drug abuse, trafficking increased manyfold since 2020’: NCB||Of late, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, drug abuse and trafficking increased manyfold since 2020 and this is evident from the activities by various drug enforcement agencies, especially by the NCB Patna zonal unit, Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) zonal director (Bihar and Jharkhand) Kumar Manish said on Friday. “We will continue to speed up our operations against drug traffickers and drug cartels to save people, especially youth from the drug menace,” Manish said. Putting up a united fight against the drug menace, Manish said the bureau is working on a ‘proactive’ approach to weed out drug abuse and illicit trafficking from Bihar and Jharkhand. On the occasion of International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, Manish said that the day is observed annually on June 26 to raise awareness about the problems that illicit drugs pose to society as well as strengthen global action and cooperation to achieve the goal of a drug-free society. Drug abuse and mental health go hand in hand. The people who are under harmful addictions are not only putting their physical health at stake but can also suffer severe mental issues, he said. This year’s theme for the day is ‘Share facts on drugs, save lives’, set by the United Nations for combating misinformation and encouraging the exchange of drug facts. With better and real-time sharing of intelligence, the NCB and other drugs law enforcement agency like the DRI, customs and Bihar Police have been successful in curbing drug peddling. The NCB also released data showing an increase in the seizure of drugs in the state over the last few years. As per the data, the NCB seized 12.3 kg ganja, 1.9 kg opium and 2.02 kg charas in 2015 and 496.5 kg ganja, 8.18 kg opium and 31.5 kg charas in 2016. The figures jumped to 14.8 tonnes of ganja, 5.45 kg opium and 114.05 kg of charas in 2017 and 6.4 tonnes of ganja, 5.5 kg opium and 212.83 kg charas in 2018, respectively. In 2019, the NCB seized 6.67 tonnes of ganja, 7.5 kg opium and 33.3 kg charas while in 2020, 4.89 tonnes of ganja, 15 kg opium and 103.9 kg charas were seized in Bihar.This year, with six months still to go, the NCB has already seized 4.82 tonnes of ganja, 5.25 kg opium, Morphine 0.710 and 48.8 kg charas. “Seizure of increased drugs, especially ganja, also reflects effective crackdown by the law enforcement agencies. Liquor addicts also shifted towards drug abuse after prohibition in 2016,” said Manish. This year’s awareness drive in rural areas of Bihar has been undertaken by Husk Power Systems, a global rural clean energy services company. Many eminent personalities of Bihar, particularly from Bollywood, Bhojpuri and regional film and entertainment industry, such as Pankaj Tripathi, Sanjay Kumar Mishra, among others, have come forward and participated in the awareness campaign by giving video messages on social media platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drug-abuse-trafficking-increased-manyfold-since-2020-ncb-101624692119245.html
26-06-2021||India||How an AR Rahman song got IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad blocked from Twitter||Twitter on Friday blocked Union information technology (IT) minister Ravi Shankar Prasad's account for nearly an hour over alleged violations of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) amid the social media network's deteriorating ties with the central government in the context of the new IT rules in the country. However, the exact reason behind the microblogging website briefly denying the Union minister his account may seem incredulous to many: a 2017 tweet related to music director AR Rahman's famous song 'Maa Tujhe Salaam', which was found in violation of Twitter's copyright policy.The DMCA notice, related to AR Rahman's song 'Maa Tujhe Salaam', was sent by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) on behalf of Sony Music Entertainment back on May 24, according to the Lumen database. It was only received by Twitter on June 25, following which the social media platform took action, as per the document.Lumen database is an independent research project studying cease and desist letters concerning online content, and requests received by Twitter for withholding content are published on its site.The 2017 tweet, posted from Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad's official handle, consisted of a tribute video to the Indian Army, where the AR Rahman's song was used in the background. It was posted on the anniversary of the 1971 war victory, said people familiar with the development.Twitter briefly blocking Ravi Shankar Prasad's account was the first instance of a Union minister being blocked from a social media network in India. The platform later restored access to the account and said that the action was taken on the basis of a DMCA notice and that the referenced tweet has been "withheld". "Per our copyright policy, we respond to valid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorised representatives," it said.Under the DMCA copyright, owners can notify Twitter claiming that a user has infringed their copyrighted works.However, the IT minister condemned the incident and said that Twitter was only displaying its own brazen arbitrariness and running its "own agenda". The ministry claimed that Twitter is only taking these measures because the government has been asking it to strictly comply with the country's new IT rules.Earlier this month, Twitter lost its intermediary status in India -- meaning the social media network can directly be sued under the country's laws for posts on the platform -- for refusing to comply with the IT rules. According to Ravi Shankar Prasad, the government calling out Twitter's act has "clearly ruffled its feathers".(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-an-ar-rahman-song-got-it-minister-ravi-shankar-prasad-blocked-from-twitter-101624687512421.html

Centre explains||A third wave of Covid-19 in Maharashtra could infect 50 lakh people and 10 per cent of it -- 5 lakh -- could be children, while the active cases in the state may reach eight lakh at its peak. These are the probabilities the government has discussed with its experts and task force and in the cabinet meeting, before the government decided to bring back some of the restrictions to the state, partly reversing the unlocking process."About five lakh children may be infected, of which 2.5 lakh may need admission in government hospitals. All these possibilities were discussed during this week's cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray," Maharashtra food and drug minister Rajendra Shingne said, as reported by news agency PTI.Why Maharashtra is at greater riskHealth ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal on Friday explained that Maharashtra may be at greater risk from the 3rd wave and that's why the state was already alerted. "When a virus replicates, some mutations aid to the virus' additional survival. When there are many cases, the virus may get more scope to get replicated," Lav Agarwal said, adding that waves are less of a concern now. "That we have allowed the waves to aggravate by our negligent behaviour is more of a concern," Agarwal said.Districts of concern in MaharashtraDirector-General of the Indian Council of Medical Research Dr Balram Bhargava on Friday said some districts in Maharashtra still have over 5 per cent positivity rate, which is concerning. The districts include Raigad, Sangli, Sindhudurg, Satara, Pune, Ratnagiri, Kohlapur, Palghar, Osamanabad. "This is a good step that the state has brought back restrictions in Maharashtra," Dr Bhargava said.Delta Plus in MaharashtraThe first Delta Plus variant in India was detected from a sample in Maharashtra in April, which proves that the variant has been there for quite some time. Now, the state has the highest number of Delta Plus cases and an 80-year-old woman, detected with Delta Plus, succumbed to Covid on Friday, recording the first death from Delta Plus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-3rd-wave-why-is-maharashtra-at-greater-risk-from-delta-plus-centre-explains-101624684705808.html

In his letter, Adhikari demanded central agencies to investigate the alleged fraud. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader began the letter by taking potshots at the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government. He said that "due to lack of enthusiasm" from the present state government, West Bengal is "failing to catch up" in the vaccination drive."In certain places, political affiliation is also being looked into by the ruling party before allowing the vaccines to be administered to eligible priority population even," Suvendu Adhikari added in the letter. "Vaccination coupons are also being reportedly issued by the ruling party like a voter slip," he also claimed.Speaking on the alleged fake vaccination camps, Adhikari said the fraud can not take place without the "complicity of top civic authorities." He also questioned the pilferage of Covid-19 vaccines from the government stock."The big question is - Were these shots really Covishield vaccines as being claimed by the accused? If so, then this raises a big question on pilferage of Covid vaccines from government stock and this cannot happen without complicity of top civic authorities," Adhikari stated. "If these were not Covid vaccines, then immediate investigation needs to be done as to what was being administered at such a large scale?" he also wrote.He further emphasised that if people who thought to have been vaccinated died from this medicine or contracted Covid-19 and died from the disease, it would "severely dent the credibility of this historic vaccination drive" being undertaken by your government."A thorough investigation needs to be done, prioritising public health and safety," Adhikari demanded.Kolkata Police on Friday arrested Debanjan Deb, who was pretending to be an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, for duping thousands of people of lakhs of rupees on the pretext of helping them get tenders of the civic body. It is alleged that Deb used the money to organise fake Covid-19 vaccination camps, pay salary to his employees and rent for the office.According to a PTI report, Deb was impersonating as a joint commissioner of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC), while lying to his family about being an IAS officer.As the case came to light, Trinamool Congress lawmaker Dr Santanu Sen said strict action will be taken against Deb. Sen who is also the Indian Medical Association’s West Bengal secretary said that the incident was part of an organised crime and Kolkata Police are investigating the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-vaccine-fraud-bjp-s-suvendu-adhikari-demands-immediate-probe-101624684502208.html
26-06-2021||India||Fearing Covid-19, Indian woman kills minor daughter in UK||A 36-year-old Indian woman in the UK has pleaded guilty to manslaughter by diminished responsibility after she admitted killing her five-year-old daughter at their home because she was terrified of dying from Covid-19 and thought the little girl could not live without her, according to a media report.Sutha Sivanantham stabbed her daughter Sayagi in the bedroom of their south London flat 15 times before severely injuring herself on June 30 last year, the Metro.co.uk reported.Her husband said she had been 'petrified' about catching the virus and the lockdown restrictions may have 'pushed her over the edge,' the report added.Appearing at the Old Bailey on Thursday, Sivanantham denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and will be kept in hospital indefinitely.Sivanantham, who had been living in the UK since 2006 after an arranged marriage, complained of mystery ailments for almost a year before the tragedy.She developed a 'morbid concern' she was seriously ill and had become convinced she was going to die, prosecutors said.On the day of the attack, she begged her husband not to go to work and called friends to tell them she was unwell.At around 4 pm neighbours went to the flat in Monarch Parade, Mitcham, and found Sivanantham with stab wounds to her abdomen.Sayagi, who was lying on the bed, had been stabbed several times in the neck, chest and abdomen.Sutha was also found to have suffered self-inflicted stab injuries and was taken to hospital, where she remained for more than two months receiving treatment before being discharged into police custody.Sainsbury’s worker Suganthan Sivanantham was called at the supermarket to be told that his wife had killed their daughter at their home, the report said.He sobbed loudly in the dock as his impact statement was read to the court.It said: ‘I get very emotional having to relive what has happened to my daughter and my wife.’He said before the killing the family had lived a ‘happy fulfilling and blissful life.’ Since then he has had to give up work and ‘each day is a struggle.'Sivanantham said he has not spoken to his wife but accepts she was not responsible for her actions.‘I know that if she was well she would not have been able to kill our daughter,’ he said.One psychiatrist who has treated Sivanantham found that the social isolation and stress caused by the Covid-19 lockdown contributed to her serious mental illness.She was sent to be treated in hospital under sections 37 and 41 of the Mental Health Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fearing-covid-19-indian-woman-kills-minor-daughter-in-uk-101624683872318.html
26-06-2021||India||Ahmedabad, Pune among 9 cities to get 4-star rating for climate initiatives||Nine Indian cities have taken significant measures to mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis and inculcated a climate-sensitive approach to urban planning, according to the cities’ readiness report on Climate-Smart Cities Assessment Framework (CSCAF) released by the ministry of housing and urban affairs (HUA) on Friday.Ahmedabad, Indore, Pimpri Chinchwad, Vadodara, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Pune, Rajkot, and Surat were adjudged top performers among 126 cities that participated in the second edition of the assessment launched in September.Kunal Kumar, joint secretary and mission director of Smart Cities Mission, HUA, said, “The CS (Climate-Smart) is a unique national framework that covers almost every aspect that impacts climate in the cities. Water management, mobility (especially increasing public transport), green buildings, and urban planning are areas where there are lacunas that need to be improved. The good things about this assessment framework help in improving all these indicators in an integrated manner. Now, cities have a real-time dashboard on how they are performing on climate aspect, which will help them in better planning.”While cities are facing infrastructure challenges and environmental degradation due to rapid urbanisation, they are also struggling to tackle extreme events such as flooding, heatwaves, and cyclones. India was the seventh most affected by the devastating impact of climate crisis globally in 2019, according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2021.A ministry official said CSCAF is aimed at providing a roadmap for Indian cities towards mainstreaming climate action in their policies and development plans. The Coronavirus pandemic has further highlighted the need to prepare cities for climate, environmental, and public health risks.The cities were assessed on five key themes (with 28 indicators): urban planning, green cover and biodiversity, energy and green buildings; mobility and air quality, water management, and waste management. The performance was rated on five levels (1 to 5 stars).Kumar said the assessment is only ranking cities based on their performance, “In the times to come, we plan to move towards outcome-based funding….Cities that improve their ranking will get more funds. We incentivize improvement of ranking for cities in the framework.”In urban planning and waste management themes, some cities have shown positive impact and were given 5 stars in performance level. But in mobility and air quality, water and energy themes, no city got 5 stars, indicating that a lot of work needs to be done before results are visible on the ground.As per the report, 43 smart cities in India are facing poor air quality that poses serious health concerns. To address the issues of air pollution and water-related problems in cities, increasing the green cover, rejuvenation of water bodies, encouraging the use of public transport and non-motorized vehicles, etc are essential.Indore, Surat, and Visakhapatnam were adjudged top performers in the urban planning, green cover, and biodiversity theme, as they have taken concrete steps not only in planning but also in making budgetary provisions, ensuring implementation on the ground, and setting up monitoring and review mechanisms. Of the 126 cities, 65 cities, including Thane, Pune, Agra, Coimbatore, etc meet the norms for 12-18% green cover.While a large number of cities have taken initiatives for the rejuvenation of water bodies and increasing the green cover, not much has been done in mainstreaming and addressing the climate crisis by making provisions in urban development policies. As per the report, 96 out of 126 cities are yet to form climate coordination cells within the local bodies. Surat, Rajkot, and Udaipur are among the nine cities that have prepared CCAP.To improve the air quality in cities, the Centre has pushed for encouraging the use of public and non-motorised transport to reduce air pollution.One of the key indicators to assess mobility and air quality is the development of non-motorised transport networks. As per the report, a large number of cities have done little in this regard. During the pandemic, several cities reported a sharp rise in bicycle sales, indicating people’s willingness to use non-motorised transport.Various studies have shown that close to 74% of people walk or rely on non-motorised transport for at least part of their daily commute. But most cities don’t have proper infrastructure for pedestrians and non-motorised transport. As per the report, 94 cities have less than 15% of road network with non-motorised transport infrastructure, while just six cities namely Kalyan Dombivali, Mysore, Naya Raipur, Ranchi etc have 50% or more.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning, School of Planning and Architecture, said, “It is easier for cities to develop NMT (non-motorised transport) infrastructure in greenfield developments. To address issues related to air pollution due to transport, there is a need to increase public transport and develop NMT infrastructure. But in most cities, we have to do retrofitting. There is a need to provide assistance to cities to develop the infrastructure.”Of the 126 cities, including 100 smart cities, 44 cities are yet to initiate regular monitoring of air quality. Amaravathi, Bilaspur, Mangalore, Nashik, Pimpri Chinchwad, Rajkot, and Vijayawada are the cities that have achieved the National Air Quality standard in all the four main pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NOx, SOx).Only Pune has managed to progress beyond implementing the identified actions under Clean Air Action Plan (planning and monitoring) indicator for air quality and has documented the impact, as per the report.The Delhi government’s Electric Vehicle Policy is an example of efforts made by cities in addressing mobility and air quality concerns. The national capital’s performance on various parameters was judged largely based on information provided by the New Delhi Municipal Council, which is part of the smart cities’ mission.Officials said that in some categories, overall data available in the public domain was considered.While the national capital was given a five-star rating in waste management (which was assessed based on the performance of Swachh Survekshan 2020), the city got a three-star rating in mobility and air quality, energy, and green buildings and urban planning, green cover and biodiversity themes.Water management is one area where a large number of cities have to do a considerable amount of work. Ahmedabad, Surat, and Vijayawada are the only three cities that have considered the climate change aspect in water management and are in the process of implementing it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahmedabad-pune-among-9-cities-to-get-4-star-rating-for-climate-sensitive-initiatives-101624681018279.html

26-06-2021||India||Delta Plus cases now in 12 states, Maharashtra has maximum: Govt||Delta Plus variant of the coronavirus has spread to 12 states in the country, with Maharashtra reporting the highest number of cases at 22, the Centre said on Friday. The government said there are now 51 cases of Delta Plus, emphasising their number is very limited and it cannot be said that it is showing an upward trend.Sujeet Singh, the director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), said there is a very limited number of cases of the Delta Plus mutation. There are 22 cases of Delta Plus variant of the coronavirus in Maharashtra, followed by nine in Tamil Nadu, seven in Madhya Pradesh, three in Kerala, two each in Punjab and Gujarat, and one case each in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Karnataka, Singh added."There are nearly 50 cases that are found in 12 districts and this has happened in the last three months. It cannot be said that in any district or state it is showing an increasing trend. Till the time we don't correlate this we will not say this is a rising trend because its mutations are the same as Delta variant," Singh said during a health ministry briefing on Friday.Also read | Testing vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 Delta+ variant: CentreThese 51 Delta Plus cases were detected from over 45,000 samples sequenced so far in the country. Singh said the Delta Plus variant signifies the Delta variant with an additional mutation - B.1.617.2.1. This specifically refers to the acquisition of the K417N genetic variant in the background of Variant of Concern (VoC) Delta (B.1.617.2) and that K417N is of public significance as this mutation is also present in the Variant of Concern Beta (B.1.351), he added."This does not mean...that severity of transmission is more or lead to more severe disease. If scientific evidence does (suggest) that then we will definitely let you know," he said adding that since the Delta variant is already a Variant of Concern, its sub-lineage can also be called a VoC.Singh said Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Telangana and West Bengal have Delta variant in more than 50 per cent of the samples sequenced.Also read | Delta Plus variant: Health ministry writes to 8 states, alerts 10 districts"After that, we came to a conclusion that exponential surge during the second wave was to a large extent driven by this variant.

The revised deadline is now September 30, changed from June 30, Anurag Thakur, Union minister of state for finance announced on Friday.This is the third time that the government has revised the last date for linking the Aadhaar and PAN documents. Earlier, the last date was set as March 31 and it was then extended to June 30. Now the government has extended the deadline once again to provide relief to taxpayers amid the pandemic.Aadhaar is the Unique Identity number of the 12-digit number and is issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India or UIDAI. It is one of the most significant identification document for Indian citizens. Whereas, PAN is a 10-digit alphanumeric number and is allotted by the Income Tax department. A PAN card is needed for completing finance-related work.In case one fails to link both of the documents, the PAN card will become 'inoperative' and a penalty of ₹1,000 will be levied. Linking PAN with Aadhaar can be done digitally in just a few minutes.Here's how to link the Aadhaar with PAN:Through SMS> In order to link the PAN with the Aadhaar number, type a message UIDPAN<space><12 digit Aadhaar><space><10 digit PAN>.

26-06-2021||India||Farmers' protest may be sabotaged by Pakistan's ISI, alerts intel report||The ongoing farmers' protest around Delhi's borders, which is now ongoing for seven months, is likely to be sabotaged by Pakistan-based Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), reported news agency ANI on Saturday, citing alerts issued by intelligence agencies. According to the report, officials have alerted the Delhi Police and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) regarding the potential threat to the farmers' stir.Also Read | Farmers to protest on June 26 to mark 7 months of their stirThe officials have sent a letter to the police and the central armed forces, warning that ISI proxies based in Pakistan may try to sabotage the farmers' movement by instigating security personnel deployed at the site, ANI reported. To this end, the news agency said that the Delhi Police have tightened security measures and taken "adequate arrangements". Additional manpower will also be deployed outside Metro stations, the police said.Moreover, as a precautionary measure, three Delhi Metro stations will remain shut from 10am to 2pm on Saturday. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) reportedly took the step on the advice of the Delhi Police, in view of the potential threat to security.There were isolated reports of disturbances across protest sites over the past few weeks, as the police blamed the farmers. The protesters, in turn, said that their movement has been largely peaceful, yet the police used force to disperse them. Protesting farmers have also been opposing the public functions of BJP-JJP leaders in Haryana over the farm laws.Also Read | We don’t engage in violence: Rakesh Tikait defends protesting farmers after Delhi Police’s complaintThe Delhi Police alleged earlier this month that several protesters assaulted two of its special branch officers at the Singhu Border who were at the site for ground analysis. An FIR against unknown protestors was also lodged at the Narela police station. Decrying the allegations, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait had said that the intention of the police and government is to instigate farmers. Earlier, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Yogendra Yadav, too, said that the government has failed to address the grievances of farmers and it is trying to break the farm stir by using different tools.Yadav said Union agriculture minister Narendra Tomar claimed that he is just one call away from the farmers to discuss their issue but the protesters are yet to get his call.Farmers across the nation are slated to hold a protest march on Saturday, June 26, to mark the completion of seven months of their agitation against the central government's three farm laws. The farmers' protest, which has yet to make a breakthrough, has been consistent with its single-minded demand to repeal the three farm laws, even though seven have passed since the movement began. They have demanded that the three laws -- the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops.Meanwhile, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday urged all farmers' unions to conclude their agitation against the government, insisting, once again, that the farm reforms will better their lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-may-be-sabotaged-by-pakistan-s-isi-alerts-intel-report-101624670135184.html

All the mission objectives were met during the launches. The ministry of defence in a statement that the enhanced range version of the Pinaka Rocket System can destroy targets at distances up to 45km.News agency PTI cited an official as saying that the development of the enhanced Pinaka system was taken up to achieve longer range performance. All the flight articles were tracked by various range instruments in order to check the accuracy of the rockets hitting the target.Also watch: Indian Pinaka rocket's enhanced version successfully test-fired by DRDOFour enhanced range version of 122mm Caliber rockets, developed for the Indian Army and which can destroy targets up to 40km, were also test-fired with full instrumentation and they too met all mission objectives. This enhanced rocket system would replace the existing 122mm Grad rockets.Defence minister Rajnath Singh has congratulated DRDO and the industry on the successful launch of the enhanced Pinaka rockets and 122mm Caliber rockets.The rocket system has been developed jointly by Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE) in Pune and High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL) with manufacturing support from M/s Economic Explosives Limited in Nagpur.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-successfully-test-fires-pinaka-rockets-can-destroy-targets-up-to-45km-101624664939787.html
26-06-2021||India||Third wave unlikely to be as severe as second: ICMR study||The third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic may not be as severe as the second wave, and scaling up the vaccination drive may help mitigate it, says a study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research in collaboration with Imperial College of London.The study, based on mathematical modelling analysis, shows that the new variant is unlikely to cause a new wave unless it leads to a complete loss of immune protection from a previous infection. A more transmissible variant would have to cross the reproduction number threshold of 4.5 to cause a third wave, said the study.“Rapid scale-up of vaccination efforts could play an important role in mitigating these and future waves of the disease,” the study added.“This study demonstrates plausible mechanisms by which a substantial third wave could occur, while also illustrating that it is unlikely for any such resurgence to be as large as the second wave. Model projections are, however, subject to several uncertainties, and it remains important to scale up vaccination coverage...” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-wave-unlikely-to-be-as-severe-as-second-icmr-study-101624662186011.html

26-06-2021||India||At least two members of Delhi O2 audit panel did not sign off on findings||Two members of a Supreme Court-appointed panel looking into Delhi’s oxygen situation during the last wave of Covid-19 expressed crucial objections when an interim report, in which the panel appeared to suggest that officials in the Capital had inflated the need for medical oxygen, was being drafted.According to documents seen by HT, these two members — Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, clinical director, Max Healthcare, and Bhupinder S Bhalla, principal secretary (home), Delhi government — said that they were not in agreement with some key findings of the report, which suggested that the state government had grossly overstated its medical oxygen requirements during the second wave of the pandemic.One of them, Bhalla, in an internal note on Friday, expressed dismay that the report was submitted to the Supreme Court, and wrote that his objections and corrections were not inserted, and that the report “does not have the approval of all the members of the subgroup”. The data on LMO (liquid medical oxygen) consumption, Bhalla said, was a mere collation from hospitals and “was not claimed by government of NCT of Delhi”. His reference was to the 1,140MT that the panel contended the Delhi government listed as the city’s consumption.In annexures attached with the report, too, Bhalla had, in a letter dated May 31, expressed displeasure at the “manner in which the proceedings of the subgroup were conducted” and alleged that it was trying to justify “preconceived and predetermined conclusions”.The other member, Dr Budhiraja, also sought changes and additions in the interim draft report, and wanted the quantity of allocation of medical oxygen to be made to Delhi to be left to the oxygen commissioner. In a letter in response to the interim draft report, he also pointed out that the minutes of the May 15 meeting were not shared for approval, leading to his not attending a crucial meeting on May 18.The panel is a subgroup headed by AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria. Its other members are Dr Budhiraja, Bhalla, Subodh Yadav, a joint secretary in the Jal Shakti ministry, and Sanjay Kumar Singh, the controller of explosives at the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO). It met seven times between May 11 and May 21.The official and internal documents made it unclear if the report was meant to be submitted to the court in this form -- particularly since the next date of hearing in the matter has not been set by the Supreme Court -- and if it had been approved by all the members.The copy of the interim report presented to the Supreme Court also did not carry signatures of the panel members, which is a routine practice.None of the members of the panel were available for comment despite several attempts to reach them.“The detailed objections/comments of the undersigned have been added at the end of the Interim Report (pages 110-119) just for posterity, leaving it to the reader to make the effort, if he/she so decides, to interpret the entire report together and make his/her conclusions,” Bhalla said in the internal statement on Friday.“The interim report seems to have been sent to Government of India without making the requisite changes, without sharing again with the members of the subgroup, and without their formal approval,” he added.Bhalla’s statement suggested that several corrections made during the deliberation as to demand and consumption of oxygen in Delhi did not reflect in the interim report despite his insisting categorically to revise the draft report to present a clear picture.The letters sent last month by Bhalla and Budhiraja to the panel have been attached as separate documents at the bottom of the interim report submitted in the apex court.On May 31, Bhalla wrote to the subgroup that the entire proceedings of the panel were “vitiated” since it had transgressed into jurisdiction of the 12-member national task force appointed by the top court for the purpose of revisiting the oxygen allocation formula for each state.“The manner, in which the proceedings of the subgroup have been conducted, suggests that the purpose of proceeding was to justify a preconceived and predetermined conclusion and narrative to recommend a lower quantity of oxygen to Delhi and to further portray an impression that the assessment by the Delhi government before the Delhi high court and the Supreme Court was exaggerated and not genuine,” he said in the letter.The other member, Dr Budhiraja, maintained in his letter that the actual requirement of oxygen had come to around 490MT per day when the calculation did not take into account oxygen cylinder refilling and non-Covid requirement of hospitals.These facts have not been mentioned in the interim report submitted to the court. Instead, the report has recorded a finding that 400 MT per day (and not 490 MT as Budhiraja claims to be the actual requirement for Delhi) was adequate for the national capital.The report was submitted to the court through the Union health ministry. An official, who asked not to be named, said the ministry had no role to play in the findings, and it only acted as a “messenger”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-least-two-members-of-o2-audit-panel-did-not-sign-off-on-findings-101624651075873.html
26-06-2021||India||Opposition’s Congress dilemma ahead of 2024||The latest assembly election cycle that included the states of Assam, West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu coincided with two years of the second Narendra Modi government at the Centre.The results have thrown an interesting challenge to the Opposition in the country. It has realised that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) can be defeated, even when it seems to have an edge.The All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) bounced back from a position of perceived weakness in West Bengal. However, the Congress seems incapable of delivering on this task at present. The Assam results are a case in point.What is even worse for the Congress is the fact that its vulnerabilities go beyond fights against the BJP.The Congress’s Kerala defeat defying a four-decade trend is a proof of this. To be sure, the next general elections are still three years away. However, if the meeting of opposition leaders at Sharad Pawar’s residence in Delhi – Aam Aadmi Party, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), All India Trinamool Congress and Samajwadi Party attended, the Congress did not – is any indication, the opposition camp is already trying to build a strategy for 2024.Any such strategy, as was obvious in the initiative at Pawar’s residence, will have to grapple with the question of what to do with the Congress.Here are five charts that explain this -1) Congress has been the weak link in the BJP’s rise since 2014In 2014, the BJP became the first party to get a majority in the Lok Sabha since 1984. It replicated this feat, with an increased majority, in 2019. An HT analysis of the Trivedi Centre for Political Data (TCPD) database shows that the Congress’s weak performance has played a major role in this.The BJP won 282 and 303 Lok Sabha seats in 2014 and 2019; 166 and 175 of these were in constituencies where the Congress was the runner-up. The Congress’s tally was just 44 and 52 in 2014 and 2019.While its seat tally improved marginally between 2014 and 2019, its performance against the BJP went down. In 2014, the Congress defeated the BJP to win 23 Lok Sabha segments. This number came down to just 15 in 2019.The fact that more than half of the BJP’s seats have come in direct contests against the Congress and the latter is increasingly finding it difficult to challenge the BJP is the biggest challenge before the anti-BJP opposition in India. To be sure, the BJP has always had an edge vis-a-vis the Congress except in 2009. But the gap is much bigger today.2) To purge or protect Congress is the questionAn all-in-unity national tactic in politics, especially in a parliamentary federal polity in India, is easier said than done. The biggest reason for this is a mismatch in national and regional political aspirations. This dilemma is the biggest when dealing with the Congress.As a hegemonic party of the bygone days, it has roots in almost every region of the country. But that does not necessarily translate into current strength. Some of the erosion or perhaps atrophying of the Congress has been recent.Andhra Pradesh, a state which played a strategic role in the Congress’s 2004 and 2009 victories, is one such example. West Bengal, where the Congress has drawn a blank in the latest assembly elections, is another. Maharashtra, where the local Congress leadership is posturing to walk out of the current post-poll alliance with the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) will be a major dilemma, unless of course, the Sena itself goes back to the BJP.The Samajwadi Party (SP) seems to have decided against allying with the Congress in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. There were many rounds of fruitless negotiations between the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) about an alliance in Delhi and Haryana before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.The AAP is now making efforts to expand into Gujarat, which will go to the polls in 2022, and where the Congress is the major opposition party.This challenge is best seen in a comparison of Congress strike rates with those of other partners in the seven assembly elections it has contested in alliance in states after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.The Congress’s strike rate has been lower than that of allies in all states except Tamil Nadu. That the Congress has lost state governments such as Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh and MLAs ahead of crucial Rajya Sabha polls in many other states to the BJP’s manoeuvres and is facing intense factionalism in states such as Punjab and Rajasthan only increases its liability quotient in any strategy to counter the BJP.3) Congress does not even bring the resource cushion anymoreAn overwhelming majority of Indian voters are anything but rich. An HT analysis had looked at this question in detail. It looked at data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) and found that out of 356 million workers in India, 90 million were salaried (the best of the lot). According to the 2018-19 PLFS, average monthly wages for even the top 10% of salaried workers in India were below ?50,000. Even for the top 5%, this number is ?61,334; 80% of salaried workers do not even earn more than ?20,000 per month, the data shows. However, Indian elections are among the most expensive in the world. A Bloomberg Quint report based on a study from the Centre for Media Studies estimated that around ?55,000 crore was spent on the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, making it the most expensive election in the world. While money is no guarantee of winning elections in India, it definitely helps.Historically, the Congress has been a resource-rich party and allying with it provided a financial cushion to the smaller regional players. With the BJP surging far ahead of the Congress in terms of financial resources, even that advantage is not significant anymore.4) The Congress needs to reinvent its politicsTo be sure, the Congress’s resource and organisation problems, especially the latter, are also a result of its overall political crisis, which is making it difficult for the party to accommodate political ambitions of individual leaders. This only increases the importance of strategising to revive the party’s political fortunes. The Congress has been experimenting with unconventional tactics. Its alliance with the All-India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) in Assam elections is one such example. However, the move seems to have backfired politically, as can be seen in a decline in support from Hindus, both Assamese and Bengali speaking, between the 2016 and 2021 elections in the state. Winning back the Hindu vote is crucial to reviving the Congress’s fortunes, and unless the leadership figures out a way to do that, the party will continue to face an existential challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppositions-congress-dilemma-ahead-of-2024-101624649874127.html

The 45-year-old chief of the Raijor Dal, a political party that he founded while in custody, was arrested in December 2019 for his alleged role in the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests.Gogoi had asked the court for permission to meet his family and constituents who elected him to the assembly last month. The judge granted parole for 48 hours but barred him from meeting the public.“The court granted him permission to visit his son in Guwahati and his mother in Jorhat. We had sought permission as Gogoi’s son, who is 14 years old, had contracted Covid-19 and his mother hasn’t been keeping well. His son has recovered now,” said Gogoi’s lawyer Shantanu Borthakur. A police team escorted Gogoi, who is at present lodged in Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH), and will bring him back after the visit. He, however, will not be able to meet his constituents.Since Gogoi was under custody, his mother Priyada, 84, had played a crucial role in his victory from the Sibsagar seat in this year’s assembly polls. Despite her age and ailments, she campaigned relentlessly for her son resulting in a victory for Gogoi without ever visiting his constituency. Last month, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) court granted him permission to take oath in the state assembly as the newly elected legislator from Sibsagar. The NIA probed two cases against Gogoi in connection with the anti-CAA protests. One was related to Chabua police station in Dibrugarh and the second, relates to Chandmari in Guwahati. The NIA invoked provisions of the anti-terror law, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act against him.He was discharged in the Chabua case on Tuesday. The second case is yet to be decided by the court.Gogoi was granted bail in connection with the Chabua case by the NIA court in October last year. But the investigation agency approached the Gauhati high court challenging the bail order. In April this year, the Gauhati HC held the NIA court was right in granting bail to Gogoi and dismissed the appeal by the investigating agency. He, however, was not released because of the second case in which he was not granted bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/akhil-gogoi-in-jail-for-18-months-gets-2-day-parole-to-meet-mother-and-son-101624648917525.html
26-06-2021||India||Custodial death of Dalit woman: KCR orders DGP to probe case, dismiss guilty officials||Hyderabad Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday ordered, after due inquiry, the dismissal of the police personnel responsible for the custodial death of 40-year old Dalit woman identified as Ambadipudi Mariyamma at Addaguduru police station in Yadadri Bhongir district on June 18. The decision comes while the chief minister was responding to a representation given by a delegation of Congress MLAs at his camp office Pragathi Bhavan in the evening. This is for the first time after taking over as the chief minister of Telangana in 2014 that KCR had given an appointment to Congress MLAs. He asked Director General of Police (DGP) M Mahender Reddy to personally inquire into the issue and take stringent action against the erring police officials – sub-inspector of police Mahesh and constables Raheed and Janaiah who are already under suspension. “After due inquiry, dismiss them from service as per the procedure,” KCR directed the DGP. The DGP will now will visit the victim’s place to conduct an inquiry.The chief minister also announced an ex gratia of ₹15 lakh to Mariyamma’s son Uday Kiran and ₹10 lakh to each of her two daughters. He also offered a government job to Uday Kiran, besides a residential house. He asked chief secretary Somesh Kumar to implement the decisions at the earliest. Mariyamma, who hailed from Chintakani village of Madhira block in Khammam district, was working as a domestic help at the residence of a church priest Father Balashouri at Govindapuram village of Addaguduru block in Yadadri Bhongir district. On June 15, Balashouri lodged a complaint with the police alleging that Mariyamma had stolen ₹2 lakh from his house. The police arrested Mariyamma, her son and his friend Shiva from their village in Khammam on June 17 and she died in the police custody the following morning. The custodial death of Mariyamma triggered an uproar in the state in the last one week with the Dalit organisations, civil liberties activists and the opposition parties raising hue and cry. Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee SC Cell chairman N Preetham alleged that Mariyamma had died because of torture by the police and that her son Uday and his friend Shiva were also beaten up in the police custody. The police, however, said Mariyamma had lost consciousness while she was being taken to the police station on June 18 and when she was taken to Bhongir hospital, the doctors declared her brought dead. On Tuesday, Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh Bhagawat admitted that preliminary inquiry had confirmed that Mariyamma had died while she was in police custody and that the erring SI and two constables were suspended. Meanwhile, the state high court on Thursday, acting on a public interest litigation petition filed by People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL) ordered a second post mortem examination, if necessary, apart from a judicial inquiry. The case was adjourned to June 28. With the custodial death of Mariaymma snowballing into a major controversy, the chief minister called the Congress delegation on Friday evening to discuss the issue. He assured that the government would take stringent action against the police officials responsible for the incident. He asked transport minister P Ajay Kumar, MP Nama Nageshwar Rao and district officials to accompany Congress legislature party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka to the victim’s family in Khammam and extend the financial assistance. Earlier in the afternoon, the Congress delegation met Governor Tamilisai Soudrarajan at Raj Bhavan and submitted a similar representation seeking appropriate action in the lock-up death case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/custodial-death-of-dalit-woman-kcr-orders-dgp-to-probe-case-dismiss-guilty-officials-101624648135632.html
26-06-2021||India||9 cities took key steps to curb climate crisis: Study||Nine Indian cities have taken significant measures to mitigate climate change impacts and inculcate climate-sensitive approach to urban planning, according to the cities’ readiness report on Climate Smart Cities Assessment Framework (CSCAF) released by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs on Friday.Ahmedabad, Indore, Pimpri Chinchwad, Vadodara, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Pune, Rajkot and Surat were adjudged top performers among 126 cities that participated in the second edition of the assessment, which was launched in September last year.Kunal Kumar, mission director of the ministry’s Smart Cities Mission, said the assessment currently only involves ranking cities based on their performance. “In the times to come... cities that improve their ranking will get more funds. We incentivise improvement of ranking for cities in the framework.”This year, the cities were assessed on five key themes (with 28 indicators): urban planning, green cover and biodiversity, energy and green buildings; mobility and air quality, water management and waste management. The performance was rated on five levels (1 to 5 stars).In urban planning and waste management themes, some cities have shown positive impact and were given 5 stars in performance level. But in mobility and air quality, water and energy themes, no city got 5 stars, indicating that a lot of work needs to be done before results are visible on the ground.According to the report, 43 smart cities in India face poor air quality that poses serious health concerns. Indore, Surat and Visakhapatnam were adjudged top performers in the urban planning, green cover and biodiversity theme, in some measure because they not only took concrete steps to plan but set aside money in their budget and ensured implementation on the ground.Of the 126 cities, only 65 cities including Thane, Pune, Agra and Coimbatore meet the norms for 12-18% green cover.The report also underscored the absence of a road network for non-motorised transport (NMT), which along with use of public transport can reduce air pollution. It said 94 cities have less than 15% of the road network with NMT infrastructure. Six cities, Kalyan Dombivali, Mysore, Naya Raipur, Ranchi, stand out, with over 50% NMT infrastructure. This is important because studies show that close to 74% of people walk or rely on NMT transport for at least part of their daily commute.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning, School of Planning and Architecture, said, “It is easier for cities to develop NMT infrastructure in greenfield developments. To address issues related to air pollution due to transport, there is a need to increase public transport and develop NMT infrastructure. But in most cities, we have to do retrofitting. There is a need to provide assistance to cities to develop the infrastructure.”The Delhi government’s Electric Vehicle Policy is an example of efforts made by cities in addressing mobility and air quality concerns. The national capital’s performance was largely assessed on information provided by New Delhi Municipal Council, which is part of the smart cities mission.While Delhi was given a five-star rating in waste management (assessed on the performance on Swachh Survekshan 2020), the city got a three-star rating in mobility and air quality, energy and green buildings and urban planning, green cover and biodiversity themes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/9-cities-took-key-steps-to-curb-climate-crisis-study-101624647955645.html

LEA Associates is an international consultant hired by the state government for preparing Ayodhya’s vision document for overall development of the temple town.Larsen and Toubro and Kukreja Architects are assisting the international consultant in executing the project, said Deepak Kumar, chairman, UP Housing and Development Board of the Uttar Pradesh government.According to ADA officials, the document was finalised after several rounds of meetings between the development authority and the consultant. Before finalising the plan, the consultant had taken the vjews of around 5,000 locals, saints of Ayodhya and prominent citizens.The development plan has incorporated 18 big projects. Of these, the detailed project report of 16 projects will be prepared by August this year. The vision document also includes creation of employment opportunities, branding of local products and promotion of religious tourism and plantation of Ramayan-era trees in Ayodhya.The chief minister is also likely to apprise Modi of a proposed new township to decongest Ayodhya. Besides, a provision of ₹300 crore has been made for the construction of an approach road to the Ram Janmabhoomi temple in Ayodhya. Also, a provision of ₹100 crore has been made for the development and beautification of tourism facilities in Ayodhya.Nripendra Misra, chairman of the Ram temple construction committee, is also likely to be present at this virtual meeting. PM Modi had presided over the bhoomi pujan of the Ram temple in Ayodhya on August 5 last year.Key elements of the development plan will cover the Ayodhya main road, the road leading to the Ram temple, Panchkoshi parikrama, Ayodhya green field township, gates at all entry points of the city, resthouses for devotees at entry points, Shri Ram International Airport, tourist centre, international museum, Saryu riverfront, renovation of five water bodies, an integrated traffic management system, multi-level car parking, scheme for rehabilitation of animals, ring road, and plantation of trees from the Ramayan era.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-to-check-ayodhya-development-plan-today-101624647896874.html

We are tracing and contacting each and every phone number and verifying addresses also.,” said SIT investigating officer Rajesh Shah.Investigators said the incident underlined the scale of fake testing at the event, which was attended by 9.1 million people amid a devastating surge of Covid cases across the country. Weeks after the event, officials in several states traced local infections to Kumbh returnees.Allegations of fake testing at the Kumbh surfaced two weeks ago after a Faridkot resident complained to the authorities that he received a message for collecting his Covid-19 report despite never having been tested. The complaint triggered a probe that unearthed roughly 100,000 fake rapid antigen tests.Three firms – Delhi-based Lalchandani Labs, Hisar-based Nalwa Labs and Noida-based private agency Max Corporate Services – were booked under sections of the Indian Penal Code, disaster management act and epidemic diseases act last week. Days later, all three firms approached the high court separately to quash the FIR and denied the charges.At present, three separate probes are looking at the allegations: one by the police, one by the district administration and one by the mela administration.Nepali Farm is an intersection on the highway from where one can head to Dehradun or Rishikesh while coming from Haridwar. Many local residents said that during the Mahakumbh, some private labs set up testing camps there but didn’t provide any authorised slip of testing details or even the name of the lab..“We were handed out a white paper slip on which, with a ball pen, testing lab personnel put on the date April 10, 2021 and said if anyone asks for Covid report while entering Haridwar, you can show this slip. As there was no number or related information, we could also not check the report status. It was the same for other passengers and local people,” said Shikha Rawat, a local resident who was tested for Covid on April 10.Haridwar chief medical officer Shambhu Kumar Jha said that mass irregularities in Covid-19 testing have come to light during the Mahakumbh.Sharad Pant, owner of Max Corporate Services, denied the allegations. “We were there only as facilitators and as service providers, real data feeding, testing was done by the said two agencies Nalwa and Lalchandani. Whatever irregularities or multiple usage of addresses or phone numbers was done during the Mahakumbh testing can only be answered by these laboratories,” he said.Both Lalchandani labs and Nalwa labs were unavailable for comment. Both labs have denied the charges.Activists questioned how the irregularities went unnoticed. “It’s a matter of serious concern as they put lives of people in danger through such wrong entries and testing malpractices when the country was battling second wave,” said Anup Nautiyal, founder of Dehradun based Social Development for Communities Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-address-used-for-3-825-covid-tests-at-kumbh-officials-101624647837510.html
26-06-2021||India||Testing vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 Delta+ variant: Centre||Both Covishield and Covaxin work against the Sars-Cov-2 variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, and the Indian Council of Medical Research is now examining their effectiveness against the emerging Delta Plus variant, said director general Balram Bhargava on Friday.“Very recently we have cultured the delta plus variant, and now we are testing in the laboratory whether the vaccine are effective against the delta plus variant. We have enough data against alpha, beta and delta... and we are doing the same laboratory tests on this variant that we did on others; it is called looking the laboratory tests to check the vaccine effect. This is ongoing and we should have results in about seven to 10 days time,” said Dr Bhargava.The Union health ministry classified the Delta Plus as a variant of concern on Tuesday.Bhargava said the variant is present in 12 countries, and India has reported 51 “very localised” cases from 11 states and Union territories. “The Delta Plus variant has also been isolated and cultured at ICMR-NIV, and laboratory tests to check vaccine effect on Delta Plus variant are ongoing. We should have these results in seven-10 days as to whether the vaccine is working against the Delta Plus variant.”The Delta variant has about 15-17 mutations and was first reported in October last year, and it was responsible for more than 60% of cases in Maharashtra in February.Also read | Maharashtra tightens curbs amid Delta Plus Covid casesAccording to Dr SK Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), out of the nearly 65,000 samples sent for genome sequencing from across the country, 21,156 were found to be variants of concern.“Eight states are important where we have found the delta variant of concern in more than 50% of the samples of Covid-19 positive people. These states are Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Telangana, and West Bengal. And it has been clearly established that the exponential surge in Covid-19 cases that we saw in the second covid-19 wave is largely due to the presence of this variant of concern,” added Singh.He, however, also said that the variant’s clinical co-relation is still being investigated, and at this stage it cannot be termed as more virulent.The Union ministry of health and family welfare on Friday wrote to the above mentioned eight states asking them to have more focused and stringent public health response.“The Public health response, in this case while broadly remaining the same, has to become more focused and stringent. Thus, you are requested to take up immediate containment measures in these districts and clusters including preventing crowds, and intermingling of people, widespread testing, prompt tracing, as well as vaccine coverage on a priority basis,” read the letter by Union health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan.“You are also requested to ensure that adequate samples of positive persons are sent to the designated laboratories of INSACOG promptly so that the clinical epidemiological correlations can be established,” the letter further read.Experts, however, say it is important to take the vaccine irrespective of the variant.“There are studies to show vaccines work in overall reduction in chances of the disease progressing to severe levels. Therefore, people should come forward to get vaccinated. All vaccines are safe,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/testing-vaccine-efficacy-against-delta-centre-101624647777670.html
26-06-2021||India||Maha tightens curbs amid Delta+ concerns||Mumbai Maharashtra on Friday tightened restrictions necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic, citing fears of a “more severe third wave” and expressing concern over variants of the virus that could pose a challenge in keeping the public health crisis under control.The move comes less than a month after Maharashtra eased restrictions in most districts as cases of the infectious disease declined following the peak of the raging second wave of infections. It announced a five-level easing in restrictions, categorising regions for relaxations according to the trajectory of the infections.On Friday, the state government scrapped the first two levels, where there were wide relaxations in restrictions, and the said that the minimum level of easing in restrictions will begin from the third category.Under the new guidelines, malls and theatres in Maharashtra will remain closed, while restaurants will be permitted to operate on weekdays at 50% capacity until 4pm. Gyms, salons and shops will have to be closed at 4pm, while a limit of 50 guests will be imposed on weddings.The decision came days after the Union health ministry called Delta Plus a “variant of concern”, citing its increased transmissibility and ability to bind to lung cell receptors more easily. India has recorded 51 cases of the variant so far, with Maharashtra reporting 22 infections.“Given that the virus causing Covid 19 is undergoing mutations in various geographies, and that these mutations are displaying more transmissibility and potential reductions in monoclonal antibody response, a state-level trigger mandating all the administrative units, irrespective of values of the indices of weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy percentage, to remain at a level not below 3 is to be in operation till withdrawn by specific order of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA),” a notification issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said.“New variants like Delta, Delta plus etc. have come to spread and are fuelling the potentiality of imminent (4-6 weeks), more severe third wave with wider geographical area,” it added.Based on the trajectory of the infections, Mumbai is already in the third category, which means there will be no change in the restrictions in the state capital, an official said.Section 144 has become applicable and not more than five people can gather at a public place, while movement should be minimal after 5pm, the notification said.The state task force on Covid-19 and the ministry of health and family welfare (MOHFW) have directed Maharashtra not to let its guard down, following which it was decided to cut down the relaxations, said Aseem Gupta, secretary, relief and rehabilitation department.“It simply means that of the five-level relaxation plan, we have removed the first two levels having maximum relaxations. It also means all the districts and cities will get maximum relaxations that are provided under the level 3 plan,” Gupta said.The state has found 21 cases of the Delta Plus variant so far in six districts.“Before the second wave hit the state, cases started rising in Amravati and then it spread across the state. This time we have decided to be more careful considering the Delta plus variant cases have been found in a few districts. We cannot be at peace when there is a threat of a possible third wave looming large,” the relief and rehabilitation secretary said.In its new order, the state government said that districts cannot reduce restrictions based on weekly positivity rate. They will have to observe the trend for two weeks. But for increasing restrictions, they won’t have to wait for two weeks and the decision can be taken within a few days. “While coming down to a lower level, the district disaster management authority (DDMA) shall look into two weeks’ trend before accepting a lower level of restrictions. When there is an upward trend in the number of positive cases being identified daily and requiring a higher level of restrictions than the current one, DDMA however shall do so without waiting for two weeks’ trends,” the notification said.It said that the weekly positivity rate, a criterion for deciding the restriction levels, should be determined only on the basis of RT-PCR tests. This was done as many districts were conducting rapid antigen tests (RAT), which are less accurate compared to RT-PCR tests. “There are districts which have a 12% positivity rate going by RT-PCR tests and less than 5% going by RAT tests which is the reason the change has been adopted,” the relief and rehabilitation secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-tightens-curbs-amid-delta-concerns-101624647776249.html
26-06-2021||India||‘Will continue to raise Article 370 issue for however long it takes’: Omar Abdullah||Former chief minister and National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah participated in the high-stakes all-party meeting on Jammu & Kashmir chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 24. He gave his sense of the discussions in an interview with Harinder Baweja.Edited excerpts: Both you and your father, Farooq Abdullah – a sitting Lok Sabha MP – were detained after the nullification of Article 370. What made you trust Prime Minister Narendra Modi after what happened? They are the ones who detained us, and they are the ones who invited us. They should answer the question. It is quite clear that there is a trust deficit between us and the Centre, and I think this was acknowledged in the all-party meeting when the Prime Minister said that there was a need to address “dil ki doori and Dilli se doori” (distance from the heart, and distance from Delhi) What does this mean? It means that there is no meeting of hearts and minds, and that there is a gap, a trust deficit that needs to be addressed.Are you feeling less “dil ki doori” after attending the meeting? It is a beginning. Nobody expects one meeting to resolve everything. It is a part of a longer process.You met Modi just a few days before the fortunes of Jammu & Kashmir were changed on August 5, 2019 and said that you “left the meeting with a very different impression about what was going to unfold”. Was there any reference to that meeting, directly or indirectly? I did not bring it up. There were wider issues about Jammu & Kashmir to be discussed. The participants spoke without fear or reservation, and the Prime Minister and the home minister heard us without interruption.It is quite apparent from the home minister’s tweet that the chronology the Centre has in mind is this: first delimitation, then elections, and then the restoration of statehood. Are you comfortable with this sequence?Ghulam Nabi Azad spoke for most of us when he said that statehood should be restored first. He outlined the chronology that we would like to see. Look, why should there be a separate yardstick for Jammu & Kashmir even for the delimitation exercise? If the purpose of what happened in August 2019 was to integrate Jammu & Kashmir with the rest of the country, then why are we being singled out for delimitation? The rest of the country will see the delimitation process according to the 2021 census but J&K is going ahead with a 10-year-old data from 2010-11. Even in Assam, the delimitation exercise was stopped so assembly elections could be held. Why treat us differently? You can’t have two systems for the country.Let me ask again, statehood before elections or elections before statehood? I ask because the National Conference took part in the civic body elections last year. We will take stock as and when we move forward. As far as I’m concerned, I have already said that I will not contest elections till Jammu & Kashmir stays a Union Territory. That is my personal decision. It was made clear in the meeting that statehood means full statehood, with all powers that were available to us earlier and are available to all other states now. We don’t want truncated statehood.You have often said that Article 370, which gave the state its special status, should be restored. But would it be accurate to say that you seem to have left it to the court to decide?The restoration of Article 370 is very much part of our political discourse and is an important ongoing issue for us. Look, it was pointed out in the meeting too that the Sangh Parivar’s struggle for the abrogation of 370 was 70 years long. We will continue to raise it for however long it takes, 70 weeks, 70 months, or 70 years.You really think that the Modi government, which was responsible for its revocation, will be the one returning it? We are not pandering to optics, and we are not asking the Prime Minister to return it, and they have given no such indication. We pick our battles. We will continue with our struggle to see it restored, constitutionally, legally, and politically.Don’t you think the argument that Article 370 and its restoration cannot be discussed because it is “sub judice”, is an argument that suits the Centre? To be fair, Azad Saab made the sub judice argument; the Centre did not. The government understands that we disagree and we agreed to disagree.What would you say to your constituents who feel that you have betrayed them by agreeing to attend the meeting? You and other mainstream leaders were also blamed for what happened in August 2019. Our wider constituency knows what we stand for. We have not been silent on Article 370. There were no preconditions on what he could or could not say in the meeting. There is no question of surrendering our ideology. I have not surrendered my identity, my political ideology, or my thought process.Do you think the invite for the meeting was an acknowledgement by New Delhi that it cannot move ahead without Jammu & Kashmir’s mainstream political parties? I don’t want to blow my own trumpet. A year ago, nobody would have put their money on such a meeting being held. It is not for me to have asked the host (PM) that question , you should ask them. The Prime Minister, to be fair, did say that he wanted such a meeting to take place earlier; soon after the civic body elections but that the window opened up only now. Covid did not make it possible for the meeting to be held earlier, he said. What I can say is that we are relevant and you cannot wish us away.The People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration – an amalgamation of political forces – was mocked as the “Gupkar Gang”. You have also been called “corrupt dynasts”. Did any of this come up in the meeting, and are you hurt by these comments? I have spent eight years in boarding school, and have a thick skin. I am a lot more pragmatic about these things. The important thing is that I have not been told to surrender my ideology. We had wide-ranging discussions and spoke our minds.Did you leave the meeting feeling optimistic or are you circumspect? I am not given to either in large doses. I operate with a healthy dose of realism. It is one meeting; the start of a process; let’s welcome it.Were back-channel talks held to set up the all-party meeting? I can’t comment on something I don’t know about.When you look ahead, how do you see your political future? ﻿I don’t have a crystal ball. If I had one, I would have seen August 2019 coming. I am but one wheel in a large machine. As I said, it is a process and we have had only one meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-continue-to-raise-article-370-issue-for-however-long-it-takes-101624647536300.html

He has recovered||Bhubaneswar: Odisha on Friday reported its first case of Delta Plus variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, classified by the Union health ministry as a variant of concern, prompting the government to reassure people that they need to continue taking precautions but there is no cause for concern.Additional chief secretary, health department, PK Mohapatra said a 62-year-old male from Deogarh district was among the 48 cases of Delta Plus in the country after genome sequencing of the virus was done by laboratories.“The person did not receive any vaccination when his swab sample was taken for test and subsequent genome sequencing... He has recovered from the infection,” said Mohapatra.Scientists at Institute of Life Sciences in Bhubaneswar, where the genome sequencing was done in the second week of May, however did not find any other case of Delta Plus variant even though genome sequencing of 600 samples was done after this case.So far, Maharashtra, which was the worst-hit state in the second surge of the virus cases has detected 20 cases, the maximum in the country that appears to have contributed to the state government’s decision to tighten restrictions citing fears of a “more severe third wave” and concern over variants of the virus that could pose a challenge in keeping the public health crisis under control.Director of health services Dr Bijay Moahapatra said there was no cause for concern in Odisha as the state expects the trend of cases surging in states like Delhi and Maharashtra before they rise in Odisha. The effects of the first wave and second wave were felt in Delhi and Mumbai first and later on in Odisha. “So we can predict the arrival of the third wave. But we have to be cautious and prepared,” he said.On Friday, Odisha reported 2,912 new Covid cases. The total positivity rate has also dropped to 4.53% but there are districts like Khurda, Jajpur, Balasore and Cuttack which have a TPR of more than 5%.The daily death toll has also remained over 40 since June 1 with 2,000 deaths reported in the last 3 months. Of the 29,500 active cases in the state, around 22% are under treatment at various hospitals while 8% are in ICUs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/62yearold-man-is-odisha-s-first-delta-plus-variant-case-he-has-recovered-101624647296108.html
26-06-2021||India||Male tiger raises 4 cubs after death of their mother tigress||Forest department officials in Madhya Pradesh have found that a tiger has been taking care of four cubs for the past month in the Panna Tiger Reserve after their mother died following a prolonged illness.A study of camera trap pictures and videos, recorded over a month, has revealed that the tiger, P243, rarely left the territory of the cubs and was even killing prey for them, a forest official said.The mother of the four cubs died on May 15. Two days later, when the forest department located the cubs, they found the tiger taking care of them, US Sharma, the field director of Panna Tiger Reserve said.The forest department decided to set up cameras to study the behaviour the tiger was displaying.“The forest department observed the tiger and the cubs for a month between May 20 and June 20 by setting up cameras in the territory of cubs and found that the tiger killed animals and left [the prey] for the cubs,” Sharma said.Though he was roaming in a large area, he did not remain away from the cubs’ territory for more than two days, the forest department found in its observations.The department found that while the tiger was killing prey for the cubs, he did not take them along for the hunt. “The tiger made all the kills away from their territory and brought the dead prey for them,” the field director said.“On May 21, he killed a sambhar and shared the kill with the cubs. On June 6, the tiger killed a cow early in the morning a little distance from the cubs’ territory, but it did not eat it,” the forest department found through the photos.Wildlife experts called the tiger’s behaviour rare. “Such a phenomenon was seen in Ranthambore many years ago but is a rarest one. The forest department should do more study on change in behaviour of the tiger,” said SK Mandol, former chief warden of the forest.The next few months are very crucial for the survival of the cubs, experts said. “Next two to three months are very crucial for gaining skills for surviving the wild. The average weight of the cubs is around 50kg, which ideally should increase to 80-90kg by the time they turn one. Currently, all the four cubs are healthy and making good progress in the wild. They don’t seem to be stressed, instead they are playful and quite active. All four cubs are staying and roaming together,” said Alok Kumar, principal chief conservator of forest, wildlife.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/male-tiger-raises-cubs-after-death-of-their-mother-101624646455570.html
26-06-2021||India||NHRC team meets family of BJP worker killed in Bengal poll violence||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) team, set up on the orders of the Calcutta high court to probe post-poll violence cases in West Bengal, visited Kolkata and Sitalkuchi in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar district on Friday, police officials said,On June 21, the Calcutta high court’s five-judge bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal dismissed a petition by the state government seeking recall of the June 18 order that asked the NHRC to probe allegations of human rights violation during alleged violence after the recent assembly polls.The NHRC constituted a seven-member panel headed by commission’s member Rajiv Jain to probe incidents of violence that took place after the assembly polls. A part of the team reached north Bengal on Thursday. Another team reached Kolkata on Wednesday.On Friday, the team in Kolkata recorded statements of the family of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker, Abhijit Sarkar, who was allegedly strangled to death by a mob in the Narkeldanga area Kolkata on May 2, the day the assembly poll results were declared, police officials saidThe victim’s brother, Biswajit Sarkar, who is among the petitioners who earlier moved the Supreme Court in May praying for a probe into incidents of post-poll violence by a special investigation team, told the NHRC team that on May 2, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supporters attacked and vandalised their house as well as the local BJP office, located nearby. He said that his brother and their mother were assaulted and the attackers tied a cable television wire around Abhijit’s neck and dragged him along the road till he died, adding that the incident took place shortly after the local TMC candidate, Paresh Pal, was declared winner.TMC leaders did not comment on the team’s visit to Narkeldanga saying the matter was sub-judice.A second team of the NHRC that visited Sitalkuchi met the family of a BJP worker whose son was abducted and killed. The team also visited the home of Ananda Barman, a young party supporter shot dead on April 10.One man was allegedly murdered while four others were shot dead by the central armed police forces, at the Sitalkuchi assembly segment during the fourth phase of polling on April 10. A special investigation team (SIT) of the CID is probing the CRPF firing incident.The team that visited Narkeldanga in Kolkata, also went to Amdanga and Jagaddal in the adjacent North 24 Parganas district. They met three families, including that of a student killed at Jagaddal after the polls.The NHRC team members did not talk to the media. Numerous other complaints have been received and the team would look into them, said one of the team members, requesting anonymity.Police said two NHRC teams, which are part of a committee, will be touring parts of north and south Bengal over the next few days. The team has been asked to submit its report before the court by June 30, the next date of hearing.The BJP has been mounting a relentless campaign against the Mamata Banerjee government, alleging that the BJP supporters are being targeted. The party has alleged that more than 30 people have been murdered and women have been raped and molested as well for supporting the saffron camp.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has earlier said all the violence took place when the Election Commission was in control of the police administration. After taking oath on May 5, she said 16 people died in post-poll violence and half of them were TMC workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-team-meets-family-of-bjp-worker-killed-in-bengal-poll-violence-101624646336890.html
26-06-2021||India||Ladakh leaders raise pitch for elected House after J&K meet||It’s been 22 months after their long pending demand for being designated a separate union territory was met, and as the Union government and parties active in Jammu & Kashmir work on restoring the political process in the UT of J&K, some leaders in Ladakh have raised a demand for an elected legislature too.After the state of Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated in 2019, J&K and Ladakh were designated as UTs, but while the former has an assembly, the latter is without one. The Union government’s stated position is that J&K’s statehood will be restored when the time is right.Former BJP MP Thupstan Chhewang said that at a meeting of representatives from political, social and religious bodies that was held on Wednesday under the aegis of an apex body, it was decided to reach out to the union government with its demand for a legislature. The meeting was also attended by BJP MP from Ladakh, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal.“We have been demanding safeguards for the protection of our land, jobs, environment, culture and language that existed prior to the formation of the UT, but the Centre has not met any of these demands despite assurances,” Chhewang said over phone from Ladakh.Namgyal was not reachable for a comment on the issue.Chhewang said at the last meeting in January with Home Minister Amit Shah, that the delegation from Ladakh was assured that a committee would be formed under the chairmanship of the Minister of State for home G Kishan Reddy to address local concerns for protection of rights under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution within two months.A panel of names for the committee, including representatives from Kargil and Leh divisions, and the autonomous hill development councils has also been forward to the centre, he said.“We understand that Covid and assembly elections took up the government’s time, but our demand primarily was either protection under the Sixth Schedule or a separate schedule of the Constitution for safeguarding the interests of the residents of Ladakh in respect of land ownership, job reservation, environmental protection, cultural and language preservation,” he said. There has been concern in the UT that with domicile rules not defined, land and government jobs will be available to outsiders depriving the residents, a large percentage of whom are from Scheduled Tribes.The demand for a legislature, he added, has been raised because the centre has “failed to offer protection” to the people by reserving jobs and ensuring land rights. “They have completely undermined the autonomous hill district councils that are elected by the people and whatever power they had is being usurped by the bureaucrats in the UT.”Ladakh has two autonomous district councils that have the mandate to decide on issues such as economic development, healthcare, education, land use, taxation, and local governance.As per the provisions of the Sixth Schedule, autonomous development councils can frame laws on land, public health, and agriculture to protect the tribal population and provide autonomy. These laws, however, require the approval of the lieutenant governor.Pawan Raina, Officer on Special Duty (OSD) to Ladakh L-G, RK Mathur did not respond to calls.“In the absence of elected representatives, the administration has taken over. And as Kashmiri leaders have been saying, bureaucracy is not a substitute for democratically elected administration. What is happening in Ladakh is that people’s representatives have no say,” Chhewang said.The former MP also said there has been little by way of development and employment in the UT in the past 22 months. “Not a single recruitment drive has been carried out. The domicile law has not been framed,” he said.However, the apex body’s demand will need endorsement from the Kargil division as well. So, it will now reach out to leaders from the Kargil division to second their demand for the legislature. Leaders in Kargil have been demanding the restoration of Article 370 and statehood.“There is a demand in the Kargil region that they should be merged with J&K since they have more in common in with Kashmir including the language than Leh,” said a leader from J&K, who asked not to be named.Chhewang, however, said the Apex Body will call on the leaders from the Kargil region in the next few days so that a consensus is built on the issue.BJP’s national genral secretary, Tarun Chugh, who is in-charge of the UT said, “The BJP is committed to safeguarding the rights of the tribal people in Ladakh. We will see to it that their languages, customs, traditions and ecology are all protected.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ladakh-leaders-raise-pitch-for-elected-house-after-j-k-meet-101624646335502.html
26-06-2021||India||India Smart Cities Awards 2020: UP best smart state, Surat, Indore best cities||Uttar Pradesh is the top performer among all Indian states in rankings given by the Centre’s Smart Cities Mission project, followed by Madhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the Union government said on Friday, releasing the results of the India Smart Cities Awards Contest (ISAC) 2020.Among cities, Indore and Surat were adjudged joint winners, and Chandigarh was ranked first among Union territories, the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs said.The awards were announced on Friday to commemorate six years of the central government’s three initiatives to spur urban development: Smart Cities Mission (SCM), Atal Mission for Urban Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U).These rankings were arrived at by the government on the basis of several parameters such as social aspects, governance, culture, urban environment, sanitation, economy, built environment, water, urban mobility. For the year of the pandemic, additional parameters of sustainable business model of Integrated Command and Control Centres and innovation in Covid-19 management were also counted for the awards.According to officials aware of the matter, UP won the best state award for shortlisting seven more cities apart from the existing 10 to transform them into smart cities: Ayodhya, Mathura, Meerut, Shahjahanpur, Firozabad, Gorakhpur, Ghaziabad).“It showed good physical and financial progress in some cities such as Agra, Varanasi, Lucknow, Prayagraj. UP was also able to complete the transfer of state supporting funds to cities... Lucknow and Ghaziabad also issued municipal bonds last year, becoming the first cities in North India to do so, in a Covid year,” a ministry official said on condition of anonymity.Surat has been adjudged the best city for the second consecutive year, while the categories for the best state and Covid-19 management did not exist in the previous rankings.“The contest is an opportunity for smart cities to showcase their most innovative, impactful projects and for us to recognise and learn from their best practices. This year’s best proposals range from the use of Integrated Command and Control Centres in governance or in response to Covid-19, enhancing safety and security of citizens, intelligent traffic management, innovative use of open spaces, enhancement of urban environment, innovations in the improvement of urban mobility, smart water management, waste-to-energy generation and many others,” Union housing affairs minister Hardeep Puri said at an online event on Friday.The Union ministry noted Indore’s consistent top performance in the list, saying in a statement: “Indore has been a forerunner among the smart cities in the past year and has consistently featured among the top ranked cities in the year 2020. The city is implementing projects worth ₹5,099.6 crores under the Smart Cities Mission... The smart city has made visible gains in a timebound manner.,” the ministry said.On Surat’s ranking, it said: “Having achieved a certain degree of success in providing essential urban infrastructure and services to its citizens, Surat has shifted focus towards using technology for operational improvements.”The urban affairs ministry on Friday also underscored the importance of cities across India using Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCCs) as war rooms for Covid-19 management. So far, 69 cities in India have operationalised these ICCCs under the Smart Cities Mission and these are being developed across all 100 smart cities, the ministry said.Agartala, Indore and Vadodara were ranked best for the sustainable business model of ICCCs.At present under Smart Cities Mission, 5,924 projects worth ₹1,78,500 crore have been tendered so far and 2,665 projects worth ₹45,080 crore have been fully completed, data by the ministry shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-smart-cities-awards-2020-up-best-smart-state-surat-indore-best-cities-101624646336113.html
26-06-2021||India||Twitter blocks IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad for 1 hour||Union minister for electronics and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday criticised Twitter after he was locked out of his account on the platform for almost an hour over alleged copyright infringement -- a development that comes amid a dispute between the social media company and the central government over the issue of compliance with new IT rules.Prasad said that the company denied him access on the grounds that he violated the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The access to the account was subsequently restored.“It is apparent that my statements calling out the high handedness and arbitrary actions of Twitter, particularly sharing the clips of my interviews to TV channels and its powerful impact, have clearly ruffled its feathers,” he said in a series of posts on Koo, which positions itself as India’s alternative to Twitter.Prasad added that Twitter’s actions were in gross violation of Rule 4 (8) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, as it failed to provide him any prior notice before denying him access.Twitter said that as per its copyright policy, it responds to “valid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorized representatives”. “We can confirm that the Honourable Minister’s account access was temporarily restricted due to a DMCA notice only and the referenced Tweet has been withheld,” a spokesperson for the company said.According to Twitter’s disclosure of the notice details on Lumen Database, a Harvard University project that collects and analyses legal complaints and requests for removal of online materials, the actioned tweet contained a post by the Union minister with a link to the AR Rehman song “Maa tujhe salaam”.The contents of the tweet, which was posted in 2017, are no longer available in the public domain.The social media firm’s action comes at a time when it is at loggerheads with the government over the new social media and intermediary guidelines. The Centre has asserted that the company failed to comply with the guidelines, which can result in it losing the safe harbour protection granted to intermediaries under the IT Act. Twitter, in turn, raised concerns about the safety of its employees in India and flagged intimidation by the police. There have been several run-ins between the social media firm and the government over orders to block access to content and marking of posts by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders as manipulated media.After Twitter briefly blocked Prasad from accessing, the chairman of the parliamentary panel on information technology, Shashi Tharoor, said the same issue occurred with him and the standing committee will seek an explanation from the social media firm over the temporary locking of their accounts and the rules it follows while operating in India.Indians creatively make videos using short snippets of foreign music and most people would consider that “fair use”, Tharoor said.Prasad previously said what happened with his account was very peculiar. “Friends! Something highly peculiar happened today. Twitter denied access to my account for almost an hour on the alleged ground that there was a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of the USA and subsequently they allowed me to access the account.”“Twitter’s actions indicate that they are not the harbinger of free speech that they claim to be but are only interested in running their own agenda, with the threat that if you do not tow the line they draw, they will arbitrarily remove you from their platform,” the minister added, saying “no matter what any platform does they will have to abide by the new IT Rules fully and there shall be no compromise”.Twitter, in its communication to the minister, said that the “account has been locked because Twitter received a compliant Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Notice for content posted to your Twitter account”. “Under the DMCA copyright owners can notify Twitter claiming that a user has infringed their copyrighted works. Upon receipt of a valid notice, Twitter will remove the identified material. Twitter maintains a repeat copyright infringer policy under repeat infringer accounts will be suspended. Accruing multiple DMCA strikes may lead to suspension of your account,” the company said in a communication sent to Prasad, according to his post on Koo.The minister said that in the past several years, “no television channel or any anchor has made any complaints about copyright infringements with regard to these news clips of my interviews shared on social media”.According to Raman Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now, because Twitter is ultimately operated as a service by Twitter Inc, the DMCA applies to it internationally. “That is how Twitter is structured,” he said.He added that it was ironic that the minister was complaining about a regime that was too strict in terms of its enforcement. “The problem with creating a broad order of takedown regimes is that such situations will arise. It is ironic that the minister is complaining about a regime that is too strict when the government is trying to create a similar situation in India with the new IT rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-blocks-it-minister-for-1-hour-101624646216234.html
26-06-2021||India||Good start... will keep up struggle to restore 370: Omar Abdullah||National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah on Friday said that his party will continue to push for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status but didn’t expect Prime Minister Narendra Modi to return it because it was the latter’s government that decided to scrap it in 2019.Abdullah’s comments came in an interview to HT, a day after attending a landmark meeting of J&K politicians with the Centre.Article 370, which bestowed special status to J&K but was controversially voided in August 2019, was brought up by several leaders at Thursday’s meeting, which marked the resumption of political engagement in the region after two years. But Abdullah said he will not raise the issue before Modi just “for the sake of optics”.“We are not pandering to optics and we are not asking the Prime Minister to return it and they have given no such indication. We pick our battles. We will continue with our struggle to see it restored, constitutionally, legally and politically,” the former chief minister said, one day after the all-party meeting.Petitions by several political parties, including the NC, demanding restoration of Article 370 are pending before the Supreme Court since 2019. “The restoration of Article 370 is very much part of our political discourse and is an important ongoing issue for us,” Abdullah said.“We will continue to raise it for however long it takes, 70 weeks, 70 months, or 70 years.”He emphasised that full statehood to J&K needs to be restored in its entirety. “It was made clear in the meeting that statehood means full statehood with all powers that were available to us earlier and are available to all other states now. We don’t want truncated statehood,” Abdullah said.On August 5, 2019, sweeping changes saw J&K’s special status revoked and the region bifurcated into Union territories. Its officer cadre were done away with.Abdullah said the meeting with the PM was a step forward, and that he welcomed it. He pointed out that there were no preconditions on what could or could not be said in the meeting but he was clear about his political goals. “There is no question of surrendering our ideology. I have not surrendered my identity, my political ideology or my thought process,” he said.The meeting was attended by 14 J&K leaders and also touched upon the ongoing delimitation exercise to redraw poll constituencies, grassroots democracy, development goals and preventing loss of life. All parties said the talks happened in a cordial atmosphere.Abdullah said he was neither overly optimistic nor overly circumspect about the event. He said he would move forward with a “healthy dose of realism”.Asked if the invitation for the meeting acknowledged the fact that the Centre could not move ahead without the support of the region’s mainstream parties, Abdullah said, “I don’t want to blow my own trumpet. A year ago, nobody would have put their money on such a meeting being held.”“I have always said we are relevant and you cannot wish us away,” Abdullah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/good-start-will-keep-up-struggle-to-restore-370-omar-abdullah-101624646035551.html
26-06-2021||India||Journalist made false claim of loot: Police||Noida The Noida Police on Friday claimed that senior journalist Atul Agrawal, who claimed to have been looted at gunpoint by assailants in Greater Noida west on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, had lied about the incident. Agrawal, the editor-in-chief of Hindi Khabar channel, however, stuck to his claims, adding that he doesn’t want to comment on “the police theory”.Pointing to his call detail records (CDR), route map and CCTV camera footages, deputy commissioner of police (Noida central) Harish Chander and additional DCP Ankur Agarwal, addressing a press conference, said that there were discrepancies in the events described by Agrawal. Police also claimed Agrawal was at a guest house in Noida when the alleged incident took place. In a social media post on Monday, Agrawal claimed that five persons on two motorcycles robbed him of ₹5,000-6,000 when he stopped his car about 300 meters from Rise police check post, when he was returning from office to his home in Supertech Eco Village in Greater Noida west at around 1am. He had claimed that the robbers returned his phone and car as they came to know that he was a senior journalist.“First, Agrawal had narrated the incident in a Facebook post (on Monday) almost 23 hours after the incident. The police team reached the spot after getting the information and called him but he refused to come to the crime spot,” Chander said. Later, on Monday evening, Agrawal visited Bisrakh police station and narrated the incident, but again refused to file a complaint, police said. Police, however, took suo motu action and registered a case against unknown suspects under IPC section 392 (robbery).According to police, at 7 pm on June 19, Agrawal had visited a friend for dinner in Noida’s Sector 45. “He had left Sector 45 when his wife called him to come home. His friend informed police that Agrawal had called last at 1.20 am but did not talk of any incident of loot,” Chander said.Addl DCP Ankur Agarwal said that five teams were formed to investigate the matter. “We recreated the crime scene and found a mismatch of evidence and allegations. Agrawal had claimed that he was passing through Rise police check post when he stopped to plug his pen drive to play music in the car at 1 am. However, Agrawal’s call records and CCTV footage showed his car passed through Rise police check post at 10.53pm. He reached home soon after,” he said.Police said Agrawal again left home again after midnight, and his car was spotted at 12.40am near the ATS roundabout in Greater Noida. He crossed Charmurti roundabout at 12.53 am and then reached a guesthouse in Noida Sector 121, they added.“He checked in there at 1.07am and checked out at 11.46am as per CCTV camera records and the visitors ledger at the guest house. It is unlikely that he was robbed on the way since the Rise police check post and the guest house are not in the same direction from Charmurti,” ADCP said.Chander said that police will collect more information and, if the allegations are found to be false, expunge the FIR. “We will inform the court about the matter,” Chander said. When contacted, Agarwal said that the incident posted on Facebook was true. “I had stayed in the guest house alone. I work in media and I need to travel at night. I did not file a complaint then as the suspects are free and I feared for my safety. I do not want to comment on police theory,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/journalist-made-false-claim-of-loot-police-101624645975557.html
26-06-2021||India||3 Assam districts, 247 localities to be containment zones from Monday||The Assam government on Friday declared three of its districts as total containment zones to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The new restrictions, which would be applicable from Monday and continue for a week, were announced after chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma held a meeting with deputy commissioners to review the situation.“We found that 247 localities or regions had over 10% test positivity rate in the past week. These areas will be declared as total containment zones with immediate effect,” said health minister Keshab Mahanta.Mahanta described the situation in four districts, Biswanath, Goalpara, Morigaon and Golaghat, as alarming. “Of these, Biswanath, Goalpara and Morigaon, will be declared a total containment zone for a week beginning Monday,” he added.In Kamrup (Metropolitan) district, which includes Guwahati, curfew will be relaxed by two hours. From Monday, the district will have curfew from 5 am to 4 pm daily. Shops, offices and business establishments will have to shut down an hour earlier, at 3 pm.In Hailakandi district curfew would remain from 5am to 5pm daily. In all other districts, curfew will be applicable from 5am to 1pm daily. The ban on inter-district movement will continue.“Those who took two doses of Covid vaccine won’t have to undergo tests at airports, railway stations from now on. They would be allowed to proceed on furnishing their certificates,” said Mahanta.Government employees who have taken one dose will have to come to office from now. Employees who are pregnant, women employees who have children under 5 years and those with disabilities are exempt from this order but they have to work from home. “We have urged frontline government employees who deal with the public to get vaccinated immediately and provisions have been made to ensure they get their doses,” the minister said, adding that their salary would be held back if they don’t get vaccinated.“Every month we collect 300 samples from the 10 government labs in Assam and send them to the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics in Kolkata. Our reports for April and May indicate that 77% of the samples were of Delta variant. Only one of those affected with Delta variant has died and all others have recovered,” Mahanta added.On Friday, Assam recorded 2793 new cases and 26 deaths. The test positivity rate in the state was 2.01%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-assam-districts-247-localities-to-be-containment-zones-from-monday-101624645856767.html
26-06-2021||India||Navy deployment after Galwan clash showed India was ready, says Rajnath||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said that the Indian Navy’s proactive forward deployment after the Galwan Valley skirmish with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh last year signalled that India wanted peace but was ready for any eventuality.The Galwan Valley clash of June 15, 2020, was the first deadly skirmish between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in more than five decades, and pushed the bilateral relationship to breaking point. It left 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead.“Indian Navy remains poised and combat-ready to tackle any challenge,” the minister said.His comments in Kochi come at a time when the Indian and Chinese armies are negotiating the next steps of a complex disengagement process in eastern Ladakh to reduce tensions along the LAC where both sides have been locked in a standoff for more than 13 months. Singh was in Kochi to review the construction of India’s first Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC) Vikrant, which is likely to be commissioned into navy in the first half of 2022, the defence ministry said in a statement.The minister was briefed about the carrier’s successful basin trials completed last November and its upcoming sea trials later this year. It is the biggest warship to be ever built in the country.“The IAC boasts of nearly 75% indigenous content, from design to steel used in construction, to key weapons and sensors,” Singh said, calling it a “shining example” of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India). He said the aircraft carrier would bolster the navy’s capabilities and help secure India’s maritime interests. He said its commissioning next year would be a befitting tribute to 75 years of India’s independence.The ship will operate MiG-29K fighter jets, Kamov-31 helicopters, soon-to-be inducted MH-60R multi-role helicopters and the indigenous advanced light helicopters. Vikrant will weigh 37,500 tonnes. It has been named after aircraft carrier INS Vikrant operated by the navy from 1961 to 1997.“It would offer an incomparable military instrument with its ability to project air power over long distances, including air interdiction, anti-surface warfare, offensive and defensive counter-air, airborne anti-submarine warfare and airborne early warning,” the statement said.India currently operates a solitary aircraft carrier, INS Vikramaditya, bought from Russia for $2.33 billion. China currently operates two aircraft carriers — CV-16 Liaoning and CV-17 Shandong. It is building a third carrier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-deployment-after-galwan-clash-showed-india-was-ready-says-rajnath-101624644776541.html
26-06-2021||India||LAC standoff: India, China agree to hold another meeting||India and China agreed on Friday to hold the next meeting of senior military commanders as soon as possible to discuss complete disengagement at friction points on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) while working to maintain stability on the ground.This was the only tangible outcome from a virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, which resulted in what the external affairs ministry described as a “frank exchange of views” on the situation along the LAC in the western sector. The last meeting of the military commanders at the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point was held on April 9.Following a drawdown of troops and armoured units from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February, India and China haven’t made any headway on disengagement and de-escalation at other friction points such as Depsang, Gogra and Hot Springs. The two sides have also engaged in a war of words this week, blaming each other for the year-long standoff on the LAC.On Thursday, India blamed China’s actions of amassing troops in border areas and attempting to unilaterally change the status quo on the LAC for the standoff, and dismissed Beijing’s contention that New Delhi’s policies were to blame for the tensions.Following the WMCC meeting, a statement issued by the external affairs ministry said: “The two sides agreed to hold the next (12th) round of the senior commanders meeting at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement from all the friction points along the LAC in the Western Sector in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols.”The two sides also agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through diplomatic and military mechanisms to reach a “mutually acceptable solution for complete disengagement from all friction points so as to ensure full restoration of peace and tranquillity to enable progress in the bilateral relations”, the statement said.In the interim, the two sides will “continue to ensure stability on the ground and prevent any untoward incident”, the statement said. It added that both sides also agreed on finding an early resolution to remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh in line with the agreement reached between the two foreign ministers in September 2020.This was the eighth round of diplomatic talks under the WMCC mechanism since the standoff began in May last year.The Indian delegation was led by additional secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava, and the director general of the boundary and oceanic department of China’s foreign ministry, Hong Liang, led the Chinese delegation.A separate readout in Mandarin from China’s foreign ministry described the discussions as a “candid and in-depth” exchange of views and said the two sides agreed to “consolidate the results of the disengagement of border troops” and “properly resolve the remaining issues” in the western sector of the border.The Chinese readout also referred to the consensus reached by the foreign ministers, and said the two sides will continue to “promote further de-escalation of the situation at the border, avoid the recurrence of the situation on the ground, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity”.It added that specific time and arrangements for the next round of military talks will be determined through the “border hotline as soon as possible”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lacstandoff-india-china-agree-to-hold-another-meeting-101624644775410.html
26-06-2021||Today's||Across religions, include women in the clergy||When Tamil Nadu Hindu religious and charitable endowments department minister, P K Sekar Babu, announced recently that women could also be appointed as priests in temples following stipulated training, it caused consternation.The importance of women priests in all religions cannot be overstated. The government and civil society should encourage more women to take up this profession and facilitate this. The clergy plays an important part in lessening social prejudices, an example being the Sikh clergy coming out strongly against female foeticide.There is huge potential in women priests from all religions becoming game-changers in gender inclusion in contemporary times. They could play a vital role in erasing vaccine hesitancy, tackling the upsurge in domestic violence during the pandemic, and addressing issues which affect women. In a deeply religious society, advice from the clergy carries significant weight.While there is no data on practising Hindu women priests, there are about a dozen formal institutions which train women for priesthood. The Jnana Prabodhini in Pune is among the oldest, and its Sanskrit Sanskruti Sangshodhika department, established in 1975, has a department to train men and women for priesthood, regardless of caste, unusual in a profession traditionally dominated by Brahmins.Manisha Shete, 51, who works as a priest and is the coordinator at the institute mentioned in an interview to a newspaper that when she began her training at Jnana Prabodhini in 2006, around 50% of the students were women. The institute encourages single women, divorcees, widows and women who are unable to have children to study there, most of whom are usually not accepted as equals in a traditional society. Excluding women from worship and carrying out religious rituals on the basis of biological functions, according to Shete, is a misinterpretation of the scriptures.The blurring of gender divisions in the clergy has also been seen among Muslims. A decade ago, the All India Muslim Women’s Board appointed two women, Hena Zaheer and Maria Fazal, as qazis in Uttar Pradesh. The progress since then has been heartening and steady. In 2016, the Bhartiya Mahila Muslim Andolan (BMMA) began training women to be qazis; today there are six in Mumbai who run sharia courts, solemnise marriages, try and resolve marital and inheritance issues, and counsel women facing domestic violence.In an interview with TV channel Al Jazeera, Noorjehan Safia Niaz, the founder of BMMA, said that the syllabus for studies of female qazis is carefully curated so as to not cater to the misogynistic rituals and principles that usually dominate religious studies. These women study the Koran from a female perspective, alongside the Constitution, to make better decisions that are gender-sensitive and in sync with the law. This means that the women are likely to be far more open and gender-inclusive when conducting rituals. According to several wedding planning portals, women priests are much more in demand today than ever. Google searches which were once limited to 10 for female priests a month in 2016 registered at least 200 per month in 2020, usually from brides who do not want to be subjected to patriarchal rituals such as vidaai and kanyadaan. Women priests are also seen as not being as judgmental as men when it comes of interfaith and multicultural couples. Women must have a greater role in the rituals that govern all our lives from birth to death.lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/across-religions-include-women-in-the-clergy-101624711986273.html
26-06-2021||Today's||Soft infrastructure, and a tablet for all, can catalyse India’s development||At Independence, India was a large, poor, illiterate, country, with disparate religions, languages, races, food, and culture, coming together against imperial domination, not much else. It was not expected to survive, much less succeed. But the 15 years after Independence created the foundations of India that stood the test of time.A democracy based on full adult franchise was institutionalised, a Constitution agreed upon, a federal structure created, and, an independent judiciary and media were given protection.The State addressed the lack of basic economic infrastructure by building capital industry and nationalising the key pillars of financial sector, State Bank of India, and Life Insurance Corporation. It created institutions of higher learning, controversially retained the merit-based bureaucracy, subordinated the Army to the civil State, and, despite being poor, managed to find a voice on the global stage and created the concept of non-alignment. Any fair assessment of that period will score it well.The political economy of India subsumed everything else between 1960-1991. It was India’s moment of reckoning with “full adult franchise” in a poor democracy. Early in the period, banks were nationalised and forced to open deposit-collecting rural and semi-urban branches, deposits used to buy government securities to fund the planned expenditure. Credit was directed at identified priority sectors, and industry was allocated credit through the credit authorisation scheme.The government’s control of the economy was stifling, more and more sectors were nationalised, and the private sector was shackled with price controls, but supported by high tariffs and entry barriers in an era aptly called the license-raj. Unsurprisingly, Indian product quality was poor, we enjoyed the glacial “Hindu rate of growth” with massive disguised unemployment, and exports were not sufficient to meet our imports, finally leading to a major balance of payments problem in 1990.By 1991, India was on the verge of default and the then government rapidly employed policies fashioned on the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s structural adjustment playbook, to obtain a five billion special drawing right facility.Steps were taken to unshackle the economy. Interest rates were decontrolled, tariff rates reduced, and the exchange rate set closer to the market rate. Licensing was eased and entry barriers were reduced. The economic unshackling changed India’s economic growth trajectory, which averaged a healthy 7% for over 25 years. Since then, successive governments of different persuasions have continued economic reforms. Even those with a welfarist orientation (which introduced or continued with Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and a range of subsidies) have prevented slippage.In fact, in the last 30 years, governments have introduced reforms in the areas of direct taxation, telecom, labour, banking and capital markets; expanded infrastructure (roads, airports and ports); increased foreign ownership limits in controlled sectors; attempted privatisation of State-owned and conceptualised and rolled-out Aadhaar. Currently, some noteworthy measures include the Goods and Services Tax, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy code, agricultural reforms (which, to be sure, have generated resistance but are overdue nonetheless) and sanitation and hygiene.Yet, to me, the biggest enabling reform for the future has to be the JAM trinity — opening bank accounts for all Indian households, getting 1.2 billion Indians enrolled onto Aadhaar and getting almost all Indians a mobile phone.To make India future-ready and to provide equal opportunity to its citizens, India must adopt technology fully in the next phase. My top five areas of reform are the following:One, address the digital apartheid. The government must ensure a “smart device for life” to all Indians, with adequate bandwidth and data. The equivalent of a mini iPad as a passport to equal opportunity with connectivity, providing access to education, health, training, upskilling and financial inclusion. This is the first requirement for aatmanirbharta (self-reliance).Two, ensure equal access in education. Virtual schooling in the pandemic has demonstrated the possibility for a much fairer future for our children. Using digital in education via the smart mini device should be the weapon and all public schools should be taught by the same teachers (by language), and their current teachers should become class monitors to ensure attendance and good behaviour.Three, revolutionise health care. The same device should provide access to health centres. All health records in India need to be digitised and centrally stored. We can address privacy issues and recreate our health care delivery in India from “absent” to “personalised”.Four, use water wisely. Managing the environment is a complex subject and India is both a victim and a perpetrator. Yet mispricing (or free) power and water has led to perversions in agriculture and lowered the water table to unforgivable levels. Exporting water-guzzling rice and sugar is like exporting food during a famine. And finally, speed up justice. At its core, this means that our courts must work faster, and jails should house criminals and not those who are undertrials. It is unjust for 60% of the inmates of jails to be undertrials.In the next phase of our journey, the defining focus must be soft infrastructure. We need to provide equal opportunity to citizens with basic access to nutrition, sanitation, health, and quality education. This will improve our economic productivity. In the digital era that is unfolding, without access to the benefits of technology among all citizens, our productivity will lag global benchmarks. Inequality will be socially threatening to our full adult suffrage-based democracy.Digital access should be the weapon to rethink our future. We now have the tools and India’s poor are waiting impatiently.

26-06-2021||Today's||Capturing the complexity of conservation in cinema||Conservation and the climate crisis are loaded words. While writing the film, Sherni, the greatest challenge for me was understanding the dimensions of such complex and delicate topics, and then weaving them into a story.Through months of research, it became clear that for such a story to be understood, the overarching philosophy had to be clear: The world does not need singular heroes, but community builders to tackle the climate crisis. Another aspect of the film was understanding the cluster of issues that give rise to human-animal conflicts.I realised that the only way for me to approach the topic was with sound methodology. My research associate and I set about studying various case studies on human-animal conflict and then collating data to ascertain patterns. I referred to the work of Michel Foucault (Biopolitics) and read works of postcolonial scholars such as Achille Mbembe (Necropolitics), among others, and built on that.When we talk about marginalised communities and initiatives such as health care, mental health or ecology, it is important to remember that the exchange of knowledge and information should always be a two-way street. There is more to learn from communities that have lived through and coped with challenges of various kinds, and to then build on their knowledge. The approach must be to promote leadership rather than force-feed them with an approach that is likely to fail.The main character in the film, Vidya Vincent, is in a limbo at both her job and personal life, and is struggling to find meaning in her job. But a field-posting as a district forest officer jolts her into a world where the challenges faced by the local community and wildlife are immediate and stark. But Vincent is not a saviour, the character is self-aware and knows that her job will not allow her to stay in the same place for an extended period. She also knows that her role is to form local allies, engage with the communities dealing with these issues, and arrive at a long-term solution. While the task is to trap and tranquillise a tigress and move her to a national park nearby, that is just the tip of the iceberg for her. She finds allies in Noorani (a zoologist) and Jyoti (a community leader), who share her sentiments on conservation.The key insight was that there are no quick fixes to the issues of conservation and the climate crisis. It requires sustained efforts for any change to take place. It takes a different mindset to work in this field, since the climate crisis affects everyone in different ways. It was important for me to include and engage younger sections of the population. Gen Z is at the forefront of these conversations the world over, because it directly impacts their future. Therefore, the idea of “forest friends”, as a group working with Vincent from within the local community, was added.The opening and closing of the film have strong surrealistic undertones, and that was intentional. I wanted to open the film with a perspective on the issue. As the silhouette of the beast in the frame reveals a human imitating an animal, the symbolism is meant to make the audience self-reflect.Initially, the ending of the film was supposed to give Vidya Vincent closure. But the Covid-19 pandemic necessitated a big picture perspective on the issues of conservation. Therefore, I decided to write an eerie, metaphorical ending meant for audiences to reflect on. What is human existence without nature? What will we tell future generations about the feeling of walking through a natural forest and hearing the sounds of birds and insects, rivers and creeks? We are all a part of nature, all human creations are inspired by nature. To be in harmony with nature is the essence of being alive.This is not something that we can buy back. There is no price tag on nature, once we lose our forests, mountains, rivers and seas, it is lost forever.Aastha Tiku is the story and screenplay writer of the Vidya Balan-starrer Sherni, a recently-released film on wildlife and conservation issues The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/capturing-the-complexity-of-conservation-in-cinema-101624711980343.html
