With this, the number of districts where corona curfew has been eased has gone up to 67. The state has 75 districts.About administrative work, he said, “Doctors must immediately be relieved of administrative or management tasks in hospitals and offices of the health department and deployed for medical work. For management work, according to the requirement, youths with MBA should be given the opportunity.”As for vaccination, he said, “The target of June is to vaccinate one crore people and we are looking to enhance it by two to three-folds in July. Students at nursing colleges must be trained as vaccinators. Begin the training programme from the next week.”“The (active) cases have gone below 600 in Bareilly and Bulandshahr. From Monday, curfew will be relaxed there too after the ongoing weekend curfew (Saturday-Sunday) ends,” Yogi said.He added that night curfew and weekend curfew should be enforced strictly and evenly statewide.About Covid numbers, Yogi said that the state currently had 19,438 active cases and the recovery rate was 97.6%. In the past 24 hours, a total of 1,092 fresh Covid cases were recorded across UP. He announced that the state so far had administered 1.98 crore Covid vaccine doses. In the past 24 hours, 4.01 lakh doses were administered. From Monday separate booths for women, too, will be operated, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/take-doctors-off-administrative-duties-deploy-mbas-instead-says-yogi-adityanath-101622916745210.html

With this, 15 members of the gang have been arrested since November last year when the recruitment exam racket was busted, police said. The suspects were identified as Ankit and Shourya Sharma, both residents of Faridabad. The duo was nabbed from Sector 62 following a tip-off, police said. On November 28 last year, nine people, including two Delhi Police constables, had been nabbed by the Noida police for running the gang. The racket had been busted after an exam centre in Noida’s Sector 62 had informed police about the fraud. Four members of the gang were nabbed later while the alleged mastermind, Ravi Kumar, an inspector with the income tax department, had obtained a stay order from court for his arrest. His nephew, Dinesh, was also arrested in the case. The gang would charge their clients lakhs of rupees to have impersonators appear for exams, police said.Police officials said that when Dinesh wanted to alter documents to get one of the scribes in the exam hall, he had Ankit forge and print them. Meanwhile, Shourya was introduced to Dinesh through Ravi and he was responsible for introducing any potential candidate to the gang. “It was a huge operation. There are at least four other members of the gang who have been identified, and efforts are on to nab them,” said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police, zone 1. The suspects were booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the UP Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/recruitment-exam-racket-two-more-held-in-noida-101622916685172.html

The daytime temperatures, however, will likely remain warm.According to weather analysts, the phenomenon of thunderstorm activity during pre-monsoon or summer season usually happens during this time of the year where the high mercury simmers the region during afternoon hours but by evening, it quickly cools the area down with light rain showers or cool breezes of easterly winds.Weather experts said it’s the high daytime temperatures itself which cause light rains, leading to pleasant weather later in the day.“The day temperature will remain high and may cross the 40 degrees Celsius mark, but during the evening, this will cool down quickly, possibly for the next two days. The reason is that the higher temperatures meet the moist, pre-monsoon winds, leading to formation of temporary convective clouds. There is a western disturbance too these days, and the cumulative effect leads to thunderstorm and light rain activity. This is a weather phenomenon that happens over smaller regions of around 200 square kms,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. A western disturbance is a moisture-laden wind that originates from the Mediterranean Sea, which is responsible for snow in the northern Indian states.“Going by the radar images, there are convective clouds over the Noida and Greater Noida area, which could lead to light rains over this region, accompanied with strong winds during the evening hours,” Srivastava added. Noida received an average rainfall of 1.5mm between Thursday night and Friday morning. On Friday, Noida’s maximum and minimum temperature was recorded at 38.8 °C and 23.7 °C, respectively, against 38.2 °C and 27.8 °C a day earlier. At the Safdarjung observatory, considered the average for the region, the maximum and minimum temperature was recorded at 39.1 °C and 23.4 °C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/thunderstorm-light-rains-likely-in-noida-101622916625808.html

The police, however, said they were doubtful of their claims.The suspects fled with cash and valuables worth over ₹13 lakh, the family alleged.The complainant, Megh Singh, a farmer, alleged that he and his wife and two children – aged 12 and nine years – were sleeping when eight criminals attacked them around 1am on Saturday. “Some of the criminals stood guard while three of them held us at gunpoint. They demanded the keys to the safe. When we refused, they tied our hands and legs and bundled us in a room, where they held us at gunpoint. They broke the safe and stole gold and silver jewellery worth ₹13 lakh,” he alleged. The suspects also fled with ₹25,000 cash, he added. Police officers, meanwhile, said they were informed five hours after the incident. Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said while the alleged incident took place at 1am, the family gave them a call at 6am. “The police team, forensic experts and a dog squad reached the spot for investigation. We questioned the family and found some discrepancies in their statements. They had no injury marks on their hands or bodies. Besides, the forensic team found a countrymade gun and ten live cartridges from the same safe. We are investigating the matter to see if this was a case of dacoity or theft. Two teams have been formed to solve the case,” he said. A case has been registered against unknown persons under Section 392 (robbery) of IPC at the Rabupura police station, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/family-alleges-dacoity-in-greater-noida-home-cops-doubt-claim-101622916625180.html

Officials said that the partial curfew may be lifted from Monday if the district continues to have less than 600 active cases on Sunday. According to the state Covid portal, the active cases for Ghaziabad stood at 573 till 9pm on Saturday, while the neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar district had 623 such cases. As per UP government’s directions issued on May 30, a district needs below 600 active cases for getting relaxations from the partial corona curfew which is in prevalence from the night of April 30. “The number of active cases on the portal has come down below 600 and it is likely that cases will further decline. So, ongoing restrictions may ease down soon. But people will have to observe strict adherence to Covid protocols,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. The officials of GB Nagar district administration said that they have chalked out a plan once the restrictions get lifted. “With the figure of active cases going down, we expect that restrictions will be eased from Monday onwards. We have planned that markets will open up from 7am to 7pm. The industries and business establishments will follow all Covid protocols, while the educational institutions will remain closed. We have also decided that clubs, swimming pools and gyms will remain closed,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar. The state portal shows the realtime figures of new cases, discharges, deaths, and accordingly the number of active cases. It shows dynamic figures which may change as per entry of fresh cases as well as deaths and discharges, the officials said. The figures from 6am today to 6am the next day are compiled and reflected in the state Covid bulletin of the next day. According to the state daily bulletin released on Saturday, Ghaziabad has 631 active cases while GB Nagar has 610 active cases. Meanwhile, the Ghaziabad CMO said that with constant decline in cases, the occupancy of beds in various hospitals has also declined considerably. According to figures of the district health department, the overall bed occupancy on May 1 was 2,725 out of total 3,262 Covid beds in the district. The occupancy figure was 100% for all the 759 ICU beds on May 1. However, the latest figures of June 4 show that the only 840 beds (about 24.64% of total beds) were occupied, registering a decline of 59% since May 1. Likewise, the overall ICU bed occupancy also declined to 34% with 267 of 785 ICU beds occupied in the district. “The overall bed availability has improved considerably, considering decline in active cases. With cases declining fast, it is expected that partial curfew will be lifted soon. But, when it opens, it is time for utmost precautions. So, effective enforcement is must,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/active-cases-decline-in-ghaziabad-relaxation-soon-from-partial-curfew-101622916505060.html
05-06-2021||Noida||As Ghaziabad plans paediatric ICUs, staff shortage looms large||Ghaziabad: Amid the efforts to set up paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) at different health-care facilities by June 20, the district health officials said that they are facing a shortage of specialist doctors and paramedical staff to operate the children’s wards. The health department has planned for about 300 PICU beds across the district, the officials said. While 10 PICU beds have come up at the Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital, another 50-bed dedicated facility for children will come up at a private hospital on the Delhi-Meerut Road. “We have set up a 10-bed PICU facility at our hospital. But we face a shortage of specialists. We have two paediatricians while a demand has been raised for three more. We have also asked the district chief medical officer for one technician and three nurses for the operation of the PICU,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar hospital. As per the recent directions of the UP government, ICUs should come up for children by June 20 to deal with any likely third wave of Covid-19. The government officials have estimated that a 10-bed PICU requires a team of 34 staff members, including paediatricians, nurses, physiotherapists and technicians. The officials of the district health department said that they tried to hire some staff on contractual basis but only few candidates arrived for an interview. “For the Sanjay Nagar hospital, we have also raised a demand for 12 OT technicians and three critical care technicians for the PICU ward. We have written to the National Health Mission (UP) about our requirements,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. “We have put on hold the creation of 20 PICU beds at District Women’ Hospital for now, while a gap analysis has been done for the proposed 50-bed paediatric facility at a private hospital on the Delhi-Meerut Road and the requirements sent to NHM (UP),” said Gupta. The gap analysis for the Delhi-Meerut Road facility was conducted on various parameters, including equipment, manpower and requirement of consumables, among others. The health department plans to acquire the private hospital, which will be operated as the city’s first dedicated child hospital,” the officials said. The analysis has found that the hospital requires at least two anaesthetists and 18 trained ICU nurses, besides equipment like oxygen cylinders, high-flow nasal cannula, BiPap machines and universal ventilators. According to the officials, 30 PICU beds, along with 50 isolation beds for children, are also complete at the government-acquired Santosh Medical College. “Besides, 20 more PICU beds are proposed at Santosh Medical College. So, the tally at the medical college will be 100 as directed by the government,” the CMO said.  Gupta also said that we have asked some private hospitals to reserve 10% of their beds for children.The UP government has already directed that at least 100 PICU/NICU (new-natal ICU) beds should come up at all medical colleges and another set of 25-30 PICU/NICU beds are to be created at district hospitals. Experts said that initiating PICUs is not a simple job as it requires roping in specialists, highly trained staff, variety of equipment and consumables. “The IMA is also waiting for certain modules from the UP government about the PICUs, and thereafter we will help government staff get training. About converting the 50-bed hospital at Meerut Road into a paediatric hospital, we estimate that considering all requirements, it will take another couple of months for making it operational,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/as-ghaziabad-plans-paediatric-icus-staff-shortage-looms-large-101622916445067.html

However, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay HC has also directed the Maharashtra University of Health Science (MUHS) to issue advisory asking medical students to produce an RT-PCR negative report along with their hall ticket at the examination centre on June 10. The court further said that before their subsequent paper (on June 15) students be asked to submit a negative rapid antigen test report. Responding to a PIL filed by HERD Educational and Medical Research Foundation, a Nagpur-based NGO and a physiotherapy student Nitesh Dhanraj Tantarpale, justice Avinash Gharote said that if the report is found positive, the examinee would not be allowed to write the paper. The single-judge bench, however, refused to give any interim relief and stay to MUHS’s winter 2020 (offline) examination for undergraduate students. The PIL sought online examinations or vaccination for nearly 40,000 undergraduates before giving the semester exams spread across 20 days and 173 centres. After the court order, the petitioner’s advocate Rahul Bhangde submitted that the students should be tested before the examination. Appearing for MUHS, Advocate Abhijit Deshpande argued that due to paucity of time, they wouldn’t be able to carry out the exercise of informing students. As an option, he suggested an upper limit for students to get the test done independently. Earlier, the MUHS strongly opposed the petition claiming that physical examinations were conducted last year as well. Deshpande pointed out that students were informed well in advance about offline tests. Two phases of the Winter-2020 examination are already complete, and the third phase will begin on June 10. Even the question papers have been dispatched to 173 examination centres and standard operating procedure (SOP) to sanitise the examination centres have been prepared and sent to all stakeholders. Questioning the locus of the petitioners, MUHS counsel also stated that only one student had come forward for the court’s intervention and wondered as to how medical students afraid of Covid-19 would treat patients. The HC also observed that there was a shortage of vaccines and questioned the fate of citizens if the would-be doctors were afraid of disease. The bench also favoured those students who should get their tests done and ordered RT-PCR negative report as a condition precedent to appear for the June 10 examination. The matter will now be heard by the regular division bench on June 14. Some students happy, others disappointedWhile students who wanted the exams to be conducted without any further postponement are happy with the court’s decision, several others took to social media platforms to share their displeasure.“RT-PCR test before the first paper is good, but what if a student contracts the virus after the exam begins? If a student manages to complete two out of the total papers, will they have to reappear for all exams again? Or will there be any different rules? The government needs to clarify all such issues,” said Brijesh Sutaria, parent of a medical student.Several student groups, including the Maharashtra Students Welfare Association, were hoping for offline exams this year, but the court’s decision has led to disappointment. “Colleges are assuring that social distancing will be maintained in exam halls, but what about hostels? Most of us will end up sharing rooms with three other students, making it easier for the virus to spread,” said a student.Usually scheduled to take place in the month of December-January, the second and third-year MBBS, BDS, and other paramedical and certificate course exams were postponed thrice this year due to rising Covid-19 cases recorded across the state. From January this year, to February the exams were then scheduled to take place in April. However, due to the second wave of Covid-19 gripping the nation, these exams were once again postponed to finally take place in physical mode between June 10 and 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/medical-exams-students-must-submit-covid-negative-report-before-exams-says-hc-101622915544945.html
05-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Insurance firm employee siphons off ₹8cr, booked||The Marine Drive police have booked an assistant manager of leading public sector general insurer, United India Insurance Company Limited, for allegedly siphoning off ₹8.09 crore from the company’s accounts. The accused purportedly diverted the money into his seven personal accounts with the help of other accomplices.The accused, Khushel Singh, was posted at the Churchgate office of the insurance company and was looking after accounting in the corporate cell. As per the complaint submitted by Jaideep S Sinha, 56, deputy general manager at the company, on May 21, the company’s principal office in Chennai received a communication from a private bank’s Mumbai office informing them about irregularities linked to their current account.When the complainant’s company carried out a preliminary inquiry into the irregularities, it was found that assistant manager Singh had diverted some funds from the company’s account to around seven bank accounts held by him in a personal capacity. Inquiry revealed that between November 13, 2020, to April 23, 2021, the accused had in all siphoned off ₹80,998,795 in 21 unauthorised transactions. The money was diverted to Singh’s seven accounts in Mumbai and Jaipur, states the first information report (FIR).The inquiry has also revealed that Singh has also diverted funds to some other individuals. Details of these people are being obtained, said a police officer. The police have booked Singh under sections 409 (Criminal breach of trust by a public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.“If money is found in the said accounts of Singh, they would be frozen and later the funds would be shown as recovery in the case. We are also checking how Singh managed to dodge the audit system of the company ensuring unauthorised transactions go undetected,” said an officer from Marine Drive police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-insurance-firm-employee-siphons-off-8cr-booked-101622915365607.html
05-06-2021||Mumbai||Mangrove cell to move Bombay HC for removal of excess mangroves in Thane Creek||Officials in the state forest department’s mangrove cell are currently drafting a writ petition, to be submitted to the Bombay high court (HC) in the next week or so, seeking permission for removal of excess mangrove trees in Thane Creek within the boundary of the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary (TCFS).Though officials did not specify the exact area affected by new mangrove growth or the number of trees that need removal, they said that only those mangroves that have come up after 2015 — when TCFS was declared a protected area under the Indian Wildlife Act — will be removed.There are at least 12 different species of mangroves and mangrove associates found in the Thane Creek, but most of the “excess” growth is that of one dominant species — Avicenna marina — which could pose a threat to the overall biodiversity. However, the removed saplings will be replanted elsewhere after being sent to a nursery.“Removal of the excess mangroves is necessary to ensure that there is room enough for flamingos and other wader birds within the sanctuary. Monitoring and management of mangroves is also a tenet under the management plan that we have prepared for TCFS. We have yet to work out the area affected, but if the court asks then of course it will be provided. The petition should be filed soon,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell).Stalin D, director of NGO Vanashakti, said such a step is imperative. “The overgrowth should be removed at the earliest. It has taken a lot of effort to get the sanctuary declared in the first place, and if we want to the keep the environment conducive for flamingos and other wader birds, we need to manage it effectively. Growth of excess mangroves also impacts fishermen and the navigability of the channel.”According to a 2005 HC order issued in response to a petition filed by the Bombay Environment Action Group (BEAG) in 2004, all construction and removal of mangrove areas require permission from HC directly, and multiple user agencies (including MMRDA, maritime board, fisheries department, among others) have from time to time filed writ petitions to execute various projects.However, Debi Goenka, former member of BEAG, and second appellant in the 2004 petition leading to HC’s orders, disagreed with these developments. “The Mangrove Foundation was set up to protect mangroves. Surely, the priority should be to stop the flow of silt and desilting, and not cutting mangroves that have grown on the mud flats. Indiscriminate quarrying in Navi Mumbai and construction activities in the catchment area of Thane creek are the real issues, as are the constantly expanding waste dumps in Bhandup, Deonar and Kanjurmarg. It may also behoove the mangrove foundation to examine how the tidal flows into Thane creek have been impacted by construction activities, which could help plan better management steps than simply removing mangroves which in turn support their own ecosystems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mangrove-cell-to-move-bombay-hc-for-removal-of-excess-mangroves-in-thane-creek-101622915364905.html
05-06-2021||Mumbai||New tech of inflatable hangars poised to take off in Indian aircraft maintenance industry||In February, just before the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, India’s infrastructure major GMR Group announced setting up of Asia’s first inflatable hangar at its Hyderabad airport, bringing a new dimension to aircraft and engine maintenance and repair in the country. The introduction of this cost-effective technology, which is in use by some aviation companies in Europe and Middle East Gulf, assumes importance given that India is set to expand both its aircraft fleet and aviation infrastructure with hundreds of airports over the next few years. Some of which will require aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) as well.The government has, over the past four years, made various announcements to construct or revive around 150 airports, including some airstrips in the country. Also, amid the government’s efforts to make the country an MRO hub, new ventures have also been reportedly announced by multiple players including Boeing, Airbus, Hindustan Aeronautics and Pratt & Whitney for setting up repair facilities in India.According to aviation industry estimates, hangars, which are used to protect the aircraft from bad weather and direct sunlight during MRO processes, are an important part of India’s USD 1.7 billion MRO business. However, it takes a considerable amount of time to source an available hangar to undertake unscheduled repairs. On the contrary, an inflatable hangar is cost-effective, reduces downtime and cost as compared to building a conventional hangar, while at the same time catering to all the functionality, safety features and structural stability of the conventional hangar.Inflatable hangar is formed by low pressure tubes aligned parallel to each other forming a “rib-cage” structure. A permanent structure, just like any other conventional one, inflatable hangars are for use in all-weather structures made from PVC fabric having a life span of over 15 years.These hangars, which vary in size, can be used as a one-to-one alternative for conventional hangars, explains Ashok Gopinath, chief executive officer (CEO) GMR Aero Technic that brought the inflatable hangar technology to the country.“It is a cost-effective option which can shorten the time of construction. As a part of airport infrastructure, it can be used to provide line, ad-hoc and base maintenance checks on the aircraft,” he said.The inflatable hangar is designed to withstand wind speeds up to 158.4 kilometres per hour (kmph) and can handle temperatures from -30 degrees Celsius to +70 degrees Celsius, thereby creating an alternative for conventional solid metal hangars that are both expensive and time consuming to build.A conventional single-aisle aircraft hangar, at present, requires an investment of around ₹50 crore and takes over 18 months to construct. An inflatable hangar, on the other hand, can be installed in about three to four months at less than one-fourth the cost, around ₹12 crore, which includes lighting, fire-fighting, ventilation, doors etc.GMR Group’s one-bay narrow-body inflatable hangar is designed to accommodate one Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 series aircraft.At present, the country has 19 conventional hangars belonging to national carrier Air India’s subsidiary Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL), GMR Aero Technic and Air Works India spread across different states. Around 3,344sqmt area is required to accommodate one narrow-body aircraft in a hangar around 7,000sqmt for a wide-body aircraft.As per industry experts, of the total MRO cost of an air operator fleet, engine maintenance cost accounts for 45%, component maintenance 25%, airframe and other costs account for 35%. According to aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri, India currently has around 700 commercial aircraft and will need 1,750-2,100 aircraft in the next 20 years. However, according to Boeing’s latest market outlook, India will need more than 2,200 new jets valued at nearly $320 billion over the next 20 years. “There is a tremendous scope for such hangars as many new airports will come up in India. Moreover, it is an ideal solution for operators and MROs for the regional connectivity scheme,” says Pulak Sen, founder and secretary general, MRO Association of India. “It is a useful technology in an MRO operation that can be used to park an aircraft for routine maintenance.” As building a conventional hangar takes around 18 months and allotting hangar space by an airport operator is a time consuming exercise, it is better to have an inflatable hangar installed at a fractional cost and time, Sen said.The cost of these hangars vary depending on the size. There are smaller ones, which can accommodate only one helicopter or a small aircraft to the largest one which can accommodate up to three Boeing 777s.“With awareness of such an option in India, these hangars can be deployed in bigger numbers going forward. However, only time will tell how the Indian market accepts this new technology,” said Sen. Echoing similar views, Gopinath said, “In the future, it (higher adoption of the technology by MRO operators in the country) depends on the demand and feasibility. If authorities are seeking for more permanent structures, they may opt for conventional hangars.”However, few upcoming airports are likely to consider inflatable hangars to make available immediate hangarage to their airline customers for the aircraft on ground, Gopinath said.“These hangars may be deployed at off-line or remote stations for smaller checks and quick turn-around of aircraft. They can also be in addition to normal hangars to take care of additional work loads, which an MRO may get,” said HR Jagannath, former CEO of AIESL.“But the main issue with inflatable hangar is the location where they are to be deployed. It should have access to the airport runway so that aircraft can come into the hangar. Mostly such hangars are deployed at accident sites, where extensive repairs to the aircraft can be carried out,” he added. European aviation major Airbus has been using portable inflatable hangers for many years to perform aircraft repairs at difficult or remote locations as a temporary measure and finds their transportability to be useful.“With the ongoing major growth of aviation in India, it is critical that airlines have access to world-class maintenance facilities within the borders,” Airbus said in a statement to HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/new-tech-of-inflatable-hangars-poised-to-take-off-in-indian-aircraft-maintenance-industry-101622915304922.html

She also claimed that since she was from a lower caste, Pise’s mother Alka, 50, and his brother Sagar, 30, got him married elsewhere and that they assaulted her and her relatives when they went to talk to them.The accused claimed that their relationship was consensual and they ended their relationship long ago. According to Pise, he lost contact with informant since few years. However, the informant would occasionally contact the applicant as a friend to share her issues.The court after hearing both the sides said, “Whether the physical relation between applicant and informant was consensual or whether it was forcible is the fact which needs to be investigated in this case and for effective investigation of said fact, according to me, custodial interrogation of applicant is necessary in this case.”As per the case registered with Dongri police, the complainant had joined the police force in 2013 and was posted at Dongri police station. Pise was also posted there and as a temporary staying arrangement, the senior inspector had given them accommodation in police quarters where the woman stayed in one room and male officers including Pise stayed in the room opposite hers.It is alleged that, Pise tried to get close to her and when she objected, he proposed.

05-06-2021||Mumbai||Forming government with Ajit Pawar was a mistake, says Devendra Fadnavis||Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said he committed a mistake by forming a short-lived government of three-days with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar in November 2019. He, however, said he does not regret it because he thought the move was right at the time. “It would have been better had we not attempted to form the government with Ajit Pawar. But at that point of time I thought it was the right decision,” Fadnavis said while speaking at an online programme organised by Marathi daily Loksatta on Friday. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Shiv Sena alliance won enough seats to win majority in the state in the 2019 Assembly elections. However, the two parties could not form the government due to their disagreement over sharing chief ministership. The Sena staked its claim on the top job in the government, but the BJP refused to accept its demand for chief ministership by rotation. Following this, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray started talking to NCP chief Sharad Pawar, which later led to formation of the Sena-NCP-Congress coalition in Maharashtra. However, while the three parties were working out a power-sharing deal, Fadnavis shocked the three parties when he hurriedly took oath as CM along with NCP’s Ajit Pawar as deputy CM. While the BJP claimed that the NCP had joined hands with it, Sharad Pawar denied the same and said that his nephew had turned rebel with a few party MLAs. The three parties closed ranks and in next two days, senior Pawar managed to get all rebel MLAs including Ajit back to the party. Fadnavis was left with no option but to tender resignation instead of making an attempt to prove majority on the floor of the Assembly. Later, Ajit was made deputy CM in the Thackeray-led government. “When you are stabbed in the back (by Sena by not forming the government with the BJP), you have to stay alive in politics. And to stay alive, you have to do whatever is needed to be done. So it was an attempt to give a befitting reply,”Fadnavis remarked as he sought to justify the move. He also said his image was dented among BJP supporters because of the move. Fadnavis was interacting in an online programme organised by Marathi daily Loksatta on Friday. CM Thackeray also participated in the interaction on the same platform on Saturday.Thackeray said the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government comprising of the Sena, NCP and Congress will complete its term. “We had cordial relationship with BJP leaders from previous generations. The Sena never wanted to part ways with the BJP. We have now joined hands with the Congress and NCP and will continue to work together in the interest of the people. We are working together honestly and there would not be problem in completing the term,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/forming-government-with-ajit-pawar-was-a-mistake-says-devendra-fadnavis-101622915244972.html
05-06-2021||Mumbai||Local trains in Mumbai will not be opened for women, general public yet: BMC||While several restrictions in Mumbai and most cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) are set to be relaxed by the Maharashtra government from Monday, the wait for the general public to resume travel to the workplace by suburban trains will be longer. Only the frontline staff and those working in the essential sectors would be allowed to travel by local trains. Though the state government has allowed all women commuter to travel by trains, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has ruled it out.Local train services for the general public were suspended for the second time on April 15 in a bid to control the spread of coronavirus in the city.The Maharashtra government in its unlock order under BreakTheChain on Saturday early morning had stated that essential service employees, people travelling for medical purposes and women commuters could be allowed to travel by the local trains. Mumbai that comes under level three of the unlock order, could permit women commuters along with essential care workers to travel.However, the state government then clarified the decision on allowing women commuters to travel by local trains would be taken by the BMC, which is the local authority to handle the pandemic.Further, the BMC’s decision on local trains would apply to the entire MMR, the government said. Though Mumbai suburban train network is spread across the MMR, the majority of it falls in Mumbai city.“In case of travel by local trains, respective DMAs (Disaster Management Authority) has been given authority to impose further restrictions on the travel for level 1,2 and 3. It is specifically directed that any further restrictions that might be imposed by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai under these rules on the travel by local trains, will hold for the entire MMR region. It is also informed that if any other DMA wishes to impose any different restrictions on travel by local trains in the MMR region, they must do so in consultation with MCGM. This is to ensure that these restrictions can be imposed smoothly throughout the journey that may be taken by passengers,’’ said a clarification issued by Aseem Gupta, principal secretary, disaster management, relief and rehabilitation department.The BMC, however, on Saturday evening issued a notification stating women commuters will not be allowed to travel by local trains and employees working in essential care services, people travelling for medical purposes will only be allowed to commute.Passenger associations have objected to not permitting women commuters. “This is an extremely wrong step by the BMC. If offices and shops are opening up then they should allow passengers to commute by local trains. Women commuters should have been allowed to travel first and then other passengers in restricted timings. BMC should look into this immediately or else citizens will again have to travel three to four hours to reach their destination.” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.Meanwhile, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport(BEST) will not be allowing passengers to travel on full seating capacity in the BEST buses from Monday. No standing passenger will be allowed to commute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/local-trains-in-mumbai-will-not-be-opened-for-women-general-public-yet-bmc-101622915064976.html

The step was taken following deaths of 5 labourers, who had consumed spurious liquor recovered from a canal in Aligarh on Thursday. On Friday too, unclaimed liquor bottles were traced from a canal in Akarabad in Aligarh by a labourer who died after consuming the illicit liquor. As per rough estimates, so far over 100 people have died in the last week’s hooch tragedy. It is believed that those who possess the spurious liquor are now dumping them in remote places and canals to avoid police action.“We have asked the public to inform the police at 112 about such liquor bottles. Vigil has been enhanced near canals and villages nearby to them. The police officials in nearby districts of Etah, Kasganj and Mathura have also been alerted and the irrigation department has also been urged to remain vigilant,” said SSP Aligarh Kalanidhi Nathani. He said 17 cases have been registered and 40 accused sent to jail after being booked under Goonda/Gangster Act. Also, their illegal properties are being demolished. The reward on absconding accused Rishi Sharma has been increased to ₹75,000. “Six police teams have been constituted and raids are being conducted at suspected spots in Haryana, Delhi, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan to nab those absconding and linked with hooch tragedy. We have arrested Neeraj Chaudhary who is carrying a reward of ₹25,000 and is brother-in-law of jailed liquor mafia Anil Chaudhary,” he said. On Saturday, the Upper Ganga Canal passing through Aligarh was searched for such bottles, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aligarh-hooch-tragedy-cops-make-public-announcement-to-alert-villagers-against-unclaimed-liquor-101622915004911.html
05-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Badlapur CBSE school calls for Class 12 practical exams, parents demand cancellation||Days after the Union government announced the decision to scrap Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 12 theory exams, a school in Badlapur received flak for scheduling practical exams starting Sunday (June 6) for the Class 12 students. Late Saturday, almost 85% of the Class 12 batch from the school decided to not attend exams starting Sunday.While the school said practical exams have to be taken for Class 12 students, especially, since theory exams have been scrapped, parents feel the situation is still not safe for students to attend physical classes or exams.“No other school in and around Navi Mumbai is conducting practical exams at present, then why is this school so insistent? Students who are currently in quarantine or recovering from Covid-19 are a worried lot, and so are the rest, who are afraid of contracting the virus during exams,” said a parent of a student studying at Poddar Brio International School in Badlapur. He added that with no official word from CBSE officials, many parents are feeling unsure about the need for the exams to be held in the current scenario.These practical exams were originally scheduled to take place in April and May but had to be postponed due to the high number of Covid-19 cases across the city and country. “With no theory exams in place, students’ practical exam marks will have to be considered and for that, we are conducting these exams. Students’ safety is our priority and all safety measures will be in place during the exams,” said Rashmi Singh, principal of the school.Singh further added that the school, situated in a ‘green zone’ has already got permission from the local collector’s office to hold physical exams for their students in batches. Parents, however, are finding the situation ambiguous. “As per the original schedule, all schools have to upload the practical exam marks of class 12 students by June 11, and therefore, the school is hurrying into the exams. Instead, they should approach the examinations authority and demand for an extension in deadline,” said another parent. Mahesh Dharmadhikari, the CBSE regional head, Pune, told HT that conducting practical exams is a decision left on individual schools. “Schools can’t force the parents, but whoever is willing, a school can hold practical exams for them. In case students can’t appear for exams due to medical reasons, schools will have to make arrangements in the future,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaibadlapur-cbse-school-calls-for-class-12-practical-exams-parents-demand-cancellation-101622914884916.html

Moreover, the police officials gifted saplings to people on the road who were strictly following corona protocols like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), central, Chiranjeev Nath Sinha got the idea to observe World Environment Day during corona times. “We decided to gift saplings to promote tree plantation among people, considering the need to improve the world around us during this corona outbreak,” said Sinha, who was recently appointed as new ambassador for Lucknow Zoo due to his love and care for wildlife. Sinha said saplings were distributed at over 500 homes where different restaurants and online services delivered food throughout the day. For this purpose, the police tied up with famous and renowned food outlets and two online delivery services to deliver a sapling as a surprise gift to each of their customers who had booked online food. “We formally inaugurated the initiative by distributing saplings to people wearing masks and maintaining social distancing on Shahnajaf Road. People enjoyed it as they had not expected this lovely gift from the police,” he said. Sinha was recently recognized by PETA (People for ethical Treatment of Animals), India, for his service to wild animals during last year’s lockdown. The officer, with help of his team, has regularly been distributing food and water to wild animals in Lucknow Zoo and other parts of the state capital since the corona outbreak last year.

On Saturday, Pune reported a day temperature at 31.1 degree Celsius and night temperature at 21 degree Celsius. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting department of IMD Pune said that as of Saturday, there is an offshore trough, that is extended low pressure area from south Maharashtra to south Kerala coast “At the same time there is one upper air circulation adjacent to the Konkan and Goa coast. Because of these two weather systems, the southern part of Maharashtra is getting continuous rainfall for the last 48 hours. So now monsoon is active now over Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Satara, Kolhapur, Sangli and Solapur district,” said Kashyapi. He added that by June 6, Monsoon may advance in some more parts of Maharashtra. “Monsoon will be active by June 6 over the southern part of Konkan and Goa, Central Maharashtra and parts of Marathwada as well. After that from June 7, the rainfall activity over Maharashtra will reduce,” said Kashyapi. He further noted that along the west coast, the monsoon has advanced more quickly than predicted whereas on the east coast side, the advancement is not much as of now. The northern limit of monsoon passes through the Northern Limit of Monsoon (NLM) passes through Harnai, Solapur, Raichur, Karnool, Tirupati and Cuddalore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/southwest-monsoon-enters-maharashtra-city-to-receive-rainfall-until-june-7-101622909364490.html
05-06-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh to promote wetlands as tourism, water sports hubs||Uttar Pradesh plans to promote major wetlands in the state as tourism, educational, recreation and water sports hubs. These include eight sites designated as wetlands of international importance (Ramsar Sites). UP has the maximum number of Ramsar sites among the 42 in India and Punjab, with six sites, is next to UP. The eight wetlands of international importance in UP are: Upper Ganga river (Bulandshahr), Sarsai Nawar Jheel (Etawah), Saman Bird Sanctuary (Mainpuri), Sandi Bird Sanctuary (Hardoi), Samaspur Bird Sanctuary (Rae Bareli), Parvati Arga Bird Sanctuary (Gonda), Nawabganj Bird Sanctuary (Unnao), and Sur Sarovar (Agra). “Due to the efforts of the forest and environment departments of UP, so many of our wetlands have been designated as wetlands of international importance. The first site to get this status was the Upper Ganga river in 2005 and till 2019 this was the only Ramsar site in UP. Six other sites got this status in 2019 while another one was added to the list in 2020,” said a senior officer of UP forest department. “We are according these sites more importance than national parks as these are rich in biodiversity. The wetlands are home to many plants (terrestrial and aquatic) and animals (terrestrial, aquatic, amphibians, reptiles, birds, insects). The state government also plans to develop them as destinations for nature lovers and tourists,” he said. The development plan includes the construction of roads for easy accessibility, boarding and lodging facilities, movement around the area, recreational activities like boating and water sports and online facilities, said a senior forest department official. “The sites will be developed under the financial collaboration of the central and the state governments (the central government will bear 60% of the cost and the balance will be borne by the state government). Most of the project proposals have been sent to the central government,” said the official. “It’s difficult to comment on the timeline for the project because of the interruptions due to the Covid pandemic. But these sites should be developed in a couple of years. Otherwise, most of the sites are still very attractive for tourists and nature lovers,” he added. 8 UP Wetlands of International Importance Sur Sarovar, the latest one to be designated as a Ramsar site in UP, is also known as Keetham Lake. A man-made reservoir, originally created to supply water to Agra. With a rich eco-system, the wetland is a refuge for resident and migratory birds, and more than 60 species of fish. The site is important for bird species that migrate on the central Asian flyway, with over 30,000 water birds known to visit the reservoir annually. Upper Ganga River (Brijghat to Narora Stretch) in Bulandshahr is a shallow river stretch of the Ganges with intermittent small stretches of deep-water pools. The river provides a habitat for Ganges River Dolphin, Gharial, Crocodile, six species of turtles, otters, 82 species of fish and over 100 species of birds. This river stretch holds importance for thousands of pilgrims and is used for holy dips for spiritual purification. Sarsai Nawar Jheel is a permanent marsh in Etawah. It is an example of co-habitation of humans and wildlife. Farming practices play roles in sustaining the water bird habitats. Sarus Cranes flock to this region. The wetland is also a site of spiritual and religious significance with the nearby Hajari Mahadev temple visited by thousands of pilgrims every year. Sandi Bird Sanctuary is a freshwater marsh in Hardoi. Rich in aquatic plants, the site provides a productive habitat for waterfowl with over 40,000 individuals counted in 2018. It is home to over 1% of the South Asian populations of common teal (Anas crecca), Red-Crested Pochard (Netta rufina) and Ferruginous Duck (Aythya nyroca). The wetland is a popular recreational and tourism destination and supports farmers as a source of livestock fodder. Samaspur Bird Sanctuary in Rae Bareli is a perennial lowland marsh. Annual counts regularly find more than 75,000 birds, with over 250 resident and migrant species. The sanctuary harbours threatened species such as the endangered Egyptian Vulture and Pallas’s Fish Eagle, and more than 1% of the South Asian population of the vulnerable Common Pochard. At least 46 freshwater fish species use the wetland. Saman Bird Sanctuary in Mainpuri is a seasonal oxbow lake (U-shaped). It provides refuge to over 50,000 water birds (187 bird species have been recorded) and is particularly important as a wintering site for many migrants including the Greylag Goose, with over 1% of the South Asian population present during winter. Vulnerable species including Sarus Crane and Greater Spotted Eagle are also found here. Parvati Arga Bird Sanctuary in Gonda is a combination of two oxbow lakes. It offers exceptional habitats for water birds, providing both roosting and breeding sites with over 1,00,000 birds documented in annual counts. The sanctuary is a refuge for some of India’s threatened vulture species: the critically endangered White Rumped Vulture and Indian Vulture, and the endangered Egyptian Vulture have all been recorded. Some ancient temples around the lakes are of religious significance and encourage tourism. Nawabganj Bird Sanctuary in Unnao is a shallow marshland. Monsoon rains feed this diverse wetland while the Sharda Canal supplies additional water. The sanctuary supports recreation and tourism activities as well as local biodiversity. It is a haven for birds, with 25,000 water birds regularly recorded and 220 resident and migratory species documented. Among these are globally threatened species including the endangered Egyptian Vulture and Pallas’s Fish Eagle. Protection and afforestation measures have helped increase the overall diversity of wildlife, with golden jackal and jungle cat now present here. WHAT ARE RAMSAR SITES? A Ramsar site is a wetland site designated to be of international importance under the Ramsar convention The Convention on Wetlands is an intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. The Convention was adopted in the Iranian city of Ramsar in 1971 and came into force in 1975. Since then, almost 90% of UN member states, from all the world’s geographic regions, have acceded to become “Contracting Parties”. The Convention’s mission is “the conservation and wise use of all wetlands through local and national actions and international cooperation, as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development throughout the world”.

05-06-2021||Pune||FYJC admission only after Class 12 result pattern is declared: Samant||Despite the cancellation of the Class 12 exams for state board, admission for courses like Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) and Bachelor of Science (BSc) will be decided only after the result pattern for Class 12 is declared, said Uday Samant, minister for higher and technical education. He was interacting with the media on Saturday at the College of Engineering, Pune (CoEP). “For technical courses, CET will be held by the end of July or August first week. This exam, like last year, will be conducted online. We will be increasing the centres twice this time for the examination,” said Samant. He further added that in case a CET is taken, it will be based on the syllabus of the state board. While talking about this academic year, Samant further added that all professional courses this year will continue to be online. “Offline lectures or practicals are not feasible as a precaution for the third wave. All courses will continue online. The online system for higher and technical education is functioning and so the structure is ready,” said Samant. While talking about the fee concession in colleges for students, Samant said that the Fee Regulation Authority (FRA) will decide on the same. “FRA will be formed, and the decision will be taken. If CET is held for courses like BA and BCom, the students will not need to pay any fee as they have already paid for the Class 12 examination fee,” said Samant. While talking about the teachers’ recruitment, Samant said that new teachers will be recruited. “As the process of recruitment of teachers needs 11 to 12 months, the teachers will be joining for the next academic year that is 2022-2023,” said the minister. Samant further said that a divisional office for Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University (YCMOU) will be starting in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. “A second campus of CoEP in Chikhali was also given allocation of ₹25 crore. The groundbreaking ceremony for the same will be done very soon. We want to give CoEP the status of state Institute of Technology status which will be comparable to IITs,” said Samant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fyjc-admission-only-after-class-12-result-pattern-is-declared-samant-101622909244637.html

I came into politics to help my father. A pandemic after 100 years happens during my tenure as CM. I have never shied away from responsibility. I am doing what I can to the best of my ability," he said."If people who voted for me do not survive the COVID- 19 pandemic, what is the use of power," he said."Acting with lust for power amid COVID-19 will lead to anarchy," he said in a veiled attack on the BJP.On Sena's previous alliance with the BJP, Uddhav said there was a trust deficit in the relations after the demise of BJP leaders Pramod Mahajan and Gopinath Munde."The BJP is now Delhi-centric. In an alliance, there has to be openness to air differences and resolve them. My new allies (NCP and Congress) treat me with respect. The MVA is an alliance where we had differences, so we are more open now," he said.There were reports of disagreements between the various stakeholders of the MVA government over easing of Covid-19 restrictions in the state, but deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar told reporters on Saturday that even though the government has been formed by multiple parties, the word of the chief minister is final.“There is no disagreement in the MVA government. We are in constant discussion over the unlocking and there is no confusion. The CM is also constantly conversing with the people over social media. We might be a multi-party government but the word of Thackeray as the head of state is final.” Pawar told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/never-wanted-to-be-the-cm-uddhav-opens-up-on-bjp-sena-rift-in-maharashtra-101622907947195.html

This is significant as Jharkhand was preparing for the probable third wave of Covid-19 which is was likely to affect those below 14 years the most.  As per official statistics of Jamshedpur , the state's second worst hit district by the pandemic after capital city Ranchi, of the total children infected, 1,180 were male and the rest female. Tata Steel medical advisor Dr Rajan Chaudhry on Saturday said 110 infected children below the age of 14 years were treated at Tata Main Hospital (TMH) till date, of which only one child died due to comorbidities. “Covid-19 is feared to affect children most in its third wave because there’s no vaccine for them as yet,” said Dr Chaudhry. According to officials, there are about 4 lakh children below 14 years of age in East Singhbhum. As per an Indian Academy of Paediatricians (IAP) estimate, Jamshedpur presently has 70 child specialists, 195 normal beds and 19 ventilators. This translates into one normal bed for every 2,052 children, one doctor per 5,715 children and one ventilator per 21,053 children.IAP-Jamshedpur president Dr Mintu Akhouri Sinha said the resource gap was so huge that it’s not possible to reduce it in the near future. “The best option is optimum use of available resources and minimise requirement of hospitalisation and ICU beds. Early detection of cases through Rapid Antigen Test, as RT-PCR results take longer, and immediate treatment, preferably in home isolation,” Dr Akhouri said.He said IAP has submitted a detailed road map paper to prepare for the probable third wave to the district health department. “We have advised to set up isolation centres at community buildings and schools for Covid-19 positive children with their mothers in every village, training of ANMs, sahiyas and sevikas so that they provide preliminary treatment in villages,” said Dr Akhouri.The district administration has already set up a 50-bed ICU at Jamshedpur Sadar Hospital, while all block hospitals have been asked to set up 30-bed ICUs, said civil surgeon Dr AK Lal . “Another 59-bed ICU for children will be functional at MGMMCH within next few days apart from the existing NICU and paediatric ICU (PICU). TMH and other big private hospitals have been asked to set up separate 200-300-bed children wards where mothers can stay with sick children ,” he said.Besides, process was on to identify suitable space for a new PICU and NICU in the district as per state government’s directions, the civil surgeon said. Meanwhile, West Singhbhum health department nodal officer Sachindra Kumar Baraik said they were setting up a 40-bed PICU at Chaibasa Sadar Hospital (CSH). The district has reported 231 children below 14 years testing Covid-19 positive between May 2020 and April 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-2k-kids-infected-in-jamshedpur-so-far-101622907324344.html

05-06-2021||Other||Niti Aayog ranking: Under fire, JD(U) renews demand for special status to Bihar||PATNAThe recent ranking of Bihar by Niti Aayog as the worst performer among all states in sustainable development goals has set off a heated war of words among political parties in the state, with the ruling Janata Dal (United) renewing its pitch for a special status for Bihar, a demand which could put stress with its ties to the BJP, also a part of the ruling alliance in the state. On Saturday, JD(U)’s national general secretary K C Tyagi said that according special status to Bihar, a long- pending demand of the party, is the only way to ensure industrial progress and urbanisation as it would attract investors to the state and set up factories and commercial establishments because of tax incentives. “We have been raising the demand for special status to Bihar before both UP A and NDA governments at the Centre. The Niti Aayog report has pointed to various shortcomings. But why hasn’t it given suggestions for its remedy? After bifurcation of Bihar in 2000, power plants, industries, coal mines and tourist spots went to Jharkhand. Despite that, Bihar has progressed by registering 10.5% growth in state gross domestic product, which is higher than national GDP,” he said. Asked if the fresh demand of special status to Bihar was a new strategy to put pressure at the Centre, Tyagi said it was not the case. “We feel it is time Bihar gets special status so that it takes bigger strides in development and become an industrial state as like Maharashtra and Gujarat. All states in eastern India, be it Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand and Bihar need stimulus to improve their social and economic indexes,” he said. The Niti Aayog, in its latest report on sustainable development goals (SDG) index where states and union territories are evaluated on various parameters like health, education, gender, economic growth, climate change, among others, has ranked Bihar as the worst performing state. The report has given ammunition to the Opposition parties, especially the main opposition party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) led by former chief minister Lalu Prasad. “Bihar’s ranking at the bottom is the result of the relentless efforts of the 16 years of the BJP-JD(U) and negative politics. Those prejudiced people who have been harping on jungle raj rhetoric are now silent and hiding, The state is ruined but these people would never allow social economic justice,” Prasad tweeted. In another tweet, he wrote, “Nitish is full of negativity. He closed down several health centres opened during my tenure as chief minister of Bihar and converted them into ghost houses and various school buildings have turned into garages. It is only because of this that Bihar has ranked the top from the bottom in the NITI Aayog report. The so-called double engine (government) has turned into trouble engine.”His son and leader of Opposition in the state, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, tweeted, “Bihar has been placed at the bottom for the third consecutive year. This sums up the 16 years of BJP-Nitish rule’s progress on paper.” Congress MLC Premchand Mishra the ranking has put a question on the tall claims of the government about taking big initiatives in economic progress and eradication of poverty. “The chief minister should explain as why the Niti Aayog does not find any substantial progress in state’s social and economic indices despite a budget outlay of ₹2 lakh crore. It signifies that all development claims are on paper and apparently a large sum of budget outlay is being pilfered. The chief minister and the entire cabinet should either prove the SDG report as false or else resign by taking moral responsibility for Bihar being ranked among worst performing state,” Mishra said. JD(U) spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan hit back. “Well now Lalu Yadav is talking of Niti Aayog. He forgot his tenure when people of India were only talking about the crimes in Bihar. If Bihar had special status, the situation would have been different. For this situation, RJD and Congress are responsible.” BJP leader and spokesperson Ajit Choudhary said, “Now Lalu Yadav has no work to do, so he is giving unnecessary ‘gyan’. I think he forgot his regime when his uneducated wife became the chief minister of Bihar. What happened at that time?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/niti-aayog-ranking-under-fire-jd-u-renews-demand-for-special-status-to-bihar-101622906844413.html
05-06-2021||Other||Bodies in Ganga bring back focus on electric crematoria||PATNAThe sight of partially decomposed and bloated bodies floating in river Ganga in Buxar last month, which led to a nationwide outrage, has once again turned the spotlight on the need for more electric crematoria in the state, especially for towns situated along the banks of Ganga. There are 11 electric crematoria in the state. Of these, six are in Patna district — Bans Ghat-2, Gulbi Ghat-2, Khajekalan-1 and Mokama-1) — besides one each in Sonepur, Bhagalpur, Munger, Purnia and Hajipur. Two of them, at Hajipur and Mokama, are out of order. Buxar has none. District magistrate (DM) Aman Samir said the administration has been pursuing the matter. “Proposal for installation of an electric crematorium was sent to the urban development department six months back,” he said.In 2018, the Patna High Court had directed the state government to construct at least one electric crematorium in each of the 38 districts, but they are yet to see light of day.In the absence of an electric crematorium or earmarked cremation grounds, poor families often find the expenses of traditional method of cremation too high and prefer the “Jal Samadhi” for the dead by immersing the body in the river, residents at Buxar said.Vikas Chandra, a Patna-based social activist, said there’s been the demand for this facility in all the 38 districts of the state. “Steps in this direction were initiated by the government in 2018, but things are still half-way. The electric crematoria at Samariya Ghat in Begusarai, Gaya and Gopalganj are still under construction,” he said.To add to the problem, there are many districts located along the Ganga where there is no earmarked space for cremation. For instance, in Buxar, Muktidhaam is the only earmarked cremation ground. “Things become difficult during rainy season. It gets inundated by river water and people have no option but to dump bodies in river water,” says Shiv Prakash Rai , a Buxar resident, adding that people from four districts, Buxar, Sasaram, Kaimur and Bhojpur turn up to perform last rites at Muktidhaam, which is believed to be sacred. “A cost-effective electric crematorium would have proved to be very useful for many families,” he says. Rai’s view was endorsed by Rachna Patil, district magistrate of Munger, a town also situated along the Ganga bank. “It can be very effective in curbing pollution. Munger is also located along the Ganga river. But the good thing is it already has an electric crematorium,” she said. The silver liningThe only solace is that after the bodies were found in Ganga, subsequent studies have not found any adverse noticeable changes in water quality. “Surprisingly, no variation has been noticed in the quality of water in Ganga after the bodies were found. We have started weekly monitoring of water samples from the river. In fact, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has directed us to monitor water quality on weekly basis and check the water quality on bacteriological parameters as well as on conventional parameters,” said S Chandrashekhar, member secretary, Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB).The conventional parameters of pH, colour, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in water are being monitored on weekly basis and not much difference has been observed in water quality, he said.Earlier, this monitoring was done fortnightly. The CPCB has also emphasized the need for Covid virus analysis of the water by National Chemical Laboratory in Pune, which has recently established protocol for testing Covid-19 virus in sewage. Recently, a team of experts from Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow, also visited Buxar for the collection of samples. “Samples have been sent to Pune for tests. We are waiting for its report,” said Chandrashekhar.Ajay Yadav, former state convener of the Ganga Samagra, an NGO working to keep Ganga clean, said, “Dumping of bodies in the river needs to be stopped. There should be proper arrangements of cremation at every place.”Rajiv Ranjan, an environmentalist, said traditional method of cremation is very expensive in any case. “A huge amount of wood is needed for the cremation. It generally costs one nearly ₹5,000 while the use of electric crematorium costs hardly ₹350,” he said. “Besides, there’s no need of felling so many trees,” he said.State of cremationsElectric crematoria There are 12 electric crematoria in the state. Of these, six are in Patna district and one each in Muzaffarpur, Sonepur, Bhagalpur, Munger, Purnia and Hajipur. High Court orderIn 2018, the Patna High Court had directed the state government to construct at least one electric crematorium in each of the 38 districts, but they are still a far cry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bodies-in-ganga-bring-back-focus-on-electric-crematoria-101622906784306.html

Not a single case of Covid-19 has been recorded among the 40,000 population that live in 10,000 households across these villages, officials familiar with the matter said.Sampling and random testing of more than 1,000 residents in the villages of Jharokheda, Andhaki and Patakpur were done last year as well as this year, with all samples testing negative, according to officials.Nuh deputy commissioner Dhirendra Khadgata credited the villagers and health teams for following Covid-appropriate behaviour and regular monitoring. He said that visitors were banned since last year and those travelling outside were mandated to quarantine for 14 days upon their return. “We have report cards of all the 443 villages in the district. Around 55 villages have fewer than or up to five cases. But, these three villages have not reported even a single case to date. These villages are mainly from remote parts of the district,” he said.Shabbir Ahmad, the sarpanch of Jharokheda village, said that the 4,500-odd villagers have managed to stay protected by maintaining social distancing and regular sanitising of the common areas. “We are completely dependent on our own farming and no outsourcing of goods was done since last April. We are growing vegetables and are ensuring that villagers do not step out of the village. We are not allowing relatives or outsiders to enter. People who were working outside majorly worked from home and those who were in private jobs and other cities were not allowed unless they carried negative reports. Also, quarantine in farms was set up for those stepping out in case of emergencies,” he said.The district administration has been surveying the villages regularly to assess residents’ health.The villages have small grocery shops and the products brought in from markets and warehouses were sanitised and kept in the open for a day before starting sales, said officials.Mahendar Singh, the sarpanch of Andhaki village, said that they have been growing vegetables, grains and other daily essentials to avoid contact with outsiders. This year, the villagers grew tomatoes, brinjal, pumpkins, onions, garlic and other vegetables. “For dairy products, those who do not have any means were given milk and buttermilk by their neighbours so that they do not have to buy from outside. We have many who work as drivers in our village. They lived in the fields and regular testing was done to check if they were infected,” he said.Andhaki has a population of 2,500 people, including children.Khadgata termed this as a success story of the villages. “These model villages kept strict vigil, followed Covid-appropriate behaviour and ensured all the families wore face masks and areas were sanitized regularly. The administration regularly supplied sanitisers and face masks to them and a weekly report was taken from the sarpanch on the supply,” he said.A common rule followed by these villages was to restrict outsiders, minimise the import of goods that subsequently led to healthier diets. All children were asked to wash their hands regularly and soaps were distributed, said officials.Chaudhary Samsuddin Khan, the sarpanch of Patakpur village which has a population of 28,000 villagers, said that they did not allow children and senior citizens at community events. Regular health camps were organised and timely vaccination was done. “Even officials from the district administration and health workers entering the village were asked to undergo sanitisation during both waves. If there was an emergency, then the villager was kept in farm quarantine, with food delivered to them and other arrangements being taken care of by the panchayat for seven days,” he said.Khan said that all roads were blocked by the panchayat and no vehicles were allowed in the village, with parking allowed a kilometre away. Also, health workers were not allowed to enter the village after 4pm, he said.In Gurugram district, at least 13 of the 156 villages have been successful in keeping Covid-19 at bay, according to an ongoing door-to-door survey in rural blocks. Not a single positive case has been detected in these villages since May 15, according to the Gurugram administration data. “Out of the 73 villages in Pataudi block, 48 in Farrukhnagar, and 35 in Sohna, seven, four and two villages, respectively, did not report any Covid-19 case,” said Narendra Sarwan, district development and panchayat officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/three-villages-in-nuh-manage-to-keep-coronavirus-at-bay-101622905524246.html

Until now, opposition parties are highlighting substandard and incomplete digging work. The ruling party-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) office bearer demanded an audit of the work and filed cases against contractors for not completing work in time. Sandeep Khardekar is a BJP Pune city spokesperson and also founder of the Creative foundation and his wife Manjusha is party corporator and representing Karvenagar area. He has written a letter to PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar and attached some photographs which are showing incomplete work and damaged service lines. Khardekar said, “I visited different places in the Karvenagar area, and I found that most of the work is incomplete one. In Girija Shankar Vihar and K52 area, the contractors have not completed work and it has damaged service lines such telephone and water lines. It has not restored yet and residents are facing a problem.” He has also raised the point of deadline of complete work and actual permission of digging roads for laying service lines and actual digging work and demanded an audit of work. Local corporator Manjusha Khardekar said, “The work is going on at snail’s pace. The digging work is also carried out. We are following up the issue with PMC officials to complete work. But they are giving excuses of rain and shortage of workers. In our areas, pre-monsoon nullah cleaning work is also going on and it is not also over.” On the other hand, Prashant Jagtap, Pune city president of Nationalist Congress party (NCP) and corporator made allegations on the BJP. He said, “After the monsoon is over, the PMC takes major development work related to laying down water, drainage lines and laying underground cables. The deadline to complete work is May 15. After that, the PMC carries out restoration work and pre-monsoon work which are supposed to be completed as per the deadline of May 31 every year.” He further added, “In a poll-bound year, BJP sanctioned ₹400 to ₹500 crore work of water and drainage department and allowed digging permission to private cable companies for their financial interest which is delaying pre-monsoon work and people have to face problems of incomplete work across the city.” Meanwhile, additional municipal commissioner Kunal Khemanar has issued an order to the road department and zonal commissioners to carry out inspection of work and audit the contractor work which should be completed before monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjps-office-bearer-demands-audit-of-digging-work-after-opposition-raises-alarm-101622903184126.html

05-06-2021||Kolkata||One person, one post: Mamata Banerjee chalks up new decree for Trinamool Congress||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has chalked up a new rule for the Trinamool Congress (TMC), wherein a member of the party will be allowed to hold only one party post at any given time, TMC sources informed Hindustan Times Bangla. The development was confirmed by party leader Partha Chatterjee at a press meet in Kolkata on Saturday, where he also announced a series of reshuffles in party positions. He also announced that Mamata's nephew Abhishek Banerjee, who earlier held the post of the Trinamool Youth Congress president, has now been appointed as the party's national general secretary."Our party chief Mamata Banerjee has nominated MP Abhishek Banerjee as the all-India general secretary of the TMC," Chatterjee said, following two crucial meetings earlier in the day. Abhishek Banerjee will be replacing party leader Subrata Bakshi as the national general secretary.Also Read: Mamata's nephew Abhishek Banerjee appointed as Trinamool general secretaryOf course, the new rule could also mean that Mamata Banerjee would have to give up either one of the posts she currently occupies -- that of the chief minister of West Bengal or the Trinamool Congress supremo -- since she herself occupies two of these posts, HT Bangla reported.Partha Chatterjee, a former state minister, also announced other appointments to party posts. Trinamool leader Kunal Ghosh has been appointed as the party's state general secretary, while Abhishek's earlier post, that of the president of the Trinamool Youth Congress, went to TMC leader and actor Saayoni Ghosh.Trinamool Congress was reported to have faced a personnel crisis in the run-up to the West Bengal legislative assembly elections earlier this year. While several turncoat leaders, including Mamata's close aide Suvendu Adhikari, abandoned the party to join the BJP shortly before the elections, many other leaders were seen grabbing on to at least two party posts. This led to the building up of resentment among longtime party workers. According to TMC sources, Mamata's new rule, when enforced, is meant to address this issue of resentment and is expected to lead to better intra-party governance, keeping the administration and party leadership separate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/one-person-one-post-mamata-banerjee-chalks-up-new-decree-for-trinamool-congress-101622899675036.html

Badal had earlier demanded High Court-monitored probe in the alleged scam. Following uproar and backlash, Punjab government on Saturday withdrew its order providing "one-time limited vaccine doses to 18-44 age group population through private hospitals"."We are going to meet the Governor. We are going to approach the Court that this scam needs to be examined. All decision-makers need to be prosecuted and I would urge the Governor to dismiss this government," Badal said.The former Punjab deputy chief minister told ANI that officials, ministers or the chief minister, "no one can't wash their hands off from the scam".Badal also accused the state government of giving a false number of Covid-19 deaths. "While the official count of deaths is 15000, the unofficial figure would be between 50,000 to 60,000. The Chief Minister should cut down on other expenditures and go from village to village, town to town to get everyone vaccinated," he said.Badal slammed Punjab health minister BS Sidhu for his remarks that he the SAD leader had got "vaccine worth ₹62,000 administered" after he tested positive for Covid-19.Badal said he is disgusted at the remarks of the minister."He needs to be sacked immediately. A case should be registered against him for big financial scam of profiteering from vaccines which were being given to private people," the SAD leader said."He (Sidhu) may mock because he knows the ground realities," Badal said, adding that vaccines were being provided "at a hefty amount" in Punjab."I have been raising this issue. private hospitals charging in lakhs. There is no oxygen available and the government isn't doing anything. How can he mock?" he asked.The MP from Ferozepur also expressed his disappointment at the Centre's handling of Covid-19 situation, saying people had faced shortage of oxygen, medicines and vaccines."Government of India has completely failed in dealing with the second wave of Covid-19. And I don't think they have any plan to tackle the third wave as well. The Centre should learn from western countries how they handled Covid-19. Everyone wants to take financial advantage of the situation," Badal alleged.He said Covid-19 situation "is quite grim" especially in the rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-chief-badal-hits-out-at-punjab-govt-over-vaccine-profiteering-101622899037049.html

Karnataka has reported a recent surge in cases of mucormycosis, a disease that happens due to a fungus called mucormycetes which can enter the body through breathing or skin injuries.Mucormycosis, or black fungus, is a rare but serious type of fungal infection that requires medication or removal surgery. It is being reported among people who have recovered from Covid-19, as the virus potentially weakens the body’s immune response. The rate is much higher among those with diabetes or those who have taken steroids during Covid-19 treatment.Also Read: Black fungus cases cross 200 mark in Chandigarh hospitalsReporting the number of cases of black fungus infection, the Karnataka health minister provided some vital details regarding the state government's means to tackle the disease. "So far, we have received 18,650 vials of Amphotericin B," he said, talking about the key anti-fungal drug used in the treatment of mucormycosis.The Karnataka state government is also considering including black fungus treatment under the 'Ayushman Bharat Arogya Karnataka' scheme.Also Read: Amphotericin-B: States race against time to procure mucormycosis drugBlack fungus can be fatal if left untreated and requires several vials of Amphotericin-B to be administered to the patient, according to doctors. Treatment protocol says that when mucormycosis infects the nose, sinus, or palate, doctors will administer a 5mg dose of Amphotericin B per kilogram (kg) of body weight. For example, if a person weighs 60kgs, he would require 300mg of the dose. Each vial has 50mg of the drug. Hence, a patient suffering from the disease will require six vials which costs ₹60,000 on a daily basis. If the infection reaches the brain, doctors have to administer 8-10mg per kilogram of the patient’s body weight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/1784-covid-19-patients-caught-black-fungus-in-karnataka-62-recovered-101622896884350.html

Yadav blamed Nitish Kumar and the Bharatiya Janata Party’s efforts and negative politics of 16 years for the reason for Bihar’s low rankings.“As a result of Nitish-BJP’s 16 years of relentless efforts and negative politics Bihar ranks top from the bottom,” Yadav tweeted on Saturday.“The ones who used to cry about the alleged jungle raj have lost their tongue and are now hiding. Bihar can be annihilated but they cannot tolerate socio-economic justice,” he added.The NITI Aayog SDG index evaluates the progress of states and Union Territories on the basis of various parameters like health, education, economic growth, institutions, gender, climate change, and environment. In the latest index, released on Thursday, Kerala retained the top rank with a score of 75, while Bihar was declared to be the worst-performing state with a low score of 52.Yadav further hit out at the ‘double engine’ coalition government of Janata Dal (United) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state, accusing Kumar of closing down health care centres opened during his tenure, and turning them into ghost houses. “It is only because of this that Bihar has ranked the top from the bottom in the NITI Ayog report,” he added."The so-called double engine (government) has turned into a trouble engine," the Rashtriya Janata Dal president tweeted in Hindi.The current leader of the opposition, RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad Yadav too hit out at the state government over the low rankings."Bihar has been placed at the bottom for the third consecutive year. This sums up the 16-year BJP-Nitish rule's progress on paper," Tejashwi tweeted.JD(U) leader and spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan accepted the Niti Ayog rankings and told PTI that Bihar’s condition would have been better if the state had received special state status during the RJD and Congress regime.“Yes, I accept but if Bihar had special status then the situation of Bihar would have been different and for this situation of Bihar RJD and Congress are responsible." PTI said quoting Ranjan.Ranjan also hit out at Yadav, alleging that during his tenure all discussions about Bihar revolved only around crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-ranks-top-from-the-bottom-lalu-prasad-yadav-hits-out-at-nitish-kumar-over-state-s-ranking-in-niti-aayog-sdg-index-101622888288488.html

05-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi high court bars entities from misusing 'Khadi' brand in beauty pageants||Private entities involved in organising beauty pageants and other business activities by illegally using the brand name "Khadi" of Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) have been restrained by the Delhi High Court from carrying out any "misleading" activities in the name of Khadi.The Noida-based 'Khadi Design Council of India' (KDCI) and 'Miss India Khadi Foundation' (MIKF) were accused by the KVIC of fraudulently using the brand name and deceiving people.In an ex-parte order, the high court said the names of the two entities were "deceptively similar" to the KVIC's trademark 'Khadi' and hence, amounted to a violation of the trademark.The high court also directed the defendants -- 'Khadi Design Council of India', 'Miss India Khadi Foundation' and its self-proclaimed CEO Ankush Anami -- to take down all their social media accounts on Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook under the tradename 'Khadi Design Council of India' and 'Miss India Khadi'.It also ordered taking down infringing content from their websites -- www.missindiskhadi.in and www.kdci.org -- and an e-commerce portal www.paridhaanam.com run by Anami -- that is analogous to KVIC's e-portal.The high court accepted the arguments of the KVIC that the defendants' websites and social media pages have been scripted and structured in a manner that gives the impression that they are the same as the KVIC or they are part of a government body providing the same services as the Khadi India."The same demonstrates the serious bad faith on part of the defendants and their intention to mislead the consumers and ride on the plaintiff's goodwill," the KVIC alleged.The KVIC alleged that the private entities were planning and advertising two events titled 'Miss India Khadi' and 'National Khadi Designers Awards, 2019' in Goa from December 19 to 22, 2020, and thus creating a false impression that the events are organized by the KVIC.Further, the defendant KDCI was duping people by promising 'Khadi Certification' to fashion designers and charging ₹2,000 per head in lieu of that and they also claimed to be associated with KVIC's Prime Minister's Employment Generation Program (PMEGP) on their website www.missindiakhadi.in which contained a hyperlink to the KVIC's PMEGP page.Taking note of KVIC's contention, Justice Sanjeev Narula said, "The plaintiff (KVIC) has established a prima facie case in its favour... An irreparable loss would be caused to the plaintiff, i.e. KVIC in case an ex-parte interim injunction is not granted.""Accordingly, till the next date of hearing, the defendants are restrained manufacturing, advertising or providing any kind of goods or services under the trademark 'Khadi'... Further, the defendants are directed to take down their Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube pages under the mark tradename 'Khadi Design Council of India' and 'Miss India Khadi', and the infringing content from their websites being www.paridhaanam.com, www.kdci.org and www.missindiakhadi.in," the judge said in the recent order.KVIC Chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena welcomed the court order saying this would deter individuals and firms from illegally using brand name Khadi and luring people on false promises."The activities of 'Khadi Design Council of India' and 'Miss India Khadi' is a clear case of duping people using the name of 'Khadi'. These entities have no connection or affiliation with Khadi at all. Those who have been duped must seek a refund and lodge a complaint against these fraud entities," Saxena said.It is pertinent to mention that KVIC, in recent times, has won several cases against violation of its trademark 'Khadi'.An arbitration tribunal in Delhi last month had said that 'Khadi' was not a generic name to be used by private individuals or firms while permanently restraining an individual from using the brand name 'Khadi'.In March this year, the Delhi High Court had also restrained a firm from using the brand name Khadi and the charkha symbol to sell its products under the name "IWEARKHADI".The KVIC in the last few years has acted tough against such violators. So far, the KVIC has issued legal notices to over 1,000 private firms, including Fabindia, for misusing its brand name and selling products under the name of Khadi.The KVIC has sought damages to the tune of ₹500 crore from Fabindia which is pending before the Mumbai High Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-bars-entities-from-misusing-khadi-brand-in-beauty-pageants-101622883705343.html

Sumit Turuk from Maoist-affected Narayanpatna block of Koraput district in Odisha was selected by St Anthony’s College of UK’s Oxford University to pursue an M.Sc programme in Modern South Asian Studies. “I reach out to you because I have run out of options to pay for this opportunity. The total sum of course fees, college community charge and college deposit come to 26240 pound sterling, equivalent to 27,13,480 Indian Rupees. I have to submit a financial declaration for the same by June 30, 2021. As the fees have been raised, I am now also hoping to work part-time to secure my living expenses and other costs, but I would appreciate having a headstart on this. Any contribution will help, and I sincerely thank you if you can spread this campaign, move it through your networks or help in any other way,” he posted on the fundraising site.The programme is a 12-month master’s degree course offered jointly by the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies and the Faculty of Oriental Studies. It involves the students to study the South Asian region, its rich history and its complex present-day societies from several disciplinary and analytical perspectives, culminating in a 12,000-word thesis.The son of a school teacher and an auxiliary nurse midwife in Koraput district, Turuk could probably never have been able to pay the course fees at St Anthony’s College in Oxford University. Goaded by his friends from Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, where e pursued his MA in Spanish language, Turuk took to Milaap.org, a fundraising website to crowdfund his course fees and realise his dream.The Odisha government initially assured him of contributing to his course fees but couldn’t as the degree was his second Masters.The crowdfunding amount included visa costs of £348, international health surcharge of £475 for one year, living expenses of £17000, emergency expenses including rent insurance or £1000 and round-trip airfare of £700. The course starts in October.On Twitter, several people ran a hashtag #Sendsumittooxford appealing to people to donate for the cause. “This is urgent! Sumeet is one most brilliant young scholar from Dalit community. He has secured admission in Oxford but is unable to join the course due to fund shortage. We need to come together and secure his admission,” posted one Twitter.Another user tweeted, “Please note that 28 lakh covers just the tuition fee. Oxford is an expensive city & living expenses can be hard to manage. Donate generously!”The response was overwhelming and beyond Turuk’s expectations. Within 3-4 hours of posting his appeal on the website, he received help worth ₹37 lakh, more than what he asked for. “I never thought people would reach out and help so quickly. I thought I may raise some money through crowdfunding in 15 days. But this was too quick,” Turuk said. He is now aiming to raise ₹47 lakh to cover the high living expenses in Oxford.His mother, Bharati Bag, an ANM working in Koraput, said she is too happy for her son’s achievements. “He has always been studious since childhood and started reading books at the age of 3,” she said.Turuk said at Oxford University, he plans to pursue research on caste in central universities in India. “I want to chart the trajectory of Dalit-Bahujan students and their anti-caste political engagements starting from the Ambedkar Students Association in Hyderabad Central University in the 90s, formation of the Birsa Ambedkar Phule Students Association in Jawaharlal Nehru University in 2014, to Rohith Vemula movement in 2016. I want to pioneer a topic of research that is vital to understand and has never been done before,” he said. “I want to study the impact of this trajectory on the shift, like discussions around caste among young students and university campuses, through the digital media boom and large anti-caste political mobilizations in recent years,” he added.The 27-year-old has been quite active on social media talking about the realities of caste discrimination in higher education. He has travelled across the country attending around 100 events sensitizing young college and university students.Since 2016, he has been an active rapper under the name Sumeet Samos. His first hip-hop single “Ladai Seekh Le” (Learn to Resist) was released in 2018. Most of his writings and songs are about SC/ST students, Savarna oppression, Ambedkar-Phule ideology, manual scavenging, caste discrimination and atrocities against Dalits. His student activism, advocacy and community-building against caste was featured in Princeton University’s Lewis Centre for Arts. He has also written for several newspapers and news websites. Between 2018 and 2020, he worked with French Radio Live (Paris) as a presenter and worked as a performing artist in various theatres of France. In 2019 he was featured among one of the 15 youths to watch out for the decade by the Times of India.Turuk said his goal is to create networks and support systems through advocacy groups and by policy intervention through the SC/ST departments in every state to make higher education more accessible to SC/ST students, particularly those from rural areas.Narayanpatna, from where Turuk hails, has been the epicentre of Maoist activities since mid-2000 in Odisha when the local tribals under an organisation named Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh started a movement to drive the moneylenders and landlords who had usurped tribal lands. With tribal forming 82 per cent of the Narayanpatna population, it has been among the most underdeveloped areas of Odisha.Between 2006 and 2008, CMAS chased away upper caste landlords and distributed around 3000 acres of land among the landless poor tribals. However, Maoists later supported the Sangh leading to a violent confrontation between CMAS activists led by Nachika Linga police. The crisis boiled over after there were series of landmine explosions targetting police and police stations in which tribals and policemen were killed. In 2012, the erstwhile Biju Janata Dal MLA Jhina Hikaka was abducted by Maoists and then released after prolonged negotiations.

The government has proposed level-wise categorisation of areas and regions to facilitate unlocking.“The orders and classification of the areas are more pragmatic. This fixes the responsibility on local administrations - district collectors or municipal corporations – to reduce the spread of the virus and augment infrastructure,” said an official requesting anonymity.Instead of passing a blanket order for the entire state, the state government has divided the districts and cities into five categories to begin the process of unlocking under its ‘break the chain’ initiative.The unlocking has been based on the test positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy in areas by dividing them into 5 categories. Mumbai and most of the cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) fall in the category or level -3 under which the opening up of the activities can begin from Monday.The cities and districts with less than 5% positivity rate and less than 25% occupancy of the oxygen beds come under ‘level 1’, while the areas with less than 5% positivity and 25 to 30% oxygen bed occupancy are termed as ‘level-2’ areas. The ‘level-3’ areas the ones with a 5 to 10% positivity rate or more than 40% oxygen bed occupancy, while the areas with positivity between 10 and 20% or more than 60% oxygen bed occupancy have been put under ‘level 4’.

Barring theatres, multiplexes, malls and auditoriums, all other activities for these level-3 areas have been allowed with restrictions.Local trains have been opened up for women commuters, apart from the commuters in a few essential services and the medical sector. Essential shops will operate till 4 pm on all days, while non-essential shops and establishments can now operate till 4 pm on weekdays. Restaurants can operate till 4 pm on weekdays while public and private offices can work with 50% of their staff till 4 pm.However, the local authorities can put restrictions on the operation of private offices. The level-3 areas, however, will continue to have a curfew after 5 pm every day. Salons, spas and beauty parlours have been allowed to operate with 50% of their capacity.Social, cultural, entertainment events and political/election meetings have been allowed with 50% capacity of the venue in level-3 areas. The number of allowed attendees has been increased to 50 for wedding events in these areas, the notification stated.Eleven municipal corporations with more than 1 million population - Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Aurangabad, Vasai-Virar, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur, Solapur and Kalyan-Dombivali - have been treated as a separate unit from their respective districts and will be judged on their positivity and bed occupancy rate to ascertain their category.

In level-4 areas, only essential shops will be allowed to be open till 4 pm for all days, while restaurants can operate takeaway services. Government and private offices will be allowed to operate at 25% capacity.Elaborating on its idea of linking the unlocking with the consumption of oxygen, the notification stated, “The state’s daily production of medical oxygen is 1,200 metric tonnes which can cater to maximum 60,000 patients with the need of the O2. If the number of patients ranged between 35,000 and 45,000, no part shall be below level-3 and no part be below level 4 if it’s more than 50,000 patients. Currently, the oxygen bed occupancy is less than 35,000 patients and thus the oxygen trigger mentioned above does not get operated. In such a scenario, the local level authorities are empowered to decide the level of restrictions they fall under.”Maharashtra has reported less than 20,000 daily cases over the past week, after reporting a daily caseload of more than 50,000 cases at the beginning of May.

Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel was also present during the meeting.During the meeting, the chief minister also requested Joshi to amend the Centre’s order to make the district collector the ex-officio chairman of the District Mineral Foundation (DMF).The Union minister appreciated the state government for proactively taking steps on the direction of the Centre to bring more mines into auctions, the release stated.It further added that the priority of the Centre is to allocate mines through the auctioning process.

The district administration did not make any official announcement about the visit. But the information was leaked, and farmer leaders began circulating messages on social media asking farmers to assemble at Karnal’s Bastara toll plaza for the protest.Khattar said the protests can be held peacefully but nobody will be allowed to disturb law and order. He said he has also appealed to farmer leaders to hold peaceful protests. Khattar said the district administration barricaded the roads and deployed a heavy police force ahead of his visit to Karnal for security.Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav insisted Khattar’s visit was advanced due to the rain forecast.Jagdip Singh Aulakh, a local leader of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said they came to know that the chief minister will visit Karnal on Saturday and asked farmers to oppose it.BKU has played a key role in ongoing protests against three farm laws passed last year.Officials said Khattar, who has earlier faced protests by farmers, did not want any confrontation in Karnal and that is why he decided to advance his visit.Farmer organisations in Haryana are separately holding protests at district headquarters and plan to burn the copies of the farm laws.Farmer leaders Rakesh Tikait and Gurnam Singh Charuni planned to court arrests in Tohana on Saturday in support of the farmers booked and arrested for allegedly blocking the way of lawmaker Devender Singh Babli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/khattar-arrives-ahead-of-schedule-in-karnal-amid-farmer-calls-for-protest-101622870902960.html

Our team, including Dr SP Mishra, Dr Deepa Devdas, Dr Priyonil Basu and Dr Chetan Sahni collected samples from Varanasi city and rural areas of Chandauli, Sonbhadra, Jaunpur and Bhadohi mostly in April. The team at CCMB sequenced these samples and found out that there were at least seven major variants circulating in the region. One hundred thirty samples were sequenced in this study,” said head, multidisciplinary research unit, BHU, professor Royana Singh, who led the team of researchers.“Among the variants of concern (VoC), the most predominant variant we found in our study was B.1.617. This variant was also reported to be one of the major drivers of the second Covid wave in India,” Prof Singh added.Also read: Alpha to Delta switch behind city’s 4th waveSingh said professor Gyaneshwar Chaubey of the department of zoology, BHU, was of immense help to them during their study.“Just as in most of India, the B.1.617.2 variant (aka Delta variant) was the most common among the samples we studied. They were found among 36% of the total samples. Other VoCs such as the B.1.351, detected in South Africa for the first time, was also found in this area,” said Dr Rakesh Mishra, advisor, CCMB.“This study confirms yet again that the Delta variant is the most widespread coronavirus variant in the country right now.

05-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC dismisses 5G plea, fines Juhi Chawla and 2 others||The Delhi high court on Friday came down heavily on actor Juhi Chawla and two other complainants for filing a plea against the installation of 5G wireless network in the country, and issued a fine of ₹20 lakh for a “defective” suit aimed at “gaining publicity”.The high court, irked by repeated disruptions in the previous June 2 hearing, also pulled up Chawla for posting the link for the court’s digital proceeding on social media and said that the plaintiffs “abused and misused the process of law”.“…plaintiffs have filed the suit to gain publicity which is clear from the fact that plaintiff no 1 (Chawla) circulated the video conferencing link of this court on her social media accounts, which resulted in repeated disruptions of court proceedings,” Justice JR Midha said, dismissing the plea.On Wednesday, the online hearing of the Delhi high court was interrupted three times by a user who sang songs from Chawla’s hit movies in the ’90s. Justice Midha then directed court officials to bar the user from the video conference and directed authorities to identify the disrupter and issue a contempt notice. The actor-environmentalist has posted the link for the video conference a day before on her Twitter account encouraging people to participate. Chawla and social workers Veeresh Malik and Teena Vachani moved the court on Monday, claiming that 5G technology can trigger serious, irreversible effect on humans with radiation and permanent damage to the natural ecosystems.According to the World Health Organization, no adverse health effect has been “causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies” despite several studies over the issue.The judge said that the plea was not maintainable as the plaintiffs had no knowledge about the issues of health risks that were being raised. The suit is “stuffed with unnecessary, scandalous, frivolous and vexatious averments”, justice Midha said, underscoring that the complainants should have first reached out to the government with their concerns before approaching the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-dismisses-5g-plea-fines-juhi-chawla-and-2-others-101622848957363.html

These panels were set up by the Delhi government on May 27.“By observing other countries, we have learnt that advance preparations are a must to tackle a potential third wave of the pandemic. In the light of these observations, I chaired a review meeting with the Delhi government’s experts committee and discussed several important issues,” Kejriwal’s office said in a tweet after the morning meeting.In another tweet, after the 4pm meeting, the chief minister’s office said, “After experts committee meeting, the CM met the preparations committee and had discussions on important issues such as oxygen management and ICU beds.”The CM’s office, however, did not share further details about the meetings.Both meetings were also attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, health minister Satyendar Jain, and some senior government officials.One of the officials present in the meetings, who asked not to be named, said: “The discussions were largely on setting objective criteria for hospital beds, oxygen management, and what kind of containment efforts are needed for what level of new cases surfacing in Delhi. The committee will now look into developing these criteria with the help of models developed by IIT-Delhi.”The Delhi high court on May 28 asked the state government to implement the recommendations of a study by IIT-Delhi to streamline the oxygen supply chain in the Capital. The study was commissioned by the Delhi government on a suggestion by the court on May 5.Another official present in Friday’s meetings said: “There were also discussions on paediatric cases and the preparations that would be needed to handle potential outbreak of Covid-19 in children.”A third senior government official said, “The government is focusing on the large-scale local production of face masks suitable for children, identifying hospitals suitable for increasing oxygen beds and ICUs for children, a special training programme for nurses engaged in paediatric wards, and designing focused mass awareness programmes.”As far as oxygen is concerned, said the third official, the government has ordered five buffer tanks with a combined capacity of 271MT, and installations should be completed by June 10.The government has also procured 4,600 oxygen concentrators over the last two months, and 3,330 more of such devices are scheduled to be procured in the next two weeks, said the third official.“The government has also arranged over 3,700 additional oxygen cylinders of the D-type category in the last two months (such cylinders are used as backup supply in larger hospitals and serve as the main source of oxygen in smaller hospitals and nursing homes),” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-to-set-targets-for-delhi-s-covid-19-infra-101622846556108.html
05-06-2021||Delhi||June remains cool as rain, wind keep mercury down||Rainfall, coupled with a thunderstorm, lashed Delhi and parts of the National Capital Region (NCR) on Friday, with civic bodies reporting that over 90 trees had fallen across the city due to the strong winds.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said a western disturbance over Jammu & Kashmir and a cyclonic circulation over Uttar Pradesh resulted in the weather suddenly turning.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the high humidity levels in the national capital and comparatively higher daytime temperatures led to the rain.“The maximum temperatures at the Safdarjung and Palam weather observatories were nearly 40 degrees Celsius today (Friday). The humidity levels at the Palam observatory touched 93%. This was another reason that caused the rainfall,” Srivastava said, adding that a western disturbance passing over Jammu & Kashmir and a cyclonic circulation over Uttar Pradesh prompted the change of weather.IMD’s initial recordings show that the Safdarjung station received 3.2mm rainfall, Palam received 9.4mm rainfall and Lodi Road 1.6mm rainfall as of 5.30pm.Some areas around the Palam observatory also reported a hailstorm at around 6pm.The three municipalities (north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations) confirmed that Friday’s strong winds, with speeds of around 60 kilometres per hour, toppled more than 90 trees in areas such as Kalkaji, Nizamuddin West, Dilshad Garden, Greater Kailash, Uttam Nagar, among others.Western disturbances are cyclonic storms originating over the Mediterranean that affect the weather in north-west and north India.A cyclonic circulation is the swirling motion of winds caused by a low pressure area, which — when it pulls warm moist air — results in overcast conditions and rainfall.On Friday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered to be representative of the city, was 39.5°C, a notch below what is considered normal for this time of the year.The minimum temperature was one degree below normal at 26.1°C. The relative humidity recorded at the station was 64%.Though the mercury remained below the 40°C-mark, the “feel-like”temperature in Delhi was 42-43°C, due to the high humidity. According to IMD, the “feel-like” temperature of a region is how hot or cold the human body feels as opposed to the actual temperature recordings.At the Palam observatory, the day temperature was 38.4°C, three degrees below normal, while the minimum temperature was 26.2°C. The relative humidity recorded here at 5.30pm was 93%.Met officials said the wind speeds in Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Noida went up to 60kmph in the evening.The IMD forecast said strong winds and rain were likely to continue till late Friday, but this was unlikely to reduce the temperature on Saturday.“The thunderstorm is likely to stay only till Friday. We are also seeing that there is a possibility of another spell of rain around June 11-12, but we will be able to confirm that when we are closer to the date,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/june-remains-cool-as-rain-wind-keep-mercury-down-101622846352361.html

05-06-2021||Business||‘Apprehensive about constitution of panel’: Amit Mitra||Even as a group of ministers (GoM) is weighing the proposal of Goods and Services Tax (GST)-waiver on Covid-19 essentials such as vaccines, drugs, testing kits and ventilators, West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra on Friday expressed his apprehensions about the very constitution of the eight-member panel.In a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Mitra asked her to record his “dissent” on various issues, including the constitution of the ministerial group: “I was surprised that the GoM of eight ministers did not include some of those who had cogently argued against the proposals of putting GST on Covid related materials. Now I can only hope that the GoM will demonstrate rationality and boldness at the face of a massive pandemic.”Sitharaman, who is also the chairperson of the apex federal body on the indirect tax, on May 29 announced an eight-member GoM under the convenorship of Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma. Other members of the group are—Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitinbhai Patel, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Goa transport minister Mauvin Godinho, Kerala finance minister KN Balagopal, Odisha finance minister Niranjan Pujari, Telangana finance minister T Harish Rao and UP finance minister Suresh Kr Khanna. The GoM is expected to submit its recommendations to the council on or before June 8. Union finance ministry did not respond to an email query on this matter.The council, at its 43rd meeting on May 28, decided to form a GoM to recommend duty exemptions on Covid essentials after some members opposed the proposed GST rates in the agenda. “An 18% GST on hand sanitizers was truly shocking, when all Governments are asking the common people to use hand sanitizers as the first line of defence against the dreaded virus... Similarly, GST was proposed on masks and PPEs used by crores of common people and lakhs of health professionals, respectively. Similar was the case of imposing GST on vaccines!,” Mitra said in the letter to Sitharaman on June 4. HT reviewed the letter.In the letter, Mitra raised five crucial other issues amidst raging second wave of pandemic and the impending third wave—raising borrowing limit of states from 4% to 5% of their gross state domestic product (GSDP), compensate states for their past revenue losses to the tune of ₹63,000 crore, revising compensation of 2021-22 to ₹2.13 lakh crore from ₹1.58 lakh crore, extend the compensation period for another five year beyond July 2022, and discuss the issue of bureaucrats overstepping the council’s decision-making, which was raised by the Punjab government.In a letter to Sitharaman on June 1, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal said that committees of bureaucrats “could by no means act as an equivalent or substitute of the GSTC” [GST Council].||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/apprehensive-about-constitution-of-panel-amit-mitra-101622842145831.html

He shared his government’s achievements, implementation of 85% poll commitments, his roadmap for meeting unfulfilled promises and report card of his ministers. Also read: Bajwa demands independent probe into sale of vaccine to pvt hospitalsThe committee, which has All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former Delhi MP Jai Prakash Agarwal as members, asked the chief minister about unfulfilled poll promises, his lack of accessibility and “over dependence” on the bureaucracy, and he responded to each point raised by party leaders. The chief minister also carried dossiers on dubious land deals and direct or indirect business interests of some party MLAs and other leaders in mining and liquor sectors, according to sources. The chief minister was to meet the panel at 11 am but reached 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road a few minutes before time and Rawat and Agarwal arrived after him. After the meeting, Amarinder said the meeting was a routine introspection for the elections that are six months away. “These are inner-party discussions and I do not propose to share them with you,” he told reporters. However, Rawat, who was more forthcoming, said the chief minister was asked about the challenges and problems faced by party leaders and his (CM’s) roadmap to deal with them before the polls. He said the committee also took up the sacrilege issue that was raised by several party leaders. “We can understand the sensitivity of their sentiments, and the CM understands it better than us. He (Capt) spoke about the administrative and legal steps being taken. I am hopeful that in the next days, results will be seen,” he said. On leadership change, the Punjab affairs in-charge also said no one talked about during the discussions with an alternative, adding that only the Congress president was authorised to speak on this. Though he refused to comment, there are indications that the party may appoint more than one deputy chief ministers, bringing former minister Sidhu back into the state cabinet and appoint a new state unit chief as part of the peace formula. Before they publicly hit out at each other, Amarinder was open to re-inducting Sidhu (as minister), who had quit the state cabinet in 2019, but was opposed to having him as the state unit president, a post that the cricketer-turned-politician was eyeing.Agarwal said the panel will submit its report to Congress president Sonia Gandhi in a day or two. The two-time CM is learnt to be piqued with the central leadership for not putting a stop to relentless attacks by his detractors, particularly Sidhu.“It was suggested to Capt saab a few months ago that he should agree to appoint Sidhu and a Dalit leader as deputy CMs. At one stage, he agreed but then changed his mind and nothing happened. If this entire exercise (meetings) was for such adjustments, it wasn’t worth it because battle lines have been drawn and the infighting will get worse,” a senior state leader said, asking about the “real issues”. Another irritant, according to sources, is the feedback sought by the panel about the probable scenario in case of a change of guard in the state. “The panel did not seek this feedback on day one of the exercise but asked party MLAs about this on subsequent days,” a senior state leader said on condition of anonymity. The induction of the three rebel Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislators, including former leader of opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira, into the Congress minutes before Capt Amarinder left for Delhi in a helicopter is being seen as his way of showing that he is standing his ground. The AAP rebels, whose joining was deferred twice earlier, were to be inducted next week, but Amarinder went ahead without the presence of Rawat and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/captain-digs-in-heels-at-meet-over-infighting-101622838319880.html
05-06-2021||Chandigarh||Under flak, Punjab govt asks private hospitals to return vaccine stock||Facing flak from the Centre and state opposition parties for selling Covid vaccines to private hospitals at a premium, the Punjab government on Friday asked these facilities to return all the stock. The dramatic turnabout came after opposition parties – Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) –- slammed the Congress government for “selling” to private hospitals doses meant to be administered free. The Centre too wrote to the state government, seeking a clarification over reports that it had earned a profit by selling jabs. Union minister Prakash Javdekar also criticised the Punjab government’s decision. Hindustan Times was first to highlight how the vaccine, procured on state government rate of ₹400 per dose, was sold to private hospitals at the rate of ₹1,060 per dose. The private hospitals were further selling the dose at ₹1,560.After Punjab state health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said he has ordered a probe into the allegations, the state government issued the new order, withdrawing “one-time” instructions to private hospitals to vaccinate people in the 18-45 years category. Now, the recalled vaccine doses will be administered free to this age group by the government, the minister said.“The order of providing one-time limited vaccine doses through private hospitals has not been taken in the right spirit and is hereby withdrawn. Further, it has been decided that the private hospitals should return forthwith all the vaccine doses available with them,” Vikas Garg, who is in charge of Punjab’s Covid vaccination programme, said in the order. Once they get their own direct supplies from the manufacturers, the private hospitals will also return to the state government the doses they have already used up. Private hospitals will now get direct supplies of vaccination from the manufacturers. The amount deposited by them in the “vaccine fund” will be refunded by the government. In letter to Punjab health department‘s principal secretary, Union health ministry additional secretary Vandana Gurnani said: “Prima facie, it’s a clear violation of liberalised pricing and accelerated national Covid-19 vaccination strategy. “As per this strategy, the private sector hospitals are directly procuring COVID-l9 vaccines from the vaccine manufacturers,” the letter said, seeking a clarification from the state. ”It’s a dangerous news... The state government wants to make a profit from the vaccination. What kind of government is this?” Javadekar told reporters in Delhi. He also targeted Rahul Gandhi on the issue, saying the Congress leader, instead of giving lectures to others, should first consider how to set things right in place in the state ruled by his party.Earlier, Balbir Sidhu said: “The vaccination procurement is done by officers who don’t belong to my department. Sometimes people take wrong decisions.” Sidhu, who is already upset with certain officers for not involving him in key decisions relating to the Covid management, also took up the matter with chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. Amarinder was apprised that how a decision taken by certain officers, had damaged the image of the government. The CM, it is learnt, asked Sidhu to take corrective measures immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/under-flak-punjab-govt-asks-private-hospitals-to-return-vaccine-stock-101622838021093.html

Sampla was scheduled to meet a Dalit family that had lost a 20-year-old member, Manpreet Singh, on May 23 allegedly because of police torture. A first information report (FIR) was lodged on Friday at Bhikhi police station against the villagers on the complaint of deceased’s uncle Diwan Singh. In his complaint, Diwan said Sampla wanted to meet the aggrieved mother and record statements of the family members. However, more than 200 villagers led by Sadhu Singh, Balam Singh, Jagtar Singh and three others named as accused blocked all entry points to the village to prevent Sampla from reaching the family, reads the complaint. Earlier on Friday, farmer leader Iqbal Singh told reporters that the village had passed a unanimous resolution to prevent Sampla from entering the village for he was a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader. Though Sampla avoided visiting the Fafre Bhai Ke village, he camped at Mansa city police lines and called the aggrieved family there. Sampla said the accused villagers interfered in the functioning of a constitutional institution. Sampla said a postmortem reported presented before the commission states that the deceased had 23 injuries. “The SHO should have been suspended earlier. Police probe will clear air on who all were involved in torturing Manpreet,” said Sampla. The NCSC chief directed Mansa deputy commissioner to releases an interim grant of ₹4.12 lakh under the victim compensation scheme by Tuesday and extend financial assistance to victim’s mother to construct a house on a plot owned by the family. Sampla said the deceased’s younger brother will be eligible for a government job at attaining adulthood. SHO booked, suspended Following the intervention of NCSC, the Mansa police booked the Budhlada station house officer (SHO) Surjan Singh under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC and SC/ST Act. Mansa SSP Surendra Lamba confirmed that Surjan Singh was placed under suspension and investigation is on. Following a petty quarrel with his neighbours in Budhlada, the police authorities summoned Manpreet to the police station on May 23 night. The aggrieved family alleged Manpreet was badly thrashed by the police and he died within hours of release from the custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dalit-youth-s-death-six-farmers-booked-for-thwarting-sampla-s-bid-to-meet-victim-family-101622837960043.html
05-06-2021||Chandigarh||Breather for Punjab as Centre allows coal diversion to pvt thermal plants||A Union government’s June 3 directive allowing diversion of coal meant to run state-owned plants to private thermal plants can come as a breather for Punjab as it can bring down the power generation cost by up to 75 paise per unit. The state government has been consistently raising this demand before the central ministries concerned, besides taking up the matter with the Prime Minister. Punjab now has the flexibility to shift its coal linkage of state-owned plants to private thermal plants. The state-owned power plants have 90% of coal linkage of their generation capacity, while private thermal has 75%. Private thermal plants purchase coal from outside to meet the demand and high cost jacks up the power generation rate. Elated over the development, Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd. CMD A Venu Parsad said he has already asked officials to work out modalities and place an order for coal at the earliest. Parsad, who was pursuing the matter for about a year, said, “From coal, the savings will be around ₹300 crore, but the additional benefits such as the cut in the fixed cost will run into several hundred crores of rupees during implementation.” According to the Union government letter, the states can also use their aggregated linkage coal i.e. aggregated annual contract quantity (AACQ) in the power plants which were established through competitive bidding. The bids for Nabha Power Limited (NPL) and Talwandi Sabo Power Limited (TSPL) of 1,400MW 1,980MW capacity, respectively, were based on the Net Heat Rate and the power generated from such power plants is supplied to the state itself. However, the state government has also put a rider for implementation, as per which, during transfer of the linkage coal by the state, it may be ensured that these plants are more cost-efficient vis-à-vis the state-owned plants to save on power purchase cost. A PSPCL engineer said it’s a win-win situation for the government, independent power producers (IPPs), consumers and the PSPCL. “The state has surplus coal as the government-run plants remain idle for almost eight months a year. The PSPCL was vigorously raising the issue with the Centre since 2017. Once implemented, it will save at least 75 paise per unit of power production cost,” he said. Pertinently, not only the opposition Aam Aadmi Party, even the Congress leaders are raising a hue and cry over the PPAs with the private thermal plants which cost the government thousands of crores and the burden rests on the consumers. The Congress in its manifesto had promised to revise the PPAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/breather-for-punjab-as-centre-allows-coal-diversion-to-pvt-thermal-plants-101622837720341.html

They broke barricades and tried to enter the ministers’ residence but were stopped by police.One of the protesters Gagan Abohar said around 14,000 teachers have been serving for the past 18 years for just ₹6,000 per month. The Congress had assured them regular jobs before the assembly elections, but nothing has been done so far, she added. “We are demanding monthly remuneration of ₹30,000 and regular jobs, but the government is asking us to clear tests for it,” she said.Davinder Singh, another protester, said they will intensify their protest. “The ministers are just rubber stamps and bureaucrats are making policies. We will oppose the Congress leaders in upcoming state assembly elections,” he added.Govt discriminating against teachers: SADChandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) condemned the Congress government for discriminating against teachers and forcing them to come to the streets and asked Singla not to behave in an arrogant and dictatorial manner and resolve the grievances of government school teachers immediately. In a statement, former minister Daljit Singh Cheema said it was shocking that during a time of pandemic when the teaching community’s role to shape the future generations was of utmost importance the Congress government was victimising them and refusing to consider any of their genuine demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/contractual-teachers-break-barricades-outside-singla-s-house-in-sangrur-101622837599420.html
05-06-2021||Chandigarh||Khaira in HC again against ED’s fresh summons||Bholath MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira has again approached the Punjab and Haryana high court against the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED’s) move to summon him afresh. The matter was taken up by the bench of justice Arun Palli and the hearing was deferred for June 9. Earlier, Khaira had moved the court against ED raids at his properties on March 9, 2021, in connection with a 2015 Fazilka drug smuggling case. Following this, he had moved the high court seeking quashing of ED’s probe. The fresh plea has been filed against ED’s move in which the agency intended to open his electronic devices such as phones. The ED had moved before agency’s adjudicating authority on April 4 seeking its permission for the same. The authority had issued show-cause notice to Khaira on April 12 asking him as to why the agency should not be allowed to examine his electronic devices. In the HC, Khaira says electronic devices can’t be allowed to be opened as it would amount to a breach of privacy. The agency has initiated these proceedings even as the entire probe is under the scrutiny of the high court, he argued in the HC. Following raids, ED had claimed that in 12 odd years ₹4.86 crore were deposited in his bank accounts but he declared only ₹99 lakh income to income tax department. The ED initiated a probe against Khaira, who joined Congress on Thursday, in a 2015 drug seizure case in which nine people were convicted in October 2017. In the same order, the trial court had summoned him as “additional accused”, a decision subsequently stayed by the Supreme Court. Khaira claims ED’s action was a case of “witch hunt” as he has been vocal against three farm laws enacted by Centre last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/khaira-in-hc-again-against-ed-s-fresh-summons-101622837539406.html

05-06-2021||Chandigarh||76% of black fungus-infected patients in Punjab are above 45||Seventy-six percent of patients infected with mucormycosis, popularly known as black fungus, are above the age of 45 in Punjab. The state has not reported even a single confirmed case among minors, data available with the state health department shows.Till Friday morning, a total of 343 people were diagnosed with the fungal infection in Punjab, of which 261 are undergoing treatment in hospitals across the state, while 23 have been cured. Also, 49 of the 343 patients have died.According to the state health department, 84 of the total infected patients are in the age group of 18 to 44, while 132 are in the 45 to 60 age group. Also, 126 senior citizens in the 60+ age group were also found infected with the fungal infection in Punjab.Besides, a suspected patient has also been reported in Punjab in less than 18 age group category.Mucormycosis, a rare but serious fungal infection, can disfigure people even when it is not fatal. The infection can badly affect the sinus, eyes, lungs, jaws and teeth and sometimes brain of the patient. Health experts believe that Covid patients/survivors, who are not following the post-recovery instructions of the doctor, especially pertaining to blood sugar levels and intake of medicines, are more prone to the fungal infection.Hussan Lal, principal secretary, health, Punjab, said: “Most of the people infected in the state with mucormycosis are above the age of 45 as most of them are either diabetic or immunocompromised. Fungal infection is mostly attacking the diabetic patient and 45-plus age group is most vulnerable. Also, among the 49 deceased people, majority of them were above the age of 45 and were suffering from diabetes and had Covid-19 history.”A 14-year-old boy of Bathinda district is suspected to be suffering from mucormycosis and his samples have been sent for testing, the state health department said. The suspected patient does not have Covid-19 infection history and if found positive, required treatment will be given to him. His condition is said to be stable. State nodal officer for mucormycosis Dr Gagandeep Singh said: “In Punjab, 82% of the mucormycosis infected patients are either Covid-19 positive or they have recovered from the virus. Also, 85% of the mucormycosis patients had diabetes. People above the age of 45 have low immunity and when they contact Covid-19 infection, their immunity further lowers. Hence, a majority of mucormycosis cases are being detected in this category. Also, a majority of the 84 patients in 18-45 categories also had Covid-19 infection history.”“Punjab is having adequate drugs, including Amphotericin-B injection, which are used to treatment mucormycosis infected patients. Also, expert health team is monitoring the cases and drugs are being given to the patients, as advised by them”, he added. “People are advised to use washed face masks as used masks can increase the chances of fungal infection. Also, if any person, especially Covid-19 recovered or infected patients, is getting black nasal discharge or is having black spots in mouth or skin, or is having vision related problem, he/she should immediately contact the health department for timely detection and treatment,” Dr Gagandeep said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/76-of-black-fungus-infected-patients-in-punjab-are-above-45-101622837418954.html
05-06-2021||Chandigarh||Operation Bluestar: 37 years on, no clarity on articles missing from Sikh Reference Library||Thirty-seven years since the Sikh Reference Library got destroyed in Operation Bluestar at the Golden Temple, confusion and ambiguities still prevail over the missing rare repository of manuscripts and other artifacts that were taken away by the army. Not only the Centre, the SGPC too has failed to come up with accurate details of the items that went missing and the ones returned by the Union government latter. And now, Punjab and Haryana high Court is hearing a petition filed last year by one Satinder Singh against the SGPC after former library director Anurag Singh questioned the integrity of the SGPC in preserving the rare repository. He claimed that the army had returned the items three months after the operation and the SGPC officials received them on September 29, 1984, but many items are missing from the library now. He also alleged that some of the rare ‘birs’ were sold. As the allegations sent the SGPC into a quandary, it set up a four-member committee of senior members to investigate the matter. When asked, the SGPC president Jagir Kaur did not reveal anything about the probe. An SGPC staffer said, “We are identifying lies in the allegations levelled by the petitioner. We are recording statements of the former SGPC staffers who have worked in the library.” He said the gurdwara body will challenge the allegations. SGPC member Kiranjot Kaur, who is a member of the probe panel, said, “We are studying the allegations levelled by the petitioner. We could not prepare a final report on this since there is a lot of confusion about the repository in the library. When we ask the retired employees of the library, they give different information.” “Actually, SGPC staff never knew of the importance of this library and it has never been their priority,” she said. “They (petitioner) have made an allegation that original ‘hukamnamas’ are missing from the library and only their photos are there. This is a lie because when we checked the record, we found that the library only had the photos. And the source of the photographs has been mentioned in the record properly. We are yet to carry out the investigation on other allegations,” she said, adding, “We are taking time because we need to bring out the truth.” Satinder said, “The SGPC has been constituting sub-committees since 2003. This is the third sub-committee. Where are the findings of the first two committees? Nobody knows.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/operation-bluestar-37-years-on-no-clarity-on-articles-missing-from-sikh-reference-library-101622837362161.html

In a letter written to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Bajwa said the state government has earned a profit of ₹2.64 crores through sale of vaccine doses to private hospitals. “What was the purpose of this profit? As private hospitals are further selling the doses at ₹1,560 per dose, it is distressing that in the middle of the pandemic, there are those who wish to make money instead of protecting the health of the people. I urge to order an inquiry into this to know who is the architect of this callous policy,” said Bajwa.SAD seeks case against health ministerBATHINDA: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday said a case should be registered against health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu for diverting vaccines meant for the common man to private institutions.The SAD chief, who was at Talwandi Sabo town in Bathinda to launch the second “vaccine sewa centre” established by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), sad Punjab government’s poor Covid management been exposed.He said this was pure loot and chief minister captain Amarinder Singh owes a public explanation.Sukhbir said if unwanted corporatisation of vaccine distribution is not stopped, the SAD would be forced to approach the courts for justice.Chugh demands registration of criminal case Chandigarh: BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh slammed the Capt Amarinder Singh government for commercialising the sale of Covid vaccine at a time when Punjab had recorded the highest Covid mortality rate in the country.In a statement on Friday, he said a criminal case should to be registered against all those involved in the vaccine scam under which the doses provided by the Centre for the poor working class was sold on commercial rates to private hospitals, who in turn made huge money out of it.He said of the 1.14 lakh Covaxin vaccines Punjab received last month at the cost of ₹420 per dose, the state government sold 40,000 of them to over 20 private hospitals for ₹1,060 per dose and the private hospitals in turn charged ₹1,560 for it from people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bajwa-demands-independent-probe-into-sale-of-vaccine-to-pvt-hospitals-101622837178869.html

These patients should be aware of the drugs like doses, frequency of intake, timing of intake, infection control practices, modalities and frequency of monitoring, the doctor said. It has been directed that facilities like a dedicated central desk can be established, which should be manned 24×7 with dedicated personnel for the timely referral and intensive and focused IEC activities should be done to create awareness in the public. “The doctors involved in Covid-19 patient’s care have been directed to attend the regular update,” said Dr Jindal.State clinical team issues guidelines for use of remdesivir, steroidsIn the wake crisis of remdesivir stock in the market due to its indiscriminate use, the state clinical team has issued guidelines of the anti-viral drug.

Experts say as the virus has mutated and chances of its further mutation cannot be ruled out, it can affect children in the coming days.The three government medical colleges have sent proposals to the state government seeking grant of ₹11 crore for preparedness to tackle third wave of Covid-19.

05-06-2021||Lucknow||UP considers scrapping commercial tax dept’s mobile squad system||The Uttar Pradesh government is considering abolition of the “controversial” mobile squad system in the commercial tax department to facilitate seamless movement of goods vehicles and end the alleged extortion that traders are often subjected to in the name of checking on the road, people dealing with the matter revealed. Mobile squads have been functioning in the commercial tax department (then known as sales tax department) since 1970 to check tax evasion by intercepting suspected moving vehicles with traders’ consignments. More than 70% of the government’s total revenue comes from the commercial tax department.“The government now feels that not only have these mobile squads lost much of their relevance under the GST regime, but they are also considered to be the main tool of corruption and extortion of traders while their output does not match the huge resources they consume,” said a senior official requesting anonymity. The commercial tax department is expected to send a formal proposal recommending disbanding of mobile squads soon to the state government that a few months back sought a report on the utility of mobile squads in the state.Asked by commercial tax commissioner Ministhy S, additional commissioner (commercial tax), Gautam Buddhanagar Zone, Noida, Chandra Bhushan Singh has sent a detailed report to the headquarters here. The report makes a strong recommendation for doing away with the mobile squad units, merging the same with department’s special investigation branch (SIB) that is mandated to collect intelligence inputs on tax evasion.Mobile squads together comprise 150 assistant commissioners, 300 commercial tax officers and 150 vehicles to carry out checking vehicles on roads in the state. Singh, in his report, has said that mobile squads act arbitrarily, harassing and extorting traders in the name of checking. He also said that after implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) with e-way bill system, the mobile squads had lost much of their relevance.“Also, the existing system of mobile squads is based on prejudice in which each vehicle carrying goods on roads is stopped without any valid reason and forced for verification, wasting transporters’ time and adding to the possibility of harassment and extortion,” Singh said in the report.He pointed out that all the mobile squads together inspected 6,11,636 vehicles during last three years and of them only 6% (367,35) vehicles were found to be at fault, which he said raised question marks on the rationale of the existence and utility of mobile squads. He further said in the report that maximum number complaints received from traders about corruption and extortion were against mobile squads.The government, according to another official, was not happy with the working of the mobile squad units and might disband them soon, making the Noida additional commissioner’s input the basis.The Mulayam Singh Yadav government abolished the border check posts about 13-14 years ago on the same grounds. Despite the apprehensions, it was found that abolition of check posts did not adversely impact the department’s revenue collection.UP Vanijya Kar Adhikari Seva Sangh president Sunil Kumar Verma said, “Like abolition of the border check posts 15 years ago, disbanding of mobile squads is the need of the hour today.”Verma has been writing regularly to the department and the government, raising the demand for restructuring and abolition of mobile squad units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-considers-scrapping-commercial-tax-dept-s-mobile-squad-system-101622835618214.html

Water accumulated in areas like Chaura Bazaar, Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar (BRS) Nagar, near Clock Tower and Model Town Extension and residents said that the civic body must wake up from its slumber and take necessary steps ahead of the monsoons .Former councillor Parminder Mehta slammed the civic body for its failure to clean the Talab Bazaar drain, which moves through parts of the old city area including Talab Bazaar, Chaura Bazaar, Bhadaur House and Kundanpuri. Mehta said, “The drain releases rain water into the Buddha Nullah, but it has been choked for years. Despite repeated complaints and reminders, the civic body has failed to clean it, due to which rainwater accumulation is witnessed in most of the main markets of the old city area.”Harwinder Singh, a resident of BRS Nagar, said, “The authorities should find a solution for rainwater accumulation near the Sidhwan Canal at BRS Nagar, due to which fruit vendors who normally install their vends at one corner shifted their vends to road sides. As the work to install interlocking tiles is also going on, traffic jams were witnessed in the area.”Meanwhile, mayor Balkar Sandhu said that directions have already been issued to the officials to get the internal drains, sewer lines and road gullies cleaned. The work is ongoing and the lines will be cleared before the monsoon hits the city, Sandhu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/waterlogging-blows-lid-off-ludhiana-mc-s-tall-claims-101622834901048.html

Their lives are most precious for us and their health assumes paramount importance. However, since we don’t have previous assessment models for these students, it is inevitable for us to somehow evaluate their performance and hence a most simple solution has been formulated,” the statement stated. The two papers, to be held on two different days with at least 3 days gap in between, will have optical mark readers, and it will have multiple choice answers. Kumar said that model question papers will be released shortly.The decision comes in the wake of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic crisis in Karnataka, which is among the worst impacted regions in the country.The exams for SSLC will be held in the third week of July and grading for PUC students will be announced by the last week of June. “We are not holding the PUC exams this year. The grading will be based on their performance at the district level assessment in the first pre-university examination,” Suresh said while addressing a press conference. “The second pre-university college students would be promoted to the next level,” he added. The minister said that the government is doubling the number of examination centres from 3,000 to 6,000 this time to ensure proper safety precautions are taken for the same. “Only 12 students per room would be accommodated and only one student per desk. At least a six feet distance will be maintained between each student,” the minister said.All students will be provided N 95 masks and all teachers will be vaccinated; the minister added.Kumar also said that the primary and secondary education are now deliberating on how they can innovate to bring in periodical review practices like CBSE and ICSE. He also added that it is unlikely that any student will be held back in these two grades.However, the decision to hold exams for class 10 received criticism from former Karnataka chief minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader HD Kumaraswamy. “It is really insane on the part of the state government to hold SSLC exams while cancelling the II Year PUC exams in the wake of the prevailing Covid situation.People of the state are laughing at such a mad decision of the education minister who is acting as if he is out of his mind,” Kumaraswamy posted on Twitter.He said that the government should withdraw the “irrational decision” and “reign in” the education minister “who is playing with the lives of children.” “It is mainly due to the fear of the Prime Minister that II PU exams were cancelled. Is this learned person who is eager to hold exams for SSLC students an education minister or the examination minister who is testing the patience of parents and students,” he added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ktaka-to-hold-sslc-exams-from-july-3rd-week-2nd-puc-exam-scrapped-101622834238088.html

Two passers-by rescued the teen, Neha, but she couldn’t escape multiple bite injuries on her arms, chest and back. The girl also received seven stitches on the head after she fell on the road in the vicious attack.Her parents, who are migrant workers, have filed a police complaint against a doctor in the area, who feeds stray dogs, alleging this had led to an increase in their number. As per information, Neha, the only child of her parents, was on her way to a relative’s house with her mother around 6am when the dogs attacked her without provocation. Two commuters passing by rescued her and helped her reach the hospital. Her mother, Roshni, said, “She was walking at some distance from me when the dogs suddenly appeared and attacked her. They also tried to bite me as I jumped in to save my daughter. Fortunately, two residents came to our rescue and saved us from the dogs.” Father Vinod Kumar, who works in a garment factory, said he was asleep at home when his wife alerted him over the phone. “I was shocked to see multiple injuries on my daughter’s body.

The three workers, all in the early thirties, died in the drainage even though manual scavenging has been banned since 1993. Ramanagara district police identified the deceased as Manjunath (32), Manjunath (30) and Rajesh (32). According to police, Manjunath who had gone into the drainage collapsed due to asphyxiation. Soon, the other two went inside to rescue him but died inside. According to police, the three workers were hired by the Ramanagara Municipal Corporation through a contractor. Police who have filed an FIR has arrested one Manoj on Friday, who is an associate of a contractor named Harish. Following the incident, two government staffers were booked and transferred .These deaths come just months after 30-year-old Lal Ahmed and 25-year-old Rasheed Ahmed died while cleaning a manhole in north Karnataka’s Kalburgi on January 26. In a similar incident, on February 23, a pourakarmika (civic worker) working for the municipality in Maddur town of Mandya district died by suicide, months after he was allegedly forced to clean a manhole without safety equipment. According to Karnataka State Commission for Safai Karamcharis, the state has witnessed 36 manual scavenging-related incidents since 2008, resulting in 72 deaths. Police cases were filed in all the incidents, but there has not been a single conviction. In four cases, police filed a B Report, which meant they did not find any evidence to file a charge sheet. Five cases were registered as unnatural deaths, 15 were under trial, two under investigation and in 12 cases, the accused were acquitted. “Any death related to manual scavenging is called an accident, but the truth is that it is culpable homicide, if not murder. When you send someone inside a pit with poisonous gases, you are aware of the danger to that person’s life,” said Clifton Rozario, a city-based advocate, who has filed the petition against manual scavenging in the high court. Even though The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act came into existence in 2013, the inhuman practice not only continues, but it has caused lives,” Rozario said. The Karnataka high court too, in December 2020, had noted the state government’s laxity in implementing the law in full letter and spirit. A bench led by Chief Justice AS Oka had noted that forcing one to perform manual scavenging amounts to a violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Indian Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnataka-3-sanitation-workers-die-while-cleaning-sewage-system-101622834120394.html

Leaving Sandhu with multiple injuries, they proceeded to vandalise a Toyota Fortuner parked at a petrol pump near the Samrala Chowk. It reportedly belongs to another relative of Bains.They moved to Chotti Colony around 12.30am where Bains’ house is located. They pelted the building with stones, while abusing and threatening the gangster’s mother, who is a witness in the murderous attack on him by the Mota gang, said police. The assailants then went to New Mohar Singh Nagar, where they hurled stones at the house of Nanna Don, an aide of Bains, and then moved to Ghoda Colony, where they fired five shots at the house of a woman, Anju, also a relative of Bains.

Karnataka revenue minister R Ashoka on Thursday said a decision has been taken to provide adequate equipment to the task force to handle any flooding-like situations in the city. “We have directed the BBMP to use high-pressure motors to drain underpasses. A task force will be set up in every assembly constituency to exclusively oversee the monsoon preparations and attend to distress calls from citizens. The task force will be provided with required vehicles, personnel and equipment to deal with rain-related emergencies. A 24X7 control room will be set up in every BBMP zone to attend to people’s problems,” the minister said. The decision was taken after a meeting called by chief minister BS Yediyuarappa with senior officials of the city administration just two days before the southwest monsoon is expected to hit Karnataka. During the meeting, the CM also instructed officials to set up eight permanent control rooms, one in each zone, and 63 temporary control rooms, which must be operational 24 hours, said officials who were part of the meeting. On Wednesday, minister for urban development BA Basavaraj, along with BBMP commissioner Gaurav Gupta, reviewed various measures taken in this regard. As per the report of the review meeting, which was presented to the CM, as many as 209 flood-prone areas have been identified across the city, of which 58 have been placed in severely vulnerable category while 151 were deemed moderately vulnerable. They also informed the CM that the redevelopment of 440 km of stormwater drain walls has been completed and added that other monsoon preparatory works will be completed by the end of June. As per the documents presented to the chief minister, Bommanhalli area in Bengaluru has the highest number (12) of flood-prone areas followed by Mahadevapura (10). On Thursday, Sai Layout, Geddalahalli and a few other areas near Hennur Main Road got flooded with just 80-90 mm of rainfall in the city. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the southwest monsoon will enter interior Karnataka and Bengaluru by Sunday. CS Patil, director in-charge of IMD-Bengaluru, said the interior parts of Karnataka will receive rain for the next three days. While the preparation for the monsoon is underway in full swing, BBMP officials are faced with the additional challenge of handling Covid-19 situation. As the number of Covid-19 cases are still on the higher side, officials have been asked to prepare for any contingencies, where people have to be evacuated in case of serious flooding. “We are preparing for the same. In several parts of Bengaluru, people have to evacuate their houses for a short time because of the flooding. They generally move with someone they know or a relative. Even though it is a worst-case scenario and is very few in numbers, we are making a plan on relocating people, if needed,” said a senior BBMP official, who didn’t wish to be named. Meanwhile, considering the higher number of power cuts in the city, Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited (BESCOM) has decided to allocate more staff for its helpline (1912) number, which was converted to Covid-19 helpline when the cases were on the rise. “We had around 60 personnel working for the Covid-19 helpline and 30 working for BESCOM helpline, with the reduction in calls, we might move some employees back to BESCOM since there are multiple power fluctuations due to rains,” said a helpline official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bengaluru-buckles-up-for-monsoon-101622833998055.html

On Thursday, another IAS officer, Shilpa Nag, the incumbent Mysuru city commissioner, resigned from the services, citing “harassment” and “humiliation” by Sindhuri at a press conference.The offer to resign, which is yet to be taken forward through official channels by Nag, has opened the floodgates of brickbats against Sindhuri, a 2009-batch officer.Nag’s allegations, also mentioned in her handwritten resignation letter, include charges like “personal vendetta” and “ego” against Sindhuri, who has also reacted in an official release on Thursday.Hindustan Times has viewed a copy of both the resignation letter as well as Sindhuri’s reaction.“There is a process, a forum in which the chief secretary, a regional secretary is there. Everyone should follow the process,” Sindhuri told Kannada TV news channels on Friday. In a statement on Thursday, Sindhuri said she had only sought details of Covid-19 related documents, including expenditure of CSR funds during Covid, from Nag, which did not constitute to harassment.“It is not my place to keep on reacting to every allegation,” Sindhuri said on Friday.People aware of the developments said Sindhuri had impeded an attempt to usurp around 1,500 acres of land near a lakebed, which had upset some politicians.People cited above said Sindhuri was being targeted for not “obeying” politicians and their demands for awarding contract of works to persons related to them as well as denying an opportunity to usurp government land for various projects. She had also probed a possible model code of conduct violations against A Manju, then with the Congress in Hassan district, during the assembly elections in 2018. She was at the receiving end of sharp barbs by elected representatives when she had allegedly denied awarding a scaffolding contract to a person related to Manju just before the Mahamastakabhisheka of Gomateshwara, an elaborate Jain festival ritual held every 12 years in Hassan district.Soon after, the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government transferred her citing flimsy grounds of her breaching protocol. Sindhuri took the legal route and was reinstated.Her being appointed as deputy collector of Mysuru, the second largest city in Karnataka, about 125 km from Bengaluru, was opposed by Janata Dal (Secular) leader Sa Ra Mahesh. At a press conference called on May 2 by the JD(S) leader, he took personal jibes at Sindhuri, stating that the district required “role model officers” and not “models”. Politicians from all three political parties – the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress and the JD(S) – have targeted Sindhuri in the recent past.The developments are not helping chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who is also at battle with dissidents from within his own party and fighting all attempts by the BJP central leadership to replace him.Sindhuri was also accused of ignoring desperate calls for help by her colleague from Chamarajanagar, where 24 Covid-19 patients died allegedly due to shortage of oxygen. However, a report after a probe into the incident indicated that there was no clear hindrance on the Mysuru DC for supply of oxygen to Chamarajanagara district. On Friday, Nag said her decision to resign was not in haste but well thought off.“Politicians, especially those who take up positions in the government, are expected to be neutral. But this rarely happens. The IAS officers on the other hand are neutral,” said a former IAS officer, who resigned from services in Karnataka two years ago citing personal reasons.He said officers are often targeted by politicians by planting fake news, spreading misinformation and organising protests for alleged corruption or irregularities. The officer cited above has known and worked with both Nag and Sindhuri in the past.He said Nag looked exhausted in her press conference.“Covid has extracted a lot from officials,” he said, adding that these officers have been working tirelessly for over a year now despite the threat the virus poses to their own families.He said such “skirmishes” were common between officials but rarely does an official do what Nag did.Karnataka chief secretary is scheduled to meet both officials on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mysuru-dc-comes-under-spotlight-as-rumblings-grow-in-admin-circles-101622833938018.html

During the meetings, the ministers and MLAs raised the issue of the “uncontrolled functioning” of bureaucrats, alleged involvement of some officers in corruption, besides officers not taking the calls made by the ministers, MLAs and MPs. They also claimed the appointment of officers in various departments had been made without the ministers’ consent. The MLAs said that in several districts, the district magistrates were not informing the people’s representatives about the progress of development and welfare schemes and even matters referred by the MLAs were overlooked, said a BJP leader familiar with developments at the meetings.Another BJP leader, who did not wish to be named, said along with overhauling the bureaucracy before the 2022 assembly election, the state government had decided to fill up vacant posts in various boards, corporations and commissions. Vacancies in the BJP’s fronts, including Mahila Morcha, Yuva Morcha, Scheduled Caste Morcha, besides minority, OBC, traders’, intellectual, and legal cells, will be filled soon, too.In the meeting with chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy chief ministers Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, the two leaders Santhosh and Singh discussed the issues raised by the ministers and MLAs regarding the bureaucracy. Thereafter, the state government shifted 18 officers and more were likely to be transferred soon, a party leader said.With eight months left for the assembly election, the state government does not want a tussle between officials and MLAs. The state government faced embarrassment in the state assembly in December 2019 when several ruling party MLAs, led by BJP lawmaker from Loni in Ghaziabad, Nand Kishor Gujjar, staged a dharna (sit-in) in protest against the working of the district administration officers.While reviewing Covid management with district magistrates and superintendents of police, the chief minister had directed the officers to hold regular meetings with people’s representatives, brief the MLAs and MPs about the progress of various health projects, hand over the list and mobile numbers of patients admitted in the hospitals to local MLAs, the party leader said.All eyes are now on party meetings to be chaired by BJP national president JP Nadda in Delhi on June 5 and 6. The BJP leaders will review preparations for the 2022 assembly election in UP. Along with cabinet expansion in UP, the leaders are likely to mull over the assembly election strategy. “The initial mismanagement during the Covid second wave has damaged the image of the state government. The state unit will launch a public outreach campaign across the state as a damage control exercise,” the BJP leader said.Six DMs among 18 IAS officers shiftedWhile carrying out a reshuffle in the state bureaucracy, the state government transferred 18 IAS officers including district magistrates of six districts on Thursday- Friday night.Manoj Singh has been made the additional chief secretary (forest), MVS Rami Reddy the additional chief secretary (horticulture), Sudhir Garg the principal secretary (animal husbandry) and BL Meena the principal secretary (cooperatives).

While experts and activists said poor implementation failed the attempts to ban liquor, the state government has reasoned multiple issues, including rise in crime rate, illegal sale and smuggling of alcohol from other districts, fall in growth rate \as well as revenue losses accounting to ₹2,571 crore in five years, behind revoking it.The cabinet in its meeting on May 27 referred to the 100-page report submitted by a 13-member committee headed by former excise commissioner Ramanath Jha and comprised legal experts, activists, educationists and officials from various government departments.  The committee said that the implementation of the ban has grossly failed, resulting in the rampant sale of illicit and spurious liquor, which is injurious to the health. Secondly, while the state government lost on its excise revenue, the high sale of illegal and smuggled liquor led to the rise in crime rate. The liquor ban also had an impact on the social, health and criminal aspects, with the involvement of children and women in the illegal sale of liquor being the most worrisome, the report stated. Lastly, the public opinion over the ban appears to have changed because of the failed implementation and it has resulted in citizen groups demanding that the prohibition be revoked.However, the committee has recommended that the ban can continue if the implementation is taken seriously. It has also stated that if the measures suggested by the Deotale committee – appointed in 2011 before the ban came into force – were enforced rigorously, liquor can be prohibited in the district by allocating more funds and resources. The Jha committee also recommended taking a decision on continuing the ban, based on its assessment in rural and urban parts of the district. Finally, it also recommend for a state-level liquor ban policy, instead of imposing it in some districtsData that went against the ban The committee collated the five-year before and after data from various departments to assess the impact of the liquor ban. In its report, the committee stated that the annual growth in stamp duty contracted between 2015 and 2019 to 8.15% from 26.14% recorded in 2010-2014. Similarly, the annual value-added tax (VAT)/ goods and services tax (GST) growth rate contracted to 1.87%, during the five years of ban against 16.32% recorded before it. The committee also observed that tourism, entertainment and hospitality sectors were badly hit.According to the committee, the cases of crimes against women shot up to 4,042 during the 2015-19 period from 1,729 cases recorded in 2010-2014, while the cases against children increased to 64 from 24 in the five-year period before the ban. The number of cases related to liquor consumption went up to 36,215 in the first five years of the ban against 12,474 cases from 2010 to 2014. Other crime cases, too, witnessed around two-fold rise from 25,101 to 47,050 in 2015-2019.“Children and women were roped into to smuggle liquor from the neighbouring Nagpur, Bhandara and Yavatmal districts to evade the police. Many students who travel to their colleges to Nagpur were caught smuggling liquor bottles in their bags. The number of illegal shops selling smuggled illegal and spurious liquor mushroomed in thousands, against the 531 licensees that existed before ban. More serious was the rise in organised crime, as gangs of goons entered in the business of illegal sale. The fact that 26 people were booked under the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) Act in the first five years of ban shows the severity of the crime situation of the district. There was not a single case registered under MPDA from 2010 to 2014,” said an excise department official.The report submitted by the committee has also stated that the government exchequer faced a revenue loss of ₹2,571 crore ( ₹1,607 crore in excise and VAT worth ₹964) in the first five years of ban.It stated that out of the 269,824 memoranda received from the citizens during a referendum, 243,627 proposed that the ban be lifted, while only 25,876 favoured its continuation. Home, excise and finance departments of the state government seconded the proposal to lift the ban, while rural development, social justice and woman and child welfare departments expressed their reservations in lifting it.Politics behind the decisionThe Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was in favour of lifting the liquor ban from Day one of its formation in November 2019. A committee under the district collector was appointed immediately after MVA government came in power. It submitted its report last March, favouring the withdrawal of the ban. When the government tried to lifting the ban on the basis of the report, the district witnessed a huge uproar, with locals saying the report was biased and the data fudged.Social activists such as Paromita Goswami and Dr Abhay Bang staunchly opposed the lifting of the ban. Treading cautious steps, the state government appointed the committee headed by Jha in September.The lifting of ban came as a decision as part of the election promise by Congress leaders, similar on the lines of the decision to impose it in 2015 by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government. BJP leader and former Chandrapur guardian minister Sudhir Mungantiwar had assured the locals that liquor will be banned if the party is elected to power in the 2014 Assembly polls. The ban was one of the decisions taken by the Devendra Fadnavis government in the first six months.In the 2019 Assembly polls, Chandrapur’s guardian minister and state relief and rehabilitation minister from the Congress, Vijay Wadettiwar, had made the issue the election plank by assuring the electorate that the ban will be lifted. “The lifting of ban was based on the referendum in which public opinion was weighed. The sale of illegal and spurious liquor had increased multi-fold and crime rates shot up. More than 4,000 women and 320 children were booked for direct involvement in illicit liquor business. The ban led to other ill-effects as well, owing to which it has been lifted,” the minister said.Mungantiwar said alleged that the data and statistics given by the district machinery are fudged and fake. “The decision to lift the ban was taken for political and other reasons. Many Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders are directly involved in the liquor business at Chandrapur and the adjoining districts. The government is eyeing an annual sale of ₹1,000 crore for liquor, but it will come at the cost of people’s health and well-being. Their claim of revenue losses is not true because the excise duty is levied on manufacturing,” he said. Mungantiwar said that MVA’s priority is to push the liquor businesses and the decision to provide waivers to the industry in the past 18 months prove it. “The decision to lift the ban during the pandemic shows how desperate they were for it,” he added.Dissenting voicesDr Bang, who has been fighting for liquor ban in Chandrapur and Gadchiroli said that the figures given to revoke the decision were exaggerated and twisted. “The public opinion taken in the name of the referendum was a sham and the memoranda collected in favour of lifting the ban were generated by those who were in the liquor business. The figures given for the rise in crime rate are inflated because the number of domestic violence cases and the general crimes have reduced. The data includes cases registered for illegal sale of liquor. A survey done by non-governmental organisation (NGO) Search and Nagpur University establishes that the ban had a positive impact. The district collector, who should have been the nodal officer to implement the ban, was asked to review and submit a report after the political leadership announced to lift it. This is just a mockery of the law,” he said.Dr Bang said that Chandrapur’s ban failed because its implementation fell short. “No ban proves to be 100% effective. The ban in adjoining Gadchiroli is 70% successful as 600 of the total villages have implemented it in toto. We have taskforces in villages for its implementation. As CM, Fadnavis had headed the taskforce for the district. If it could be successful in Gadchiroli, why can’t it be replicated in Chandrapur? And if the ban is lifted for failure in implementation, ban on tobacco, corruption and plastic, too, should be lifted,” he added.Goswami, who has been fighting for the ban since 2002, said that the government lacked the will power to strictly implement it. “Why it can’t be successful in Chandrapur when its being strictly in force in Gadchiroli. The government had passed an ordinance in September 2019 for the stricter implementation of prohibition in these districts, but MVA government did not convert it into a law,” she said.Demand for ban started in 2000s • Wardha, known for the popular Sevagram Ashram where Mahatma Gandhi lived during the freedom movement, was the first district to impose liquor ban in 1975• The Maoist-dominated tribal district of Gadchiroli imposed the ban in 1993• The demand for liquor ban started gaining momentum in Chandrapur from the early 2000s. In 2010, the issue was raised in the legislature, and the government assured to appoint a committee to deliberate on the issue• During 2010-11, 585 (60%) gram panchayats in the district passed a resolution calling for the liquor ban. More than 100,000 women signed a petition over the demand, but no decision was taken by the then Congress-led government• in February 2011, a committee was constituted under the then guardian minister and Congress leader Sanjay Deotale• A month later, thousands of women from Chandrapur’s Chimur marched to Nagpur demanding the ban• The Deotale committee submitted the report in February 2012 recommending the ban and suggested measures for its implementation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/why-govt-lifted-the-6-year-old-liquor-ban-in-maharashtra-s-chandrapur-district-101622833398034.html

The incident happened when state tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray was holding a meeting in one of the conference rooms along the lobby. However, no injuries were reported as the incident took place outside the conference rooms where no one was present. Following advice from officials, Thackeray called off the meeting and left the premises immediately, said an official. State public works (PWD) department officials inspected the site soon after the incident.State PWD minister Ashok Chavan said that an ornamental false ceiling having wooden support had collapsed, as it was fitted 25 years ago. “I have sought a detailed report of the incident,” he added.The incident has raised serious safety concerns of ministers and officials who use the premises to hold meetings. It also led to panic among officials and the staff of the guest house. However, PWD officials said there was no problem with the structure or the ceiling of the building. “The portion that collapsed was part of an ornamental false ceiling. It has nothing to do with the RCC (reinforced cement concrete) structure or the slab. We’ll soon find out the cause of the incident and take action accordingly,” said Anil Gaikwad, secretary, PWD.He added that the structural audit of the building was conducted only three months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/false-ceiling-collapses-in-mumbai-s-sahyadri-guest-house-none-hurt-101622833158015.html

The health teams, including ASHA workers, visited 1,49,891 houses in the district.Initially, the target was to visit 1,24,954 houses and cover 6,25,540 persons in rural areas. But later, the villages within the city limits were also screened as a precautionary measure.The villagers and sarpanchs extended much support during the survey. “Even as the number of new Covid positive cases is on a steady decline, precautions are a must. People should stay home unless venturing out is absolutely necessary. Masks should be worn and necessary distance from each other should be maintained,” said Mohali civil surgeon Adarshpal Kaur.Revealing the survey findings, Kaur said, “The sampling has indicated that there is no community spread in the villages. The screening was done to provide doorstep testing facility to villagers who were hesitant to come forward.”Stating that the rural areas witnessed more cases in the second wave as compared to before, the civil surgeon said, “The villagers were in denial mode and avoided being tested. They used to land up in hospitals with very low oxygen levels, so it was decided to take testing to their doorstep to contain the spread of disease.”For health-related queries, patients/ attendants can contact the health department helpline 104.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-community-spread-in-mohali-villages-finds-survey-101622831478615.html

05-06-2021||Chandigarh||Runaway couples seeking protection share their ordeal||They are adults and in love, but are constantly living in fear and in hiding. Their only crime is that they chose to spend life with a partner of their own choice, and want to stay in a live-in relationship. However, with this decision comes a threat to their life and they can be seen knocking the doors of the high court.In Haryana’s Jind village, a 19-year-old girl was locked in house, her studies were stopped and search for a bridegroom was started. Her only fault was that she loved a man of her choice.While the girl is a Jat and an MBBS aspirant, her 20-year-old love interest belongs to a backward class and has studied till Class 12.The girl, wishing not to be named, said: “We have been in a relationship for nearly four years. He was my senior in school and we have been very good friends since 2017. He is a very sensible person; even his family is very loving and caring. I love him and want to spend life with him.”While their love was blooming and both were focusing on making careers, so that they could lead a comfortable life afterwards, her family got to know about their relationship. “They did not let me attend coaching classes or online classes. My father took away my phones and I was not allowed to step outside.”The youth, who belongs to an adjoining village, said: “She called me one day, saying that her parents are planning to marry her to someone else. It was then we decided to run away.”The couple wants to be in a live-in relationship, till the time the boy attainsthe marriageable age. But they feared a threat to their life and hence reached the Punjab and Haryana high court in Chandigarh, seeking protection, but their plea was dismissed on May 14.The order mentioned that if such protection is granted then the social fabric of the society would be disturbed.The youth, who had very high hopes, said: “We live in fear all the time. The cancellation of the petition has added more stress.” The couple is living in hiding; they switch places frequently, so that they don’t get caught.Their advocate, Vishal Mittal, said: “Protection to life and liberty is every person’s right under Article 21 of the Constitution. Any person can seek protection. Judges should not go into the validity of their relationships but into this aspect of protection.”Another advocate, wishing not to be named, said: “Ideally, judges must go by one law, which is written in the Constitution. But often personal prejudices and laws of society come in their judgment. In law, personal opinion has no space.”‘Around 40 such cases daily’AdvocateSarvesh Kumar, who represented another such couple from rural Punjab,said that daily around 40 such petitions seeking protection are listed in the high court.His clients, Arshdeep Kaur and Gurpinder Singh, both 24, fell in love two years ago. While Singh does a private job, Kaur’s family wanted a son-in-law who has a government job. “I tried convincing my family but they were too adamant. I know that I cannot live without him; so we planned to run away,” said Kaur.The couple reached Chandigarh and got married at a gurdwara on May 24. This has agitated the girl’s family, who are looking for the couple. “My family is threatening Gurpinder’s family and his relatives. They are even giving death threats,” said Kaur, who is quite scared as her brothers and father are “very aggressive”. “They will kill us; hence, we sought protection. We are living in hiding and have switched off our mobile phones.”Even their plea for protection was rejected by the high court on May 14, on the ground that representation lacks “necessary particulars” regarding manner and mode of alleged threat.Sarvesh Kumar cited numerous cases wherein different judges had denied protection to several couples in live-in relationships. “In one such case from Amritsar, the girl was later allegedly killed by her family in the name of honour,” he said.However, while a high court bench on May 18 held that a live-in relationship is not prohibited nor does it amount to the commission of any offence, another bench observed that such relationships may not be acceptable to all, but could not be termed illegal. Hence, the denial of protection to a live-in couple would be a mockery of justice, it ruled. The court on May 21 gave protection to one such couple from Karnal, who are now staying at a safe home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/runaway-couples-seeking-protection-share-their-ordeal-101622829019268.html
05-06-2021||Delhi||‘Must administer 2nd Covaxin jab in 6 wks’: Delhi HC||The Delhi government on Friday told the Delhi high court that it planned inoculations by Covaxin based on the assurance by the manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, that the national capital will be given 500,000 doses in May and “four times that in June”.The submission came in response to the court’s observation that there was an “urgent need” to vaccinate people with the second dose of Covaxin within six weeks. “People cannot be left in lurch,” justice Rekha Palli said.The judge said there was an urgent need for the authorities to spell out the time to administer the second dose considering the Delhi government’s submission that 150,000 people have been administered the first dose between the age group of 18-44 years.“..Specially in view of the submission of Respondent no 1 (Delhi government) that 1.5 lakh people between the age group of 18-44 years have been administered the first dose, there is an urgent need to vaccinate the people with 2nd dose within six weeks,” the court said.It also questioned the city government for not taking a timely decision to stop the administration of the first dose in the city.“Even though you were well aware you did not stop it. When you already knew on May 12 that the doses were not coming, why did you not stop it..They (the Delhi government) were getting too optimistic that they would get it (the vaccines). They were overconfident... Had you been a little wiser…,” justice Palli remarked.The court was hearing three pleas filed by people who were finding it difficult to get the second dose of Covaxin after getting the first jab.According to Delhi government’s vaccine bulletin on Friday, the government-run vaccination centres have less than a day’s stock of Covaxin for the 45+ age group, even though its present stock of Covishield is expected to last another 28 days.For the 18-45 years age group, all 368 Delhi government centres -- administering Covaxin and Covishield -- have been shut for about two weeks after they ran out of stock.Advocate Anuj Aggarwal, additional standing counsel for the Delhi government, told the court that they continued to vaccinate because the Centre told them not to set aside any doses. He also said that since they were promised the adequate amount of Covaxin doses, they inoculated the people accordingly.To this the court said, “So as the Delhi government, you are saying that you can’t do anything? Give us a clear stand”.Aggarwal told the court that the supply needs to be streamlined, and added that the Delhi government issued a circular on June 3, mandating that next doses supplied will be used only for administering second doses.Central government standing counsel Anurag Alhuwalia told the court that it had dispatched the vaccine, and left it to the discretion of the state governments to use it for first dose or second dose.The court asked both the Centre and the Delhi government to look into the shortage while remarking that it would not get into a blame game at this stage.The court asked the Centre and Delhi government to take instructions and posted the matter for hearing on June 7.The company has a production capacity of about 10-15 million doses a month. On May 20, it announced it was ramping up production with additional capacity of 200 million doses per year, taking the annual production to close to 1 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/planned-covaxin-vaccinations-on-assurance-of-manufacturer-delhi-govt-tells-hc-101622828297675.html
05-06-2021||Delhi||303 vaccination centres shut amid lack of Covaxin doses||New Delhi As many as 303 Delhi government vaccine centres, meant for those aged above 45 years and spread across 196 locations in the city, were suspended on Friday in the light of shortage of Covaxin doses, the government’s daily vaccine bulletin showed.The government’s bulletin recorded 414 vaccine centres spread across 299 locations on Friday for the beneficiary group comprising individuals aged over 45 years, as against 717 vaccine centres spread across 495 locations recorded till Thursday. The bulletin also showed that the government-run centres have less than a day’s stock of Covaxin for the 45+ age group, even though its present stock of Covishield is expected to last another 28 days.For the 18-45 years age group, all 368 Delhi government centres -- administering both Covaxin, which is produced by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, and Covishield, produced by the Serum Institute of India.-- are suspended for around two weeks now after they ran out of stock.“Covaxin doses are almost over for the 45+ group. For more than a week now, we have been administering Covaxin to only those scheduled for the second dose. Now, even with the second dose policy, we are unlikely to succeed in continuing with offering Covaxin doses for more than a day to the 45+ category. We urge the central government to expedite and scale up the supply of Covaxin in Delhi,” said AAP MLA Atishi, while reading out the government’s vaccine bulletin in a live streamed video press briefing on Friday evening.“For the 45+ group, we had around 600,000 doses of vaccines left on Friday morning – of which around 590,000 were Covishield doses, which should last for 28 days, and the remaining were Covaxin doses. More Covaxin centres for the 45+ group are likely to be closed tomorrow (Saturday) and in the coming days if stocks are not replenished. As far as the 18-45 age group is concerned, we have been out of vaccines for 12 days now. Vaccination in Delhi is mostly happening in private centres currently. The rates are unaffordable for around 70% of Delhi’s population, especially at a time when the lockdown has affected household incomes. So, only people who can afford the high price between ₹1,000 and 2,000 for a single dose are getting vaccinated. It is an unfortunate scenario,” said AtishiStressing on how vaccinating the younger population would help reduce hesitancy among the elder population, Atishi said, “In Delhi, more than 50% of the population belonging to the 45+ age group have got at least one dose of vaccine. The vaccine coverage of this age group can be increased with increasing supplies for the 18-45 group. It is inter-related. Higher vaccination coverage in the younger population will help reduce hesitancy among the older population. The young are also likely to encourage the seniors in their family to get vaccinated along with them. Delhi needs 5 million doses of vaccines in June. We appeal to the central government to help in this regard.”Government records showed that around 4.25 million people in Delhi have received one dose of the vaccine and around 1.24 million have received both doses.Documents seen by HT showed that the Delhi government is supposed to receive 319,510 doses of Covishield and 96,300 doses of Covaxin directly from the central government – for the vaccination of the 45+ age group -- in June. The Delhi government will also be allowed to purchase 309,220 doses of Covishield and 91,960 doses of Covaxin from manufacturers to carry out vaccinations for the 18-45 age group.“However, consignments directly ordered from the manufacturers are not likely to arrive before June 10. So, the Delhi government centres for the younger beneficiary groups are unlikely to resume till then,” said a senior government official.To be sure, vaccine sites in central government hospitals in Delhi (which are currently vaccinating only the 45+ group) and those in private hospitals (open for both 18-45 and the 45+ age groups) have independent stocks.Delhi has a total population of around 20 million, of which 15 million are over 18 years and qualify for the vaccine drive. As per government estimates, there are around six million people aged 45 and above – of which, government records showed, around 2.51 million have received one dose of the vaccine and around 832,000 have received both doses. Also, there are around nine million people aged between 18-45 years, of which around 1.12 million have received one dose of the vaccine and 2,387 have received both doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/303-vaccine-centres-shut-amid-shortage-of-covaxin-101622828237747.html

The height of the constructed pier is 6.5 metre, and average height of the piers in the stretch varies from 5.6 metres to 17 metres.”The spokesperson added, “The foundation work between New Ashok Nagar to Kondli is in full swing. Foundation work on around 2km of the 9.2km elevated corridor in Delhi has been completed.”In February this year, the NCRTC started the work on the construction of a bridge on the river, which will be parallel to the Delhi Noida direct flyway.The 1.35-km-long bridge on Yamuna, which will be the 17th to come up on the river, will connect Sarai Kale Khan and New Ashok Nagar stations.“It will be the first RRTS bridge on the river. The length of the bridge crossing over the river will be around 626 metres. The remaining portion will come up on the floodplain on both sides,” said the spokesperson.This will be the eighth mass transit corridor to be constructed on the river.Northern Railway is constructing a new bridge parallel to the Old Yamuna bridge. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has four corridors crossing the river and the construction work on the fifth bridge on the Majlis Park-Maujpur corridor started in August last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/first-pillar-on-delhi-meerut-rrts-line-comes-up-at-new-ashok-nagar-101622828177711.html
05-06-2021||Delhi||Panel gets 10 days to fix criteria to assess Class 12||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Friday constituted a 13-member team to fix “well-defined objective criteria” for the assessment of Class 12 students following the cancellation of their exams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.In a statement, announcing the constitution of the committee, CBSE said the panel will submit its report within 10 days. Officials said the board will now collect data on the past performances from schools and seek expert opinions to formulate the alternative assessment method.The Union government on Tuesday cancelled CBSE Class 12 exams to ward off the threat of coronavirus infections. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The government said that CBSE will come up with a “well-defined objective criteria” in a time-bound manner to assess these students. On Thursday, the Supreme Court gave two weeks to the CBSE to come up with an evaluation formula for Class 12 students.In the statement, the board said, “In view of the uncertain conditions due to Covid and the feedback obtained from various stakeholders, it was decided that Class 12 board exams of CBSE will not be held this year. It was also decided that CBSE will take steps to compile the results as per well-defined objective criteria in a timeb-ound manner.”The members of the committee included Vipin Kumar, joint secretary in ministry of education’s department of school education, Udit Prakash, director of the Delhi government’s directorate of education (DoE), Nidhi Pandey, commissioner of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, one representative from the UGC and NCERT each, and two representatives from the schools, CBSE controller examinations and director (academics), among others.Sanyam Bhardwaj, CBSE controller examinations and a member of the committee, said the board will try to formulate a criterion using which the students will get marks equivalent to what they would have gotten after appearing in the examination. “We will analyse and study the data of previous year performances of students in classes 10, 11 and internal exams of Class 12 and compare it with their Class 12 final marks in CBSE board exams. We will compare and correlate the performances of students in Class 10 and then Class 12 in previous years. We will collect this data from some schools on Monday,” he said.Bhardwaj said that the board will also seek information regarding the methods schools used for the internal assessment of students.“We are just trying to find out the ground reality and take wider consultation before coming out with an assessment method. We have requested our regional officers to consult with schools in their regions and seek this information. Besides, we will also take advice from experts on the matter... Whatever data we will collect from schools would be easily available with them,” he said.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said, “The committee has wide range of people. It’s looking very balanced... If the board is going to consult large number of schools it will have some benchmark to base their assessment policy on.”Teachers and students have already expressed reservations over suggestions in some quarters that the CBSE formula for assessing Class 10 students may be applied for Class 12. They said the policy was flawed and that it was unfair to meritorious high scorers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbse-forms-13-member-committee-to-fix-assessment-plan-for-class-12-101622828117764.html
05-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt challenges HC nod for pvt schools to collect annual fees||The Delhi government has challenged in the Delhi high court the order by a single judge allowing private schools in the city to collect annual fees and development charges.The judge on Monday quashed two orders issued by the Delhi government last year, prohibiting private schools from collecting annual charges and development fee during the Covid-19 lockdown. The judge ruled that schools may collect these charges for the last academic year, on a monthly basis, but only after a 15% reduction in the payable amount, in lieu of un-utilised facilities (such as water and electricity) during the lockdown.The matter was urgently mentioned on Friday, following which it was listed for hearing before a bench of justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla on Monday.The Delhi government has argued that “schools being charitable organisations are adopting an inhumane approach by charging parents more in the unprecedented time”.“...Therefore, creating such a pressure to recover from the parents who are already struggling to save their family from medical emergencies is nothing but an inhuman approach which may not be allowed by this court. Needless to say each and every family is incurring expenses... with economy at an all-time low and people losing jobs which makes the survival of common man more difficult,” the government said in the appeal.Justice Jayant Nath on June 1 quashed orders issued on April 18, 2020 and August 28, 2020, which restricted private schools in the city to collect additional charges.The high court ruled that the prohibition on collecting the charges is “illegal and “ultra vires” to the powers of Delhi government’s directorate of education under the Delhi School Education (DSE) Act and Rules.The Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, an umbrella body of 450 private unaided schools in Delhi, moved the court in September 2020 against the Delhi government orders, saying that the orders curtail the rights of the educational institutions to fix their own fees.In its appeal against the June 1 order, the Delhi government has said extra charges such as development fees was suspended as the upgradation, improvement and maintenance was not required when the schools were closed for more than one and a half years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-challenges-order-allowing-pvt-schools-to-collect-annual-fees-and-development-charges-101622827997860.html
05-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt caps rate for black fungus treatment at private hospitals||After fixing the rates for the Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals, the state government has put a cap on the rates for treatment of mucormycosis or black fungus, at private hospitals.The admissions of these patients remain the same as the normal Covid-19 patients. While the charges for the routine isolation range from ₹4,000, ₹3,000 and ₹2,400 per day, for A, B and C category areas respectively, it is ₹7,500, ₹5,500 and ₹4,500 for intensive care unit (ICU) without ventilators. For the treatment in ICU with ventilators, the rates are ₹9,000, ₹6,700 and ₹5,400 for the hospitals in A, B and C category areas, respectively. The rates include monitoring, consultation charges, meals, nursing charges investigations such as CBC (complete blood count), serum creatinine, urine routine, X-ray, electrocardiogram (ECG), nursing and bed charges.For the 28 types of surgeries related to fungal infection, the charges have been capped between ₹10,000 to ₹1 lakh for Class-A areas, ₹75,000 to ₹7,500 for Class-B areas and ₹60,000 to ₹600 for the Class-C areas.Mumbai Metropolitan Region, except Vasai Virar, Bhiwandi; Nagpur and Pune, have been classified as A-class areas, while areas such as Aurangabad, Solapur, Kolhapur, Nashik, Amravati, Bhiwandi, Nanded, Kolhapur, Vasai Virar and Sangli have been classified as B-class areas. The remaining rural regions are in C-category. The notification issued by the public health department will remain in force till July 31.It has also warned that if a private hospital is found violating the orders, it will be liable for cancellation of registration of nursing home and also face action under India Penal Code. The notification also states that the billing by such hospitals will be audited by the auditors appointed by local authorities and any such excessive amount, if charged, will be reimbursed to the patient.Maharashtra has reported more than 5,000 cases of black fungus, which has already declared as a notified disease. The rates have been capped by using provisions in various Acts including the Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act, Maharashtra Nursing Home Act, Bombay Public Trusts Act among others.“Superspeciality hospitals in big cities in MMR, Nagpur, Pune where the specialised doctors are available to handle these cases, charge high rates. This adds to the hardship of patients and the government had received many such complaints,” said a health department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-caps-rate-for-black-fungus-treatment-at-private-hospitals-101622827757692.html
05-06-2021||Delhi||Woman stabbed by neighbour in Rohini||A 28-year-old woman was critically injured after she was stabbed at least eight times on Thursday, allegedly by her neighbour, outside her home in Rohini’s Sector 11.The attacker, identified as Naresh alias Raju, was arrested and the kitchen knife he used for the crime has been recovered, police said.The woman is being treated in hospital and is now stable.Though the exact motivation behind the alleged attack is yet to be ascertained, preliminary investigation revealed that the two neighbours were not on good terms for a few months, and the woman, Renuka Luthra, also filed a complaint against the accused about a month ago.Her father, Bhim Luthra, alleged that Naresh was annoyed because of the complaint and wanted revenge.The incident, which took place on Thursday evening and was captured on CCTV cameras installed nearby, went viral on social media.In the footage, the man was seen attacking the woman with a knife as the latter fell on the ground trying to shield herself. While the man continued stabbing the woman, another man tried to stop him and pulled him away, after which the former fled the crime scene.HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.Deputy commissioner of police (outer north) Rajiv Ranjan Singh said the injured woman was first taken to a nearby hospital from where she was referred to Safdarjung hospital as her condition was serious. “The woman’s condition is now stable,” said DCP Singh.According to the DCP, the woman and the arrested neighbour had known each other for eight months. “The exact cause of the attack will be ascertained when we record the woman’s statement,” he added.Meanwhile, her father alleged that Naresh often created a nuisance in the neighbourhood after drinking alcohol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/50yearold-arrested-for-stabbing-neighbour-in-rohini-101622827698350.html
05-06-2021||Delhi||CBSE survey to gauge how Covid-19 impacted schools||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has initiated a survey to understand the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the teaching-learning and assessment processes, and the socio-economic condition of its affiliated schools across the country. The survey aims to provide possible solutions to the challenges faced by the schools in the current Covid-hit academic year, and in the future.The virtual survey, which started on June 2 and will conclude on June 20, focuses on the teaching and learning practices adopted by the schools during the lockdown. In a letter to all its affiliated schools on Wednesday, CBSE director of academics Joseph Emmanuel said, “The insights obtained will help the board to propose and create support systems for schools in the current academic session and future policy formulations.”Among the details sought in the survey are the total strength of students from classes 9 to 12 in the academic sessions 2020-21 and 2021-22, the percentage of students having access to the internet, the percentage of students not in touch with schools since March last year, modes of virtual learning schools used during the lockdown, and attendance of students during online classes.The board has also asked schools to submit information on how their students and teachers accessed remote learning when the schools were physically shut. For instance, if students had to purchase devices or were given school-owned devices, or if multiple students used the same devices.CBSE has asked schools to tell them about the most popular tools for supplementary learning. These include worksheets, audio lessons, video lessons, assignments as games and narrative, and offline study material. It has sought information on whether schools have provided psychological support to students, and catered to the needs of children with disabilities.Physically classrooms were shut across the country for seven to 10 months last year. Schools in Delhi partially reopened for practical and remedial classes for students in classes 9 to 12 but had to shut down after the second national wave of Covid-19 -- fourth wave in the Capital.Emmanuel said the information collected will be used to find “broader solutions to existing problems” for CBSE affiliated schools. “The survey will help us understand the real picture on the ground. After analysing the responses, we will be in a better position to take any decision regarding the current curriculum as well as assessment for the existing and upcoming academic sessions,” he said.CBSE has also sought suggestions from schools on how it can provide support in terms of training and resources for teachers and students.Several school principals in Delhi said the survey will help the board understand their challenges. Meenakshi Khushwaha, principal of Birla Vidya Niketan in Pushp Vihar, said, “The survey is very crucial given that the entire education system is witnessing several challenges due to the pandemic. The suggestions provided by the schools should be taken seriously. Even if 10,000 schools respond, it will help the CBSE get a broader picture of the real situation while making any policy decision.”Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, said, “It is a very thoughtful decision to consider challenges and views in a very democratic manner. The survey will also help the board to deal with unforeseen circumstances in the future. Besides, efficient and meaningful strategies can only be formulated with reliable quantitative and qualitative data in hand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbse-survey-to-study-impact-of-covid-on-its-schools-101622827577746.html
05-06-2021||Delhi||Forest officials alert after leopard seen in Sultanpur||The state forest department on Friday put out an alert after they received two reports of a leopard being spotted around south Delhi’s Sultanpur Depot.A senior forest department official said they were first informed of a leopard being spotted around the Delhi-Gurugram border near Chattarpur on Wednesday, after which teams from the South forest division did a thorough search of the area.The department received another report from residents, who claimed they spotted the animal near Sultanpur Depot around 10am on Friday.“We have caught some images on CCTV cameras, but the images are blurry and we cannot say for sure if it is a leopard. However, we have set up more cameras around the area and have also put out an alert for the public to not venture out after dark, and to be on their guard. We are also engaging with local residents to ensure they do not attack the leopard, since it is a protected animal,” the forest department official said.Forest officials said they have laid out traps and are conducting round-the-clock patrols to capture the animal. Teams from Wildlife SOS, a wildlife protection and conservation group, also assisted the forest department in their capture efforts in the area on Friday.Delhi has seen an increase in leopard sightings over the past six years, a rise that experts said is an indication of the city’s success in efforts to create green spaces and sanctuaries for the safe movement of these animals.Amit Anand, deputy conservator forests (south division), said camera traps have been set up around the area and announcements are being made to ensure residents are vigilant.“We could not use drones on Friday since the skies were cloudy. But we will conduct drone surveillance on Saturday to spot the animal. Our primary aim is to trap the animal. If it is found to be in a healthy state, we will release it in the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary,” Anand said.Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in-charge at the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, where a leopard was spotted in 2016, said the reduced movement of people and vehicles due to the Covid-19 curbs could be one of the reason behind the increased instances of leopard sightings in Delhi.“We need to understand the leopard is a ‘generalist’ in its food habit, which means that it eats anything and everything. Even if scraps and chicken waste are thrown somewhere, they will attract a leopard. It has adapted itself well to the urban landscape, so we have seen leopards move around different continuous forests in Delhi,” Khudsar said.In March this year, the south forest division confirmed that at least two leopards were living in the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary over the past six months. Officials said they were spotted near some old mining pits in the area, adding that this was proof of the increased population of prey base for these animals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/leopard-sighting-near-sultanpur-depot-forest-dept-puts-out-alert-101622827517700.html

05-06-2021||Pune||Decision on further curb relaxation in PMC and PCMC on Monday: Ajit Pawar||Pune: The decision to further ease Covid relaxations in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad is likely to be taken on Monday. Areas under Pune and Khadki cantonment boards may also expect curb relaxation. Deputy chief minister and Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar made the statement during the Covid review meeting at Council Hall on Friday. Pawar instructed the civic and district administration to consider the areas under Pune and Khadki cantonment boards for relaxation from curbs.“The decision of unlocking is dependent on the positivity rate in that particular administrative unit. In terms of PMC and PCMC, the positivity rate is at 5% or below 5%. But in rural areas, the rate is still around 12%-13%. By Monday we will take a decision regarding further easing of restrictions,” Pawar said.With non-essential shops permitted to reopen, there is growing pressure from various business organisations such as salons, gyms operators to resume business. Pawar hinted at the possibility of an increase in the timings of shops.“Salon, beauty parlour operators are asking to be included in the unlock phase. We are going to monitor the positivity rate per day. Let’s wait for the reports of Saturday and Sunday,” he said.He also announced relief for areas under Pune and Khadki cantonment boards. “Khadki and Pune cantonments are not a part of Pune city (jurisdiction wise). So, no concessions have been given there. In the meeting, I told the administration to consider Khadki and Pune cantonments as a part of Pune city and apply the same rules of unlocking to these areas as Pune city. Dehu cantonment is more related to Talegaon and the positivity rate in that area is more than 10%. So no concessions will be given there as of now,” he said.Warkari representatives also met Pawar on Friday for the organisation of ‘Palkahi Sohala’. Pawar said a committee headed by Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao will be formed to discuss the issue with warkaris and a report will be prepared. “A report will be prepared in 3-4 days. It will be submitted to the chief minister and he will make the decision. Warkaris have asked for permission to take padukas to Pandharpur with only 50 people. They may follow the rules, but there might be crowd on the way. How would that crowd be controlled? Such situations have to be handled without using force,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/decision-on-further-curb-relaxation-in-pmc-and-pcmc-on-monday-ajit-pawar-101622825598133.html
05-06-2021||Pune||Over 0.2 million youth vaccinated at private hospitals in Pune city||After the Central government gave a nod to private hospitals to purchase Covid vaccines directly from the manufacturers, several prominent hospitals from the city bought the vaccine doses and from May 22 began vaccination. A majority of the beneficiaries who were getting vaccinated were from the age group of 18-45, and so since May 22 when the private hospitals started vaccinating until now a total of 0.2 million have received the vaccine in this age group. As the government centres have stopped vaccinating this age group, the younger population has to rely completely on the private hospitals and the speed of their vaccination is also quite good compared to the government vaccination drive in the city. “There is a good response to our vaccination within the hospital since we have started. As we bought the vaccines directly from the manufacturers, we were able to resume the vaccination. Youngsters are coming for vaccination with a prior appointment taken on the Cowin website, as there is no direct walk-in vaccination allowed for them as per the government guidelines. But it needs to be changed as many of them are coming directly to the hospital for vaccination but due to a smaller number of slots they cannot get the vaccine. This needs to be changed and district administration needs to look into this matter,” said Dr Avdhut Bodamwad, medical superintendent at Ruby Hall Clinic. Prominent hospital like Ruby Hall clinic, Noble hospital and Sahyadri Hospital have started the vaccination at their hospital premises through the directly purchased vaccine doses. The rate for the vaccination is ₹900 if it is taken at the hospital and at corporate offices on their campus it is ₹1,200 which is fixed by the Pune hospitals’ association. “Vaccination drive is going on well at our hospital and there is a huge rush of youth between age 18 to 45 coming for vaccination. There is a proper system in place for the pre-booked appointments at the hospitals and as per the slots given, they are given the vaccination. We are planning to increase our vaccination pace, but it will happen only when we get more vaccine doses from the manufacturers.” said Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/over-0-2-million-youth-vaccinated-at-private-hospitals-in-city-101622825597615.html
05-06-2021||Pune||Pune city was home to 100 gardens during Peshwa era: historian||Researcher and historian Mandar Lawate has found leads and references to prove that the city of Pune was truly a city of gardens. Lawate’s findings in old document writings in ‘Modi Script’ during his research on Peshwas has found that lakhs of trees were planted around the city creating various baugs. The Peshwas were fond of gardens or baugs as they called them and there were close to 100 baugs in the city 200 years ago but the concept of baug was nothing similar to what we have now as gardens. “During the rule of the Peshwas, Pune flourished in terms of green cover. Until 1818, there were at least 100 private ‘baugs’ (gardens), but they were unlike the gardens we see today. They were more of fruit bearing trees, flowering plants and food crops. There were no landscaped lawns or carved fountains and manicured trees that we find in gardens today,” said Lawate. These gardens were found from Shaniwar wada into all four corners of the city as far as Bobdev ghat. “What we know as Tulsibaug, Hirbaug, Belbaug, Chiman baug, Motibaug are not just names of areas but in the Peshwa era were actual gardens spread over acres of land. Now we identify Sarasbaug as one of the oldest baug created by the Peshwas,”said Lawate. He found map etchings saved and salvaged by the Britishers from the old records from Shaniwarwada which distinctly show gardens of the city. It was not just the Peshwas who had the gardens, but Pune then boasted of several Sardars as well as commoners having baugs like Purandares who owned tracts of land, which is now known as Nehru Stadium, or Vasantbaug in Bibwewadi, or the Bunglabaug near SP college. The Peshwas before coming to Pune were residents of Saswad and they brought with them lots of trees of all kinds which were then planted in the city. It is said that there were 1.5 lakh mango trees planted throughout the city from Mandai to Parvati and beyond. The second Bajirao although known for all the wrong things also had a green thumb where upon he brought coconut trees from Konkan and planted 25,000 trees in Shaniwar wada area. “It is indeed a lesson for us to learn why Pune was hailed as green city, although many of the gardens then were private as compared to the gardens which are now public,” said Lawate. Chandrakant Abhang, a history scholar said that the Peshwes were very particular about the city’s green cover. “There was a rule then too if a tree was cut then two would be planted in its place which is still applicable even today under the tree authority in PMC. That period also gave importance to the conservation and preservation of nature.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/city-was-home-to-100-gardens-during-peshwa-era-historian-101622825537520.html

On the occasion of the World Environment Day on June 5, Warghade famously known as ‘tree man’ will be planting 200 more trees. In what is an inspiration to many, Warghade has planted over 21,000 trees at the Bakori village where an open land of around 200 acres in the ‘Gayran’ area (reserved for cows and cattle for eating grass) since 2017. “My birthday comes on March 22 and in the year 2017, I wanted to do something for the nature, so I decided to plant trees at this open mountain area. Initially, I planted 10 trees on my birthday, since then I started planting more and more trees on the hills. Looking at the plantation, local residents, school children and people working around joined the movement. We altogether have planted more than 21,000 trees till now,” said Warghade. 48-year-old Warghade is a businessman and out of passion is doing this social work to preserve the environment. To give daily water to the planted trees, he himself spends money from the pocket and through water tanker plants are given water. Almost all the trees planted by him have grown well into huge trees. “We have planted various kinds of trees like banyan, tamarind, peepal tree, pomogranate, chikku, guava, sheesham, lemon and neem trees on the hills. Also, to do daily watering to these trees, we have dug up a small pond one part and the water tanker release water into and then we give water to all trees through pipes. Our aim is to plant 5 lakh trees on this hill, and we are going to achieve it in the next few years,” added Warghade. Appreciating his work, Kiran Gandhi a resident of Wagholi area said, “I have also participated in this noble cause of tree plantation started by Warghade and his family, we society members celebrate birthdays by planting tree at the hill. Through this cause, we are able to give back something our mother nature.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/world-environment-day-tree-man-warghade-plants-21-000-saplings-to-turn-barren-land-green-101622823917395.html
05-06-2021||Pune||World Environment Day: Biodiversity mapping in Velhe records 208 species||The Raintree foundation recently concluded the first leg of the year-long biodiversity mapping initiative along with Biologia Life Science LLP near Velhe, Pune. During this phase, a total of 208 species in Northern Western Ghats were recorded. For any conservation of a landscape, biodiversity mapping is the first step in the process. The assessment of each ecosystem within the landscape is to find out species, composition and species’ richness. Mapping is also important for impact assessment of any interventions happening within the landscape. The project area of Velhe, Pune district is confined by the boundary of the watershed which is about 2,100-hectare area. It has nine villages namely Lavhi, Avali, Merawane, Sakhar, Dadvadi, Phanshi, Chirmodi, Ghavar and Gunjavane. “Environmental conservation is at the centre of Raintree foundation’s rural ‘Sustainable Landscape Management’ program. The program, through education and empowerment initiatives, encourages the community to tackle environmental conservation. While our environment program has conducted several awareness and sensitizations trainings for the community and the forest department, over the last two years, we have initiated a comprehensive biodiversity mapping exercise in the region, which will help us identify the gaps and co-create a robust conservation plan with the community and other stakeholders.” said Leena Dandekar, founder, Raintree foundation. The objective of the mapping is to have systematic documentation of the flora and fauna in villages which will help in creating inventory of endemic and threatened species of the project villages. “This kind of bio mapping will also help in understanding change in land use and land cover (LULC) of the project area and its possible impact on biodiversity and also aid in identifying priority conservation areas,” said Dandekar. Biologia-Life Sciences as an implementation partner, had a team of 12 experts collecting the data on 12 different groups of flora and fauna. The team began their recce visit in February 2021 and began their first field visit in March 2021 for three days and they came across 208 species in one visit. According to a member of the team of taxonomists doing the survey said, “We sighted a mouse deer also called Indian spotted chevrotain which is the smallest deer species found in India. It is native to India and prefers dense vegetation and is nocturnal in habit, as well as that of a Palm Civet, an omnivorous nocturnal species.” The team also found leopard scat near Ghavar confirms presence of leopard in the landscape, seven species of fish were recorded in three days, along with 77 species of birds 37 species of butterflies-dragonflies-damselflies as well as some migratory bird species. “We recorded a few winter migratory bird species, against their normal migratory patterns. We are conducting further review on these species to understand any change of its migration pattern due to climate change,” said Dharmaraj Patil, program manager, environment, Raintree foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/biodiversity-mapping-in-velhe-records-208-species-101622819777248.html
05-06-2021||Pune||Parents demand RTE admission process resumes to avoid further delays||With the unlock process ushering in, parents have demanded to restart school admissions under the Right to Education (RTE). The lottery under the RTE was declared on April 7, however, the document verification and other procedures were stopped due to the lockdown which continued until May end. Parents and activists are demanding that the RTE process should restart quickly so that children begin school soon. Parents of children who have been selected under the RTE lottery have received text messages wherein they are asked to keep the documents for verification ready. Speaking about the delay in the admission process, Soni Rathod from Undri said that her 6-year-old son has been selected under RTE for admission in Class 1. “I have received the message so far that the admission process is yet to start. I have seen my number on the online lottery of admission under the RTE. The online lottery was on April 7,” said Rathod. “Due to the lockdown, there has been a delay. Earlier, we went to the RTE office for enquiry. We were informed that the process will start soon, and the details will be uploaded on the website. The details have not been uploaded yet. We want the online school to start so that the child is busy. The process should not be delayed as the children will suffer academically. While sitting at home, my six-year-old does not study. If the online classes start, at least for some time during the day he will be engaged in something productive,” said Rathod. Another parent, Nitin Mohare, has been waiting with his documents ready. “Due to the lockdown, I was forced to come to my village. But if the admission process starts, I’ll have to come back to the city and get the admission. Other schools with regular admissions are charging a huge fee to enrol children. I am unable to pay that. I hope the process resumes soon so that my child does not stay behind in her studies,” said Mohare. Schools are likely to start their new academic year from June 15. Last year, due to the pandemic, the online admission was delayed. The process was completed in January 2021 for the academic year 2020-2021. Under RTE, 25 per cent seats of the unaided private schools are reserved for students from economically backward sections at entry level of preschool and Class 1. For the academic year 2021-2022, there are 982 RTE registered schools in Pune. Of the 55,813 applications, 14,567 students were selected in Pune during the online lottery. Mukund Kirdat, city-based education activist and member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), said that since the unlock process has begun, the education department should not delay the process further. Across Maharashtra, there are 82,129 students selected under RTE during the online lottery. “Many parents received the message around April 15. The education department has wasted one and half month by doing nothing. The department has kept the parents on the waiting list in a limbo. These parents will need more time to get their cold enrolled. And while doing this, they might lose the chance at taking admissions elsewhere,” said Kirdat. He further added that the shops are now open so why cannot the parents get the documentation verified in the morning time. “We urge the education department to restart the process of admission soon. This will help parents and students,” said Kirdat. Education department officials said that parents can visit the official website for more information regarding the online admission process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-demand-rte-admission-process-resumes-to-avoid-further-delays-101622819717226.html
05-06-2021||Pune||Pune schools await notification from board on formulating SSC results||After the evaluation method for Class 10 was declared by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE), the state board was expected to declare a pattern in which the results are to be drafted by schools until May 31. However, the notification has not yet been published by the board. Dinkar Patil, chairman of MSBSHSE said the notification will be published by June 5. “The board is working on the document, and it will be published soon so that schools have clarity about how the marks are to be calculated,” said Patil. Sources at the board said that the drafting of the notification will need a few more days. Probably in the next week, the notification will be issued. The notification will give clarity to schools about how the 30 marks from class 10 are to be calculated. As per the evaluation pattern declared by the board, every subject would be evaluated for 100 marks. Of these 50 marks will be based on the result of Class 9. From Class 10, 30 marks will be internal assessment based on the performance of the student from the whole year and 20 marks will be calculated based on the oral/practical and homework done by the students. Medha Sinnarkar, principal of Laxmanrao Apte Prashala from the city said that many schools have not taken exams like unit tests and half yearly due to the lockdown. “Schools that have can evaluate the students based on these. In our schools we had already conducted the exams before the lockdown started. So it is easier for us to evaluate students. Some schools will have to conduct online tests to evaluate students,” said Sinnarkar. Teachers noted that delay in this notification may affect students adversely as many are not sure how the result would turn out this year. Avinash Takwale, principal of Poona Night school said that students who have not studied properly in Class 9 will face issues while their evaluation is done. “The board should issue a notification soon so that schools can start preparing accordingly. Many students have not studied in Class 9 very seriously, so this time the result may not be as good,” said Takwale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/schools-await-notification-from-board-on-formulating-ssc-results-101622819659228.html
05-06-2021||Pune||Student bodies demand reduction in college fees due to Covid||Due to the second lockdown in the state and the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic situation, the education sector has been hit, especially students who took admissions for courses with high fees. The Yuvak Kranti Dal, a youth organisation along with other youth organisations and students are demanding a fee cancellation from colleges. A movement has been started online and forms are being filled by students over this issue. “We are collecting complaints from students in Maharashtra via Google forms to demand reduction in fees. Students are being charged full fees even though they are not using college resources as colleges are closed due to Covid-19. These complaints will be forwarded to the vice-chancellor as well as the governor of Maharashtra and Yuvak Kranti Dal will follow up on the same. We request all the students to fill the form.” said Sachin Pandule, member of the organization. Last year, there was lot of conflict seen between students their parents and school and college administration over fees payment. So, to review the existing fee structure of the colleges in the state, the state government had appointed J P Dange committee to restructure the fees. The committee submitted its report last year in September, as students were demanding to reduce gymkhana, library, canteen and other expenses from fees. However, the recommendations given by the committee are not yet considered and made open in public; student organisations are now demanding to immediately take action on it as large number of students are not taking admission for this academic year due to high fees. Ketan Gosawi, a computer engineering student said, “In the last 1.5 year we have hardly used any college resources or gone to campus. Still for the next academic year, our college has charged regular fees and not given any concession over it. I come from a farmer’s family, and we are already suffering financially at home and cannot afford to pay full fees this year.” Talking about this issue Dhanraj Mane, director of state higher education department said, “We have not yet got any directives about it, once we get any order it will be worked upon accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/student-bodies-demand-reduction-in-college-fees-due-to-covid-101622819417127.html

He was handed over a packed body as per Covid protocols at the hospital mortuary after the completion of formalities. Gaddaiah and his relatives immediately performed the last rites. A week later, the couple’s son, David, also died of Covid-19 on May 23. Gaddaiah held a memorial service for Girijamma, 60, and David on May 31. Little did he imagine, Girijamma, a vegetable seller, would return home at Jaggaiahpet in Andhra Pradesh’s Krishna district two days later and leave them shocked first and a bit frightened later.It later emerged that she had recovered and that the body that was earlier handed over to Gaddaiah by mistake and was not that of his wife.“Inquiries revealed that in the hospital, Girijamma was shifted to another ward for better treatment. On May 15, when Gaddaiah went to see his wife, he could not find her in the original ward. As the duty staff could not give proper replies, he thought she might have died,” a relative of the family said. Gaddaiah then went to the mortuary, where the staff showed him the body of a 60-year-old woman. “Maybe, because he was in grief, he could not properly identify the body and mistook it as that of his wife. At his request, the staff handed over the body to Gaddaiah.”A Hanumantha Rao, the resident medical officer at the Vijayawada Government Hospital, said bodies in the mortuary are handed over to the relatives only after proper identification. “Similarly, the body of the woman was handed over to Gaddaiah only after he identified it. Girijamma was actually undergoing treatment in another ward, and she was discharged after she recovered.”KV Rama Rao, a local police officer, said no case has been filed as there was no complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/andhra-woman-returns-home-days-after-she-was-presumed-to-have-died-of-covid-101622805137092.html
05-06-2021||World||Biden turns to Obama to help boost health care enrollment||President Joe Biden turned to his old boss, former President Barack Obama, on Saturday to help him encourage Americans to sign up for “Obamacare” health care coverage during an expanded special enrollment period in the pandemic.Biden used his weekly address for a brief Zoom chat with Obama to draw attention to the six-month expanded enrollment period that closes Aug. 15. Meanwhile the government released a report that claims that nearly 31 million Americans — a record — now have health coverage through Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act.“We did this together," said Obama, whose administration established the health insurance marketplace. “We always talked about how, if we could get the principle of universal coverage established, we could then build on it.”The White House effort to spotlight the expanded enrollment period and claim strong numbers for the Obama-era health care law comes as the political world and the health care system await a Supreme Court ruling on the law's constitutionality.The Health and Human Services Department said in a report that nearly 31 million have obtained coverage in 2021 as a result of the law. That's considerably higher than the more than 20 million estimate that’s commonly cited.The Biden administration has launched a special COVID pandemic sign-up period, and Congress passed a big boost in subsidies for private health plans sold under the law. But that alone doesn’t explain the increased coverage.The report says 11.3 million people are covered through the health law’s marketplaces, where subsidized private plans are offered. An additional 14.8 million are covered through expanded Medicaid, the report adds. All but a dozen states have accepted Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, which mainly serves low-income working adults. And 1 million are covered by so-called basic health plans, an option created by the ACA and offered in a limited number of states.That accounts for enrollment of about 27 million people. But the Biden administration is also claiming credit for four million people who would have been eligible for Medicaid without Obama’s law.The Supreme Court is soon expected to rule on a challenge to the health law from Texas and other GOP-led states. They argue that because Congress has eliminated the law’s penalty for being uninsured, a now-toothless ACA requirement that almost all Americans must have health insurance is unconstitutional and therefore the law should fail.Those defending Obamacare say that even if the Supreme Court strikes down the coverage requirement there’s no reason to tamper with the rest of the law.The White House says 1.2 million people have now signed up for health insurance through the government marketplace during the special enrollment period that began in February. That number includes people who would have qualified for a sign-up opportunity even without Biden’s special enrollment period.A life change such as losing workplace coverage or getting married is considered a “qualifying life event” that allows people to sign up any time during the year. Last year about 390,000 people signed up because of life changes from Feb. 15 to April 30, the government said.Biden, in the conversation with Obama, spoke about the 2015 death of his son Beau Biden from cancer.“I literally remember sitting on the bed with him within a week or so him passing away," Biden said, "and thinking, what in God’s name would I do if I got a notice from the insurance company saying you’ve outlived your coverage?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-turns-to-obama-to-help-boost-health-care-enrollment-101622914074698.html
05-06-2021||World||In Venezuela, an account of a kidnapping renews focus on violence against women||In 2001, Linda Lopez was kidnapped and held for almost four months in a Caracas apartment, where she was repeatedly raped and tortured.Now, she has released a book about her experience and her years-long battle to bring the case to trial in a system that she says still fails Venezuelan women.The release of the book co-written by Lopez, a lawyer, and Luisa Kislinger, a Venezuelan writer and activist, has revived debate about violence against women and girls in Venezuela, which activists says is often overshadowed by the country's humanitarian and economic crisis.Venezuela does not publish statistics on domestic abuse, but it is a widespread problem in Latin America that increased during the pandemic, according to data from the U.S.-based nonprofit International Rescue Committee in a report published last June.In her book, "Double Crime," Lopez, best known by her first and middle names Linda Loaiza, details a horrific ordeal of being gagged and handcuffed, beaten with glass bottles, burned with cigarettes and repeatedly raped between March and July 2001.Luis Carrera, the son of a prominent academic, was arrested in November 2001 and convicted in 2006 for beating and kidnapping Lopez and spent six years in prison.The court determined she had been raped during her captivity, but absolved Carrera of rape charges on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to show he was the perpetrator.That was a failure of the system, Lopez told Reuters in an interview.Failing to punish rape "is telling society: do it. You have carte blanche. You can," she said.Lopez's case became a symbolic one for women's rights groups because proceedings were delayed for years as judges repeatedly declined to hear it, according to Lopez and the groups, such as Tinta Violeta in Caracas.Her supporters said the delay was because of the prominence of the Carrera family. Rights groups say the government fails to investigate and prosecute abuse, particularly when assailants are well-connected men, and that it has not invested enough in helping women escape or recover from abusive relationships.Reuters was unable to locate Carrera, who was released from jail in 2008.His father, Gustavo Carrera, did not respond to emails seeking comment.Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab said in a message to Reuters that the government actively prosecutes cases of domestic abuse and that women's rights are guaranteed under the country's constitution.He said prosecutors were investigating 185 cases of women being murdered between January and November of 2020 and 53 cases in the first three months of 2021. Watchdog group Femicide Monitor says 256 women were murdered in 2020 and 73 from January to April this year.The issue of women's rights returned to the spotlight in April due to a flood of sexual harassment accusations against musicians and entertainers. One well-known Venezuelan poet died of an apparent suicide days after being accused of statutory rape. He had confirmed the accusation in an Instagram message and asked for forgiveness.Lopez was rescued by police and firefighters on July 19, 2001, when Carrera left her alone in the apartment unbound for the first time, allowing her to call for help, she told state prosecutors.She spent a year in a hospital to treat a broken jaw and broken ribs, and underwent 15 operations to reconstruct her face and genitals."I have innumerable scars on my body," she said.The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, a Costa-Rica based tribunal that forms part of the Organization of American States human rights protection system, in 2018 ruled that the Venezuelan state had failed to properly protect Lopez from sexual assault.Lopez said Venezuela has not complied with key elements of the sentence, which ordered that Lopez be paid damages and said the government should investigate why officials ignored warnings by family members that Lopez had been kidnapped.Saab told Reuters that his office was in talks with the foreign ministry and the women's ministry to determine how to respond to the sentence, without elaborating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-venezuela-an-account-of-a-kidnapping-renews-focus-on-violence-against-women-101622913007135.html

After 4 years of battle, a historic accord was reached with G7 member states,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire tweeted. “France can be proud!”The meeting of finance ministers came ahead of an annual summit of G-7 leaders scheduled for June 11-13 in Cornwall, England. The U.K. is hosting both sets of meetings because it holds the group’s rotating presidency.The endorsement from the G-7 could help build momentum for a deal in wider talks among more than 140 countries being held in Paris as well as a Group of 20 finance ministers meeting in Venice in July.The G-7 has also been facing pressure to provide vaccines for low-income countries facing new surges of COVID-19 infections and to finance projects to combat climate change. A statement Saturday from the two-day finance ministers' meeting said only that they welcomed increased funding commitments by member countries and looked forward to more.International discussions on the tax issue gained momentum after U.S. President Joe Biden backed the idea of a global minimum of at least 15% on corporate profits.The tax proposals endorsed Saturday have two main parts. The first part lets countries tax a share of the profits earned by companies that have no physical presence but have substantial sales, for instance through selling digital advertising.The G-7 statement echoes a U.S. proposal to simply let countries tax part of the earnings of the largest and most profitable companies — digital or not — if they are doing business within their borders. It also supported awarding countries the right to tax 20% or more of profit exceeding a 10% profit margin.Part of the agreement is that countries such as France that have imposed digital services taxes would remove them in favor of the global agreement. The U.S. considers those unilateral digital taxes to be unfair trade measures that single out big U.S. tech companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook.The other main part of the proposal is for countries to tax their home companies' overseas profits at a rate of at least 15%. That would deter the practice of using accounting schemes to shift profits to a few very low-tax countries.Nations have been grappling with the question of how to deter companies from legally avoiding paying taxes by resorting to tax havens — typically small countries that entice companies with low or zero taxes, even though the firms do little actual business there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-nations-sign-key-pact-to-make-tech-giants-pay-fair-taxes-101622903739003.html

All you need to know||The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday approved a new version of popular diabetes medicine to be sold as a weight-loss drug in the United States. In addition to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, the doctors will now be ableto prescribe injectable drug Wegovy, a higher-dose version of Novo Nordisk’s diabetes drug semaglutide, for chronic weight management.Wegovy is the first approved drug for chronic weight management in adults with general obesity or overweight since 2014. The drug is indicated for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related condition like high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, or high cholesterol.Wegovy’s safety and efficacyAccording to the FDA, the safety and efficacy of Wegovy were studied in four 68-week trials, in which more than 4,100 patients participated. Over 2,600 patients received Wegovy for up to 68 weeks and more than 1,500 patients received placebo during these four trials.In a trial that enrolled adults without diabetes, the average body weight of participants was 105 kg and 74 per cent were female. Those who received this under-the-skin injection lost an average of 12.4 per cent of their initial body weight compared to those who received placebo.In another trial that enrolled adults with type 2 diabetes, the average body weight was 100 kg and 51% of the patients were female. Individuals who received Wegovy under this trial lost 6.2 per cent of their initial body weight compared to those who received placebo.Also Read | Obesity may protect patients, with severe bacterial infection, against deathSide effects of WegovyThe US FDA said that that the most common side effect of Wegovy includes nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, indigestion, dizziness, abdominal distension, eructation, low blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes, gastroenteritis and gastroesophageal reflux disease (a type of digestive disorder).Warnings about Wegovy useWegovy contains a boxed warning, informing healthcare professionals and patients about the potential risk of thyroid C-cell tumours. It also contains warnings for inflammation of the pancreas, gallbladder problems, low blood sugar, acute kidney injury, damage to the eye's retina, increased heart rate and suicidal behaviour or thinking. FDA has warned against its use in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or in patients with a rare condition called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2.“Having obesity or overweight is a serious health issue associated with some leading causes of death, including heart disease, stroke and diabetes, and is linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer,” the FDA said in a statement, adding that losing 5-10 per cent of body weight has been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-approves-obesity-drug-wegovy-safety-efficacy-and-side-effects-of-higher-version-semaglutide-101622902273350.html

Now we have the next decade for ecosystem restoration," Khan said.He said although Pakistan's contribution to global carbon emissions was quite low as compared to advanced nations, yet the country was one of the most vulnerable to changing climate patterns."Pakistan's contribution to global warming and climate change is minimal. Rich countries, which contribute significantly more, have a greater responsibility to provide funds to ones like ours so that we can fight climate change," he said."The countries which contribute the most towards pollution and have the resources should support those trying to combat climate change," he said.Khan also lauded UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for reiterating the message that the developed world has to take responsibility and help countries which do not have the resources when it comes to fighting global warming.Talking about the steps being taken by Pakistan to tackle the challenge, he said the country was aiming to produce 60 per cent clean energy by 2030.Khan said one billion trees had been planted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the government would achieve the target of planting 10 billion trees in the next five years."If we are successful in our goal of planting 10 billion trees, it will have a major impact on the people, the country and the economy," he said, urging the people to take part in the campaign.Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose message was read out by the country's ambassador to Pakistan Nong Rong, commended the strides made by Pakistan to cope with climate change.Xi Jinping said his country stands ready to work with Pakistan and other countries to inject new impetus into global environmental governance and contribute to a clean and beautiful world.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson virtually delivering his message appreciated Prime Minister Khan for undertaking the project of planting ten billion trees and termed it a huge campaign for forestation.UN Secretary General Guterres in his virtual address said the next ten years will be the final chance to avert a climate catastrophe, turn back the deadly tide of pollution and end species loss."We should finally make peace with nature and secure a better future for all," he said.Earlier, Khan in a tweet urged the "world to join hands to protect the environment and reset relationship with Nature".He said Pakistan was fully committed to play a leadership role in restoration of the ecosystem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chance-for-world-to-correct-course-imran-khan-tells-rich-nations-to-help-poor-countries-combat-climate-change-101622902513800.html
05-06-2021||World||US official says trade relationship with China marked by 'significant imbalance'||The trade relationship between the two largest economies in the world has “significant imbalance” and the Biden administration is committed to leveling it, according to the US trade representative.“There are parts of this trade relationship that are unhealthy and have over time been damaging in some very important ways to the US economy,” Trade Representative Katherine Tai told reporters Saturday in response to a question about whether the US would continue with a trade deal signed with China in January 2020 and the tariffs on Chinese goods.“It’s a relationship in trade that has been marked by significant imbalance - that is in terms of performance, but also in terms of opportunity and openness of our markets to each other,” she said ahead of a virtual meeting of trade ministers from members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. ”The United States is committed to doing everything we can to bring balance back to the US-China trade relationship.”The comments come as the two nations seem to be increasing their economic discussions, with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He speaking to both Tai and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen over the past two weeks. While China said that those talks showed the two sides have restarted normal communications, there’s been no public sign of any progress on the bilateral tariffs or of discussions over other economic flashpoints between the nations.The US administration is reviewing its stance toward China and hasn’t made any major changes to the policies it inherited from former President Donald Trump, and Tai has pledged to build on the January 2020 trade pact, saying on May 5 that she respects the continuity of US policy.However, there are increasing signs of the direction the new administration’s policy will take. The White House’s top official for Asia said last month that the US is entering a period of intense competition with China, and the administration this week kept in place a Trump-era ban on investment in the US by some Chinese companies.Despite those diplomatic and political tensions, trade and investment flows between the two nations continue to strengthen. China’s exports to the US are still growing, while China is stepping up its purchases of US goods, even though that’s not enough to reach the levels promised in the trade deal.At the same press conference, China’s Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao argued that China is continuing to open up its economy despite the challenges of the pandemic, listing a number of areas in which it had reduced controls on foreign investment and trade. He also reiterated that China was “favorably considering” joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, an economic treaty originally meant to help cement US power in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-official-says-trade-relationship-with-china-marked-by-significant-imbalance-101622899725449.html

During an interview, Nasa administrator Bill Nelson told CNN Business that he turned to the space agency scientists, asking them to look at the mysterious events from a scientific standpoint to get a better idea.In April last year, the US department of defense released three declassified videos that showed US Navy pilots encountering what appeared to be UFOs. While the videos had earlier been leaked and published by a leading US daily, it was the first time when the Pentagon formally acknowledged the existence of such videos. The US Navy then released seven incident reports, revealing more details about the series of encounters between their pilots and ‘unidentified aerial phenomena’.“I have talked to those navy pilots and they are sure that they saw something real. And of course we have seen their video from their jet. What is it? we don't know,” said Nelson, the former Florida senator and spaceflight veteran.Also Read | Documentary filmmaker releases video of ‘swarm of UFOs’ over US navy shipEven as the broad conclusions of US intelligence on UFOs have been reported, the full report is expected to be delivered to Congress later this month. The complete report could present a broader picture of what the US government knows about the mysterious flying objects.“We don't know if it's extra-terrestrial, we don't know if it's an enemy. We don't know if it's an optical phenomenon,” said Nelson, while dismissing the possibility of an optical illusion. “We don't think so because of the characteristics that those navy jet pilots described as they saw it move around,” the Nasa chief added.On being asked whether Nasa should be more involved at this point, Nelson said, “Well we are... and I have started it. I have been here a month, and I have started it.” The Nasa administrator also said that the agency is not directly working with the Pentagon, but stressed that “if we find something, the Pentagon will want to know.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/they-saw-something-real-nasa-getting-serious-about-ufos-under-new-chief-101622897177178.html

It is all done within the context of the United States' domestic political process," Putin was quoted as saying."The people who do this, they probably assume that the United States has such economic, military and political might that it can get away with that. It is no big deal, that is what they think."Putin said such behaviour reminded him of the Soviet Union."The problem with empires is that they think they are powerful enough to make some mistakes. We will buy these (people), bully them, make a deal with them, give necklaces to them, threaten them with battleships. And this will solve all the problems. But problems accumulate. A moment comes when they cannot be solved anymore."Biden and Putin will meet in Geneva on June 16, the White House and the Kremlin have said, to discuss "the full range of pressing issues", according to Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cant-get-away-with-making-threats-putin-likens-us-behaviour-to-soviet-union-101622895642823.html

Information minister Lai Mohammed cited “persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria's corporate existence” as a reason to suspend Twitter operations.The suspension came at a time when Twitter is facing challenges in India due to new IT rules, which were to be implemented by May 26. The Indian government issued a notice on Saturday as a final ultimatum for the microblogging platform to comply with the new IT rules. Amid Twitter’s battle with the Centre, Amid Twitter’s battle with the Centre, several Union ministers have opened their account on India’s Koo.Last month, Koo’s Radhakrishna said that his company was in discussions with investors to raise funding, hoping to close a deal within 3-4 months.

05-06-2021||World||G7 nations near historic deal on taxing multinationals||Group of Seven rich nations will seek to overcome long-standing differences on Saturday and strike a landmark deal to close the net on large companies that they say do not pay enough tax.The proposed accord, which could form the basis of a global pact next month, is aimed at ending a decades-long "race to the bottom" in which countries have competed to attract corporate giants with ultra-low tax rates and exemptions.That has in turn cost their public coffers hundreds of billions of dollars - a shortfall they now need to recoup all the more urgently to pay for the huge cost of propping up economies ravaged by the coronavirus crisis."We are just one millimetre away from a historic agreement," French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told the BBC on Friday as he and other G7 finance chiefs met in person for the first time since the start of the pandemic at talks in London.British finance minister Rishi Sunak, who is chairing the talks, also wants large companies to be required to declare their environmental impact in a consistent way. The G7 is likely to commit to avoid withdrawing Covid stimulus too early as well.Rich nations have struggled for years to agree a way to raise more revenue from large multinationals such as Google, Amazon and Facebook, which often book profits in jurisdictions where they pay little or no tax.U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has given the stalled talks fresh impetus by proposing a minimum global corporation tax rate of 15%, above the level in countries such as Ireland but below the lowest level in the G7.Yet major disagreements remain on both the minimum rate at which companies should be taxed, and on how the rules will be drawn up to ensure that very large firms with lower profit margins, such as Amazon, face higher taxes.TO THE WIREOne question is whether 15% should be the final rate or whether it should be regarded as the floor for a final deal, leaving room to agree a higher level at subsequent talks within the broader G20 group of nations scheduled for Venice in July.Beyond the level itself, just as important for Britain and many others is that large multinationals pay more tax where they make their sales - not just where they book profits, or locate their headquarters."Their business model gives them chances to avoid taxes ... much more than other companies," German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said.The United States is also holding out for an immediate end to the digital services taxes levied by Britain, France and Italy, which it views as unfairly targeting U.S. tech giants for tax practices that European companies also use."It's going to go right to the wire," one source close to the talks said. "The United States are holding to their position, as are we."British, Italian and Spanish fashion, cosmetics and luxury goods exports to the United States will be among those facing new 25% tariffs later this year if there is no compromise.The U.S. has proposed levying the new global minimum tax only on the world's 100 largest and most profitable companies.Britain, Germany and France are open to this but want to ensure companies such as Amazon - which has lower profit margins than other tech firms - do not escape the net.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-nations-near-historic-deal-on-taxing-multinationals-101622887882185.html

Dr Fauci and his colleagues took notice, in the early days, of the theory that Covid-19 may have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan, China.In an interview with CNN, Fauci said the email had been taken out of context by critics and he had an "open mind" about the origin of the virus.With regard to the "lab leak" email, the doctor told CNN that he still finds it unlikely that a Wuhan laboratory released the virus."I don't remember what's in that redacted [email], but the idea I think is quite far-fetched that the Chinese deliberately engineered something so that they could kill themselves as well as other people," he said.Amid criticism of an inconclusive international probe into the virus' origins and new reports of Covid-related illness in the region weeks before it was officially identified, the theory is once again sparking debate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-chinese-virologist-says-fauci-emails-prove-her-wuhan-lab-leak-claims-101622885464792.html

His ministry also announced Twitter's suspension on Twitter When asked about the details of the suspension, a ministerial aide told Reuters: "Wait and see how things will turn out."As of the early hours of Saturday, Twitter's website was inaccessible in Nigeria on some mobile carriers, while its app and website worked on others, according to Reuters tests in Lagos and Abuja.Twitter is investigating its "deeply concerning" suspension of operations by the Nigerian government, and "will provide updates when we know more," the company said in a statement.On Wednesday, the US tech firm said Buhari's post threatening to punish groups blamed for attacks on government buildings had violated Twitter's "abusive behaviour" policy.In April, the information minister reacted angrily when Twitter chose neighbouring Ghana for its first African office. He said the company had been influenced by media misrepresentations of Nigeria, including reports of crackdowns on protests last year.Demonstrators calling for police reform had used social media to organise, raise money and share alleged proof of police harassment. Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, tweeted to encourage his followers to donate.In the protests' wake, Mohammed called for "some form of regulation" on social media to combat "fake news".A spokesperson for Airtel, one of Nigeria's largest mobile carriers, on Friday declined to say whether the company had received any government directives about the suspension.MTN, the largest mobile carrier, did not respond to calls and a message seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nigeria-indefinitely-suspends-twitter-days-after-president-s-post-removed-101622884753678.html
05-06-2021||World||Videos contradict US police version of fatal shooting of Kansas City man||A group of Christian ministers is questioning the fatal police shooting of a Kansas City man after they said videos released this week contradicted the law enforcement version of what happened.Malcolm Johnson, 31, was shot and killed inside a Kansas City gas station convenience store on March 25 when officers tried to arrest him for questioning in an earlier shooting.The Missouri State Highway Patrol, which is investigating all fatal shootings by Kansas City police, has said two officers tried to arrest Johnson when a fight ensued. The patrol said Johnson pulled a gun and shot an officer in the leg as other officers arrived. The wounded officer returned fire, killing Johnson, the patrol said.A video released on Thursday, which was taken by a store employee, shows several officers struggling with Johnson on the floor. A shot is heard and the officer who was shot backs away. Then two other shots are heard and Johnson stops struggling.The video does not show if Johnson drew a gun, who shot the officer or which officers then fired at Johnson, who was Black. The ministers said the video does not show Johnson with a gun.Dr. Emanuel Cleaver III said ministers watched the video together on a large screen Thursday. Several ministers at a news conference Thursday afternoon said they believed the video showed one of the police officers may have accidentally shot the officer after a shot ricocheted and then another officer shot Johnson twice in the back of the head.Pastor Darron Edwards said the videos show “this is not an open and shut case" and police need to tell everyone what really happened. He said the officers involved should not be on the street if the case is still being investigated.“We're still searching for the truth, and all this community wants is the truth,” Edwards said.Some of the ministers are part of a group called Getting to the Heart of the Matter, which has worked with the police department and Chief Rick Smith to bridge a divide with minority communities since social justice protests broke out last summer, while other community activists have criticized the force and called for Smith to resign or be fired.Cleaver said Kansas City has a serious disconnect between the police and the community, particularly minority communities. He said the videos were given to the ministers and activists, rather than to investigators, because the community does not trust police.“If you look at the disconnect, the distrust, between KCPD and the community you have to of course look at it from the head,” Cleaver said. “I think, in order to change the narrative, in order to change this ongoing problem, we have to start with the top and then work our way down. That's the only way we're going to bring about change and bring the community and law enforcement together, which is the sign of a happy and healthy city.”The ministers first questioned the shooting on Tuesday, when they released a different video that showed two officers with guns drawn entering the store and trying to arrest Johnson, who appears to try and run before being taken down by officers. The struggle moved out of the camera angle before Johnson was shot.After meeting with patrol officials on Wednesday, the ministers expressed more confidence in the investigation but the new video raised new questions.Sheryl Ferguson, a Kansas City organizer with It's Time 4 Justice, said both videos showed Johnson's feet were to the side, or facing down and she could not believe that he was so combative that five officers could not contain him.“I would think that I was looking at a replication of George Floyd, wouldn't you,” She said. “I would think that I was looking at someone that was working to save his life, wouldn't you?”Floyd died last year after former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for about 9 ½ minutes. Chauvin was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said Thursday that her office has received the videos and is analyzing the information. The office is also evaluating its processes to find ways to engage with the community to gain “these necessary facts” in the investigation.“A part of our review will be an evaluation of any discrepancies between the original accounting of this event and the actual evidence, including any video evidence,” Peters Baker said in a statement.The Kansas City police department has referred questions to the highway patrol.

We are grateful for the continuous support, ongoing initiatives and generosity of our members in helping the people of India”.The statement also noted though in the last few weeks, infection rates were “starting to decline across many states as vaccination rates are increasing rapidly”, there were still “many areas” that are “experiencing devastating case loads and are still in crisis mode”.Given those circumstances, C-IBC “is continuing to support relief efforts in supporting the people of India”.C-IBC’s president Victor Thomas said that it was very heartening that Canadian companies operating in the “India-Canada economic corridor stepped up and have been very supportive”.Funds were donated primarily through the Canadian Red Cross, while some companies sent medical supplies that were immediately required during the crisis. While major Canadian pension funds, which have heavily invested in India’s infrastructure sector, could not contribute directly due to their charters, they undertook matching grants programmes based on contributions from their employees.Thomas said the cumulative contribution was “not insignificant” and Canadian companies wanted to send out the message, “we’re there and we’re supportive” in the context of doing their bit to assist India during a critical phase.According to C-IBC the donations have “helped set up temporary Covid-19 hospitals, supply hospital beds, medical oxygen, lifesaving medicine, provide personal protective equipment (PPE), emergency care for migrants, and implement infection control activities in communities across India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-firms-contribute-rs-354cr-for-india-s-covid-fight-101622871683378.html
05-06-2021||World||Health authorities call to speed up second dose of Covid vaccination in Canada||Alarmed over the possibility of an increase in transmissibility of the Delta variant of Covid-19, Canadian health authorities are calling for acceleration of administration of second doses of vaccines, particularly to those in communities considered most at risk.“The Delta variant or B.1.617 has been detected essentially across Canada,” Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said on Friday, according to the agency Canadian Press.The Public Health Agency of Canada or PHAC believes the variant, which was first detected in India, is “at least 50% more transmissible” than the original coronavirus which originated in China, according to a statement released by Tam on Thursday. And, it also stated that the four major variants of concern “all have certain mutations in common, which may have an impact on vaccine effectiveness, although the evidence is still limited”.Therefore, Tam stressed on Friday it “is very important to get that second dose when variants” like Delta were present in the country.Surprisingly, despite being declared a variant of concern or VoC in mid-May, PHAC is yet to release any data on the extent of the spread of the B.1.617 variant in Canada, while it provides daily updates on the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants.However, Tam said that in the “context of a transmissible variant, that variant could well takeoff and replace other viruses in the communities”.That alert was sounded earlier this week by Dr Lawrence Loh, medical officer of health in the Peel Region of Ontario, as he said during a press interaction: “B.1.617 is quickly replacing B.1.1.7, which was the Alpha variant originally detected in the UK and which drove our third wave across Brampton and the region of Peel.” He warned the Delta variant could become the dominant strain in the region in a month and then across the province in a matter of weeks after that. Peel region comprises cities in the suburbs of Toronto and is among the most densely populated areas in the country.While less than seven per cent of Canadian have been fully vaccinated, Mayors within the Peel Region have called for quickening that pace because of the threat that the Delta variant could precipitate another wave of the pandemic even as the country is slowly emerging from a third wave.The National Advisory Committee on Immunisation or NACI’s guidelines state that second doses can be given up to four months after the first, but in an updated recommendation on May 28, it said “second doses should be offered as soon as possible, with priority given to those at highest risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 disease after or concurrent with first doses for all remaining eligible populations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/health-authorities-call-to-speed-up-second-dose-of-covid-vaccination-in-canada-101622869882663.html
05-06-2021||World||Environment day: Phase out carbon or lose out on contracts, UK tells businesses||Boris Johnson’s government told companies to publish their carbon reduction plans and commit to phasing out greenhouse gas emissions altogether by 2050, or lose out on large UK state contracts.Firms that haven’t committed to so-called net zero emissions or published a “clear and credible” carbon reduction plan by September won’t be allowed to bid for contracts worth more than 5 million pounds ($7.1 million) a year, the Cabinet Office said in an emailed statement.Johnson is seeking to position the UK as a leader in the battle against climate change as he carves out a post-Brexit identity for the nation, and Saturday’s announcement, timed for World Environment Day, means the government is using its 290 billion pounds of annual procurement to push businesses into swifter action to slash emissions.“It’s important we use this purchasing power to help transform our economy to net zero,” Minister for Efficiency and Transformation Theodore Agnew said. “Requiring companies to report and commit to reducing their carbon emissions before bidding for public work is a key part of our world-leading approach.”The UK hosts a major round of United Nations climate talks in Glasgow in November, and Johnson has unveiled a succession of ever-more ambitious targets in an effort to spur international and domestic action.The UK has a legally-binding goal to phase out net emissions by 2050, and Johnson has announced interim plans to reduce them by 68% by 2030 and 78% by 2035, from 1990 levels -- the most ambitious targets among major economies.The announcement also adds to government efforts to spur action from business, after Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak in November said the UK would compel large companies and financial institutions to report their climate risks by 2025. It’s a measure he’s pushing other major economies to adopt at a two-day meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations that concludes on Saturday.The latest proposals require firms to publish a carbon reduction plan setting out where their emissions come from, and any environmental management measures they have in place.They’ll be required to publish so-called Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, encompassing their direct emissions and those from the power they consume. They’ll also have to include reporting of some Scope 3 emissions taking in their wider footprint -- including business travel, employee commuting, transportation, distribution and waste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/environment-day-phase-out-carbon-or-lose-out-on-contracts-uk-tells-businesses-101622855846592.html
05-06-2021||World||North Korea’s Kim Jong Un appears in public for the first time in month||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made his first public appearance in about a month, with state media showing him at a Party meeting that discussed ways to improve the country’s deteriorating economy.Kim, wearing his signature black Mao suit, said it was time to take “additional state measures for solving pending problems urgent for the economic work and people’s living,” according to official Korean Central News Agency Saturday. A plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Party will be held in early June, KCNA said.Kim also reviewed the “execution of major policy tasks in different fields” in the meeting, the state media said.North Korea’s economy has shown little sign of growth this year after its worst contraction in decades as it continues to struggle with the pandemic, US sanctions and a lack of trade with China.Kim’s last public appearance was on May 6, when he posed for a photograph after a gathering for military families, according to NK News, a web site that focuses on North Korean news. Before that he had failed for the first time to appear for events, following a political congress in Pyongyang, it said.State MattersThe latest absence could be part of Kim’s plans to avoid Covid-19, NK News said. He could have been attending to state matters or vacationing at his coastal mansion, where satellite imagery indicates an increase of activity in the area, it said.The health of North Korea’s leader is one of the most closely guarded secrets in the reclusive state, known only to a few people in the country’s most powerful inner circle.Being overweight and a chain smoker, Kim, 37, has been the subject of health speculation for years. His longest absence from the public eye was six weeks in 2014. When he did appear, he was walking with a cane, raising speculation that he could be suffering from gout.Periods of prolonged absences have become a bit more frequent for Kim since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. NK News said the current break is his seventh since 2020.North Korea, which was quick to shut its borders, could find its antiquated and underfunded medical system overwhelmed by an outbreak of the coronavirus. Pyongyang has said it has had no recorded cases of Covid 19, a claim doubted by officials in the U.S. and Japan.Kim is thought to have three children, the oldest about 11 years old. With no clear successor, the leader’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, is seen by the outside world as a possible candidate to take over should something happen to her brother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-appears-in-public-for-the-first-time-in-month-101622855858571.html
05-06-2021||World||Microsoft says error led to Bing blocking images of Tiananmen 'tank man'||Microsoft Corp on Friday blamed "accidental human error" for its Bing search engine not showing image results for the query "tank man" in the United States and elsewhere after users raised concerns about possible censorship around the Tiananmen Square crackdown anniversary.Users, including in the United Kingdom, Germany and Singapore, reported Friday that when they performed the search Bing returned the message, "There are no results for tank man."David Greene, civil liberties director at the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that content moderation was impossible to do perfectly and "egregious mistakes are made all the time."But he said it could be more sinister: "At worst, this was purposeful suppression at the request of a powerful state."Hours after Microsoft acknowledged the issue, the "tank man" search returned only pictures of tanks elsewhere in the world."Tank man" is often used to describe an unidentified person famously pictured standing before tanks in China's Tiananmen Square during pro-democracy demonstrations in June 1989.Microsoft said the issue was "due to an accidental human error and we are actively working to resolve this."Smaller search engines such as DuckDuckGo that license results from Microsoft faced similar issues around "tank man" searches and said they expected a fix soon.Rival Google showed many results for the famous image when the "tank man" search was performed on Friday.A significant percentage of the Microsoft employees who work on Bing are based in China, including some who work on image-recognition software, according to a former employee.China is known to require search engines operating in its jurisdiction to censor results, but those restrictions are rarely applied elsewhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-says-error-led-to-bing-blocking-images-of-tiananmen-tank-man-101622854343520.html
05-06-2021||World||No obligation to pay for workers' Covid screening time: Amazon||Amazon.com Services LLC has no obligation to pay fulfillment center workers for time spent undergoing mandatory Covid-19 screenings, which benefits the public in general, the company says in a motion to dismiss a would-be class action filed in the Eastern District of California.The required screenings, conducted in accordance with government regulations and guidance—not just for employees but for all visitors—aren’t compensable “work” under the Fair Labor Standards Act because they aren’t primarily for Amazon’s benefit, the Thursday motion says. According to Amazon, the screenings benefit everyone, and its benefit is merely incidental.Even if considered work-related, the pre-shift health screenings are “preliminary” to their principle activities, Amazon argues, likening them to the security screenings the U.S. Supreme Court found not compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act in Integrity Staffing Sols. Inc. v. Busk.Amazon acknowledges an informal FAQ published by the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division states that for certain employees, “a temperature check before they begin work must be paid because it is necessary for their jobs.”But according to Amazon, although the screenings may be necessary for patient-facing health-oriented jobs, it isn’t needed for its warehouse associates, and the guidance isn’t entitled to a high-degree of deference in any event.The plaintiffs also fail to allege that the “screenings themselves take any appreciable amount of time,” Amazon says. Waiting time is clearly not compensable, the company says, but the plaintiffs’ 10 to 15 minute estimates collapsed the screening and wait time together.Amazon advances similar arguments to challenge the plaintiffs’ claims for unpaid wages and overtime under state law.Amazon distinguishes Frlekin v. Apple Inc., where a California court found time spent in security screenings compensable under the state’s laws.First, the security screenings were implemented to prevent theft and were, as a result, primarily intended for the benefit for the employer, Amazon says. And second, the employees weren’t permitted to leave the work until the screenings were complete and were subject to a higher degree of intrusion and control, it adds.Amazon says the plaintiffs additional claims related to inaccurate wage statements and payment of wages owed upon discharge fail because, among other things, they are derivative of the other non-viable claims.The case is in the US District Court for the Eastern District of California.Amazon is represented by Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. Plaintiffs are represented by Hodges & Foty LLP and Parmet PC.The case is Boone v. Amazon.com Services LLC, E.D. Cal., No. 1:21-cv-00241, motion to dismiss 6/3/21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-obligation-to-pay-for-workers-covid-screening-time-amazon-101622853196431.html
05-06-2021||World||Alaska man, charged in US Capitol riots, avoids house arrest||A federal magistrate on Friday declined to order house arrest for a far-right internet troll charged in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol after court officials raised concerns about his recent encounters with police officers in Arizona.U.S. Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey warned Tim “Baked Alaska” Gionet that he acted dangerously and “came close to committing crimes" while he videotaped himself arguing with a drunken friend and calling police twice. But the magistrate ultimately concluded that Gionet didn't violate any conditions of his pretrial release.Gionet grew up in Anchorage, Alaska and had grown well known in right-wing politics through his social media appearances.Gionet was arrested 10 days after the riot in Washington, D.C. He is charged with violent and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds and knowingly entering a restricted building without lawful authority.After his arrest in Houston, Gionet initially was ordered to submit to electronic location monitoring, but the court lifted that condition of his release on March 31.On Jan. 6, Gionet streamed live video that showed himself inside the Capitol and encouraging other protesters to stay. Investigators say Gionet also profanely called an officer an “oathbreaker” and chanted, “Whose house? Our house!”His lawyer has said he only went to Washington to film what happened.he Justice Department has arrested about 465 people in nearly all 50 states - an average of about three defendants arrested every single day, including weekends, since January 6th. Marine Corps officer, Christopher Warnagiris, the first active-duty service member arrested in the insurrection, was indicted Thursday on nine charges including assaulting an officer.In Gionet's case, a pretrial services officer had recommended imposing home detention and banning Gionet from posting videos to social media or other video sharing platforms. A federal prosecutor concurred with the recommendations.Harvey rejected both recommendations, but chided Gionet for “baiting” his friend into fighting in a moving car.“You knew what you were doing, putting the camera in his face,” he said. “You wanted to get a rise out of him, and you did.”A video of Gionet's contact with law enforcement in Arizona on May 26 was posted on YouTube, according to a pretrial services report. Gionet apparently called police that evening to report that a friend and fellow “YouTuber” had assaulted him, federal prosecutors said in a court filing.After officers arrived, Gionet agreed to take his friend home. When the friend became belligerent in the car, Gionet called police again and was “somewhat uncooperative” with the second set of officers who respond, prosecutors said."He also appears to threaten his friend," they wrote.Defense attorney Zachary Thornley said Gionet didn't break any laws or violate any conditions of his release.“I really don't know why we're all here today,” he said during a remote hearing Friday.“We're all here because your client recorded all of this and put it up on YouTube, which a smart person might wonder if that's what you should be doing while you're under court supervision,” the magistrate countered.Prosecutors say the video appears to be a money-making vehicle for Gionet, a social media personality who was listed as one of the speakers at the white nationalist “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that erupted in violence in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alaska-man-charged-in-us-capitol-riots-avoids-house-arrest-101622851592713.html
05-06-2021||World||India likely to get large share of US jabs: Envoy||India is expected to get possibly the largest share of the 25 million Covid-19 vaccine doses that the US on Thursday announced it will send to partners countries and those in need of them to deal with ongoing surges.India figures in two categories of prospective recipient countries.Out of the 25 million doses, 19 million will go through Covax, the WHO-led initiative for global equitable distribution, to countries earmarked by the US. Of this, 7 million will go to Asia, including India and 15 other countries, according to a fact sheet issued by the White House.India also figures on a list of recipient countries described by the US as “regional partners and partner recipients”, which also include Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Egypt, Jordan, Ukraine, Georgia and Gaza — 7 million doses have been set aside for this group.India did not feature in the first fact sheet, leading to some confusion, because it was in statement issued by President Joe Biden. An updated fact sheet has India in this category as well. No country-specific numbers have been released by the US.Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Indian ambassador to the US, told PTI: “India will be a significant recipient of US vaccines as India has been included in both the identified categories in the allocation announced today- direct supply to neighbours and partner countries, and under the Covax initiative.”“The vaccine allocation announcement by US and telephone call between PM and VP Kamala Harris reflect the firm commitment of the leadership of both India and US to work in partnership on global issues,” the Ambassador later told HT.President Biden has pledged to share 80 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines countries that need them — 60 million of AstraZeneca (called Covishield in India), which the US doesn’t intend to use, and 20 million of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna — by the end of June.The Biden administration announced the allocation plan for 25 million of 80 million on Thursday, promising, as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has said, “the United States will not use its vaccines to secure favors from other countries”. It was a thinly disguised shot at Russia and China, who, the Americans say, have distributed vaccines seeking to advance their own interests.The White House also announced it was lifting restrictions invoked under the Defense Production Act that will allow sharing of raw materials needed for the AstraZeneca, as well as Sanofi and Novavax vaccines, which are also not authorised in the US.“The removal of the Defence Production Act priority ratings would further strengthen vaccine supply chains including for manufacturers AstraZeneca and Novavax,” Sandhu said.Sandhu, on Thursday, also had a discussion with US Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy. “We discussed India US cooperation to contain the global pandemic, including in vaccines, and potential collaborations to ensure affordable health care,” the Ambassador said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-likely-to-get-large-share-of-us-jabs-envoy-101622844581102.html

This comes after the state government’s global bid to purchase 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses did not get a response from any international firm on Friday, the last day of making the bid. An official spokesperson said that Malta-based Pharma Regulatory Services Limited has given an expression of interest to Haryana Medical Services Corporation Limited (HMSCL) for providing 60 million Sputnik vaccine doses at ₹1,120 per dose. “We are verifying the antecedents of the pharma company. We will also get in touch with the Indian High Commission in Malta to do a thorough check on the company,’’ additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said on Saturday. Arora said though the offer has come after the due date of the global tender got over it is still being examined to see if it met the criteria of the tender document and ensured optimal vaccine availability for the state.The firm has given a timeline of 30 days to supply the first batch of half a million (5 lakh) doses followed by a million doses every 20 days till the supply is completed against a letter of credit issued in their name. The last date for receipt of global tender was June 4. Russian manufactured Sputnik-V is the only vaccine besides Covishield of Serum Institute of India and Covaxin of Bharat Biotech which has been granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malta-firm-offers-60mn-sputnik-doses-says-hry-101622917765155.html
05-06-2021||India||CM’s nephew Abhishek named TMC national general secy||Kolkata Abhishek Banerjee, Trinamool Congress MP and nephew of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, was promoted to the post of the party’s all-India general secretary on Saturday. Senior party leader and minister Partha Chatterjee also announced that the party, after its sweeping victory in the recently held assembly elections, would now expand its organisational footprint beyond the state. “One of the biggest decisions taken by Mamata Banerjee in Saturday’s meeting was to appoint Abhishek Banerjee as the general secretary of the All India Trinamool Congress,” Chatterjee said. Experts said that Abhishek Banerjee played a key role in the party’s victory in the assembly polls in which the TMC won 213 seats of the 292 assembly constituencies where polls were held. The BJP could manage only 77. It was Abhishek who was instrumental in roping in poll strategist Prashant Kishor after the Lok Sabha polls in 2019. Political commentator Biswanath Chakraborty said: “Abhishek Banerjee has emerged as a true leader and the second-in-command of the party through the 2021 assembly elections. So, it is obvious that now he would play a greater role.” “Mamata Banerjee is at the helm of affairs in the TMC. So it is natural that her nephew would get elevated. Why should we (BJP) get into it?” said Samik Bhattacharjee, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal. The TMC which returned to power for the third consecutive term also made some other major organisational changes on Saturday, while hinting that more would be made at the district level in the next one month. Actor Saayoni Ghosh has been made the head of the youth wing, a post earlier held by Abhishek Banerjee. The party has also appointed MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar as president of its women’s wing. First-time MLA and film director Raj Chakraborty will head the party’s cultural cell. “Today, the All India Trinamool Congress takes a new step towards effective leadership. Going forward, we shall be committed towards being a #OnePersonOnePost party,” the party tweeted. The TMC working committee, however, was yet to take a decision on whether to take back turncoats who abandoned the party to join the BJP ahead of the assembly elections and now want to return. While many have openly apologised and said that they want to return to the TMC, a few others sent feelers by criticising the BJP. “Nothing was discussed on this. Mamata Banerjee would take a decision. She may also form a committee for this,” said Chatterjee. The party also has decided to step outside Bengal, Chatterjee said. In April a tweet by the TMC had triggered speculation over whether Mamata Banerjee would contest against Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi or the party would field someone to challenge him in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. “It was also decided in the meeting that the TMC would expand beyond West Bengal to strengthen the party. The party’s MPs, including Abhishek Banerjee, would be working in this,” Chatterjee said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cms-nephew-abhishek-named-tmc-national-general-secy-101622917585216.html

The state's emblem is also imprinted on the bikini.

During the two recent cyclones—Tauktae and Yaas-- coastal areas bore the maximum brunt in the state. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has written a letter to PM Modi recently urging him to declare coastal erosion as a natural disaster helping to provide compensation to the affected from the national and state disaster response funds. Speaking at a webinar organized by the premier marine body Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) on Saturday as part of World Environment Day, experts called for restoration of coastal vegetation giving more emphasis on mangrove forests, which they said will act as a bio-shield protecting lives of residents. The webinar highlighted that the entire Kerala coast recently witnessed ‘storm surge’ during the two cyclones. They are of the view that such storm surges are likely to occur in the coast increasingly in coming years with rapid warming of waters in the Indian Ocean. Alarming winds triggered by cyclones help form storm surge in waters which results in high waves, sea erosion and flooding in the coastal hamlet. This was seen recently especially in coastal areas like Chellanam in Kochi, they said. Kerala’s coastal region could be protected to a great extent through restoration of mangroves and other biodiversity in the region, said CMFRI Director Dr A Gopalakrishnan. “Conservation of coastal biodiversity, which is in deterioration owing to many reasons including constructions, is the best long-term natural option for protecting the lives of coastal people from sea turbulence,” he said, adding that mangroves act as a model bio-shield. The webinar, which was attended by leading experts who work on mangroves, recommended that restoration of coastal vegetation along the Kerala coast should be planned in a social forestry concept with public participation. Feasibility studies are required for identifying potential areas for mangrove forestation. Dr N Vasudevan, Managing Director of Forest Development Corporation, Maharashtra; PP Pramod, Chief Conservator, Forest Eastern Circle and Custodian, Vested Forest, Kerala; Dr R Ramasubramanian, Director of Coastal Systems Research Programme at MS Swaminathan Research Foundation, Chennai; Dr P Kaladharan, Principal Scientist of CMFRI, Dr Grinson George, Senior Programme Specialist at SAARC, Dr K Vinod, Principal Scientist of CMFRI and Dr Ratheesh Kumar R, Scientist of CMFRI also spoke at the webinar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mangroves-best-remedy-to-check-growing-coastal-erosion-in-kerala-say-experts-101622911885415.html

The South Asian country's top health regulator, the National Health Surveillance Agency of Brazil - Anvisa, has also approved the proposal to import Russia's Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine into that country.Also Read: WHO nod likely by September: Bharat BiotechEarlier in February, Bharat Biotech signed an agreement with the Brazillian government for the supply of 20 million doses of Covaxin during the second and third quarters of 2021, in which it presented an "adequate action plan" and fulfilled all the pending issues related to the certification of good manufacturing practice (GMP) request, Anvisa said.The clarification regarding GMP comes as the Brazillian health regulator had earlier denied the proposal to import Covaxin into the country after the authorities found that the Indian plant in which the Covid-19 vaccine was being made did not meet the GMP requirements.Also Read: India could get Covid vaccine for kids, Zydus Cadila set to seek nod for ZyCoV-DBrazil, as the per initial agreement, is expected to receive four million doses of Covaxin, following which it will monitor the data on Covid-19 vaccine use and decide, if required, the number of additional doses to be imported. Initially, Covaxin will only be used under specific conditions, Anvisa said on Saturday in a statement issued in Portuguese, shortly after the 9th extraordinary public meeting of the collegiate board.Presenting a slew of conditions for the import of Covaxin, Anvisa said that all batches to be destined for Brazil must have been manufactured after the adaptations of the GMP implemented by the manufacturer Bharat Biotech, according to the corrective and preventive action report presented to Brazil's health regulator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brazil-clears-proposal-to-import-covaxin-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccines-101622904345225.html

Senior party leader and minister, Partha Chatterjee, also announced that the party, after its sweeping victory in the recently held assembly elections, would now expand its organisational footprint beyond the state. “One of the biggest decisions taken by Mamata Banerjee in Saturday’s meeting was to appoint Abhishek Banerjee as the general secretary of the All India Trinamool Congress. According to political analysts, Abhishek Banerjee played a key role in the party’s thumping victory in the assembly polls in which the TMC won 213 seats out of the 292 assembly constituencies where polls were held. The BJP could manage only 77. It was Abhishek who was instrumental in roping in poll strategist Prashant Kishor after the Lok Sabha polls in 2019. Political commentator Biswanath Chakraborty said: “Abhishek Banerjee has emerged as a true leader and the second-in-command of the party through the 2021 assembly elections. So, it is obvious that now he would play a greater role.” “Mamata Banerjee is at the helm of affairs in the TMC. So it is natural that her nephew would get elevated. Why should we (BJP) get into it?” said Samik Bhattacharjee, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal. The TMC which returned to power for the third consecutive term also made some major organisational changes on Saturday, while hinting that more changes would be made at the district level in the next one month. Actor Saayoni Ghosh has been made the head of the youth wing a post earlier held by Abhishek Banerjee. The party has also appointed MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar as president of its women’s wing. First-time MLA and film director Raj Chakraborty will head the party’s cultural cell. “Today, the All India Trinamool Congress takes a new step towards effective leadership. Going forward, we shall be committed towards being a #OnePersonOnePost party,” the party tweeted. The TMC working committee, however, was yet to take a decision on whether to allow the turncoats, who abandoned the party to join the BJP ahead of the assembly elections and now want to return to the TMC. A number of them have openly apologized and said that they want to return to the TMC, while a few others have sent feelers by criticizing the BJP. “Nothing was discussed on this. Mamata Banerjee will take a decision. She may also form a committee for this,” said Chatterjee. The party has also decided to step outside Bengal, Chatterjee said. In April, a tweet by the TMC had triggered speculation over whether Mamata Banerjee would contest against Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi or the party would field someone to challenge him in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. It was also decided in the meeting that the TMC would expand beyond West Bengal to strengthen the party. The party’s MPs, including Abhishek Banerjee, would be working on this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-s-nephew-abhishek-made-tmc-general-secretary-in-key-party-meet-101622907804835.html

All you need to know||Twitter on Saturday removed the blue tick from the personal accounts of Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and a few other RSS functionaries for a brief period of time. By evening the blue ticks were restored. There has been no official statement by either the government or Twitter, though RSS functionaries have termed it as "tech feudalism by Twitter".What is a blue tick?A blue tick on Twitter is a verification badge which symbolises that the accounts are authentic. The social media platform has a set of rules to grant this verification badge.Why did Twitter remove the blue tick? What does the rule say?According to Twitter's rulebook verified badges may be automatically removed from inactive and incomplete accounts. There are other reasons for which an account may lose its verified status like hateful conduct etc. But inactivity has been cited as the reason for removing the blue ticks in these cases.How does Twitter determine inactivity?In its policy guideline, Twitter has mentioned that inactivity is based on logging in. "We encourage people to actively log in and use Twitter when they register an account. To keep your account active, be sure to log in at least every 6 months. Accounts may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity," it said.Have these accounts been inactive?The personal account of the Vice President has been inactive since 2020. The accounts of the RSS functionaries were also inactive for some time. The accounts of the RSS functionaries were made to check the spread of misinformation by parody accounts, it has been said.Allegation of biasThe RSS has pointed out that several accounts have been inactive but they continue to remain verified. Many have pointed out the examples of Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley's Twitter accounts which have blue tick long after their death. It may be noted that Sushma Swaraj's Twitter account has been turned into a memory account and is now handled by Swaraj Kaushal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-blue-tick-row-why-does-twitter-remove-verified-status-all-you-need-to-know-101622903445687.html
05-06-2021||India||L-G hasn't rejected Kejriwal's ration scheme, asked to follow law: Sources||Delhi's Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Anil Baijal has not rejected chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's doorstep ration delivery scheme but has only advised for the constitutional scheme of things to be followed in letter and spirit, sources in the know of the matter said. The aim is to ensure smooth decisions and seamless benefits to people at large, sources said, after the Aam Aadmi Party accused the Centre of stalling its Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana Scheme.Officials explained that since the scheme seeks to change the method of distribution of ration supplies — from fair price shops to private vendors who will deliver at doorstep, it will require prior approval of the Centre as per Section 12 (2) (h) of the National Food Security Act 2013. The file has now been returned to the chief minister for reconsideration."It was brought to the notice that a Writ Petition WP (C) 2037/2021 in the said matter has been filed by the "Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh" in the High Court of Delhi challenging the proposed arrangement of doorstep delivery of ration by GNCTD wherein the Union of India is also a party. The said petition is scheduled to be heard on August 20, 2021," sources said."It is underlined that the Hon'ble Lt Governor has not rejected the proposal as is being portrayed. He has advised for the constitutional scheme of things to be followed in letter and spirit with the sole aim of ensuring smooth decisions and seamless benefits to people at large," sources added.Under the scheme, every ration beneficiary of Delhi would have received 4 kg wheat flour (atta), 1 kg rice and sugar per person at the convenience of their homes, Kejriwal's office said adding that this could have stopped ration mafia and beneficiaries would have got the supplies at home without going to the fair price shops. The scheme is also in tune with Centre's One Nation One Card scheme, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lg-hasn-t-rejected-kejriwal-s-ration-scheme-asked-to-follow-law-sources-101622904450050.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that India will stand with the Saudi government's decision, Naqvi added, reported news agency ANI."Haj will depend on the decision of the Saudi Arabia government. PM Narendra Modi has said India will stand by the side of the Saudi govt in their decision. Last year Haj got canceled. This year nothing has been decided yet," ANI quoted Naqvi as saying.Also read | Only 'immunised' pilgrims to Mecca allowed: Saudi authoritiesSaudi Arabia last year banned outside pilgrims from taking part in haj to contain the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Only a limited number of domestic pilgrims were allowed to perform haj. The restriction was the first such ban in recent history on what is considered the most significant pilgrimage for Muslims all around the world.On Thursday, the world's largest Muslim majority nation, Indonesia cancelled the haj pilgrimage for the second consecutive year amid the concerns of the increasing spread of Covid-19."Due to the pandemic and for the safety of the pilgrims, the government has decided that this year it won't allow Indonesian pilgrims to go again," Reuters quoted the country's religious affairs minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas as saying.Saudi Arabia has relaxed a ban on travellers coming from 11 countries that were imposed to prevent the spread of the virus, but quarantine measures will be required to follow, Saudi state news agency said, according to the Reuters report.Also read | Covid-19: Saudi Arabia to organize Mecca pilgrimage under special conditionsEarlier in March, the Saudi health ministry said that it will allow vaccinated people to attend haj this year, as per media reports.Around 2.5 million pilgrims used to visit the most sacrosanct site of Islam in Mecca and Medina to perform the week-long haj, and the lesser, year-round umrah pilgrimage, which cumulatively helped the kingdom to gain around $12 billion annually, as per the official data, Reuter reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haj-2021-will-depend-on-saudi-arabia-s-decision-says-union-minister-naqvi-101622899676562.html
05-06-2021||India||'Dear BJP, why do you hate Delhi,' AAP asks as Centre 'blocks' ration scheme||The Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday accused the Centre of stalling Delhi's doorstep delivery of ration scheme, which was scheduled to begin with one or two days. The scheme would have benefitted 72 lakh people in Delhi, but the LG has rejected the file citing an ongoing legal case and the absence of the Centre's approval.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's office issued a statement in which it was claimed that no approval from the Centre is required for such a scheme and the ongoing legal complications too do not deter the launch of the scheme as there has been no such court order. Delhi food minister Imran Hussain said the decision to reject the file is politically motivated.L-G hasn't rejected Kejriwal's ration scheme, asked to follow law: SourcesIn March, BJP promised Home Delivery of Ration in Tamil Nadu.Today, BJP has stopped Home Delivery of Ration in Delhi.Dear @BJP4India, we once again ask you - Why do you hate Delhi?#ModiProtectsRationMafia https://t.co/WVYu7IyKVhThe scheme was designed after informing the Centre and all the suggestions of the central government were incorporated. The file was sent to the LG for final approval on May 24, but it has been returned."Prime Minister, what nexus do you have with ration mafia that you stopped Kejriwal government's Ghar Ghar Ration Scheme?" the AAP tweeted.Under the scheme, every ration beneficiary of Delhi would have received 4 kg wheat flour (atta), 1 kg rice and sugar per person at the convenience of their homes, the CMO said adding that this could have stopped ration mafia and beneficiaries would have got the supplies at home without going to the fair price shops. The scheme is also in tune with Centre's One Nation One Card scheme, it said.The scheme, which has undergone a name change on Centre's direction, was scheduled to be launched on March 25. But the Centre raised a few objections which were addressed by the Delhi cabinet, the CMO said.The obstruction will also dent Delhi's fight against the pandemic, the CMO said. "Centre’s obstruction also severely compromises Delhi’s fight against the third wave of Corona. As cautioned by experts, the next Covid wave may disproportionately target children. By forcing people to stand in long queues outside ration shops, it is likely that in the third wave the virus may pass from parents to their children. Keeping this in mind, the Delhi government had fast-tracked the implementation of this scheme," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dear-bjp-why-do-you-hate-delhi-aap-asks-as-centre-blocks-ration-scheme-101622902022688.html

Though children are vulnerable to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the majority of them are asymptomatic and only 1-2 per cent had to go for hospitalisation," news agency ANI said quoting Somasekar.He urged parents to exercise caution so the virus is not transmitted from adults to children and asked them to look for changes in children's behaviour to identify the symptoms of Covid-19.Somasekar added that Covid-19’s impact on children so far has only been felt in the state of Karnataka, where as many as 68,635 children under the age of 10 have been infected, starting from the beginning of the pandemic till May 20 of this year, according to state health department data.He also discussed easy-to-adopt measures in everyday life like physical exercise, avoiding junk food, healthy sleep, wearing masks, following a balanced diet, and age-appropriate vaccination, reported ANI.As the second wave subsides and states are taking precautionary measures to resist a probable third wave, more attention is being paid to Covid-19’s impact on children. The Union health ministry said in a press conference on May 22 that children can be infected by Covid-19 and can infect others, and that it cannot be said with certainty that infection rates among children are comparatively less than adults.Instances of children being infected have poured in from all over the world. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report on Covid-19’s impact on adolescents found that almost one-third of adolescents hospitalised with Covid-19 in January-March of this year had to be admitted to intensive care units, and 5% needed machines to help them breathe.In India, Delhi and Maharashtra have started ramping up infrastructure by setting up additional pediatric wards and ICU beds in anticipation of a third wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/children-are-vulnerable-to-covid-19-majority-asymptomatic-says-expert-101622895754972.html

The doctors' body said Coronil is not approved by the World Health Organization; it does not either have any approval from the Drug Controller General of India of Ayush as a medicine. "Coronil is however recognised as a food supplement by Ayush Vibhag of central government and is not a drug or medicine as claimed by Baba Ramdev on National TV on hourly basis advertisements" Dr Ajay Khanna, state secretary of IMA Uttarkhand wrote to the chief secretary of the state.This "retaliation" comes at a time the association is at loggerheads with Ramdev over the yoga guru's disparaging comments on modern medicine. The controversy has been going on and the IMA filed complaints against Ramdev and sent a legal notice to Patanjali Ayurved.No curbs on Ramdev, he’s entitled to his opinion: HCAmid this ongoing tussle, it has been reported that Patanjali has proposed to add Coronil as part of Covid-19 kit in Uttarakhand. This is medically wrong, the IMA said as this will result in a mixing of allopathy and Ayurved, the IMA said."Addition of Coronil with allopathic drugs shall amount to mixopathy that is a cocktail of Allopath and Ayurved which is not permitted as per the rulings of the honourable Supreme Court. Apart from the Apex Court, several high courts of various states have also ruled that mixopathy is not allowed," the IMA said.Since its launch, Coronil has been mired in controversies as the Uttarkhand government last year said that Patanjali was given a licence to manufacture an immunity booster, not anything related to the treatment of the Coronavirus.Priced at ₹545, the kit consists of three things — Coronil tablet, Swasari vati and Anu Taila. The Haryana government has recently anounced that one lakh Coronil kits will be distributed among Coronavirus patients in Haryana free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/-coronil-not-a-medicine-uttarakhand-ima-raises-concerns-over-ramdev-s-therapy-101622894953076.html

That vaccine is in the garbage in Rajasthan and profits are being made on that vaccine in Punjab. This is the culture of Congress,” Puri said during a press conference.Also read: Under flak, Punjab govt asks private hospitals to return vaccine stockCiting the data of Covid-19 vaccination in Punjab, made public by an officer of the government in that state on May 29, Puri said the figures reveal that the dispensation is profiteering by overcharging for the vaccines. One dose of Covishield vaccine, which costs ₹309, has been sold at ₹1,560 through private hospitals, Puri said."These people are giving a dose of Covishield which they bought for ₹309 to a private hospital for ₹1,000 and as per yesterday's data they are selling it for ₹1,560," the Union minister said.He further cited the disclosed data by saying, that 429,000 doses of Covishield were procured at ₹13.25 crore its average amount is ₹309 and 114,190 Covaxin doses were procured at ₹4.70 crore, its average amount is ₹412."The Centre has distributed 50 per cent of vaccines to states and UTs to administer doses to people free of cost. States are profiteering on their own procurement. If these figures are true then the real amount of profit is not just ₹2.40 crore," Puri said.Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday made the same allegations against the Punjab government, saying that the state government distributed the vaccine procured under the state quota to 20 private hospitals for ₹1,000.Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati also said that it is 'indecent, inhuman, condemnable and very unfortunate' that the Punjab government was indulging in corrupt activities during a health emergency.Also read: Captain digs in heels at meet over infightingThis comes after Sukhbir Singh Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal accused the Amarinder Singh government of diverting vaccine doses to private hospitals for profit.After the backlash, the state health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Friday said that he has ordered a probe into the allegations imposed by the opposition regarding the vaccines.Post this, the state government in new order withdrew the “one-time” instruction to private hospitals for vaccinating people in the age bracket of 18-44 years and instructed the hospitals to return all the vaccine doses available with them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-is-their-culture-puri-slams-congress-led-govts-for-covid-vaccine-corruption-wastage-101622884107906.html

Justifying the move, the state government said that this is only on the certificates being issued to people falling between the age group of 18 and 45 as the state government is procuring these vaccines, not the Centre. An official told news agency PTI beneficiaries of 45 plus are getting certificates of vaccination with the photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as in other parts of the country, but those falling in the 18-44 age bracket have photographs of Mamata Banerjee as the state government is using its resources to procure these vaccines. "The government has started procuring vaccines directly from the manufacturers and arranging for inoculating the population. That is the reason it has been decided to use photograph of the CM on the certificates," the news agency quoted an official as saying. Also Read: Mamata and her battle against Union government over bureaucratsState minister for housing and outgoing mayor of the city Firhad Hakim, who is also the chairman of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation board of administrator, said other states are also taking similar steps. "All information regarding inoculation is there on the certificate. Starting from the batch number of the vaccine, there is also CoWIN Registration number. Besides, a special message of the CM," Hakim told PTI adding that Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have already replaced PM's photo with that of their respective chief ministers. PM Modi's photo on Covid-19 vaccine certificates triggered a controversy ahead of the state elections and the photo was removed from certificates in the poll-bound states for the time being. The photo reappeared after the stipulated period was over.From May 1, the third phase of the vaccination against Covid-19 has begun in which state governments are also procuring vaccines directly from vaccine makers.

The government said this is the last chance given to Twitter. While this "last notice" comes in connection with the IT rules in which all social media intermediaries operating in India have to abide by, the Twitter versus government saga has been going on for quite some time and several central ministers have opened their accounts on Koo, an Indian microblogging platform.Here are 10 things you need to know about the ongoing government versus Twitter1. After the farmers' rally on Republic Day in Delhi turned violent, the government asked Twitter to take action against some accounts, but Twitter was not prompt in responding to the request. Later, it complied but partially, when the "damage had been done".2. The government expressed its displeasure over the toolkit that was shared by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. The Centre said that Twitter was being misused for planning string social media campaigns to create disharmony and unrest in India.3. Twitter wrongly showed the geolocation of certain areas of Ladakh as part of China and took several days to rectify the mistake, the IT ministry has recently said in a statement. "Twitter chose to show the geo-location of certain locations in Union Territory of Ladakh as part of the People’s Republic of China at a time when India and China were engaged in the peaceful resolution of border-related issues through bilateral dialogue," it said.4. The government has also accused Twitter of promoting vaccine hesitancy. "Twitter’s lack of responsibility has led to rampant proliferation of fake and harmful content against India and Indians. Promoting vaccine hesitancy has been rampantly done through the use of the Twitter platform and yet Twitter has taken no action. Is this commitment to the people of India?" the IT ministry said.5. The government said Twitter took no action against posts that "maliciously" termed B.1.617 mutant as an Indian variant.6. Recently, Twitter flagged some posts of a BJP spokesperson as "manipulated media". The Delhi Police Special Cell visited the office of Twitter in this regard.7. Twitter has said it is concerned about the safety of its staff working in India. "Right now, we are concerned by recent events regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve," it said.8. Twitter also said that the new IT rules have elements that could inhibit free speech. It said it plans to “advocate for changes to elements of these regulations that inhibit free, open public conversation”.9. In reply, the government said that the platform will have to abide by the rules as these have been finalised after wide consultations with all stakeholders.10. Twitter has appointed an interim grievance redressal officer in India. This was one of the mandatory provisions stipulated by the new IT rules.Meanwhile, Twitter on Saturday removed the blue tick from the personal accounts of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat as well as a number of other leaders from the organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/last-chance-10-things-to-know-about-government-versus-twitter-battle-101622884907224.html

05-06-2021||India||‘Comply with new rules or lose safe harbour: Govt to Twitter||The ministry of electronics and information technology on Saturday sent a sternly-worded letter to microblogging platform Twitter to share compliance details with the new intermediary guidelines, all clauses of which came into effect on May 25, saying that Twitter’s refusal to follow the rules demonstrates a “lack of commitment towards providing a safe experience to the people of India”.“Despite being in operation in India for over a decade, it is beyond belief that Twitter Inc. has doggedly refused to create mechanisms that will enable the people of India to resolve their issues on the platform in a timely and transparent manner and through fair processes,” the ministry has stated in its letter. “Users who are abused on the platform or are harassed or are subject to defamation or specula abuse or become victims go a whole range of other abusive contacts must get a redressal mechanism that the same people of India have created through a due process of law.”The ministry has, as a “gesture of goodwill”, given Twitter one last notice to immediately comply with the new rules or lose the exemption from criminal liability available to the social media intermediary under section 79 of the Information Technology Act. Section 79 provides Twitter safe harbour or protection against any kind of criminal action for third party content posted on the platform.The government has threatened that non-compliance with the new guidelines will result in the platform being criminally liable for third party content posted on it.Also read: Now, Twitter removes verification tick from RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s accountThe central government has given Twitter one last chance to comply with the new guidelines notified on February 25, which direct companies such Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook to regulate content, appoint officers who will be liable for compliance, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.The government has been in a standoff with the microblogging platform since last week when Twitter raised concerns regarding “intimidation tactics by the police” and with the “core elements” of the new social media and intermediary guidelines. Twiter’s statement prompted a strong response from the government which called the remarks an “attempt to dictate its terms”.In a letter addressed to Jim Baker, the ministry has expressed its “dismay” over Twitter’s response to its communications indicating that it has not fully complied with the new rules. The ministry had sought details of the compliance officer, grievance redressal officer and nodal contact person from all significant social media intermediaries (which have 50 lakh users or above) on May 26. While Twitter shared the details of the last two, naming an India-based attorney, it did not share details of a compliance officer with the government.Twitter declined to comment.The ministry in its letter has stated that the platform has not informed about the details of the chief compliance officer and that the nodal contact person and resident grievance officer appointed by Twitter is not an employee of Twitter Inc. in India, as prescribed by the rules. It has further added that the address shared by Twitter is that of a law firm, which also is not in consonance with the new guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/comply-with-new-rules-or-lose-safe-harbour-govt-to-twitter-101622883083533.html
05-06-2021||India||World Environment Day: What we know about India’s net-zero emissions target||Soon after the Biden Administration took over and vowed to resume its commitment on climate change, that took a backseat for four years during the tenure of Donald Trump, US President’s special envoy on climate, John Kerry, visited India ahead of the Climate Leaders’ Summit. The US assured the world of its commitment to a net-zero emission target for 2050.The move was seen as the country’s bid to reclaim its position in global climate leadership, even as several other nations, including the United Kingdom and France, have already enacted legislations towards achieving a net-zero emission scenario by the middle of the century. On the other hand, developed nations such as Canada, South Korea, Japan and Germany have also expressed their intention to commit themselves to a net-zero future. Even China has promised to go net-zero by 2060.However, India, the world’s third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, after the United States and China, is yet to show any keenness. During his last visit, Kerry aimed to talk New Delhi through softening its stance and exploring the possibility of pledging itself to a net-zero goal by 2050.Click here for latest updates on environmentRecently, Ravi Shankar Prasad, a former additional secretary in the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, and one of lead negotiators for India at global climate meets, said that the “net-zero emissions target is unjust for developing nations like India” .“While the feasibility and efficacy of such a strategy for all countries is questionable, it also strikes at the root of the basic tenets of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Simultaneously, it undermines the achievement of a climate-just world,” he wrote in an article published at the Indian Express.What is net-zero goal?Net-zero, also referred to as carbon-neutrality, is a state in which a country’s emissions are compensated by absorption and removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Absorption of the emissions can be increased by creating more carbon sinks such as forests, while removal of gases from the atmosphere requires advanced technologies such as carbon capture and storage. Net-zero does not mean that a country would bring down its emissions to zero. Through carbon absorption it is possible for nations to have negative emissions, if such absorption and removal of greenhouse gases exceed the actual emissions. Bhutan is a case in point and often called a ‘carbon-negative’ nation as it absorbs more than it emits.Why the push for net-zero goal?Countries are being put under pressure to commit to a net-zero emission goal for 2050. There are views that the only way to achieve the Paris Agreement target of keeping the planet’s temperature from rising beyond 2°C compared to pre-industrial times is by achieving global carbon neutrality by 2050. Scientists and environmental experts fear the present policies and actions against emissions reduction won’t be able to prevent even 3-4°C rise in surface temperature by the turn of the century. The net-zero formulation does not assign any emission reduction targets on any country. Moreover, unchecked emissions by rich and developed countries over past several decades are significantly responsible for global warming and the resultant irreversible climate change.READ MORE: UNEP report to launch today. All you need to knowA country can become carbon-neutral at its current level of emissions, or even by increasing its emissions, if it is able to absorb carbon or remove greenhouse gases more. From the perspective of the developed world, it is a big relief, because now the burden is shared by everyone, and does not fall only on them.What are India’s objections?India is opposed to the net-zero emissions target as it is likely to be the most impacted by it. Over the next two to three decades, India’s emissions are likely to grow at the fastest pace in the world, as it aggressively pushes for growth and development on all fronts. No amount of afforestation or reforestation would be able to compensate for the increased emissions at the scale is looking at. Moreover, most of the carbon removal technologies right now are either unreliable or expensive.India’s arguments are not unfounded. The net-zero goal does not figure in the 2015 Paris Agreement. It only requires the signatory nations to take the best climate action it can. Countries need to set five-year or a 10-year climate targets for themselves and the results. Apart from that, the countries are also required to set more ambitious targets than the previous one for every subsequent time-frame.READ MORE: Global average temperature could pass 1.5° Celsius within the next 5 yearsThe implementation of the Paris Agreement has begun recently and the majority countries have their submitted nationally determined targets with an aim to achieve them by 2025 or 2030. India’s argument is that countries must focus on delivering on what they have already promised instead of opening up a parallel discussion on net-zero targets outside of the Paris Agreement framework.Where do other countries stand?Data shows India is the only G-20 country whose climate actions are compliant to the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global temperatures from rising beyond 2°C. Even the actions of the European Union, often seen as climate-progressive, is assessed as “insufficient” while India is praised for doing more, relatively speaking, on climate change than many other countries.Rich-poor divide in climate targetIndia often pointed out that developed nations have failed to deliver on their past promises and commitments to climate change. No major country achieved the emission-cut targets assigned to them under the Kyoto Protocol, the climate policies that were in place before the Paris Agreement. While some countries openly walked out of the Kyoto Protocol without any consequences none of them delivered on the promises that they made for 2020.The developed countries also faltered on their commitment to provide money and technology to developing and poor countries to help them mitigate the impacts of climate change.ALSO READ: On World Environment Day, India’s top ten concernsIndia has been insisting that the developed countries should take more ambitious climate actions now to compensate for the unfulfilled promises from the past.However, India says it is too early to rule out the possibility of achieving carbon neutrality by middle of the century, even though she does not want to make an international commitment at this stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-environment-day-what-we-know-about-india-s-net-zero-emissions-target-101622881384730.html

The person added that the communication was sent as part of a “regular communication” with the ministry. A ministry official familiar with the matter said that it was a good thing that the company was complying with the guidelines but it was unlikely to affect the ban. “The ban was imposed for a different reason,” the official said. “It is good that the company is complying but the ban is a separate issue.” The official added that TikTok was not among the significant social media intermediaries, which have 50 lakh users or above, that was asked to share compliance details. A TikTok spokesperson said that the company looks forward to engaging with the government and returning to India. ”TikTok remains fully committed to the Indian market. We have always worked to comply with the law and look forward to engaging with the government about returning to India and again providing a joyful platform to our millions of creators and users,” the spokesperson said.Also read: Twitter restores blue verification tick of VP Naidu’s personal accountThe government is facing pushback against the new guidelines that direct companies such Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook to regulate content, appoint officers who will be liable for compliance, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.Twitter was the third company to express concerns with the rules. WhatsApp sued the Union electronics and technology ministry over the new rules in Delhi high court on Wednesday, and Facebook on Tuesday said there were “a few of issues (that) need more engagement with the government”. It became the seventh party to challenge the rules in court. Meanwhile, TikTok was among the 250 apps, mostly of Chinese origin, banned by India in the aftermath of the clashes with China in the Galwan sector in June last year. The government banned the application in three tranches stating that they posed a threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the country. “(The apps are) prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order,” the government had said. TikTok was part of the first ban that the government implemented, wherein 59 apps were taken down.Union information and technology minister Ravi Shanker Prasad called the ban a “digital strike” on China.The government was particularly concerned that the apps, which included the popular game PUBG, could be compromising the data of Indian users, Hindustan Times reported on June 30. Officials said that the apps were reported for “leaking data”. “All these apps have been reported to have been leaking data. Their malpractices have also been singled out by experts. They have been said to take location data, transfer files to servers in China,” an official had said then. The Ministry invoked its power under section 69A of the Information Technology Act with the relevant provisions of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by Public) Rules 2009 and in view of the emergent nature of threats has decided to block 118 mobile apps ‘since in view of the information available they are engaged in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order’. The ministry had said that the move “will safeguard the interests of crores of Indian mobile and internet users. This decision is a targeted move to ensure safety, security and sovereignty of Indian cyberspace”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-ban-tiktok-shares-info-on-compliance-with-new-rules-101622875824172.html

05-06-2021||India||States just transferring prisoners instead of efforts to decongest jails||Many states have since last year been just transferring prisoners from one prison to another instead of “making any credible” efforts to decongest jails despite the Covid-19 pandemic, a Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) report has said. The report was released days after the Supreme Court on May 8 cited “housing of inmates beyond optimal capacity” in prisons and again ordered decongestion of jails with immediate release of prisoners granted bail or on parole. It said the impact of the decongestion efforts on prison occupancies did indicate an average fall in the number of inmates. But it added the inmates in many states actually increased between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, when the Supreme Court constituted panels in states and Union territories to reduce overcrowding in prisons. CHRI said the number of jail inmates in Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands rose by 10.42% during this period. “In Bihar, the prison department transferred 14,903 prisoners which amounted to more than 35% of their prison population, to ease overcrowding in select prisons. However, at the end of June, 25 prisons were overcrowded, as opposed to 19 prisons on 1st April. Further, the overall occupancy increased from 86.7% on 1st April to 92% on 30th June 2020,” the report said. CHRI said the same practice was noticed in Haryana, where the women prisoners from Gurgaon were transferred to another prison in Jhajjar due to insufficient quarantine infrastructure. This too resulted in overcrowding in Jhajjar prison, it added. The Supreme Court suggested that prisoners, who have been convicted or are undertrials for offences for which the maximum imprisonment is seven years, may be considered for release. CHRI said there was no correlation found between the number of meetings of the Supreme Court-appointed panels and the release of prisoners. It added a higher number of meetings ensured regular monitoring of prisons and effective measures to curb the spread of the virus. CHRI said different procedures about consideration of parole applications were followed in states. It cited the vulnerabilities of senior citizens to Covid and said only Mizoram, Punjab, West Bengal, Delhi, and Jammu & Kashmir considered cases of elderly prisoners for release. “Similarly, barring the three [Mizoram, Punjab, and Delhi], no other HPC [panel] considered undertrials for release who were suffering from co-morbidities and other chronic diseases and pre-existing conditions like chronic diabetes, heart condition, cancer .... Only Punjab HPC specifically mentioned pregnant women as the category for release,” the report said. CHRI called for ensuring strict implementation of legal provisions that check arbitrary arrests. “The judiciary and other stakeholders must also consider alternatives to imprisonment … to support efforts to reduce overcrowding in prisons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-just-transferring-prisoners-instead-of-efforts-to-decongest-jails-101622867902806.html
05-06-2021||India||World Environment Day 2021: Why restoration of ecosystem is important||The World Environment Day is celebrated every year on June 5 across the world to inspire the people and the communities to take action to prevent the growing strain on planet Earth’s natural systems from reaching its saturation points.This year the World Environment Day is themed on ‘ecosystem restoration’ and calls for urgent action to revive the damaged ecosystems, with Pakistan being the host country for the day.Restoration of ecosystem holds significance in a globalised world that has been witnessing rapid development at blinding speed. According to the United Nations, the world loses enough forest every three seconds to cover a football pitch and over the last century over half of our wetlands have been destroyed. “As much as 50% of our coral reefs have already been lost and up to 90% of coral reefs could be lost by 2050, even if global warming is limited to an increase of 1.5°C,” the UN has warned.ALSO READ | UNEP report to launch today. All you need to knowThe loss of ecosystem deprives the world of carbon sinks, like forests and peatlands, at a time humanity can least afford it. Emission of global greenhouse gasses have grown exponentially for three years in a row and the blue planet is a step ahead in its path to potentially catastrophic climate change.Moreover, the raging coronavirus disease pandemic has held a mirror for us on how debilitating the consequences of ecosystem loss can be. The shrinking area of natural habitat for animals has led to ideal conditions for pathogens – including coronaviruses – to spread.The World Environment Day 2021 focusses on ecosystem restoration and its theme is “Reimagine. Recreate. Restore.” The day will kick off the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030), a global mission to revive billions of hectares, from forests to farmlands, from the top of mountains to the depth of the sea.ALSO READ | On World Environment Day, India’s top ten concernsEcosystem restoration means preventing, halting, and reversing this damage – to go from exploiting nature to healing it. It also calls for assisting in the recovery of ecosystems that have been degraded or destroyed, as well as conserving the ecosystems that are still intact. Restoration can happen in many ways, such as through actively planting or by removing pressures so that nature can recover on its own.Ecosystem restoration at a global scale is important if we are to mitigate the extent of the ecological crisis that we are currently facing, and protect the biodiversity for future generations.Our food systems and the revival of forest and agrarian crops depend on healthy soils. But soil degradation not only compromises the essential value of the ecosystems but also its ability to produce healthy and sustainable foods. Therefore, the restoration of soil is important to sustain life on earth.ALSO READ | Generations at work: Their love for environment knows no ageIndigenous culture is pivotal for the community and the society. However, the ecological erosion has the potential for erosion of culture, including that of knowledge and language. This knowledge is often hyper-localised and has evolved over thousands of years and is crucial for the health of many ecosystems and the livelihoods of communities across the globe. Therefore, ecological restoration can help to sustain the diversity of human cultures by supporting mutually advantageous relationships between human beings and the nature.Restoring ecosystems carries substantial benefits for people. It also creates jobs in rural areas where they are most needed.Some countries have already invested in restoration as part of their strategies to bounce back from coronavirus disease while others are turning to restoration to help them adapt to a climate that is already changing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-environment-day-2021-why-restoration-of-ecosystem-is-important-101622867093612.html

05-06-2021||India||World Environment Day: India produced 45,308 tonnes of Covid-19 biomedical waste in previous one year||Biomedical waste is a threat to global public environmental health and with ‘plastic footprint’ becoming larger by the day due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, concerns on plastic waste choking the planet are mounting.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), India has been generating nearly 146 tonnes of bio-medical waste every day due to diagnostic activities and treatment of Covid-19 patients. Between June 2020 and May 10, 2021, India produced 45,308 tonnes of Covid-19 biomedical waste. This is in addition to the 615 tonnes of biomedical waste a day being produced before Covid-19, the pollution control board's data showed.This is an increase of almost 17% in biomedical waste generation solely because of the pandemic."There has been a general increase and since it is a crisis situation, we are not thinking of plastic but general prevention. The focus is no longer plastic, so that is a problem," news agency PTI quoted Ravi Agarwal, founder-director of the environmental non-profit Toxics Link, saying.Agarwal also noted that a lot of biomedical waste like face masks, PPE kits are being generated from normal households and it is also contributing to the problem significantly. "These things are finding their way across ecosystems. A lot of these things like masks can be seen on beaches, in coral reefs etc," he also said.Apart from Covid-related medical waste, what is also contributing to plastic waste is people using home delivery services for essential and non-essential shopping more than before.Lack of Covid-waste disposal mechanisms is also a major contributor to the problem.Under the existing rules by CPCB, biomedical waste is segregated into four categories. While the yellow category is for waste that is classified as “highly infectious” — such as human, animal, anatomical, and soiled — red is for contaminated recyclable waste generated from disposable items like tubing, bottles tubes, syringes.Sharp objects like needles, syringes with fixed needles are segregated into the white category and broken or discarded and contaminated glassware, including medicine vials are categorised into the blue category.However, as the Covid waste is considered potentially infectious, it is tagged yellow and incinerated. "We never know the extent of pollution we are doing... We are converting our land-based pollution to water or air pollution. That’s what we end up doing,” said Siddharth Singh, deputy programme manager at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), as per PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-environment-day-india-produced-45-308-tonnes-of-covid-19-biomedical-waste-in-previous-one-year-101622862552910.html

05-06-2021||India||PM lauds scientists for indigenous vaccines||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday lauded scientists for the scale and speed at which they developed indigenous vaccines against Covid-19 pandemic and bolstered measures to fight the viral disease within a year, even as he reiterated his government’s call for a self-reliant and strong India.“In the previous century, inventions were made in other countries and India had to wait for many years. But today the scientists in our country are working at the same speed and at par with other countries,” said Modi while chairing a meeting of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Society through video conferencing.“Our scientists, within a year, developed ‘Made in India’ vaccine and made it available to the countrymen,” he added.The Prime Minister further hailed science for always helping world fight crises. “Coronavirus pandemic has come before the whole world as the biggest challenge of this century, but history is witness to this, when there is a big crisis on humanity, science has given better future ways to be prepared,” he said.During the meeting, Modi reiterated his call for an Aatmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant) and a strong India, saying that the pandemics may have slowed its pace but the country’s resolve remains the same.The PM also spoke about the concerns of climate crisis and urged experts to actively look for solutions while preparing for carbon capture, energy storage and green hydrogen technologies. “Our scientists, our institutions should prepare ourselves for this future challenges with a scientific approach. From carbon capture to energy storage to green hydrogen technologies, we have to take a leap,” he said.Lauding the work done by the CSIR, he said: “This institution of ours has given so many talents and scientists to the country. A great scientist like Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar has given leadership to this institution.”The CSIR, he added, has a powerful ecosystem of research and patents and its scientists work for many problems faced by the country.Union ministers Nirmala Sitharaman, Piyush Goyal and Harsh Vardhan were also present at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-lauds-scientists-for-indigenous-vaccines-101622850316260.html
05-06-2021||India||Alpha to Delta switch behind city’s 4th wave||The Delta variant of Sars-Cov-2 out-competed the Alpha variant within weeks and went on to spark Delhi’s most devastating wave of Covid-19 yet, according to a new report by Indian scientists who carried out genomic analysis, providing yet more evidence that India needs to reconsider its decisions to delay second doses of the vaccine.The report is yet to undergo peer review and was published late on Thursday by researchers from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB).It is part of a flurry of scientific evidence published in the last 24 hours that reinforces fears that the Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, is harder to contain and may be leading to more vaccine breakthrough cases and even severe disease – attributes that have implication for India’s vaccination drive, especially the decision to delay second doses.“Although we don’t have effectiveness data for the Covishield vaccine against severe disease with the Delta variant, the UK data from PHE and from the Crick Institute point to the urgent need to review our data and our policies and use impact modeling to decide if a change is needed,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, professor of microbiology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.“While much more remains to be done, three takeaways for now are: Delta (B.1.617.2) is more transmissible than Alpha (B.1.1.7), there seems to be greater immune escape and reinfection, and fully vaccinated breakthroughs were disproportionately due to Delta,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, IGIB, in a tweet.Late on Thursday, Public Health England (PHE) updated its technical analysis of the variant to say that the variant that was first found in India is more likely to lead to hospitalisations than the variant that has been predominant in the UK, or the Alpha variant (also known as B.1.1.7). A previous PHE analysis on May 27 showed the efficacy of one dose against the Delta variant was significantly lower than against the other variants (see box).On Friday, Lancet published a fresh analysis of how vaccines perform with the variants in lab tests – where antibodies from vaccinated individuals are made to react with the different variants. It showed that the neutralising capacity of antibodies from people who got two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 5.8 fold lower when the Delta variant was involved, as compared to the predecessor variant that was prevalent in 2020. This was similar to the loss of neutralisation activity seen with the Gamma (or B.1.351) variant, which has been established to be significantly resistant to vaccines.In contrast, the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) led to only a 2.6 fold loss in neutralisation by vaccine-trained antibodies.The authors of the Lancet study, also from the Public Health England, said that the findings back their decision to reduce the gap between two vaccine doses, which UK announced on May 15. “These data therefore suggest that the benefits of delaying the second dose, in terms of wider population coverage and increased individual NAbTs (neutralising antibody titers) after the second dose, must now be weighed against decreased efficacy in the short term, in the context of the spread of B.1.617.2 (Delta variant).“Worldwide, our data highlight the ongoing need to increase vaccine supply to allow all countries to extend second-dose protection as quickly as possible,” they said.Agrawal said the timing of doses was a “complex issue”. “There are some benefits, some losses. Overall an acceptable strategy if used with flexibility of giving second dose at 8 weeks in some situations and longer intervals for others,” he said.Taken together, these findings mean the Delta variant ticks all three boxes of traits that make a variant particularly dangerous: it is more transmissible, it is more resistant, and it can lead to more serious disease.On transmissibility, Indian researchers from NCDC and IGIB say the manner in which the Delta variant replaced the Alpha variant in Punjab “was surprising since there is no known mutation in B.1.617 lineage or in B.1.617.2 that is associated with such high transmissibility.” Punjab previously had the Alpha variant as the dominant virus.In Delhi, the Delta variant was relatively obscure at 5% in February, at a time when the Alpha variant’s prevalence was estimated at 20% of all samples. But by mid-April, the Delta variant overtook Alpha in prevalence, and at one point in mid-April was estimated to have a prevalence rate of 65%. It was around this time the positivity rate – the proportion of samples that return positive – in Delhi jumped to over 36%.The Indian researchers too note that the viral load of the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) appeared to be higher than the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7), “and based on data from India and UK, so does vaccination break-through rate”. They add that B.1.617.2 is “capable of creating very fast rising outbreaks with vaccination breakthroughs”.“We would re-emphasize that prior infections, high seropositivity and partial vaccination are insufficient impediments to its spread, as seen in Delhi, and strong public health response will be needed globally for its containment,” the authors said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alpha-to-delta-switch-behind-city-s-4th-wave-101622838952997.html
05-06-2021||India||Indian ‘seeker’ among sleuths who raised heat on lab theory||A motley group of social media detectives with backgrounds in science have been leading efforts to uncover clues about the origins of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, particularly if it leaked from a lab in Wuhan – according to new reports, which identifies one of them as an Indian based, possibly, in Bhubaneswar.A group of 24 people that calls itself DRASTIC, or Decentralized Radical Autonomous Search Team Investigating COVID-19, began looking into clues from Chinese scientific databases shortly after the pandemic began, Newsweek reported earlier this week.The clues involve scientific papers that detail how researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and other Chinese establishments were investigating coronaviruses found in an abandoned mine, how these studies may have been meant to find a vaccine, and some instances where authorities attempted to conceal data.Some of these have now come into the spotlight. Top American health official Anthony Fauci said on Thursday that China should release the health records of nine people, including six miners who fell sick in 2012 – an incident that may have kick-started a biological investigation into Sars-like coronaviruses, according to the clues uncovered by DRASTIC.“It starts with an outbreak of severe unexplained pneumonia cases in 2012, which saw six miners hospitalised. Three of them died, and the cause for their illness was suspected to be due to “SARS-like CoV”. The symptoms were almost indistinguishable from COVID-19,” said the Indian who uses the nom de guerre The Seeker on Twitter, and was identified as among the DRASTIC members who pieced together the most crucial of the clues.The group was also profiled in a piece by CNET on April 15, which identifies as The Seeker being a resident of Bhubaneswar, though in both cases, the person asked to remain anonymous.According to tweets by DRASTIC members, particularly The Seeker, the illness of the miners may be the first time a predecessor or a close relative of the Sars-Cov-2 virus may have infected humans. “WIV went on a years-long investigation into the same mine, on the lookout for what afflicted the miners,” The Seeker wrote on April 8.The clues the group has found has led it to suspect the WIV researchers were likely investigating the pathogen that caused the 2012 illness (and death) of the men who went into the abandoned mine, and one of the pathogens they isolated may have leaked from the lab at a later date. Viruses are typically isolated and grown in order to study them, a process that requires high levels of biosafety standards.In public, one of the lead researchers of WIV, Shi Zhengli, said the miners’ death and illness was due to a fungal infection but DRASTIC found evidence it may have been a Sars-like coronavirus.The illness of the miners caught the attention of the group when they found a Master’s thesis by a medical student in 2013, who described symptoms that are now associated with Covid-19. The thesis also described the illness as suspected to have been caused by a Sars-like coronavirus. A bulk of the clues the group found were in previous scientific papers and news reports – a technique often described as OSINT, or open source investigation. Chinese authorities have since restricted access to the CKNI database, where some of the crucial trails were found, Newsweek reported.Officials and scientists around the world are now increasingly agreeing on the need for China to offer more access and disclose more data. These include detailed information about the projects WIV was undertaking, the origins of another coronavirus known as RATG13, which the Chinese scientists said were found in bats in a cave hundreds of kilometres from Wuhan, and the nature of the illness of three WIV researchers who were hospitalised right before the first confirmed cases of Covid-19 took place.The debate over the origin of Sars-Cov-2 has ranged from it having evolved naturally, to being engineered -- with one scenario falling somewhere in between: that it leaked from the WIV where it was being studied after being found in bats.DRASTIC members also speak of overlapping genomic code snippets with other viruses for which Chinese experts have released the sequence, hypothesising the need to determine if the teams were carrying genetic modifications for further analysis.The search for evidence for a lab role has been difficult, as is the hunt for a motive if the origin of the pandemic indeed lies in a lab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-seeker-among-sleuths-who-raised-heat-on-lab-theory-101622838355301.html
05-06-2021||India||4-yr-old mauled to death by leopard in Kashmir||At around 7.40pm on Thursday, Adha Yasir’s parents heard a sharp cry.The four-year-old girl was playing on the lawn of her house in Jammu and Kashmir’s Budgam district. Her parents, who were in the house, and neighbours in Ompora Housing Colony remember the girl running about.The parents rushed out, only to find their daughter nowhere. They alerted the neighbours, the local police, and launched a massive search operation.Roughly one hour later, local residents found the girl’s necklace and slippers from the forest that surrounded the colony. “This raised suspicion that the girl was taken away by a leopard, which are common in the area,” said Ehsan Fazili, a neighbour.In the early hours of Friday, their fears came true. Police found Yasir’s mutilated body in the forest nursery located one kilometre from her house, said an official who was part of the search team.“After receiving the information, a police team, locals and the wildlife department constituted various teams to trace the girl. After massive searches, the teams recovered the mauled body of the girl from the nearby forest nursery. Preliminary investigation suggests that the girl has been attacked and mauled by some wild animal (probably a leopard), said senior superintendent of police (Budgam) Tahir Saleem.Local residents and politicians blamed the wildlife department for the death of the girl. “This is the nursery not the forest so they could have easily cleared trees from this place,” said Shabir Ahmad, another neighbour.Former minister and legislator Ruhullah Medhi termed the incident a case of “criminal negligence”. “Given the fact that incidents involving the same wild animals occurred multiple times in the recent months in areas as close to district collector’s office. People then were lucky, but this time this innocent little soul had to pay with her life,” he said.Budgam deputy commissioner Shabaz Mirza chaired a high level meeting with senior officials of police and forest department to decide on measures to prevent such incidents in the future, including immediate removal of fallen material trees from snow and bushes and other cultural operations (like removal of bushes) in Ompora forests and other areas.A spokesperson for the J&K administration assured action within two days.“DFO (Divisional Forest Officer) Budgam will immediately take steps for erection and strengthening of existing chain-link fencing at Ompora forests and will also submit DPR (detailed project report) to higher authorities for sanction of funds. He will also process the proposal/ case for sanction of thinning of the forest immediately. Wild life Warden Budgam will deploy staff well equipped with machinery for elimination of the wild animal (leopard), which has turned man-eater,” said the spokesperson, adding that the family of the deceased girl will also be compensated.DC Budgam Shabaz Mirza and SSP Tahir Saleem visited the house in the afternoon and assured them this type of incident wont be repeated and expressed condolences with the family.

The season of plenty is back but the usual joy and ecstasy are missing this time also_ everyone has a story of loss and gloom to share. Umbrella makers of Alapzuha are no exception_ they are bracing for another lost season. Umbrellas are not merely seasonal object that sprouts like a mushroom in the first spell of the monsoon and were once a symbol of status and part of fashion. When an academic session starts in the southern state a new umbrella is almost a right of every school-going child. True, usually this is the best time for umbrella makers they flood the market with innovative products and with a lot of advertisements and jingles to attract buyers but they are silent now no market, buyers or schools around they are in for another lean patch. But industry insiders say the online market is slowly picking up and it roughly forms 10 per cent of total sales. But they complain many online giants insist on the lowest price to make use of the dull patch. Alpha, known for its backwater tourism, is also famous for its umbrella. It is home to the country’s two popular brands, Poppy and John’s. Industry insiders say the umbrella market in the country is roughly between ₹800 crore to ₹1000 crore and it grows by ten per cent every year. But last two years there is negative growth due to the pandemic. Usually, the sale peaks from May to August but in the last two years virus has stolen their march. “I think the worst is over and we will bounce back soon. We have enough stocks piled up. Once the general trade picks up we can clear them. There is no point in talking about lost opportunities, we have to look forward,” said director of John’s Umbrella Mart Joseph A Thayyil. His company employs over 300 workers. Alappuzha has a long history of umbrella-making. In the 1940s Thayyil Abraham Varghese alias ‘Kuda Vavachan,’ a small-time merchant, started manufacturing an umbrella in a small way. In 1954 he founded St George Umbrella Mart with a dozen workers. After his death, his son Baby Thayyil took over the business. But later a split took place in the family and the brand ‘St George’ was frozen. Baby then started Poppy Umbrella Mart and his brother began John’s, Umbrella Mart. Now both are major players in the country. Baby Thayyil died last week following age-related ailments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-brings-little-joy-for-kerala-umbrella-makers-as-pandemic-casts-shadow-on-sales-101622834898188.html
05-06-2021||India||AIADMK united against Sasikala’s comeback attempt: Palaniswami||Chennai: The complications in AIADMK are deepening with three players- former chief ministers and party leader in state assembly, Edappadi Palaniswami, former deputy chief minister O Pannersevlam and ousted interim general secretary V K Sasikala, who is attempting to gnaw her way back --- play important roles in the drama, which is yet to unfold fully. Palaniswami on Friday said the AIADMK was “united” in not allowing any member of the Sasikala family back into the party days after audio clips of her speaking to partymen and assuring them that she would make a comeback leaked. “She (Sasikala) is not with the AIADMK. She stated before the elections that she was quitting politics. She is not talking to any AIADMK leader or cadre. She is only talking to the AMMK cadre. But some people are trying to create confusion in the AIADMK by using Sasikala,” Palaniswami told reporters in Chennai at the party headquarters after meeting party leaders. Pannersevlam was not present at the meeting although he was in Chennai.In response, Sasikala’s team shared with reporters more audio clips of her conversations with her supporters and attached their AIADMK membership cards. A telephonic conversation with S Anbu from Madurai and his AIADMK ID card was released.Sasikala is heard speaking to Anbu about how party founder MG Ramachandran and his successor and her close aide J Jayalalithaa ran a cadre-based party. “Some people failed to understand that this is a cadre-based party,” said Sasikala. “Cadre like you have been writing to me about your pain. I can clearly see that all you cadres are on my side. Amma said the party has to govern for a 100-years. Shouldn’t I protect that vision? I did my best before I left the next day at 11am (to prison in Bengaluru). For me, the party has to be good, cadre have to be happy. We have to work together to take forward what Amma left behind. That’s my only intention. This will surely happen. Soon, I will meet you all,” Sasikala could be heard telling Anbu.Anbu tells Sasikala that she believed Edappadi and he betrayed her to which Sasikala just smirked. Sasikala had picked Palaniswami to be chief minister after she was convicted in the disproportionate assets case and she too had to surrender in Bengaluru prison in February 2017. Palaniswami and Pannerselvam who were both Sasikala’s loyalists who turned against her at different times, united their warring factions and expelled her and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran who founded AMMK with her supporters. Palaniswami, who is the co-coordinator of the AIADMK and was recently made leader of the opposition (LoP, held a Covid-19 consultation meeting in the city Friday with his party’s district secretaries. Pannerselvam was absent. To this, Palaniswami dismissed that there was any rift between them and said that Pannerselvam had a housewarming ceremony to attend. He added that it wasn’t a formal meeting but he came to the party headquarters as it was an auspicious day. Palaniswami and Pannerselvam have been working independently so far from their native districts in Salem and Theni respectively. The duo always had tensions between them which came out in the open when Pannerselvam put up a fight twice and eventually gave in for Palaniswami to be the 2021 elections chief ministerial candidate and after their loss on May 2, to become the LoP. For the elections, the dual leadership put up a united front to keep Sasikala’s family away. However, Pannerselvam’s stance has always been softer on Sasikala’s re-entry into the party. The cracks in the dual leadership emerged as Pannerselvam has been feeling sidelined and less powerful compared to Palaniswami who has solidified his position in the party. “Channels of communication are open between Pannerselvam and Sasikala,” said a senior AIADMK leader who is a Pannerselvam supporter. “You can expect some announcements from us soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-united-against-sasikala-s-comeback-attempt-palaniswami-101622834659239.html

An additional amount of ₹500 crore would be spent to ensure related equipment and facilities for free vaccination, the minister announced. No new tax was suggested in view of the pandemic. Presenting the revised budget, Balagopal said the government would ensure food for all and would do everything possible to avert a third wave of the pandemic. He added that money would not be a constraint and that new sources of revenue would be found once the pandemic situation improved. “We will consider the concerns over the third wave of the pandemic. The health emergency existing is a challenge to the development prospects of the state,” he said. “Money won’t be a constraint in meeting the health needs of the people. We will do everything possible to avert a possible third wave,” he added.The previous government had allotted ₹20,000 crore which had been fully utilised to fight the pandemic, he said.From the new Covid-19 relief package, ₹2,800 crore was allocated for emergency health situations and ₹8,900 crore for distribution among those who lost their livelihood. An amount of ₹8,300 crore was announced towards interest subsidy for loans provided to various sectors to tide over the crisis. Besides this, the finance minister also announced a revival package for coastal areas and aid for the successful women-oriented poverty eradication programme ‘Kudumbhasree’. Balagopal’s predecessor T M Thomas Issac had presented a full budget in February and the one announced on Friday was a mere continuation of his proposals. “Those budget proposals will continue.We have made some additions to that considering the Covid-19 situation and to boost the economy of the state.Health is our priority, then food.After that we need to revive our economy and for that we need more jobs. In order to achieve that, our aim is to give thrust to the agriculture, industries, tourism, IT, knowledge economy sectors,” Balagopal told reporters later in the day. The minister said several foreign countries have vaccinated their people and their economies are open.“If people are vaccinated, tourists will show interest in visiting our state.If all are vaccinated at the earliest, we can revive our economy.For that purpose we have allocated ₹1,000 crore for vaccines and ₹500 crore for related purposes,” he said. The opposition called the budget a “sly jugglery of figures sans any substance.” “It is a mere jugglery of figures to hoodwink people. The government has made no fund allocation in the budget to boost the Covid-damaged economy. And it has no idea how to increase its revenue,” leader of the opposition in the state assembly V D Satheesan said. BJP state chief K Surendran termed the budget as a disappointment and said the state government was renaming and implementing the central projects.“The financial assistance of ₹20,000 crore package which was announced in the last year’s budget was repeated this time.....the finance minister should explain how much money was spent for what purpose from that package,” he said. The two main revenue earners of the state, liquor and lottery, are currently in limbo due to the pandemic. The state beverages corporation, which runs foreign-made Indian liquor outlets, had recently said that it had suffered a loss of ₹1,000 crore in the last two months. The state has been under lockdown since April 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-main-focus-in-kerala-s-revised-budget-101622834538632.html

A five-member team led by MD Suchitra Ella and executive director Sai Prasad were in the 100-acre facility which was established HLL Bio-Tech Ltd in 2012 under the union health ministry but final works are still pending. “They visited once a few years ago also. Today they came to see the current status. Nothing has been finalised yet,” said an official of HLL.The team had met Stalin in the secretariat on Thursday to discuss manufacturing vaccines in Tamil Nadu. This came in the backdrop of the union government informing Tamil Nadu that it intends to bring in a partner on its own to operationalise the IVC. Stalin had previously written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for the IVC to be handed over to the state on a lease so it can find a private operator and begin producing Covid-19 vaccines from the facility. The state had also sent two representatives to Delhi to speed up the matter. After the Centre’s reply, Stalin reiterated his request and said whoever finds a player operations have to start at the earliest so it can facilitate mass production of vaccines which are currently in shortage. Meanwhile, HLL had invited tenders for private players to participate which has now closed. “We are in talks with interested companies,” the official quoted above said.The Centre has invested around ₹700 crore for the IVC which is about 63 km from Chennai and has been lying unutilised for want of additional funds to complete the last stages of work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-visits-chengalpet-vaccine-complex-101622834538096.html

05-06-2021||India||Human race facing an existential crisis in Covid-19 pandemic: Delhi high court||“It would not be an exaggeration to say human race in general is facing an existential crisis” in the Covid-19 pandemic, said the Delhi High Court on Friday while expressing anguish over the way things have transpired in the second wave where vaccine shortage is hitting everyone even when the Central government says the best way to fight the pandemic is to vaccinate the entire population.The high court, which was dealing with the issue of Sputnik V vaccine, also said going by the rule book to save human lives in these extraordinary times may be in jeopardy and “one has to look at the bigger picture"."At this moment, flexibility and alacrity has to be the mantra,” and that the officers should not be afraid of audits and investigations and any officer who refused to act in the current pandemic may open himself to being charged for offences against human body, it said.These observations were made by the high court in the order on the issue related to manufacturing of Covid vaccine Sputnik V by India's Panacea Biotec in collaboration with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).While taking note of the fact that there have been a large number of coronavirus cases in India, a bench of Justices Manmohan and Najmi Waziri also expressed displeasure that "there is nothing to show that the government officers had handheld the Indian manufacturers of vaccine and acted as facilitators for use of this untapped infrastructure in India".“Today, we are a bit anguished with the way things have transpired during the second wave. As a responsible citizen you also would be anguished. Vaccine shortage is hitting each and everyone. Even today vaccine is not available in Delhi… You have good products in India, a little handholding will work,” the bench said.It added that someone from Russia has been able to locate infrastructure in Himachal Pradesh but the Centre has failed to do so.Coming on the issue of Sputnik V vaccine, the high court directed the Centre to release arbitral award of over ₹14 crore along with interest from 2012 to Panacea Biotec for manufacturing Sputnik V vaccine in India subject to the condition that the company obtains permission from the government to manufacture the vaccine.The bench said the release of the amount, awarded to the company by the arbitral tribunal, will also be subject to the undertaking of the firm that 20 per cent of its sale proceeds of Sputnik V will be deposited with the court’s registry till the awarded amount is secured.The high court’s order came on a plea of Delhi-based Panacea Biotec seeking to modify a July 2020 order, by which the firm had undertaken not to prosecute further the execution proceedings instituted by them in relation to an arbitral award, running into crores of rupees, passed in its favour and against the Centre.The company, in its fresh application, sought release of the arbitral award saying it needs funds at the earliest in the larger interest of humanity as it has already manufactured trial batches of Covid vaccine Sputnik V in collaboration with RDIF and the process of manufacturing scale-up batches is on.At the outset of the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the Prime Minister was one on one talking to other states and even the external affairs ministers was in touch with other countries for arranging vaccines and that the situation is being monitored at the highest level.The bench said in the absence of any documentary proof by the government and the specific denial by the company that it has not been entirely funded by RDIF, the court cannot presume that the firm is provided with fund by RDIF to facilitate manufacture of Sputnik V in India.The court made it clear that in this case it was not examining the government policy on procurement and distribution of Covidd-19 vaccines.It also took note that the Delhi government has been repeatedly making statements about shortage of vaccines at its centres, halting its vaccination drive.The court said from the company’s plea, it was apparent that there is a lot of untapped capacity by way of infrastructure for manufacture of the vaccine in the country.“However, there is nothing to show that the government officers had handheld the Indian manufacturers of vaccine and acted as facilitators for use of this untapped infrastructure in India. Even when a foreign fund is tapped into this untapped infrastructure to manufacture these vaccines, the officers despite being asked in advance have refused to ensure that the vaccines sought to be manufactured are made available for immediate use in India,” the bench said.The court said prima facie there was no justification for insisting bridge trials for domestic manufacture of a vaccine but not for the one manufactured abroad.The court also asked the Central government to consider Panacea's application seeking waiver of trial for Sputnik V which has already been approved for limited use, in accordance with the law.Additional Solicitor General Balbir Singh along with Central government standing counsel Rajesh Ranjan said clinical trials have not been waived off anywhere in the world, including India, but it has only been shortened from 10 -12 months to 8-10 weeks.Senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, representing Panacea Biotec, has said it has only got an advance amount from RDIF and it needs further funds to ramp up its production which has to be 100 million (10 crore) doses per year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/human-race-facing-an-existential-crisis-in-covid-19-pandemic-delhi-high-court-101622832741423.html

It was the second nuclear-powered attack submarine that India had taken on lease from that country.The submarine is returning to Russia as its lease period is learnt to be coming to an end, the people familiar with the development said.The first nuclear-powered submarine, also called Chakra, was taken in 1988 under a three-year lease from the then Soviet Union.Some pictures of INS Chakra returning to Russia came out on social media. However, there was no official comment on the matter.In 2019, India sealed a USD 3 billion deal with Russia for leasing another nuclear-powered attack submarine for the Indian Navy for a period of 10 years.Under the deal, Russia will have to deliver the Akula class submarine, to be known as Chakra III, to the Indian Navy by 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-navy-s-lone-nuclear-powered-attack-submarine-on-its-way-back-to-russia-101622832395344.html

Netizens took to Twitter to share pictures of a rainbow that formed after the showers.Strong winds of up to 60 km/hr swept through the national capital, the meteorological office said.The winds uprooted trees at 67 places in north Delhi, including Civil Lines, Shalimar Bagh and Paschim Vihar, and at 11 locations in south Delhi, including in Kalkaji and Nizamuddin West among others, officials said.Similar incidents were reported in east Delhi as well.It is likely to be the first time since 2014 that the city may not witness a heatwave in the summer season.No heatwave has been recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, considered the official marker for the city, till now.Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 39.5 degrees Celsius during the day, a notch below the season's average. The minimum temperature was recorded at 26.1 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal.Till 5.30 pm, the Safdarjung observatory had recorded 3.2 mm rainfall.Palam recorded a maximum temperature of 38.4 degrees Celsius and a minimum of 26.2 degrees Celsius along with 9.4 mm rainfall. A hailstorm was also reported at Palam at 5 pm.The Lodhi Road observatory received 1.6 mm rainfall and recorded a maximum temperature of 39 degrees Celsius and a minimum of 25.3 degrees Celsius.The strong winds added to the woes of farmers protesting at the Delhi borders against the Centre's three new farm laws."Around 100 tents have been affected and damaged due to the strong winds and rains. The protesters will spend the night inside trolleys, and the tents will be erected tomorrow (Saturday) morning," farmer leader Gurmeet Mehma said.Another farmer leader, Sarwar Singh Pandher, said food items have also been affected."It happens every time when this kind of a situation comes in front of us," he added.A senior police officer said several incidents of trees uprooting were reported in the national capital on Friday evening after the strong wind and rains."The municipal department was informed about it and the roads were later cleared for the traffic," he added.The weatherman has predicted partly cloudy skies with the possibility of very light rains/thundershowers on Saturday.The maximum and the minimum temperatures will likely hover around 39 degrees Celsius and 24 degrees Celsius respectively.On Thursday, the national capital recorded a high of 38.2 degrees Celsius, two notches below the normal, and a low of 24.4 degrees Celsius, three degrees below the normal temperature for this time of the year.

05-06-2021||India||Harsimrat Badal says Punjab govt profited from Covid vaccines, slams Rahul's 'silence'||Former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Friday lashed out at Congress government in Punjab over its order, which was later withdrawn, for providing one-time limited vaccine doses to 18-44 age group population through private hospitals and questioned "silence" of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on the issue.The Shiromani Akali Dal leader levelled corruption allegations against Capt Amarinder Singh government in Punjab and asked if his visit to Delhi was linked to the controversy over vaccine supply in the state."Was he summoned in Delhi to pay ransom to save his chair? These Congress leaders took a cut in uniforms, PPE kits, action for poor and now even vaccines weren't spared," she alleged.Badal, who is MP from Bathinda, targeted Rahul Gandhi for not tweeting about alleged "profiteering" by Punjab government over vaccination by private hospitals."Rahul Gandhi gives suggestions that poor should get vaccine free and when his party's government is getting a profit of ₹650 on each dose why is he silent. Did Rahul Gandhi tweet anything about it? If he is silent on this, this reeks of some settlement between the Captain and high command. If that's not the case he should change health minister, admonish CM and take action against the chief secretary," Harsimrat Kaur Badal told ANI.She accused the Punjab Chief Minister of giving clean chit to all those related to the controversy."You can take this in writing, if there is a judicial probe into this scam, there are chances of truth coming out. Otherwise everyone will be given a clean chit," she said.She said that Punjab government had withdrawn its order providing "one-time limited vaccine doses to 18-44 age group population through private hospitals" following huge furore."If this order was so good why did the government withdraw it? Where is the accountability? Chief Secretary tweeted like a salesperson of private hospitals stating that common people can avail vaccines at cost if ₹900 and ₹1200," she said."What is Punjab government's intention? Do they want to save poor peoples lives or they want to earn profit from vaccines meant for the poor? This is clear that they committed a scam by taking money from private hospitals and traded vaccines meant for the poor. They indulged in profiteering. After this scam came to light, they have taken the order (selling vaccines to private hospitals) back," she said.Badal also targeted Punjab Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu over his remarks that he was not involved in the vaccine procurement and distribution process and had nothing to do with the controversy. She said the minister should resign."Can a health minister wash off his hands from orders issued by his department? These circulars are being sent across the state and the health minister isn't even picking calls made to him. Does he mean that this scam was committed by the CM? Or he has no say in his department. If that is the case why doesn't he resign then?" she said.The SAD leader also questioned the silence of AAP over the controversy and accused the party of being B team of Congress. She said AAP has many Congress turncoats and few of them even returned to the party.The former union minister also slammed the Centre over its vaccination policy."The Centre has failed. When other nations were vaccinating their people, the Centre was showing its COVID friendship and was exporting vaccines. And now they are having a shortage of vaccines. Not just vaccines, oxygen and medicines too were in shortage. We earned a bad reputation worldwide for COVID deaths," she said.

Signed by officer on special duty Rajiv Verma, the three-page document was sent to all central ministries, public sector units, banks and autonomous bodies. “The Centre came up with such an order because it has failed on all fronts. This is an attempt to impose more control on government organisations and bureaucrats,” said TMC Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy.BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said, “This is a process to ensure that bureaucrats, who take the oath to protect the interests of the nation and follow the code of official secrecy in regard to state and national security, follow rules”.The order, which HT has seen, was issued two days after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee employed the state’s former chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay as her special adviser on May 31, the day he retired, amid a tussle with Centre. Bandopadhyay, who was given a three-month extension following an appeal by the state, but was asked to report for duty at the North Block office of the department of training and personnel on his last working day.Banerjee refused to release the bureaucrat and the Centre sent him a show cause letter, accusing him of violating Section 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, by not attending the meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Kalaikunda on May 28 to review damages done by Cyclone Yaas. Banerjee, accompanied by the bureaucrat, met Modi during the meeting, but left in a few minutes. Bandopadhyay joined duty on June 1 on a three-year contract and replied to the show cause letter on Thursday.The CVC, India’s apex anti-corruption body for government officials and which was formed in the mid-1960s, has said that accepting a job offer without completion of a mandatory cooling-off period will amount to “serious misconduct.”“It has been observed that sometimes government organisations... use the expertise of retired government officials by hiring them on contractual basis, in the capacity of advisor/consultant etc. There is no defined procedure for seeking vigilance inputs before engaging the retired officials…,” said the order, adding this may lead to situations where people with tainted past are engaged by a government organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmcslams-centre-over-making-cvc-nod-a-must-to-employ-exbureaucrats-101622831479655.html

State has a fiduciary duty to perform towards the citizens under Article 19(1)(g) and Article 21... and thus it becomes the bounden duty of a welfare State to secure the rights of livelihood of the citizens.”Directing the national carrier to reinstate over 41 permanent and contractual pilots, the judge said it is the duty of the state towards securing the livelihood of the citizens and nothing has been shown on record to show that the termination of the 41 pilots would be impacting their financial crunch.The services of the pilots were terminated last year on account of commercial slowdown in wake of the lockdown.“The financial difficulties expressed by the Respondent (Air India) only qua the Petitioners(41 pilots) and the adamancy in resisting to take them back, only reflects malice in the action of the Respondent, which to a large extent, is substantiated by the file notings,” the court said.“Tested on the anvil of the aforementioned principles of examining an action of a State or its Agency, this Court is compelled to conclude that the impugned action is violative of the well settled legal position and suffers from arbitrariness and unfairness and fails on the touchstone of Article 14...”The pilots had initially moved the court in July last year seeking directions to Air India to accept the withdrawal of the resignations tendered by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-sack-staff-citing-covid-19-delhi-hc-to-air-india-101622831479073.html
05-06-2021||India||Govt investigators sent to get Choksi return from Dominica||A team of government investigators sent to Dominica in a private jet last week to bring back fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi returned to India on Friday after it became clear that legal proceedings in the island’s courts may last several weeks.Publicly available flight data showed that the jet took off from Douglas-Charles airport in Dominica at 8.09pm local time on Thursday and was heading towards India via Madrid at the time of filing of this report. It is likely to land in New Delhi at 11pm on Friday. The investigators are on the flight, said people familiar with the developments.“We have a strong deportation case against Mehul Choksi in Dominica but the whole legal process will take time,” said an officer on condition of anonymity.The team -- comprising two Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officers and representatives from the ministry of external affairs -- was rushed along with a cache of documents on evidence against Choksi in a hired Bombardier Global 5000 jet of Qatar Executive last Friday.The officers were sent after Choksi, who fled India in 2018, was detained in Dominica on charges of illegally entering the island and Antigua Prime Minister Gaston Browne said the businessman should be deported directly to India.For about seven days, the jet was parked at the airport to bring back Choksi, who is wanted in a ₹13,500 crore bank fraud case. But the India-born businessman is currently involved in two separate legal proceedings in Dominica, pending which he cannot be repatriated, say experts.A magistrate’s court in the Dominican capital Roseau is hearing the government’s charge that Choksi entered the country illegally. It will be heard next on June 14.Last week, Choksi’s lawyers moved the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, alleging that he was abducted and asking him to be sent back to Antigua. That habeas corpus petition was adjourned on Thursday after judge Bernie Stephenson said she will decide the next date of hearing after meeting both sides.The Indian government felt the team was not required anymore and that foreign ministry officials based in the Caribbean can coordinate the legal formalities with Dominican authorities and the courts, said the people quoted above.The team, they said, already briefed Dominican authorities about the charges and evidence against Choksi, which will be argued by local government prosecutors on India’s behalf whenever the deportation case is taken up. India is not a party yet in either of the court hearings.Choksi approached the high court in Dominica seeking bail in “illegal entry” case. The HC has adjourned the matter to Tuesday.India is pushing for Choksi’s deportation from Dominica directly on the ground that he doesn’t enjoy any constitutional and legal protection there and has an Interpol red notice against him.His legal team approached the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court last week, alleging that he was abducted from Antigua, where he is a citizen, on May 23, tortured and brought to Dominica, roughly 100 nautical miles away.A person with knowledge of developments said three Indian officials and a lawyer, who appeared to have been hired by India, attended Choksi’s bail hearing in the magistrate’s court on Thursday.The whole episode has already taken a political colour in the region, with opposition parties in both countries – Antigua & Barbuda as well as Dominica targeting the respective prime ministers for violating the law of the land.Browne has repeatedly said he will not accept Choksi back and that Dominica should send him back to India. Dominica, however, has not made it clear if it is keen to send Choksi directly to India.India said on Thursday that it was making all efforts to bring back the fugitive. “He (Choksi) is currently in the custody of Dominica with some legal proceedings underway. We will continue to make all efforts to ensure he is brought to back India,” foreign ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-investigators-sent-to-get-choksi-return-from-dominica-101622830157933.html
05-06-2021||India||Lioness dies of Covid, tiger too suspected victim||A 9-year-old lioness, Neela, died in the Arignar Anna Zoological Park or Vandalur Zoo outside Chennai on Thursday after a Covid-19 outbreak among Asiatic lions was reported, the Tamil Nadu government said on Friday. A tiger is also suspected to have died of Covid in a Ranchi zoo on Thursday night.Nine of 13 lions in Vandalur Zoo were tested for the virus a few days ago.“A few of the lions were symptomatic and one of them, a 9-year-old lioness, Neela, succumbed to the disease,” a forest department statement said. A statement from the zoo earlier in the day said the lioness had been asymptomatic and showed nasal discharge on June 2 and was treated symptomatically immediately.The forest department said other lions have been quarantined and senior vets from the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (TANUVAS) are supervising treatment, which has started with antibiotics and prophylactic drugs.At Ranchi’s Bhagwan Birsa Biological Park, a 10-year-old tiger died showing Covid symptoms such as fever on Thursday night, officials said on Friday, adding that a rapid antigen test indicated the animal did not have a Covid-19 infection and the big cat’s samples were being sent for advanced testing. The park, which now has nine tigers, has procured kits to test all the carnivores for Covid.“...we are sending the swab, blood samples and [a] lung [of the tiger] to IVRI [Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly] for more detailed investigation and to find out if the animal was infected with any coronavirus-like disease,” said OP Sahu, a veterinary doctor at the park. Sahu added the tiger’s blood test suggested liver and kidney infection and that the rapid antigen test was conducted on Friday morning.Rapid antigen tests have been found to be less accurate than the polymerase chain reaction tests, which are considered the gold standard for detecting Covid-19. The RT-PCR test results are expected to come by Saturday.Officials said the tiger had a fever on Tuesday which subsided after medication. On Wednesday, the tiger did not eat well. “It did not eat at all on Thursday. Then, we called an expert from Ranchi Veterinary College and a vet from Tata Zoo. We also consulted vets in Hyderabad. The animal was given saline. But it could not survive,” said the park’s director, YK Das. Das said the tiger was genetically weak. “It was suffering from health issues. Its liver and kidney were comparatively weak.”Eight Asiatic lions at the Hyderabad zoo tested positive for Covid-19 in May. It was the first such instance in the country and prompted the Centre to order the closure of all national parks, sanctuaries, and national zoological parks. The lions were isolated and have since recovered while similar cases have been reported from other parts of the country.According to the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention, there is currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading Covid-19 to humans.It said in an advisory on its website that more studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by Sars-CoV-2, and that Covid-19 can spread from people to animals in some situations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lioness-dies-of-covid-tiger-too-suspected-victim-101622830097888.html
05-06-2021||India||Parliament entitled to override SC judgments: AG Venugopal||The Supreme Court on Thursday saw an interesting debate on the power of the legislature to pass laws to override judgements of the apex court, which saw this as undesirable -- a view opposed by the government’s top law officer . The discussion came in a case related to the appointment of members of tribunals, and that it was about a larger issue than just the case at hand was made further clear when Attorney General KK Venugopal submitted a note to the court that said that unless there is violation of fundamental rights or any constitutional provision is violated, courts should not interfere in matters that fall within the executive policymaking domain. He pointed out that Parliament in its wisdom enacts a law after broad consultation among standing committees and expert groups to decide what is in public interest.The bench told Centre, “this is not a game of numbers” reminding the AG that just because Parliament has standing committees, it cannot be a ground to prevent Courts from striking down a law.The exchange comes in the context of the Supreme Court saying last week (in an order on the government’s management of Covid-19) that the Constitution does not see courts as being spectators when the rights of citizens are affected by executive policies -- a response to the governments submission in an affidavit that the “wisdom of the executive should be trusted”.Experts said that given the context of what has been happening -- earlier this week, the court termed the government’s vaccine policy for the 18-45 years age group arbitrary and sought to understand the logic behind it -- such exchanges may continue.The case in question was a petition challenging the validity of a Central Ordinance prescribing tenure, age of retirement and conditions of service of members of Tribunals under the Tribunals Reforms (Rationalization and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021. The ordinance reduced the tenure of chairpersons and members of tribunals to four years instead of the five. Another bone of contention was how the ordinance retrospectively dealt with heads and members of tribunals appointed prior to its passing on April 4.Parliament also went against orders of the Court which allowed lawyers with 10 years of experience to become members of tribunals and said only those over 50 could become members of chairpersons, defeating the intention of the SC to infuse fresh talent. There were other areas of challenge to the ordinance raised in the petition filed by Madras Bar Association. The amicus curiae and senior advocate Arvind Datar summed up the petition and said the executive order was a clear attempt to “override” the Court.Responding to this, Venugopal said SC’s decisions were not based on any existing law. His argument was that if courts found that five years was a reasonable tenure, then Parliament was well within its rights to decide that four years was better.The bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat did not agree. “This Court has struck down the rules relating to the tenure of four years, sending a panel of 2 to 3 candidates per post in the past. If you are bringing them again and again are you not overruling the judgment by way of legislation?”Venugopal said that it was not correct “to proceed on the basis that Parliament is helpless and has to accept Supreme Court judgments.” “Courts can pass any number of judgments. The Parliament can always say that we will not accept it because it is not in the interest of people…. Parliament is entitled to override the judgment of the Supreme Court, within the contours of what is permitted,” he said.The bench reserved judgment on the petition challenging the ordinance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parliament-entitled-to-override-sc-judgments-ag-venugopal-101622829738436.html

Singh shared his government’s achievements, progress on the implementation of 85% of poll commitments, his road map for unfulfilled promises and report card of his ministers.The committee, which has All India Congress Committee (AICC) incharge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former Delhi MP Jai Prakash Agarwal as its other members, asked the chief minister about unfulfilled poll promises, his lack of accessibility and “over dependence” on the bureaucracy, and he responded to each point raised by party leaders. He carried dossiers on land deals and interests in mining and liquor businesses of some party MLAs and other leaders, according to the people cited above.The chief minister, who was to meet the panel at 11am, reached 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road, on time and before Rawat and Agarwal arrived. After the meeting, he said the meeting was routine introspection before the elections that are six months away.“These are inner-party discussions and I do not propose to share them with you,” he told reporters.However, Rawat, who was more forthcoming, said the chief minister was asked about the challenges and problems faced by party leaders and his (CM’s) road map to deal with them before the polls. He said the committee also took up the sacrilege issue that was raised by several party leaders.“We can understand the sensitivity of their sentiments, and the CM understands it better than us. He spoke about the administrative and legal steps being taken. I am hopeful that in the next few days, results will be seen,” he said.Rawat was clear that there was no talk of an alternative, adding that only the Congress president was authorised to speak on this.Though he refused to comment, there are indications that the party may appoint more than one deputy chief minister, bringing former minister Navjot Sidhu back into the state cabinet and appointing a new state unit chief as part of the peace formula.Singh was open to inducting Sidhu, who quit the state cabinet in 2019 as minister, but has opposed appointing him as the state unit president, a post that the cricketer-turned-politician wants because it will put him in charge of the party in the state.“It was suggested to Capt saab a few months ago to appoint Sidhu and a Dalit leader as deputy CMs. At one stage, he agreed but then changed his mind and nothing happened,” a senior state unit leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-appears-before-cong-panel-defends-his-style-of-functioning-101622829737873.html
05-06-2021||India||Need to buy time till a majority of population is vaccinated: Centre||People will need to be particularly vigilant and states will have to be careful while lifting restrictions as long as India does not have adequate vaccine coverage, top government officials said on Friday, urging citizens and regional authorities to “buy time” in the fight against Covid-19.The remarks, made by Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul come at a time when cities such as Delhi and Mumbai are considering lifting some restrictions after a devastating wave of infections that began in March-April before it eventually crushed the health care capacity.“We need to buy time till we, at the soonest possible time, are able to vaccinate a large population, and in the meanwhile continue to enforce the tools: testing, tracking, isolation, self-discipline, wearing mask, avoiding gathering, avoiding parties, eating together in large groups, and so on,” said Paul, at a Covid-19 briefing on Friday.“If we behave appropriately, we will be gradually pushing the wave away, and there is a good possibility that there will be no next wave. What I am trying to say is that we have to buy time; and we want to buy time particularly to ensure that we achieve a high coverage of our vaccination. That is the time we want to buy; and that is the duration of intense discipline that we want to exercise. And that is my appeal today,” he added.Paul also said that globally, India was better placed in terms of Covid-19 numbers, and this was a result of strong actions taken by the people at every level. “Please appreciate what is working, which is that we are now back to wearing masks more diligently. What is working is that testing is more generous; we have imposed restrictions in many districts that has made it difficult for the virus to spread. There are no crowds, there are no large gatherings; this is the price we pay but this is what has resulted in containing the pandemic,” he said.“The connotation is when we will reverse this process the situation can again become unacceptable, and that is something we have to keep in mind. If our discipline, and if our containment measures, our vaccination scale up; our preparedness slackens again then the situation can again lead to a difficult phase,” Paul added.In terms of vaccinations, global data shows the number of people who received at least one dose of vaccine, India has administered 172 million (17.2 crore) doses, which is more than the US that has administered 169 million (16.9 crore) doses, and the UK has administered 39.5 million (3.95 crore), Paul said.As for the 60 plus population, India has administered at least one dose of the vaccine to 43% of the target population, and it is 37% for those in the 45 years old and above category, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-buy-time-till-a-majority-of-population-is-vaccinated-centre-101622829677812.html
05-06-2021||India||SII gets DCGI’s nod to manufacture Sputnik||The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Friday granted permission to Serum Institute of India (SII) to manufacture Sputnik V, which will allow the production of doses for testing.“The company applied for a test license which has been granted,” confirmed an official in the government familiar with the development, asking not to be named. The actual manufacturing of the vaccine will take time.A test license, as per the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) website, is granted for the import of small quantities of drugs for the purposes of examination, testing or analysis. SII has been given permission to manufacture Sputnik V for the purpose of analysis. The company sought grant of license on Wednesday. The company in its response also said that it has only got preliminary approvals at the moment. “The preliminary permissions are in place. The production will take time. It will take few months,” said a company spokesperson.Sputnik V is currently being distributed in India by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, which signed a pact with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which globally markets the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute.As part of the deal, Dr Reddy’s will distribute the first 250 million doses of Sputnik V. RDIF has also tied up with six other local companies to manufacture its vaccine, and its chief executive officer, Kirill Dmitriev, said earlier that it was also in talks with other manufacturers to ramp up production in India that is likely to start sometime in July.As per current estimates, RDIF is looking at a production capacity of about 850 million Sputnik V vaccine doses per annum from India. Apart from SII, the companies with which it has entered manufacturing tie up include Hetero Biopharma, Gland Pharma, Stelis Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, and Virchow Biotech.RDIF, in a statement on May 24, announced that Panacea Biotec launched the production of Sputnik V in India.“The first batch produced at Panacea Biotec’s facilities at Baddi will be shipped to the Gamaleya Center for quality control. Full-scale production of the vaccine is due to start this summer. Company’s facilities comply with GMP standards and are prequalified by WHO,” the RDIF statement said. Sputnik V was registered in India under the emergency use authorisation on April 12, 2021, and vaccination against Covid-19 started on May 14 under pilot project.According to Dr Reddy’s Labs, they will soon be launching the vaccine in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-gets-dcgi-s-nod-to-manufacture-sputnik-101622829617919.html
05-06-2021||India||Green law to push infra will hit environment hard, fear experts||The environment ministry is working on a radical change to the country’s environmental law regime, including changes in the important Wildlife Protection Act 1972, senior environment ministry officials said. The move comes amidst concerns among activists and environment groups that the changes are being made to make it easier to develop infrastructure and industrial projects -- even in environmentally sensitive areas.The ministry’s wildlife division has prepared a Cabinet note to amend the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, which is yet to be cleared by the Cabinet; a similar note on the amendment to Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 has also been finalised after circulating it internally among ministries. The FC Act amendment has been finalised with inputs from ministries. The first draft was cleared and is ready to be sent for Cabinet nod, ministry officials said.On April 8, the ministry called for expression of interest from consulting and law firms to prepare a new draft amendment to the Indian Forest Act, 1927. Meanwhile, a private law firm is preparing a draft environmental management act which will subsume the Air Act 1981, Water Act, 1974, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and serve as an overarching law for all infrastructure and industry projects. This will also cover regulations of the coastal areas and islands through the Coastal Regulation Zone provisions.RP Gupta, secretary at the ministry did not reply to HT’s questionnaire or calls seeking comment. A senior environment ministry official said on condition of anonymity that the idea is to “streamline processes and to remove any ambiguity in provisions. This will make the job easy for everyone.”The amendment in the FC Act, for instance, will mainly focus on finalising the definition of forests. The SC in 1996 in the T N Godavarman Thirumalpad Vs Union of India & Ors case held that the word ‘forest’ must be understood according to its dictionary meaning. It also said that irrespective of whether an area is a forest as per revenue records, it will be covered by the FC Act, and cannot be used for any non-forestry activity without the Centre’s permission if it meets the dictionary meaning.“To avoid any further confusion, we will ensure that states which haven’t yet recognised forests as per dictionary meaning do so immediately and those that have can finalise the area accordingly. It will also clarify that plantation on non-forest land will not be recognised as forest in future. They are a totally different category and can be harvested by people who have planted them. This will also facilitate plantations,” the official cited above added.It isn’t known what changes have been suggested in the wildlife law. “A Cabinet note will be submitted soon where the ministry’s objectives have been summarised,” a second official said on condition of anonymity.“ A cautious, democratic and ambitious environmental agenda is the way forward to uphold social justice as reduce risk to business. Instead, the government has floated at least one legal change every month that is regressive, will increase resource conflicts and will not help defend ecological vulnerabilities. Most of these legal amendments have been designed in close door expert meetings, or instructed through office orders. They look to extract rather than protect the environment,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.Earlier this year, when the second wave of Covid-19 was ravaging the country, the environment ministry issued some contentious circulars. In a letter dated March 22 to additional chief secretary (forest)/ principal secretary (forest) of all state governments and Union territories, the ministry stated that a state government/UT administration will not impose any additional condition on infrastructure projects after in-principle approval has been accorded by the Centre. Independent experts say the move will further centralise powers to monitor infrastructure projects and constrain state government’s decision-making in issues related to forest and wildlife conservation.Last month, the ministry made provisions to expedite forest clearances for “critical infrastructure projects” in Left-wing extremism (LWE)-hit districts and those related to defence and security in border areas by delegating them to the regional offices of the ministry and making clearances time bound. Decisions on major projects such as granting terms of reference (TOR) for a township and area development project proposal on the Great Nicobar Island which is likely to impact turtle and megapode nesting sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-law-to-push-infra-will-hit-environment-hard-fear-experts-101622829317861.html
05-06-2021||India||India clears ₹43,000 crore project to build 6 high-tech submarines||The defence ministry on Friday cleared a project worth ₹43,000 crore for building six advanced submarines in the country under the government’s “strategic partnership” (SP) model to bolster the Indian Navy’s underwater force levels and counter the rapid expansion of China’s submarine fleet, officials familiar with the development said.The defence acquisition council (DAC), India’s apex procurement body headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh, approved the proposal on Friday and the navy is soon expected to issue requests for proposal (RFP) for the programme, called P-75 India, the officials said.The new submarines are part of the 30-year submarine-building programme approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security in 1999.This is a landmark approval as it is the first case being processed under the SP model, the defence ministry said in a statement.“This would be one of the largest ‘Make in India’ projects and will serve to facilitate faster and more significant absorption of technology and create a tiered industrial ecosystem for submarine construction in India. From a strategic perspective, this will help reduce current dependence on imports and gradually ensure greater self-reliance,” the statement said.The SP model envisages indigenous manufacturing of major defence platforms by an Indian strategic partner who will collaborate with a foreign original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to set up production facilities in the country.In January 2020, the defence ministry cleared two Indian and five foreign shipbuilders to take part in P-75I.The Indian strategic partners cleared to collaborate with the foreign OEMs are Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited and L&T. The foreign yards they can team up with for the project are the French Naval Group, German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems, Russia’s Rubin Design Bureau, Spain’s Navantia and South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Company.Also Read | Indian Navy approaches defence ministry for Predator drone acquisitionThe new submarines will be equipped with air independent propulsion (AIP) systems that will enable the vessels to stay underwater for longer periods and enhance their combat capabilities, the statement said.With P-75I being cleared, the country has taken a step forward towards achieving the goals of its 30-year submarine construction programme, the defence ministry said.The navy plans to operate a fleet of 18 new conventional submarines and six nuclear-powered boats. The government approved the plan to build six nuclear-powered submarines in 2015, tweaking the 1999 submarine-building programme.“The availability of new technologies and advanced manufacturing capabilities to the industry will be an important step towards enhancing the nation’s quest for self-reliance in modern conventional submarine construction,” the statement said.The project will take time to mature and if all goes well, the first submarine will be delivered to the navy not before 10 years, officials said.The ministry will take the new project forward by issuing RFPs to the shortlisted Indian strategic partners who will then respond with techno-commercial offers in collaboration with one of the shortlisted OEMs. In exceptional cases, rules allow the Indian strategic partner to submit techno-commercial offers in collaboration with two OEMs.The next steps in the long process will involve opening and evaluation of technical offers, trials, staff evaluation, opening of commercial offers of companies technically compliant with the RFP and finally, the selection of the strategic partner with the lowest bid.A minimum of 45% indigenisation has to be ensured by the strategic partner in P-75I, officials familiar with the project said.The strategic partner will also ensure that the sixth submarine has a minimum indigenous content of 60%, they added.“There is an incentivisation model for specific equipment and systems under the hull, engineering and electrical heads wherein achieving indigenous content between 70% and 100% will ensure that an incentive of 5% to 20% of the equipment/system cost is paid to the strategic partner as a reward,” said one of the officials cited above.He added that a two-contract model is envisaged in P-75I -- one contract between defence ministry and the strategic partner, and the second one involving the foreign collaborator.In August 2018, DAC cleared a project under the SP model for building 111 naval utility helicopters (NUH) to replace the navy’s outdated fleet of French-designed Chetak choppers. But there has been no forward movement in the NUH project worth ₹21,738 crore.DAC on Friday cleared another project worth ₹6,000 crore for air defence guns and ammunition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-clears-rs-43-000-cr-project-to-build-6-high-tech-submarines-101622799616611.html
