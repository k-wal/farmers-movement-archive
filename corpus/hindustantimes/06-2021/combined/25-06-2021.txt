25-06-2021||Mumbai||Post second wave: Mumbai airport sees slight increase in passenger traffic in June||As the impact of the second wave has decreased across the country, Mumbai airport has seen a slight uptick in passenger traffic. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), in the first 20 days of June surged past the total passenger volume of May. According to data sourced from CSMIA, total passenger traffic from June 1 to June 22 crossed 4.65 lakhs as compared to 4.34 lakhs in May. Passenger footfall had started declining after the impact of the second wave of Covid-19 was largely seen in the country. According to booking.com, Mumbai is the second city to see more travellers after Delhi in June. Thomas Cook and SOTC too said that a large number of Indians have resumed travel in June, resulting in more passenger traffic across the country.A Mumbai airport official said, “We are happy to see more footfalls this month as compared to May when the passenger traffic drastically fell.” As lockdown restrictions have begun to ease, data from Booking.com reflected consumer travel optimism with Indian travellers searching for destinations that can be safely explored during the monsoon months. CSMIA spokesperson confirmed the rise in passenger traffic and said, “The number of passenger traffic had fallen down from 1,041,110 in April to 434,680 in May. However, until June 22, the passenger traffic was noted to be 465,470. As a result of the increasing passenger footfall, air traffic at CSMIA too has risen from around 200 flights per day to around 350 flight movements per day.”Booking.com said their research was conducted among a sample of adults (28,042 respondents across 28 countries, including India) who are planning to travel in the next 12 months. “Respondents completed an online survey in January 2021, “Around 72% of Indian travellers say that travel is more important to them now than it was before the pandemic. New Delhi emerged as the top destination booked by Indian travellers travelling domestically, followed by Lonavala and Mumbai,” said Ritu Mehrotra, regional manager, South Asia at Booking.com Recent ‘Back to Travel’ research by Booking.com found 68% Indian travellers stated that not being able to travel extensively in 2020 has made them yearn for travel even more in 2021. The research also mentions that 70% Indian travellers have used the increased time at home to plan future travel while 64% have banked more vacation days, so are excited about the potential of taking longer vacations in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/post-second-wave-mumbai-airport-sees-slight-increase-in-passenger-traffic-in-june-101624645375475.html
25-06-2021||Mumbai||Cross country study finds link between air pollution and Covid-19||Areas with poor air quality and higher emissions of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 are more likely to have Covid-19 infections and related deaths, according to a joint study by four institutes across the country. This is the first time that a pan-India study has found a direct correlation between air pollution and Covid-19. Statistical analysis established that there was a significant correlation between Covid-19 cases and PM2.5 concentrations in all states in India, with a correlation coefficient of 0.66. The correlation coefficient for PM2.5 concentrations and deaths resulting from Covid-19 was 0.61. In statistics, a correlation coefficient above 0.5 means the two data sets have a compelling correlation to each other. The study titled ‘Establishing a link between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) zones and Covid-19 over India’ based on anthropogenic emission sources and air quality data was published in the peer-reviewed journal Urban Climate on June 10. The study was conducted by scientists from Utkal University, Bhubaneswar; Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, National Institute of Technology Rourkela; School of Earth, Ocean and Climate Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar. It was partially funded by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the Government of India. “We have done a statistical analysis to see if there is any correlation between district-level air pollution data and Covid-19 cases. While there are some studies in Europe to find a correlation between the two data sets, in India there have been no prior studies to understand these correlations. Our findings suggest a significant correlation between the district level air pollution data and Covid-19 cases. We found that regions with huge amounts of fossil fuel such as petrol, diesel, and coal etc. combustion in transport and industrial activities, also experiences a lot more Covid-19 cases,” said Saroj Kumar Sahu, lead author of the study and assistant professor at Utkal University. The study involves three kinds of data sets—National Emission Inventory (NEI) of PM2.5 for 2019, developed by the scientists; a number of Covid-19 positive case and corresponding death as of November 5, 2020, adopted from the government of India website and air quality index data (in-situ observations) collected for 16 stations across the country. The scientists divided specific areas into different hotspot zones across India. From 36 states, 16 districts were picked for the study, including Mumbai and Pune. Maharashtra recorded the second-highest emission load- 828.3 Gigagram per year (Gg/Yr) of PM2.5, after Uttar Pradesh which recorded 1138.08 Gg/year, according to the National Emission Inventory developed by the scientists. ‘Between March and November 2020, Maharashtra recorded 17.19 lakhCovid-19 cases, which was the highest in the country. “However it is important to note that in terms of PM2.5 emission per person, Maharashtra is ahead of Uttar Pradesh,” said Sahu. Among the 16 cities captured in the study, Mumbai and Pune recorded the third and fourth highest ‘bad air quality days’ respectively. For Mumbai, out of a total of 165 bad air quality days, 22 were very poor. Pune recorded a total of 117 bad air quality days. Parallelly, Mumbai recorded 2.64 lakh Covid-19 cases and 10,445 deaths during the period studied, which was the highest in the country while Pune recorded 3.38 lakh Covid-19 cases and 7,060 deaths. The transport and industrial sector was the major PM2.5 contributor in Maharashtra and correlated with a rise in Covid-19 cases. “What is worrying is that there is evidence that the novel coronavirus sticks to fine particles like PM2.5 allowing them to move from one part to another by making the airborne transmission of Covid-19 more effective. Through our analysis, it has become clear that rising pollution load is becoming more of a catalyst to aggravate the Covid-19 cases,” said Sahu, adding that polluted hotspots are also triggering long-term effects and more studies are needed to understand this. Apart from Mumbai and Pune, the study also found that two other hotspots -Nagpur and Chandrapur - in Maharashtra witnessed high pollution as well as higher Covid-19 cases and casualties. Gufran Beig, senior scientist and founder project director, System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and co-author of the paper said that at hotspots within Maharashtra exposure to daily air pollution can make a person’s lungs weak. “When human-induced emissions are added combined with the double impact of the Covid-19 virus, the damage to lungs will be much faster and worsen health conditions,” said Beig. The study found that all the districts where cases of Covid-19 crossed 20,000 recorded emissions more than 200 Gg/yr of PM2.5. “It confirms that sources of the tiny particle are fossil fuel and mostly dominated in developed and urban places,” said the study. Sahu said the study results will help slow down the spread of the virus by providing more preventive steps and resources in areas with high pollution levels for present situations as well as for future possibilities. Among solutions, the study highlighted that there was a need to adopt cleaner technology, better transport emission norms like Bharat Stage (BS) VI at the earliest, and ensure better coal technology like ultra-supercritical power plants to reduce particulate emissions. Ashok A Shingare, member secretary, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, who was not a part of the study said, “By and large we are aware that if there are more pollutants in the air, there is a predominance of more pneumatic diseases in those regions. Considering the Covid-19 impacts the pulmonary system, there has to be and is a clear correlation for health ailments emerging out of both air pollution and Covid-19. Keeping the transport sector as the major source of air pollution in Mumbai and Pune, we have leapfrogged from BS-4 to BS-6 but implementation and adoption of these new vehicles are lacking. There is a need for building more awareness and to keep economics in mind for faster adoption of BS 6.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cross-country-study-finds-link-between-air-pollution-and-covid19-101624645315485.html

25-06-2021||Mumbai||80-yr-old is Maharashtra’s first Delta plus victim||An 80-year-old woman from Ratnagiri became the first Covid-19 patient with Delta plus variant (AY.1) to succumb to the infection in the state. The senior citizen died on June 13 and her genome sequencing report, which identified her as infected with AY.1, was submitted to the state health department on June 20. Health experts have raised concerns over the delay in submission of genome sequencing reports, which is critical for early detection of Covid-19 variants. The Delta plus variant is a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of Sars-CoV-2 that was detected in Maharashtra during the second wave. The union health ministry on Tuesday categorised the Delta-plus variant of Covid-19, as a ‘variant of concern’. The octogenarian patient along with her son contracted Covid-19 in the last week of May. She was admitted to the district civil hospital on May 31 on testing positive. The deceased individual was a psychiatry patient who was also undergoing treatment at the civil hospital at Ratnagiri. Later, she was referred to a dedicated care hospital, where she was undergoing treatment for Covid-19 treatment in a separate psychiatric department. “The patient died before we could get her genome sequencing report. She was declared dead on June 13 and her report that confirmed the presence of Delta-plus was submitted on June 20,” said Dr Sanghamitra Gawde, civil surgeon of Ratnagiri. Dr Archana Patil, Maharashtra director of health service said that they are still collecting information about the deceased patient including if she had Covid-19 vaccines. Following this, the state health department has instructed district officials to keep an eye on the remaining 20 recovered patients. As per the state health ministry, a total 21 number of Delta-plus variant cases have been found in the state. At Ratnagiri, nine samples were identified with the Delta-plus variant— the highest in the state, followed by Jalgaon, Mumbai, Palghar, Thane and Sindhudurg districts. Concerns This is not the first case where the genome sequencing reports of a Covid-19 positive patient have been submitted late. A 78-year-old female from the eastern suburb of Mumbai contracted Covid-19 along with her eight family members in April. Her blood samples were collected in the third week of April for genome sequencing. But the report was submitted to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) only on June 22. She was the first Covid-19 patient diagnosed with the Delta-plus variant in the city. “The patient and her family members have recovered completely. But considering the samples were sent in April when the pandemic curve was at its peak, it was essential to submit the report at the earliest. It would have helped us to understand how transmissible the Delta-plus is and how much it contributed in the second wave,” said a senior officer from BMC’s health department. Public health experts and doctors said sequencing and early detection of new variants are needed. It could provide essential information that can help in better planning of anti-Covid containment plans. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, had raised a similar issue. That’s when they decided to start genome sequencing in the civic-run Kasturba Hospital. “On a daily basis, we sent samples for genome sequencing through random selections. But often, the reports come after 20-30 days. So, to avoid such delays, we sought permission from the central government to start genome sequencing at Kasturba Hospital which will help us in getting the reports within days,” he said. In view of the rise in infections across the state in March-April, the state in April signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) to undertake genome sequencing of 4,000 positive swab samples. Some private laboratories said they should also be allowed to do genome sequencing that may help in producing data in bulk which would help in providing information about mutation of the virus, possibly adaptation to the available vaccines, and the epidemiological characteristics of the new variants that are travelling across geographies. “We have known how the Delta variant of Sars-Cov-2 was more transmissible that contributed to the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases across the country. So we need to generate data in bulk and share in real time to understand how it is influencing the spread of the virus among the population,” said a senior officer from a private laboratory in Mumbai. As per the report submitted by the central government on Friday, a total of 45,000 samples have been sequenced in India. Of these, 48 of them have been found positive of Delta-Plus variant, 20 of them are from Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/80yrold-is-maharashtra-s-first-delta-plus-victim-101624645016086.html

The Maharashtra government decided that a common entrance test (CET) will be conducted for admission to first year junior college (FYJC), or Class 11. The Class 10 board examination was cancelled due to a surge in Covid cases. According to officials, the syllabus for the CET will be from the Maharashtra State board. Questions will be asked on Mathematics, English, Science and Social Science. The SET will be conducted offline and will have Multiple Choice Questions in the optical mark recognition (OMR) format.Nisha Channe, a student of Class 10, said that the process is fair.“I am happy with the CET. Students can apply and attempt if they are not happy with their final marks. Also, since the CET will be just for 100 marks the students have to spend a lot less time while attempting the examination. As of now, Covid cases have reduced, so students will be safe,” said Channe.Students who attempt the CET will be given a preference for admissions for Class 11. The remaining vacant seats will be allotted to students who have not taken the CET. The CET is likely to be held July-end or August first week, as per the education department. Students can choose to fill the form after their results are declared. Prathmesh Kulkarni, a student of class 10, said that as the CET is based on the state board syllabus, it may affect the score of CBSE students.“As preference for admission will be for students who attempt CET, it will be important for those who want a good college to attempt the paper,” said Kulkarni.While there is no examination fee for SSC students, CBSE and CISCE students attempting the SET will have to pay an enrolment fee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cet-admissions-for-class-11-welcomed-by-class-10-students-across-all-boards-101624644955487.html

Due to Covid, organ transplants were halted at the institute for some time. The aim is to resume these services after things normalise, said Prof RK Dhiman, director, PGI.“Organ transplant will now get a major boost in Uttar Pradesh. We have set up a State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) for the purpose. People can easily donate organs and get organ transplant after contacting the hospital administration. They will also be able to donate organs of brain-dead patients,” he added.Despite having the best of faculty and facilities, the PGI has a dismal record when it comes to liver transplant. The last such procedure was done on January 24, 2019. The transplant was of a nine-year-old boy Suhail, a resident of Bahraich, who didn’t survive. In all, 16 out of 19 patients who went to the PGI for liver transplant didn’t survive.However, things changed when Professor RK Dhiman joined the institute as director. A hepatologist, Dr Dhiman is known for his role in starting liver transplant at PGI Chandigarh. And he did exactly the same in Lucknow. He formulated a plan to start liver transplant at the institute. He made a team of surgeons and sent them for training to the ILBS. Four surgeons, one hepatologist, a radiologist, two anaesthesia experts and a pathologist completed training at the ILBS.He said, “Lucknowites have to travel to Delhi or other places for getting a liver transplant. But soon, Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) will start liver transplantation services.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lucknows-sgpgi-to-start-liver-transplantation-services-after-two-and-a-half-years-101624644775949.html

UP is the highest wheat producing state that alone contributes around one-fourth of the country’s total wheat production. But the state still lags far behind Punjab, MP and Haryana – the top three wheat buyers. As per the data released by the central government on Wednesday, the country’s total wheat procurement, as on June 22, stood at 432.19 lakh metric tonnes (LMT), which is claimed to be the highest ever. With its share of 56.21 LMT wheat in the total procurement, UP is the fourth-highest procurer in the country after Punjab, MP and Haryana. Uttar Pradesh is said to have broken its own wheat procurement records this year. According to the same data, Punjab and Haryana, where farmers have been most vocal against the Centre’s three agriculture laws, alleging that the central government might eliminate the MSP system, have purchased as much as 132.1 LMT and 84.93 LMT of wheat from farmers on the MSP, emerging as the top and the third procurers, respectively. Madhya Pradesh (MP), which has given neck-to-neck competition to Punjab, has come on the second position by buying 128.08 LMT of wheat from farmers during 2021-22 marketing season that has now almost come to a close in all the states. Rajasthan’s share in the total wheat procurement has been recorded to be 22.85 LMT, which is the fifth highest, but more than 33 LMT less than that of UP and this is being seen as a big change in the recent years. “Before the Yogi Adityanath government came to power four years ago, Rajasthan remained the top fourth wheat procurer in the country for several years. But it has now ceded that position to UP as the government started aggressive wheat and paddy purchase in keeping with its 2017 manifesto,” said a senior bureaucrat. According to a report available with the state’s food and civil supplies department, the average wheat purchase in UP between 2011-12 and 2015-16 was only 24.20 LMT. It indicated that wheat procurement was as low as 6.83 LMT in 2013-14, 6.28 LMT in 2014-15 and 22.67 LMT in 2015-16. “The total wheat purchase was recorded to be 221.07 LMT in 10 years between 2007 and 2017. Against this, the Yogi Adityanath government bought 218.86 lakh MT of wheat worth ₹39037.01 crore benefitting a record 46,34,828 farmers in just four years,” said Surya Pratap Shahi, agriculture minister, during a press conference on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-emerges-4th-largest-wheat-procuring-state-in-country-101624644475468.html

The compensation recovered may be utilised for restoration of environment by preparing an action plan,” read the order.Following a complaint by a local councillor last year, the NGT had formed a joint committee under the HSPCB to look into the matter. Based on the ground inspections, the HSPCB, in its report, stated that the sugar mill was located in an “over-exploited area” but it had been extracting groundwater using a borewell, to meet its water requirements. This was done without the permission of the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) and was hence illegal.The illegal extraction had taken place from April 15, 2015 to December 12, 2020.HSPCB member secretary S Narayanan told HT that they will comply with the directions of the NGT and initiate actions for recovery of compensation and restoration of the environment as per its directions.In August last year, taking a serious note of environmental violations by the sugar mill, the NGT had ordered closure of sugar and distillery units at Panipat Cooperative Sugar Mill until remedial measures are taken.As per the previous orders of the NGT, “the norms under the Water Act, the Air Act and the Environment Protection Act are also not being followed, which amounts to criminal offences. Groundwater is being illegally extracted which may seriously and irreversibly affect the environment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hspcb-told-to-recover-penalty-of-rs-4-13-cr-penalty-from-panipat-sugar-mill-101624644296146.html

Over 2.70 lakh students are enrolled in Class 12 in BSEH.BSEH secretary Rajiv Prasad said they have decided not to follow the CBSE pattern as they could not hold pre-board exams and unit tests for Class 12 students and the final exams were cancelled for Class 11 students last year due to the pandemic.“We will follow the 30:10:60 formulae in announcing the Class 12 results. We are expecting to announce the Class 12 results before July 31,” the board secretary added.The Supreme Court had directed all boards to announce Class 12 results by July 31 and the top court has accepted the CBSE formulae to evaluate Class 12 results.

The government has adopted many methods to defame the protesters but it failed to do so. Our party has always raised its voice for farmers and labourers and Chautala sahab’s release will give new momentum to the agitation,” he added.Reacting over Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance in Punjab, the ex-Ellenabad MLA alleged that BSP supremo Mayawati is dual faced and is working as per BJP’s directions.“I have good relations with Sukhbir Singh Badal and whenever he meets me, I will ask him to be wary of Mayawati. She had forged an alliance with our party ahead of the 2019 parliamentary polls but had snapped all ties when the elections were round the corner. She can give a jolt to SAD as well before the assembly polls in Punjab which are due next year,” he added.Chautala said he is hoping for NCP leader Sarad Pawar to form a third front to fight against the BJP and Congress at the national level.While interacting with party workers in Jhajjar, Abhay said, “Time has come for Bhupinder Singh Hooda to go behind the bars for his involvement in many corruption activities during his tenure as the Haryana CM.”“Hooda had been taking digs at me by asking us to look for a competent lawyer to ensure the release of my father. If Hooda goes to jail, I will provide him a long list of advocates,” he added.Slamming his estranged nephews Dushyant and Digvijay, Abhay said the two has no concern for their grandfather OP Chautala and both did not even visit him in the hospital after he met with an accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chautalas-release-will-strengthen-farm-stir-abhay-101624644055902.html

I was a Class-11 student then. After his death, we faced extreme financial hardship and even left Punjab to save the rest of the family. We returned to Tarn Taran in 1992, under the Beant Singh government,” said Sumut Sondhi, secretary, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee.He added, “I have been working in the Congress for long. The party has formed the government in Punjab thrice after that, yet my family has not been granted any relief. Despite several pleas, we were never compensated. If the state government has started compensating terrorism-hit families, it should not discriminate.” Amritsar-based Gurpreet Singh said, “My father Abnashi Singh was kidnapped in 1980s and it is widely believed that militants killed him. He had served as the personal secretary of the then Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gurcharan Singh Tohra. Despite this, the government never thought of giving us anything on compassionate grounds. Both my sons, Kunwar Partap Singh and Tej Partap Singh, are educated but jobless.”In 1987, the world of two kid brothers was turned upside down when militants eliminated their parents, Darshan Singh and Gurmeet Kaur, “While my mother was killed, my father was taken to an unknown place to never return,” said Baljit, 36, of Muglani village near Khadoor Sahib in Tarn Taran district.

My maternal grandfather dropped us to a nearby religious dera that raised us. We are still living there and struggling to make ends meet. Over the years, we have submitted a number of applications to the government, seeking compensation or relief.

25-06-2021||Patna||Youth given jab minus vaccine, nurse suspended||The Bihar government has suspended a nurse after a video of her administering Covid-19 shot to a youth without vaccine in the syringe went viral, officials said on Friday. The incident took place at Urdu Middle School temporary vaccination centre in Barhampur village of Saran district recently on June 21. “Chanda Kumari, the auxiliary nursing midwife (ANM) who committed the lapse, has been placed under suspension and departmental proceedings will be initiated against her,” said Dr JP Sukumar, Saran civil surgeon. He, however, ruled out any foul play. According to Azhar Hussain, the youth who was given the jab, he noticed the nurse’s blunder the same evening in a video his friends shot of him on his cellphone. Hussain’s friend Aman Khan, who shot the video, said it was a case of oversight on the part of the nurse, who was chatting while administering the shot to his friend. “I was shooting the video just to capture my friend’s reaction at the time of vaccination. We noticed in the evening while checking our (vaccination) status on the cellphone that the nurse did not load any vaccine in the syringe before administering the shot to my friend,” Khan claimed in the viral video. The nurse has admitted her mistake, the Saran civil surgeon said. “There was a lot of rush at the vaccination session that day and many people had crowded around her. It was in the melee that she forgot to load the vaccine in the syringe, as claimed by the ANM in her show cause notice,” said Dr Sukumar. The ANM was posted at Ekma Nagar panchayat but was on deputation to Chapra urban area for the vaccination drive, the civil surgeon added.District immunisation officer Dr (Major) Ajay Kumar Sharma said the ANM was taken off the vaccination drive. The youth has also been contacted to be given his first dose of vaccine, he added. “Using empty syringe in case of intramuscular injection, as in case of Covid-19 vaccination, is absolutely harmless if the air injected is in moderate quantity. In worst case, it may cause mild to moderate pain around the injected area. Air embolism is caused in case of intravenous injections when the volume of air injected is over 20-50 ml,” said Dr Umesh Bhadani, dean, AIIMS-Patna.In another case of vaccination blunder, on June 16, a woman in her 60s was given a shot each of Covaxin and Covishied at an interval of around five minutes at a rural vaccination camp in Beldarichak village under Patna district. Similar instances of vaccine mix-up have also been reported from Bihar’s Samastipur and Purnia districts. One Ankit Sharma (32) claimed his provisional vaccination certificate, after the first jab, mentioned Covaxin even though he was administered Covishield at a rural centre in Samastipur on May 16. Another Madan Lal Modi (50) claimed he was given Covaxin instead of Covishield in the second shot at a community health centre in Purnia on May 11. The medical officer in-charge Dr Ashok Kumar Singh had attributed the incident to “human error”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/youth-given-jab-minus-vaccine-nurse-suspended-101624639616376.html

The two arrested have been identified as Mohammad Haji Salim Kashim and his son Mohammad Kafil.Ashok Kumar Singh, superintendent Government Railway Police (GRP) at Muzaffarpur, which has been probing the case, said the parcel caught fire after the explosion but no casualty or damage to property was reported. The parcel did not contain name and details of the sender while the addressee was named as Mohammed Sufiyan. Police have been treating Sufiyan as a suspect in the case since he did not show up to collect the parcel, which contained clothes and a sealed vial that is now believed to have triggered the explosion. Sources in Bihar’s Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), which has since joined the probe, said at least four suspects had been detained from different locations, but declined to share details saying it could hamper the investigation.“There is a hint of terror connection in the case. A joint report of Bihar and Telangana ATS is expected to be sent to the Union Home ministry today. We believe the case will soon be transferred to NIA,” said an official of Bihar home department, requesting anonymity. Earlier, the GRP team had gone to Secunderabad and examined CCTV footages from railway station there, which reportedly showed four men getting down from a vehicle carrying a packet which looked quite similar to the one that exploded at Darbhanga railway station.Meanwhile, the NIA team led by a superintendent of police met senior police officers to review the probe. They also inspected the blast site. A senior GRP official said that NIA team will also meet investigating officer in the case and Darbhanga GRP officer-in-charge Harun Rashid, who returned from Secunderabad on Friday.“The probe will now be formally handed over to the NIA and the railway police will provide assistance to them,” said a senior GRP official.A few years ago, a Darbhanga native was arrested for his alleged links with the proscribed outfit Indian Mujahideen (IM)..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/darbhanga-blast-two-held-in-up-nia-team-visits-site-101624639615869.html

Jha, who has been appointed as the BPCC chief in 2017 in place of Ashok Choudhary, had put in his papers shortly after the 2020 assembly polls in Bihar in which Congress fared poorly.Senior BPCC leaders claimed that apart from proposing Ram’s name, Das has also recommended names of seven leaders, Kumar Ashish, Pravin Singh Kushwaha, former Riga MLA Amit Kumar Tunna, former MLA Manoj Kumar Singh, former MLA and state Mahila Congress president Amita Bhushan, AICC secretary Chandan Yadav and Shakillur Rahman as working presidents in the new committee, which is likely to be announced shortly.Irked by the recommendations, senior BPCC leader Kishore Kumar Jha said Das lacked maturity needed to understand Bihar politics. He said he had spoken to Das and AICC general secretary KC Venugopal and urged them to be politically practical for constitution of the new committee in Bihar if the party wanted to regain its glory ahead of 2024 elections. “It is do or die like situation the party in Bihar and the party high command should take the decision after proper thinking,” said Jha, adding that he would try to meet Rahul Gandhi soon.Meanwhile, former BPCC chief Anil Kumar Sharma took to Twitter to draw the party high command’s attention towards proposed reconstitution of the AICC and sought judicious representation as per caste combination and regional balance. In a tweet, Sharma said that of the six nominated members in the AICC from Bihar, are four Muslims and two Yadavs. Of the four Muslims, three hail from Katihar. Only Seemanchal and Kosi regions were represented, while core of the party’s base has been marginalized, he said.Das could not be contacted despite several attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bpcc-reshuffle-will-rajesh-ram-emerge-as-dark-horse-for-top-post-101624639615137.html
25-06-2021||Pune||BJP-led chakka jam protest at Katraj today||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has planned chakka jam agitations at Katraj chowk on Saturday to demand political reservation for OBC. BJP leader Pankaja Munde is going to lead the agitation at Katraj chowk, the party has also sent out a message to its cadre to remain present for the agitation planned from 10am onwards. The Marathas have already begun agitations for getting reservation after the Supreme Court scrapped it, and immediately after the Maratha protests, the OBCs have begun agitations in the state. OBCs are on the verge of losing their political reservation in local bodies across Maharashtra as it was quashed by the Supreme Court last month. Katraj chowk is one of the main chowks in the city. With a chakka jam at the chowk, it would disturb the traffic coming from the old Katraj ghat mainly from Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli towards Pune city. Even chances are that traffic might be disturbed in Katraj and Ambegaon areas. Bharatiya Janta Party has decided to hold state-wide protests for the same demands, and also announced support for Maratha reservation in the state. After BJP, it is expected that OBC leaders from all parties will undertake similar protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjpled-chakka-jam-protest-at-katraj-today-101624638715203.html

The Central government is misusing CBI and ED for political agenda and it’s not new for Maharashtra and other states.” Pawar interacted with the media at the NCP’s party office. ED on Friday raided former Maharashtra home minister Deshmukh’s residence at Nagpur. While asking about the raids, Pawar replied, “Nothing new about ED raids, such raids have happened previously also. I am sure that they did not receive anything. As ED did not getting anything, out of frustration they are arresting someone.” Pawar said, “I am in political life for a long tenure but never seen that any political party passed any resolution to start CBI inquiry against opposition party leader. BJP state president Chandrakant Patil passed such resolution in its state level meeting and demanded to start CBI inquiry of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.” Pawar said, “Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) is ruling in the centre. CBI is coming under central government. As it is they are misusing it. They should start such inquiry.” Pawar also welcomed the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with Kashmir leaders. He said, “It is good that Central government realised that they did nothing in Kashmir whatever promised by them. Let’s hope that Prime Minister would keep his promises given to all party leaders in Kashmir.”BOXPawar bats for common leadership during 2024 Lok Sabha pollsNationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar batted for common leadership in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls instead of giving a single face from opposition parties. While asking that considering the previous elections experience, instead of Rahul Gandhi, opposition parties thinking for any other face? Pawar said, “I expressed my opinion very clear that the opposition parties should do alliance along with Congress party. There is need to have a common leadership.” While asking that whether Sharad Pawar would lead the opposition party’s alliance and became the face? He said, “I did such things for last many years but now will guide and help to bring all together.” When media asked the details about opposition party meeting at his residence in Delhi, Pawar said, “It was not a political meeting. It was mainly to discuss farmers’ agitation issue which are going for the last six months in Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/not-worried-about-ed-raids-at-deshmukh-s-residence-pawar-101624638595099.html

During former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh’s tenure, he got the candidature for legislative council but on the last day of filing the nomination form, he was not able to reach Mumbai as his helicopter was not able to land.

25-06-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Amazing Grace||For a girl from Bandra, Asha Puthli’s success in the international music scene of the Seventies was nothing short of extraordinary. From being described as a “genius” by legendary New York-based record producer John Hammond — the man credited with discovering musicians like Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan; to winning the prestigious Downbeat critics poll award for her vocals on Ornette Coleman’s path breaking 1973 album Science Fiction; to having the New York Times describe her album The Devil is Loose as an instant classic — Puthli’s international musical career had scaled exceptional heights. What’s more, her astonishing four-octave range was matched by her effortless segueing between genres as varied as the blues, pop, rock, soul, funk, disco, and techno. Puthli’s achievements are even more remarkable when you consider that at a time when the West was only just beginning to discover Indian music through The Beatles and Ravi Shankar, here was an Indian girl, singing the blues like she’d been dyed in them. To be sure, there was a time when Puthli had been the toast of New York’s avant garde; photographed by Andy Warhol and Richard Avedon, styled by Manolo Blahnik and immortalised by writer Ved Mehta in his book Portrait of India. ****************************As the convent educated daughter of an upper middle-class family which featured stalwarts of the Indian Independence Movement such as cultural doyenne Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay and poet Harindranath Chattopadhyay, brother of Sarojini Naidu, Puthli had studied Indian classical music as well as opera. But it was not only music that had consumed the teenager. A voracious reader, who devoured authors like Dostoevsky, Andre Gide and Kessler, Puthli had been attracted to all things cultural. “I used to hang out at the Samovar which was such a hub for artists, writers, filmmakers and intellectuals,” she says, on a call from Florida where she lives for part of the year with her filmmaker son Jannu Goldschimdt. “Then there were institutions like the Alliance Francaise and Goethe Institute and personalities like Gerson da Cunha and Pearl and Alyque Padamsee. I looked up to them all.” Like a sponge, Puthli says, she soaked up the heady mix of intellectual and cultural stimuli, the city an oyster for her insatiable appetite; but whereas it turned her into one of the frontline personalities of her generation, her name a constant fixture in youth magazine Junior Statesman, it also rendered her woefully unfit for a conventional life of domesticity and marriage. Fortunately, her breakthrough came in the form of a year’s stint as an airhostess for BOAC and a subsequent scholarship to study dance with Martha Graham in New York. Soon, Puthli found herself winging her way to New York on a student visa, to seek her fortune in the Big Apple. ****************************It was no surprise that she hit the ground running, navigating her way with a combination of her characteristic, chutzpah, unique sense of style and generosity of spirit. “I think the fact that I had nothing made things easier, because it made me more creative,” she recalls. “For instance, instead of buying clothes, I invented my own look; I would turn an Indian mirror work pillowcase into a skirt, combine it with a traditional Saurashtra blouse and voila, it became a fabulous outfit for which I’d get complimented by strangers on New York’s streets.” To understand the sensation the lithe, dark-haired Puthli with her large kohl-lined eyes, full sensuous mouth and provocative one-liners created is not hard. New York’s smartest set opened their hearts and homes to the exotic Indian rose with enthusiasm. “As far back as I can recall, Asha Puthli was always a star,” says former NYT journalist Pranay Gupte, another Indian who’d breached the hallowed barriers of American media. “I saw her several times at Studio 54, in the company of people like Françoise Gilot, Picasso’s former partner, and Woody Allen and Zubin Mehta. Her songs frequently graced radio stations and she was a sought-after guest,” he says, adding, “But her fame never went to her head. When my son Jaidev was a little kid, enamoured of long limousines, one day Asha hired a spectacular limousine to ferry him around for the entire day! On another occasion, she threw a lavish, surprise birthday party for a schoolteacher friend. What’s more, she never expected anything from those on whom she lavished her largesse.” ****************************But though she’d become a darling of NYC’s smart set, Puthli eventually found her head knocking against the hard ceiling of the racism and cultural imperialism of the era. “Corporate America and record executives did not think I was marketable,” she says, adding, “According to them, blacks would not accept me and whites would not accept me. And Indians were not interested in buying western music.” Fortunately, Europe had been more accepting. Here, she found the backing of record companies and appreciative audiences who turned her albums into chartbusters. However, decades later the memory of rebuff from America, the mecca for jazz can rankle. When CBS was looking for an international star to put their formidable marketing muscle behind and the choice had been narrowed to Julio Iglesias and Puthli, Iglesias had been chosen because of the big Latin contingency in America, and millions of dollars were spent on promoting him, Puthli says, recounting how each time she’d see her rival’s face on a bus, it had felt like a kick in the stomach. This cognitive dissonance of being Indian and singing Western proved to be Puthli’s stumbling block. Though she continued to reap accolades from music critics and icons, serious money and international fame eluded her. “I cannot describe how I felt when overnight Donna Summers began looking, singing, dressing and dancing like me,” she says of the Disco Queen of the era, who went on to rake millions and attract a global following. ****************************But it is a tribute to Puthli’s upbringing and grace that she has made peace with pain. “If success equals happiness, I am truly blessed,” she says. Today, in her mid-seventies, she says she is spending what she describes as the happiest days of her life, with her beloved son and their pet pooch, and later this year there is a plan to release a much-cherished album of classic jazz covers titled All My Life, as a tribute to her many mentors and collaborators. Meanwhile, thanks to the internet, her status as a cult icon keeps growing, with her original records becoming collector’s items on E-bay. What’s more, her snakey, sensuous, futuristic music continues to win new fans through sampling in songs by iconic rappers like P. Diddy, The Notorious B.I.G., Dilated Peoples, Governor featuring 50 Cent, and Redman. And finally, there are plans for a book or a film documenting her life. “I think age has mellowed me, has taught me a lot. And I am always open to life’s magical possibilities,” says Puthli, looking back with grace and gratitude at her extraordinary journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-amazing-grace-101624634095966.html

It may be noted that all the members of the Paranjape family are together except the complainant”. The Vile Parle police station has clarified that there were no arrests in this regard. “The entire matter is nothing but an internal family dispute about the share in the ancestral property and it has nothing to do with our real estate development business and our firm Paranjape Schemes (Construction) Limited.

Sen’s comments come after people pointed out that Sen was seen in a few photos with Debanjan Deb.Sen who is also the Indian Medical Association’s West Bengal secretary said that the incident was part of an organised crime and Kolkata Police is investigating the matter. He also said that the Kolkata civic body is reaching out to people who had received the jabs at the fake vaccination drive.“When we realised that Debanjan Deb is a fraud and his ill-intentions without wasting time we lodged an FIR with the Muchipara police station and asked them to take stringent measures. This is an organised crime and the police are taking their own course. I believe that the Kolkata Municipal Corporation has taken a significant step to reach out to beneficiaries to gather information regarding any side-effects,” Sen was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Sen also wrote a letter to the Muchipara police regarding the photos where he was seen with Debanjan Deb. He said that Debanjan was being accompanied by others and it was hard to question his genuinity.Debanjan Deb was arrested after TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty busted his fake vaccination drive in the New Market area in Kolkata on Wednesday. Mimi while speaking to Hindustan Times Bangla said that her suspicions arose after she did not receive a vaccination certificate from the people arranging the vaccination drive. She said that the man posed as an IAS officer and was with the Kolkata civic body. He was also using a fake ID card and masks and sanitizers labelled with Kolkata civic body logos. Deb was arrested after Mimi informed the police.The police later said that beneficiaries may have been injected with Amikacin, an antibiotic, according to another report by HT. The report said that after raiding Debanjan Deb’s office in south Kolkata the cops found a large number of Amikacin vials alongside fake labels of Covishield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/fake-vaccination-drive-tmc-mp-sen-clarifies-after-photos-with-accused-surface-101624624918823.html
25-06-2021||Kolkata||BJP attacks TMC over fake Covid vaccination, demands probe by central agency||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has attacked the Trinamool Congress (TMC) over the vaccination camps in Kolkata where fake Covid-19 vaccines were allegedly administered, saying the fraud could not have taken place without the support of the ruling party and the state administration.Subhas Sarkar, a BJP Member of Parliament (MP), said Debanjan Deb, who is accused of organising the camps, has been spotted with multiple TMC leaders. He added people, who were administered the fake vaccines, should be kept under observation. “If they develop any illness, the state should take responsibility. If the accused has close links with the chief minister, then the case file would be suppressed.”Saumitra Khan, another BJP MP, tweeted: “How the vaccine is available in the open market? Trinamool MP and MLA are involved in this case. This is being done in their presence. If this case is investigated by the central agency, the correct information will come out.” The BJP has circulated pictures that show Deb purportedly posing with TMC ministers and lawmakers including Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee, Debashis Kumar, and Santanu Sen. Deb apparently shared the photos on his social media platform in 2020. In February, when a bust of Rabindranath Tagore was unveiled in Kolkata, Deb’s name was engraved in a stone there along with names of ministers and lawmakers. Deb was referred to as a top government official. People aware of the matter said police were investigating how Deb’s name figured on the stone.Hakim said public figures do not check the background of every person they come across while attending public programmes. “If I have to check each and every person’s credential at every public programme, then I would not be able to mix with and attend to the people. There could be one fraud person among 100 good citizens. If he stands beside me and takes a picture, what can I do?”Also Read | SC gives fresh chance to Mamata Banerjee, minister to respond to CBI chargesMukherjee echoed Hakim. “We often go to public functions. Many people come there. It is not my responsibility to check each and every person’s background.”TMC Member of Parliament Mimi Chakraborty was among those who were vaccinated at one of Deb’s camps.Kunal Ghosh, a TMC spokesperson, said the entire operation was camouflaged and that mistakes and a crime has been committed. “Police are probing it. Chakraborty...suspected something was wrong when she did not receive any (confirmatory) message... after getting the vaccine. This took the lid off. It would be wrong to say TMC leaders are involved. Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seen in pictures with some persons who have been accused of economic offences and are now wanted by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Does that mean Modi is involved?”Meanwhile, KMC member of the board of administrators, Atin Ghosh, said, “It (unveiling of the Tagore’s statue) was not a government programme. Neither was any permission taken from the civic body. None of the ministers and TMC leaders, who names were engraved, was present there. Sometimes a local club or NGO unveils a statue without informing the KMC. So it won’t be right to say that TMC ministers and leaders were present at the occasion along with Deb.” He said that the stone slab would be removed. TMC MLA Nayana Banerjee has lodged a police complaint as her name and that of other party leaders were included even though they were not present at the programme. TMC MP Santanu Sen, TMC MP, who can be seen in one of the photos, and is also the state secretary of the Indian Medical Association, has lodged a police complaint against Deb. The Kolkata Police on Wednesday busted the fake vaccination racket. They say Deb, 28, who was masquerading as the joint commissioner of the city’s civic body, allegedly organised several such camps, where hundreds of people were vaccinated. Police suspect amikacin, an antibiotic, was administered at the camps. Police found a large number of Amikacin vials and fake labels of Covishield when they raided Deb’s office on Thursday.A police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the people who took the fake jabs in south Kolkata were told that they were getting Covishield. “...while those who got the fake jabs in a similar camp in north Kolkata were told they had got Sputnik. His office employees were also given fake injections and were told they were getting the Pfizer vaccine. Such a camp was also organised at Sonarpur.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-attacks-tmc-over-fake-covid-vaccination-demands-probe-by-central-agency-101624625215108.html

The women, one of who belongs to Sangrur district, shared a video with Sangrur Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Bhagwant Mann on June 23, saying their employers had kept their passports and urged him to facilitate their return. Also read: Patients left high and dry as doctors go on strike in PunjabMann said that the women were stuck in Erbil city of Iraq and he had talked to the officials concerned at the Indian Embassy in Baghdad, who had traced the women. “I received a video from the women two days ago and sent it to the ministry of external affairs on Thursday evening. I met officials of the ministry on Friday and submitted all documents that I got from the women’s families. The officials arranged my phone call with the Indian embassy in Baghdad. Though the women don’t have their passports, the Indian embassy will take them into custody and they will be back in India in a couple of days,” Mann said. Apart from the one from Sangrur district, the rest of the victims are from Hoshiarpur and Jalandhar districts. In the video, the women can be seen sharing their plight with faces covered. They said they had gone to Iraq for jobs as helps in households and companies but their passports were taken away and they were not given food and adequate rest. “We faced exploitation in households and from company owners. We had problems of food and sleep.

25-06-2021||Pune||NGT levies ₹2 crore penalty on PMC for violating order on garbage||PUNE The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) to pay ₹2 crore for not completely complying with the tribunal order from 2018, related to a garbage dumping ground in Uruli Devachi and Phursungi. The order was passed by the principal bench of NGT comprising of chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel; judicial members Justices Sudhir Agarwal, M Sathyanarayanan, and Brijesh Sethi; and expert member Nagin Nanda.The amount will be used to enforce an action plan to restore the environment in the area which will have to be prepared by PMC, as originally directed, and submitted to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). The Maharashtra Environment Secretary will monitor the compliance by PMC. MPCB and state environment department will assess continued violation of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, and levy a compensatory amount that PMC will have to pay along with the ₹2 crore, according to the order.In an order passed on July 19, 2018, the NGT had issued a showcause notice to PMC asking why an order from December 2017 had not been complied with. The 2017 order had directed PMC to come up with an action plan to clean up the garbage that had piled up in the dumping ground for the past several years. Additionally, the 2018 order, after the showcause notice, had directed PMC to submit an amount of ₹2 crore to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) in the form of a bank guarantee to ensure compliance. The 2018 order has mentioned that upon failure of compliance of any part of the order, the bank guarantee of ₹2 crore should be encashed.Expert member Nagin Nanda was part of the bench which passed the 2017 and 2018 orders, and was part of the bench that passed the order of June 21, 2021 too.An oversight committee was appointed with a validity of two years to ensure that the order is complied with.However, the oversight committee has passed its validity and the waste still remains on the site. The money that PMC was supposed to furnish as guarantee in 2018 to MPCB has not been submitted.Additionally, residents of the area who are the original applicants, claimed that not only has PMC and MPCB failed to clear the garbage, but they have also proposed a new garbage processing plant in the area. This claim, however, was denied by advocate Rahul Garg representing PMC.“However, waste processing facility is proposed for 1550 MTD waste so that no waste is left to be landfilled. No fresh dumping of waste is taking place at the said site since January, 2020. A part of the site has already been bio-mined and the remaining site will also be soon cleared. However, learned counsel is not clear about the quantum of waste which remains to be cleared,” read a part of the order that described the PMC response.There are three parties involved in the case - the residents, the PMC, and the MPCB.When the court asked about how much waste still remains on the site, the PMC counsel had no answer and the MPCB counsel requested more time to come up with an answer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ngt-levies-rs-2-crore-penalty-on-pmc-for-violating-order-on-garbage-101624620776402.html

The first two levels having maximum relaxations have been removed till further order, according to a notification issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Friday. “Given that the virus causing Covid019 is undergoing mutations in various geographies, and that these mutations are displaying more transmissibility and potential reductions in monoclonal antibody response, a state-level trigger mandating all the administrative units, irrespective of values of the indices of weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy percentage, to remain at a level not below 3 is to be in operation till withdrawn by specific order of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA),” the notification issued by Kunte stated. The decision has been taken considering emerging cases of Delta plus variant in the state, officials said. The state task force and the ministry of health and family welfare (MOHFW) has directed the state not to let its guard down, following which it was decided to cut down the relaxations, said Aseem Gupta, secretary, relief and rehabilitation department.Also read: ‘Delta plus’ variant evades vaccines?

It also means all the districts and cities will get maximum relaxations that are provided under the level 3 plan,” Gupta said.The state has found 21 cases of Delta plus variant covering six districts. Of them, nine cases are in Ratnagiri, seven in Jalgaon, two in Mumbai and one case each in Thane, Palghar and Sindhudurg.“Before the second wave hit the state, cases started rising in Amravati and then it spread across the state. This time we have decided to be more careful considering the Delta plus variant cases have been found in a few districts. We cannot be at peace when there is a threat of a possible third wave looming large,” the relief and rehabilitation secretary said.What is level 3The districts or municipal corporations with a weekly positivity rate of between 5-10% or oxygen bed occupancy over 40% will be classified under level 3.In this category, shops selling essentials can stay open till 4 pm on all days and those selling non-essentials are allowed to operate only on weekdays.

A Pune citizen Hanumant Phadke challenged the PMC’s drive in the court, located in the municipal corporation’s headquarters at Shivanjinagar and managed to get a stay order issued.This came as the PMC’s anti-encroachment drive was about to begin in the Ambil odha area, near Dandekar bridge, under police protection. The drive is targeting illegal constructions and obstructions on the banks of the stream as well as on the water bed itself.Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “It is necessary to remove encroachments on nallahs, but the administration acted in a hurry. They should have given residents some more time to make necessary arrangements. The drive needs to be carried out before, or after, the monsoon season.”Many homes and shanties are in the flood line and the PMC had issued notices to residents asking them to vacate the illegal premises.On Thursday morning, there was much tension in the area as residents clashed verbally with PMC officials and the police.Residents alleged that the police was using force to keep them away from their homes and some even claimed that they had not received the PMC notices. Meanwhile, the opposition parties in the city blamed the ruling BJP for the chaos. Congress leader Arvind Shinde and the NCP’s Nitin Kadam claimed that the PMC was looking to develp the Ambil odha area under a slum rehabilitation area (SRA) scheme. “The administration was going to conduct the anti-encroadhment drive at the very spot discussed in the PMC meeting,” Shinde alleged.The Aam Adami Party’s (AAP) Mukund Kirdat also opposed the drive. He said, “The corporation carried out the drive during rainy season which is wrong.”Municipal administration officials decline a comment officially, but of the record administration officials were quoted as saying, “Houses are in the water body. If there is heavy rain, same political parties will blame the administration for not removing the encroachments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-court-stays-ambil-odha-anti-encroachment-drive-residents-clash-with-police-101624618376918.html
25-06-2021||Pune||Step up Covid testing, genome sequencing to detect delta variant: Experts||The health experts in the city suggest that Covid-19 testing and genome sequencing in the district should be increased if the delta variant has to be detected to avoid the early onset of the third wave.Dr Sanjay Patil, former vice-president, IMA, and chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter, said that testing is vital and should be done.“However, contact tracing is less. There is laxity in contact tracing. After every positive patient there should be at least 10 to 12 contacts that should be tested,” said Dr Patil.He added that genome sequencing in suspected cases should be done.“The samples used for genome testing should be area wise. If a doctor feels that a particular case is different from usual Covid-19 cases, such cases should be referred for genome sequencing. The central government has given directives that at least 100 samples should undergo genome sequencing,” said Patil.He added that samples from containment zones should undergo genome testing.Testing for Covid-19 in the Pune district has increased marginally from 16,356 on June 1 to 18,509 on June 24, according to data provided by the district health officer.Dr Kapil Zirpe, member of the city and district Covid-19 task force and head of department, critical care at Ruby Hall Clinic, said that as of now there is not enough evidence of how dangerous the delta variant is.“We need to do random testing in the city. Testing vendors and customers who frequent the market is important as they can turn into superspreaders. Increased random testing is crucial if we have to stay prepared for the third wave,” said Dr Zirpe.He added that no matter where people are, they must follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.“Also, many students travel from one place to another and they frequently meet others. In such a scenario, along with vendors, students are also crucial as more random testing can help avoid any superspreaders,” said Dr Zirpe.He further noted that random testing intends to avoid the increase in the number of cases in the next wave.“We should be prepared for the next wave. By more vaccination and testing, we can keep more patients away from being critical,” added Dr Zirpe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/step-up-covid-testing-genome-sequencing-to-detect-delta-variant-experts-101624618074864.html
25-06-2021||Mumbai||‘Allegations of scam in Ram Temple land purchase a fit for CBI, ED probe': Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Friday said the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) would find a ‘fit case’ in the alleged financial irregularities in the purchase of land by the Ram Temple trust. Raut also said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national executive should pass a resolution to demand for an investigation by these agencies into the alleged irregularities.Raut’s allegations come after the Maharashtra unit of the BJP passed a resolution in its executive demanding the CBI and the ED carry out a probe against the deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and minister and Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab. This is also the second time Raut has asked for an investigation into the allegations.“Are the CBI and the ED your party workers or members of the IT cell?” Raut asked the BJP while accusing them of lowering the stature of these central investigating agencies by targeting political rivals.“It is unfair to misuse these central investigating agencies. This needs to stop. It is understandable when these agencies are probing cases associated with national security, loss to national treasury or cases related to money laundering. Why are you maligning the image of these agencies,” Raut was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.He also expressed confidence that the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will complete two years in office this year and said that it will also complete its full tenure. “These tactics to destabilize the government will not work,” Raut further added. Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil said he found it strange that the ED searched Deshmukh’s residence after the state BJP passed a resolution demanding the probe against Ajit Pawar and Anil Parab.“It is time to focus on the pandemic but the BJP is doing the wrong things at the wrong time,” Patil said.Workers of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) protested against the ED by holding a demonstration outside Deshmukh's residence. The NCP workers were led by the party’s city unit chief Duneshwar Pethe. They raised slogans against the central government, calling it ‘autocratic’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/allegations-of-scam-in-ram-temple-land-purchase-a-fit-for-cbi-ed-probe-raut-101624617494420.html
25-06-2021||Pune||Global village idiot: One from LHLB community files... conform not at cost of individuality||I feel kind of stupid talking to people who talk about leadership skills, especially leadership skills in children. Which means I feel stupid talking to almost everybody, because right now, almost everybody seems to be busy grooming leaders and entrepreneurs and innovators and critical thinkers, and they have all realised it’s better to start young. It seems we require many such professionals in the future. Now, I have grown up with images and stereotypes and unwritten expectations of what a good manager, charismatic leader, successful engineer or generally great achiever is supposed to look like: crisp, well dressed in formals (or studied casuals, which are really designer), firm, but nice, intelligent but caring, commanding, but nurturing, agreeable, and of course: short-haired. Which of course rules out people who are long-haired and/or ask too many questions, and/or generally have difficulty being a predictable type. I am ruled out on all counts. Thankfully.My children seem to prefer wearing their hair long as well. For now, anyways. And they are quite amused with people who tell them to cut their hair. Here are the typical comments our boys get:“You look like a girl.”“Why do you have such long hair like a girl?”“When are you going to cut your hair short and neat like regular boys?”“If you don’t cut your hair by next week, I will tie it in a pony like a girl’s!”“The rules don’t allow boys to have long hair!”What is it about boys in long hair that raises insecurity within men and women? Renders them incoherent, forcing them to abandon reasoning abilities and eventually be forced into a corner from where they clutch at the straw of archaic rules and societal propriety?The irony is not lost on the children, especially since the remarks come from adults and educators who are otherwise desperately trying to get them to look at “gender equality” and to “express” themselves and to “think” for themselves.I remember a conversation couple of years ago with Mr D, our 9-year-old (he was seven then). “Baba, one of my teachers asked me the dumbest question today – “Why do you like long hair? Why does she like asking me to cut my hair every month? Why doesn’t she cut her own hair first?” The last 12 months have been fantastic - the kids don’t have to cut their hair and they are happier on that count. There was a brief turbulence in that paradise a couple of months ago when talks started about schools reopening. The boys told me quite seriously then, “You have to talk to the school Baba. We don’t want to cut our hair when we go back to the classroom. Okay?”As a parent and a member of the very, very, very, minority LHLB community, I intend to talk and keep talking to schools and teachers and adults and the world at large, because it is important to my children. (LHLB = Long Hair Long Beard). If I had a daughter, I would also be part of the MASFM community (Makeup & Accessories in School Freedom Movement). If kids can’t make their own choices about how they look, what they wear, don’t expect them to grow up all sorted and feeling good about themselves. A child’s person is their own space and they have a right to self-expression - in fact, it’s a core part of how they feel about themselves. The more years adults repress that expression, the deeper the self-doubt in the future. If we are lucky, it’ll explode in rebellion when adults will have to listen to them. But, very often, kids grow up into adolescents who go into a shell, giving up the fight against conformity, and then grow into brooding young adults who spend their 20s following cool young singers and artistes and like-minded friends, but never finding peace; and then the 30s are spent affirming to themselves a self-image that is cobbled together from fragments of images impaled into their psyche by society; and then the 40s come and thereafter, they start from rock bottom, finding themselves in therapy and career changes and an endless cycle of ruing a wasted life and looking for people and places to allocate the blame.I want my kids to be whoever they want to be every day of their lives. Because that’s what an education is supposed to do in the first place - help them find and understand themselves. The world comes later. For that to happen, I have to first strive every day to not tell them what they should wear or eat or like or not like; and to not tell them how they should feel or not feel in any given situation. And after I have checked myself, I have to also respond when they come and ask me to stand up for them against the world’s arbitrary and illogical norms and expectations. And that’s why I feel kind of stupid talking to people who talk about leadership skills in children. Far as I am concerned, I will be happy if they learn to lead themselves.Mukherjee, author, learning-tech designer and management consultant, is founder of Mountain Walker and chief strategy advisor, Peak Pacific.

Please don't call them liars. They're feeling very bad," Kejriwal's tweet read further.The report, which was submitted to the Supreme Court, was prepared by a panel constituted by it in May when the Capital was facing an acute shortage of liquid medical oxygen.

25-06-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan gets genome sequencing lab to monitor, detect Covid-19 variants||Genome sequencing facility will now be available at the SMS hospital in Jaipur, Rajasthan. State health minister Dr Raghu Sharma said, in the fight against Covid-19, the facility of genome sequencing has been made available in the state. “Around 100 samples of Covid-19 have been used for genome sequencing. According to the investigation report, about 90% of these have been found to be delta variants. The remaining 10% came positive for Covid-19’s B1.1 variant,” Sharma said, expressing confidence that with the availability of the genome sequencing facility in the state, effective monitoring of the changing variants of Covid-19 will be possible. The technique of genome sequencing will help in getting information about the new variants of the virus. A sum of ₹1 crore has been spent for the facility at SMS Medical College. Sharma said, till now, samples from the state for genome sequencing were being sent by the Indian Council of Medical Research to the IGIB lab in Delhi. Every day, at least ten samples were sent from the state but their reports were not received on time. The health minister said the sampling work on the machine installed at SMS Medical College started on June 15. The machine can test up to 20 samples per day and soon its capacity will be increased to 80 samples daily. The test report of the samples can be received within 3 to 4 days. Sharma informed that the state is also leading in vaccination management. So far, 2,23,00,076 people have been inoculated against Covid-19. The vaccine wastage in the age group of 18-44 years is almost negligible, while in the age group of 45 years and above, the vaccine wastage is 0.7%, against the permissible wastage by the Government of India, which is 10%. “If the Central government provides vaccine doses in sufficient quantities then the department can administer vaccine doses to about 15 lakh people daily,” the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-gets-genome-sequencing-lab-to-monitor-detect-covid-19-variants-101624612675739.html

It accused the Delhi government of politicising the oxygen demand even as Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) called the audit report fabricated.“How can someone politicise oxygen? How can someone play with life like this? This is criminal negligence. This is a conspiracy,” said BJP leader Sambit Patra. He accused chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of creating a “false alarm and spreading panic across the country”. Patra blamed Kejriwal and his government for the lives lost in Delhi due to the oxygen shortage. “He should feel guilty of ruining lives.” Patra said Kejriwal will be held accountable and punished for “his criminal negligence and conspiracy”.Also Read | Work on oxygen plants may stretch to mid-August in GhaziabadPatra claimed Delhi had surplus oxygen. He added if excess oxygen continued to be supplied to Delhi, it would result in a national crisis.Patra accused the Delhi government of “fraud” and said 12 states including Uttar Pradesh and Haryana as a result did not get their share of oxygen. He said the Delhi government completely failed in managing the crisis. “His (Kejriwal)’s Covid mantra has been 100% advertisement and 0% Covid management. They have completely failed and all they have done is blaming (Prime Minister) Modi and the Centre,” he said.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia hit back saying no such audit report exists and accused the BJP of lying.

Kanta Prasad was admitted to Safdarjung Hospital on June 18 after police said he overdosed on alcohol and sleeping pills. They said they were trying to find out whether the incident was an accident or the Baba ka Dhaba owner tried to take his life.The Indian Express cited Atul Kumar Thakur, the deputy commissioner of police of South District, as saying that the condition of the 81-year-old is stable and that he is back home. The newspaper reported that the Baba ka Dhaba owner has recorded his statement before the police, alleging that several YouTubers called him to pressure him to apologise to Gaurav Wasan and he fell into depression after that. The newspaper said that no FIR has been filed so far in the matter and that the police are probing the role of the alleged YouTubers.Also read | 'Baba ka Dhaba' row ends, YouTuber Gaurav Wasan says 'all is well'Last week, the police said his family found Prasad unconscious at the eatery and took him to a nearby private hospital, which referred him to Safdarjung Hospital. Prasad’s son Karan alleged that his father was depressed because some people, including a few YouTubers, were “pressuring him to withdraw the cheating case and reach a compromise with Wasan.”“My father was being constantly asked to withdraw the case and patch up with Wasan. It was the main reason behind my father’s depression. He was not telling us anything about it, but we could see he was under pressure,” Karan said but did not specify whom he was speaking about.Also read | Baba ka Dhaba row: Case of cheating filed against YouTube ‘influencer’Prasad and his dhaba shot to fame overnight in October last year after YouTuber, Gaurav Wasan, shared a video showing Prasad in tears. The Baba Ka Dhaba owner told him he was struggling to make ends meet as business dried up during the coronavirus pandemic. The video went viral and led to thousands of people making a beeline to his eatery in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar and many even donated money. He later opened a new restaurant, which was shut in February due to a shortage of business.The octogenarian also filed a cheating case against Gaurav Wasan after accusing him of allegedly siphoning off donations, a charge that the YouTuber later refuted. Last week, the two posed for photographs at his dhaba and claimed all was well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/baba-ka-dhaba-owner-released-from-hospital-levels-allegations-against-youtubers-101624610062479.html

If the deceleration is more, there is a possibility of slipping away from the track. In such a situation, the pilot may go beyond the endpoint,” explained Dr KR Kaimal who retired from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) after 33 years of service. At ISRO, he worked under former President late APJ Abdul Kalam and owns five other patents. Tabletop airports are a nightmare for pilots and many accidents occurred in the country, including the last year’s mishap in Kozhikode international airport that claimed 22 lives.Innovators said many airports and pilots have expressed interest and they applied for a patent. One of the young scientists has already joined the French aircraft giant Airbus Industrie. They said several reasons usually attribute to accidents in tabletop airports, such as climate conditions, lighting arrangements, carelessness on the part of the pilot and misjudgement. Dr KR Kaimal said the newly-developed programme gives a warning to the pilot so that he can increase the speed and take off again and land in a nearby airport or the same airport after obtaining permission. He said the process has been demonstrated at the Hindustan Aeronautical Limited and Kozhikode airport and many pilots have shown keen interest in it.“Accident statistics indicate that descent, approach and landing are most dangerous phases of flight and often lead to 61% of accidents. We studied all existing and upcoming landing guidance system and came to a conclusion that even with the existing instrument of landing system installed on runways, pilots continue to make errors during approach and landing that lead to many accidents,” explained Keerthi K Radhakrishan, one of the innovators.She said their product consists of an integrated system indicating safe landing on the runway. The system includes an array of transmitters emitting unique frequency signals installed on both sides of the runway touchdown zone. The rays emitted are sensed by the corresponding sensors set up on the aircraft. She said this process clearly defines the runway to the pilot. “If the airplane makes a proper landing on the touchdown zone, the sensors installed on the flight are activated and the system will indicate to the pilot that a safe landing has been made. If the landing was incorrect, the sensors will not be activated and the system would alert the pilot with an audio and a visual warning. This includes triggering the pilot’s attention to abort the landing and initiate a go-around,” she said.Kaimal said the second part of the innovation is more important. “In critical situations, lakhs of neurons which are developed from fear and anxiety of pilots are picked up by brain jelly sensor and then amplified electro-magnetically. Thus, flight mode can be changed to autopiloting,” he said, adding that because of the unavailability of the jelly sensor and its high cost, the second part of the experiment was lagging. He said the new project can help pilots get a good assessment of the landing and automatic takeoff using brain jelly sensors in critical conditions. He said after the patent is received, the technology will be transferred to firms and airports that show an interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/young-innovators-develop-system-to-avoid-mishaps-at-tabletop-airports-101624608657363.html
25-06-2021||Delhi||When BJP was busy with polls, I was fighting for oxygen for Delhi: Kejriwal||Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to not call the residents of the national capital liars, and said that when the party was busy with election campaigns, he was fighting and begging to arrange oxygen for them. Kejriwal tweeted, “My fault that I fought for 2 crore Delhi residents. When you [BJP leaders] were busy with election campaigns, I was awake all night arranging medical oxygen. I fought, I begged to ensure oxygen for people of Delhi. People have lost their dear ones for oxygen shortage. At least don’t call them liars, they will feel terrible about it.”Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday also accused the BJP of misleading people and said that findings of the Supreme Court-appointed audit committee that Delhi’s medical oxygen demand during the worst Covid-19 surge was exaggerated, and did not exist.“We have heard of a so-called report that claims oxygen demand in Delhi was exaggerated. BJP leaders have been citing such a report against the AAP government. The truth is: There is no such report. The BJP is misleading people. No such report exists.

Closing your eyes to truth doesn’t alter the truth.”Sisodia asked him to show the signed report of the members and said that this report had been prepared at BJP office and submitted by Central government in the Supreme Court.“Show me the signed report of the members. This report has been prepared at BJP office and submitted by central govt in SC. We will take it up in SC,” he tweeted.Sisodia said at the press conference, “The Supreme Court set up an oxygen audit committee. We spoke to members of the committee. They said that they have not approved or signed any report till now. Then what report is it? Where has it come from? I challenge the BJP to get a report which has been signed and approved by the oxygen audit committee.”“Such misleading statements and conspiracies are not okay in matters that are subjudice. We are all aware of the oxygen crisis in Delhi and the Central government’s failure in oxygen management across the country. Instead of taking responsibility, the BJP is citing reports that do not exist. The BJP created this report in its headquarters and called it the report of the oxygen audit committee.“It is an insult to people who lost their loved ones because of BJP’s oxygen mismanagement. Were the patients, doctors, and hospitals lying? So many parties went to the court – were they all lying? BJP leaders are lying,” said Sisodia.“BJP’s lies are unrelenting and heinous, should be called Bhartiya Jhagdaalu Party for shirking responsibilities, Modi ji needs to manage his party,” Sisodia added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/scappointed-oxygen-audit-panel-hasn-t-okayed-any-report-dy-cm-manish-sisodia-101624605893850.html

The current investigation pertains to June 15 arrests of seven persons from Mumbai and Thane and seizure of 17.3 kilograms of hashish from them. Preliminary probe revealed that two of the arrested accused -- Rajvinder Singh and Gurmit Singh -- had travelled from Punjab to Mumbai on bikes, purportedly carrying the contraband in their backpacks, said NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. Also Read | NCB nabs Pak-linked drug dealer from HoshiarpurInvestigation revealed that Kaskar was the main supplier of the contraband material, said another official. The agency is also investigating the terror angle in the drug supply, as high quality hashish generally comes from Kashmir and lands in bulk in Punjab, from where it is sent mostly to Mumbai, Pune, and Goa, the officer added.Kaskar, deported from the United Arab Emirates in 2003, was said to be operating Dawood’s real estate business in Mumbai and surrounding areas, the police said. On September 18,2017, the Thane anti-extortion cell arrested him along with two of his accomplices — Mumtaz Shaikh and Israel Sayyed — for allegedly extorting ₹30 lakh from a Thane-based builder.One more accused Pankaj Hangar, 54, a gambling den owner, was arrested in the case subsequently, as police found he was in touch with Kaskar and Shakeel, a Dawood henchman.On October 11 the same year,Thane police slapped stringent provisions of the MCOCA on the seven accused: four arrested and three wanted — Chhota Shakeel and two Dawood gang shooters, Shammi and Guddu. Thane police later found that Kaskar, Sayyed and Shaikh had allegedly extorted gold from a jewellery shop owner. Eventually, Thane police registered two more cases against the gang and Kaskar was named in all. His brother Dawood has also been named as a prime accused in one of three cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncb-takes-dawood-s-brother-iqbal-kaskar-in-custody-in-drugs-trafficking-case-101624604754064.html

Shekhawat has denied his voice was on the audio clips, which were uploaded on social media. Also Read | Cabinet expansion Rajasthan CM’s prerogative: Independent MLAs support GehlotJoshi said if Shekhawat is clean, then why is he running away. “He is a fugitive on moral grounds. He should appear before the ACB and give a voice sample,” Joshi said as Congress workers shouted slogans calling Shekhawat a fugitive.Joshi accused Shekhawat of making baseless allegations of phone tapping. “You have no faith in the Rajasthan Police and are not giving your statement or voice sample. What should be understood by this? He should cooperate with the Rajasthan Police or else people will call him a fugitive.”Joshi said the FIR Shekhawat lodged in Delhi in March over alleged phone tapping has no grounds. His comments came as he refused to appear before the Delhi Police for questioning in the phone tapping case. Joshi said he has not been named in the FIR against Lokesh Sharma, an officer on special duty in chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s office. Sharma is accused of circulating the audio clips purportedly about a conversation about toppling the Congress government in Rajasthan.Sharma has rejected the allegations and moved the Delhi high court seeking quashing of the FIR against him.BJP state chief Satish Poonia cited the slogans raised against Shekhawat and said that Congressmen may have been remembering “their ancestors and hence raised them”. He said Rajasthan is known for politics of harmony and ideological struggles. Poonia added Gehlot and his loyalists have started politics of animosity. “The country is watching how Congress leaders are speaking against the Prime Minister and home minister...now such words against Union ministers are condemnable.”Poonia said no one becomes a fugitive if some people raise slogans. “It is their frustration and guilt that is coming to the fore. Earlier, there used to be ideological fights in politics in the state but now Congress has hit a new low.

Outpatient department (OPD) services remained non-functional in most government hospitals as protesting doctors refused to attend to patients. Also read: India’s vaccination not fast enough to foil Covid-19 3rd wave: ReportThe call for the day-long strike was given by the Joint Punjab Government Doctors Coordination Committee, which has members from the Punjab Civil Medical Services Association and is supported by the Punjab State Veterinary Officers Association, Punjab Medical Teachers Association, Rural Medical Officers Association, Punjab Dental Medical Officers Association and Punjab Ayurveda Officers Association. Black badge protest at medical college in Faridkot All OPDs in civil hospitals in Faridkot, Moga, Bathinda, Muktsar, Ferozepur and Fazilka districts remained closed. Patients unaware of the strike reached hospitals only to return after waiting to be attended. The OPD services at Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital in Faridkot was, however, functional. A few doctors of the medical college did not join the protest, while others registered their protest by wearing black badges on duty. Dr Shilekh Mittal, the medical superintendent of the medical college and hospital, said: “There has been some impact on OPD services due to the strike but we are providing treatment to all patients. We have medical students on duty along with doctors, so patients are not facing any problem.” Dr Chander Shekhar Kakkar, a senior vice-president of the PCMS Association, Punjab, said that all OPDs have been closed in the state to protest against the pay commission recommendations. “If the state government does not accept our demands, a decision will be taken after consulting association members to scale up the protest by closing more services on Monday. Our main demands are the restoration of NPA, 5% house rent to doctors and higher education allowance to all doctors equally,” he said. “The medical college is providing OPD services despite the strike call. All medical college doctors do not directly come under the state health department and they also have interns. But we are going to ask them to close the OPD in support of the strike as this is a joint protest of doctors,” he said. Emergency, Covid services unaffected The OPD services besides academic and administrative work remained suspended at Government Rajindra Hospital and dental college in Patiala. Punjab State Medical and Dental Teachers Association general secretary Dr DS Bhullar said emergency and Covid-19 related services are on and these will not be affected due to the strike. Rupinder Kaur, a patient’s attendant, said: “We have come for follow-up checks as my mother underwent surgery recently. Since the OPD services are unavailable, we have been told to visit some other day next week,” she said. Patients caught unawares in LudhianaHealth services in Ludhiana remained suspended in response to the PCMS Association’s strike call. Members of the Joint Punjab Government Doctors Coordination Committee, which includes PCMS doctors, rural medical officers, homoeopathy and ayurveda practitioners, held a protest and raised slogans against the state government.Besides OPD and IPD services, elective surgeries were also not conducted.Puja Rana of Field Gunj, who came to the civil hospital for skin treatment, said that the department was closed and she was asked to visit on Monday. Durgesh Kumar, a migrant who had come from Guru Arjan Dev Nagar near Samrala Chowk, said that he was suffering from stomach pain but on reaching the civil hospital, he was told that OPD services were suspended. “I work in a factory and can’t afford to take leave every day. Why should patients pay for this? Doctors should stop treating government officials instead.”Rohit Rampal, a member of Punjab Civil Medical Services (PCMS) Doctors Association, said: “Instead of giving extra allowance to Covid warriors, the government has decided to reduce the salaries of doctors.”He said that the NPA used to be 25% of the basic salary and the sixth pay commission, which aims to better the pay scales, has proposed to reduce this to 20% and also delink non-practising allowance from the basic salary.Doctors threaten indefinite strikeAmritsar: OPD services were disrupted in government hospitals in Amritsar district due to the strike by doctors. However, Covid-19 and emergency services remained normal. The doctors threatened an indefinite strike if their demand was not met.

The remaining dose was then stored separately. Tripathi, who is wanted in the case and has applied for anticipatory bail in Dindoshi session court, had accused the doctors of Shivam Hospital of perpetrating the scam in his application. Tripathi’s lawyer had said that on June 15, Tripathi recorded his statement with the Kandivali police naming the Pataria couple.Till Thursday, the Mumbai Police had registered seven FIRs in the vaccination scam.Bhoiwada police on Wednesday night registered the fifth first information report (FIR), while late Thursday evening, the Bangur Nagar and Borivli police stations filed the sixth and seventh FIRs respectively, in connection with the vaccination scam.

These students did not use the library, gymkhana and other educational facilities as they were not present in the college due to Covid lockdown, so they should not be charged for the same,” Samant said in the press statement.“Considering the problems of students and parents in the backdrop of the ongoing pandemic, it has been decided to give a discount of ₹16,250 to students,” he said.The amount will be deducted from fees that students will be charged for the 2021-22 academic year. This decision will benefit nearly 20,000 students across the state, the minister announced.Announced late Thursday evening, the decision came after a meeting between Samant, the principal secretary of the department of higher and technical education, the director of the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) and college professors.For the past year, several student groups have made similar demands from the University of Mumbai as well, asking the varsity to direct all affiliated institutes to not charge fees for facilities not used by students in over a year. The University instructed colleges to follow this rule in 2020-21 but for the new academic year, no such statement has been released by the authorities yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/engineering-students-in-maharashtra-s-govt-colleges-to-get-rs-16k-fee-discount-for-202122-101624598093473.html

Reports added that the boy's mother claimed her son attended the party of a volleyball coach in the Chamarajpet area of Bengaluru on May 31, when the incident occurred. According to a police complaint by the mother, which was filed last week, the host of the party allegedly dissolved unidentified tablets in water and injected the solution into her son’s forearm.Based on the complaint from the teenager’s mother, police registered a case against the youth under section 328 (causing hurt by means of poison with intent to commit offence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).“My son discontinued studies after class 10. On May 31, the coach invited my son for his birthday. He went to his house in Chamarajpet around 9pm and returned at 11 pm. About four days later, his right elbow was swollen. We went to Sanjay Gandhi hospital and doctors said there was a poisonous substance in the elbow and the forearm had to be amputated. When asked how it had happened, my son said at the party, the coach powdered some tablets, dissolved them in water and injected the same into his right arm,” the boy's mother said in her complaint, according to the Indian Express.Bengaluru Police have requested doctors at the hospital to submit a report on the poisonous substance found in the boy’s body. They will approach a court after the report is submitted, seeking permission to question the accused, who is in jail on charges of vehicle theft, regarding the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bengaluru-boy-loses-arm-after-friend-injects-drugs-at-birthday-party-101624597332245.html

But for the state tribal welfare department, getting the members of the 13 primitive vulnerable tribal group (PVTG) is proving to be a tough task, HT has learnt.Vaccine hesitancy among the 1.3 lakh people in the 13 PVTG groups, who are eligible for vaccination, has proved to be a headache for the officials.“Till now we have managed to vaccinate just about 17,000 of these 1.3 lakh people mostly in the 30+ age group. Though Dongaria Kondhs in Rayagada and Bondas in Malkangiri have shed their hesitancy, among the rest it persists. The people of tribal welfare department, as well as healthcare workers, are trying to create awareness but still, it’s proving to be a tough task,” said P Arthanari, project director of Odisha PVTG Empowerment Livelihood Improvement Programme.Till Thursday evening, Odisha had vaccinated more than 1.06 crore people of the eligible 3.09 crore people of which 19.53 lakh received two doses and the rest single doses of Covid-19 vaccine. On Thursday, it vaccinated 2.82 lakh people, much higher than what it managed to vaccinate in May and most of June.The PVTG groups are Birhor, Bonda, Chakotia Bhunjia, Didayi, Juang, Kharia, Dongria Kondh, Kutia Kandh, Lanjia Saura, Lodha, Mankidia, Paudi Bhuyan and Saura.In the second surge of the pandemic, around 160 people from these communities had tested positive for Covid. Many groups like the Chakotia Bhunjias who live in relative isolation in the Sunabeda sanctuary were infected in the second wave.Officials said while many of them were hesitant to get tested for Covid-19, the reluctance to get vaccinated is proving to be a big challenge. “We are trying to overcome this challenge. We have got interpreters to convince them in their language,” said PK Mishra, special officer, Lanjia Soura Development Agency in Gajapati district.Gram Vikas, an NGO which conducted a Covid-19 assessment among 61,034 people in the tribal-dominated districts of Gajapati, Ganjam, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Keonjhar and Sundergarh, found low rates of vaccine coverage. There is still lots of vaccine hesitancy among the tribals and rural communities, an official of the NGO said.The officials said a video clip doing the rounds that predicted that those vaccinated would dye in the next two years proved as one of the biggest impediment in getting people vaccinated. In other areas, the tribals told healthcare workers that they trusted their village deity to protect them. In a village of Rayagada district early this month, the people fled by the time the vaccinators arrived.“They have their own belief system. They would rather believe in Dishari and Bejuni, their priests, than the modern medical system. As a tribal researcher working in a central government project, I have found it difficult to win their trust,” said PC Mohapatra of Koraput-based Council of Analytical Tribal Studies.However, there seemed to be some silver lining despite the hesitancy. In Rayagada district, around 1,700 Dongaria Kondhs have so far been vaccinated while in Malkangiri over 2,000 Bonda tribals have been vaccinated. “We did not expect the Bondas to agree so quickly to our pleadings for vaccination. I hope other tribals fall in line as well,” said Malkangiri chief district medical officer Dr Prafulla Nanda.Meanwhile, the SC/ST welfare department has started a daily wage compensation worth ₹100 for 14 days for all PVTG people who tested positive for Covid-19. As per the PVTG covid management strategy, a health kit, worth ₹2500, is being provided to every family of infected PVTG member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccine-hesitancy-persists-among-13-primitive-vulnerable-tribal-groups-of-odisha-101624596113665.html

25-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Old forgotten inboxes||The door looks weathered; so does the letterbox on it. The box is broken, there’s nothing inside. The next door on the street has a similarly dilapidated box. So does the door ahead. The lane is like a museum of letterboxes. Almost every house has one, each exuding the mood of a bhule bisre geet, an old forgotten song.Old Delhi is speedily altering. Familiar landmarks are giving way to new. Ramshackle mansions are being replaced by multi-storey housing. Local pizza outlets are popping up within a spitting distance of kebab stalls. Much is disappearing, but the Walled City’s old letterboxes are hanging on. If no longer as a utility, then as an overlooked exhibit.This is one of the areas in the Capital where residences are still equipped with such long-time metallic or wooden contraptions. But most are cobwebbed and dust-covered, as if untouched for years. One street to view them is in Kucha Chalan, which isn’t far from the former site of Daryaganj’s post office. (It’s been replaced by a car showroom.)Bearing their respective addresses, the little letterboxes here might have gone out of use, but they vividly evoke the days when people would handwrite letters to friends and patiently wait for handwritten replies, dropped into the box weeks later by the neighbourhood dakiya (postman) on bicycle. In houses with letterboxes, there would be the thrill of unlocking the little lock to collect the day’s catch. “In my time, trunk (phone) calls to relatives outside the city were expensive, so we would write letters,” recalls an elderly woman whose house is fitted with an inactive letterbox. She says that the box wasn’t freely accessible to everyone in her family—a revered elder would first scan all the letters for any “objectionable” correspondence.The worn out state of most of these boxes suggests the weakening of letter writing culture. That’s no proof of the death of paper mail. Many houses across the city, including modern apartment complexes, have letterboxes in some form or the other, stuffed daily with printed materials ranging from insurance documents and pizza delivery flyers to invoices, and perhaps even an occasional letter or postcard (what’s that?!)One house in Kucha Chalan stands out flamboyantly: atop a rusting metal letterbox is nailed its gleaming red-and-white wooden adaptation. The letterbox revival suddenly seems less hopeless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-old-forgotten-inboxes-101624572229418.html

It is currently undergoing testing and security audit. The NIC is also trying to add a face recognition system to ensure there is no attempt by proxy,” the official added.Once implemented, an applicant will not have to visit the regional transport office (RTO) to give the test for the learners’ licence. The project is likely to take off in about two months, the official said.Once the applicant clears the test, an e-learner’s licence with a validity of six months will be issued. “The process will require applicants to register on the transport department website, that will allocate them a date on which they can take the learner’s licence test from their homes. The applicant will go through a standard online tutorial, and can then take the test. The candidates will also have to sit for a test to check for colour blindness, after which the e-learner’s licence will be issued,” said the official.On June 22, the Delhi government also decentralised the process of issuing vehicle registration certificates by empowering the car/two-wheeler dealers to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/soon-learner-s-driving-licence-test-to-be-done-online-software-in-final-stages-101624571988179.html
25-06-2021||Delhi||‘E-divide a worry, unique learning need of the hour’||From addressing concerns on online education during the Covid-19 pandemic to suggesting innovative solutions to resolve multiple issues -- 100 students from classes 5 to 12 will on Friday be awarded for winning responses submitted for a nationwide competition – Lenovo Smarter Ed Scholarship, an initiative by the Hindustan Times. The winners will be given Lenovo laptops and tablets worth ₹25 lakh.Hundreds of students from classes 5 to 12 submitted entries in the form of essays, audio files, audio video files, or digital presentations, on the current online education system, documenting their concerns, ideas, and creative solutions.Around 200 students were shortlisted from the entries based on originality of thought, constructive recommendation, and creativity. The shortlisted students were interviewed virtually by senior editors and journalists from HT, who picked the 100 winners.A challenging timeSchools from across the country were shut following the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown imposed in March last year, pushing students towards online education in a matter of days.Though some schools reopened in a phased manner in January for senior students, the rise in infections during the second wave of Covid-19 led to them being closed again, and to the cancellation of the Class 10 and Class 12 board exams.Nandini Sharma, a Class 12 student at Ryan International School in Vasant Kunj and one of the winners of the competition, submitted an essay on the impact of Covid-19 on teenagers.“There was a slump for students of my age with a period of no creativity, because we have a lot of competitions in schools. I suggested introducing activities such as group discussions, movie presentations, analysis of out-of-syllabus topics, because they can sharpen our cognitive and creative abilities,” she said.Auvi Mukherjee, a Class 11 student of Bombay Scottish School in Mumbai, said, “I enjoyed online education and it was convenient to access lectures and classes from home. But I do not believe that online education will mirror offline education. Traditional learning experiences are different due to the environment and real-world experiences. Online learning can act as a resource repository, or maybe a substitute for bad weather days.”Interactive lesson plansSeveral younger students called for more interactive lesson plans. Ayush Datta, a Class 8 student of Delhi Public School in Kolkata’s New Town, said, “My experience with online learning has been pretty good. I think it would be much more interesting if the curriculum is made more interactive and engaging. Apart from this, we need to address the issue of the digital divide. We are lucky to have access to the internet but not all students have that access. We could maybe distribute devices and arrange for internet in rural areas.”Principals from several schools said the competition allowed children to explore the pros and cons of online learning and come up with feedback in their own schools.Prachi Ranadive, principal of Shishuvan School in Mumbai, said, “The essay topic was very close to the students because it was all about getting their views and insights. Though schools hold regular sessions to communicate with students, the competition gave children the individual opportunity to write and express themselves.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/edivide-a-worry-unique-learning-need-of-the-hour-101624571808909.html
25-06-2021||Delhi||Queues outside Metro stations spilling on to markets: Traders||Long queues outside Metro stations are causing crowding and traffic snarls in markets around stations, a delegation of traders told Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) managing director Mangu Singh on Thursday, officials and members of the delegation said.Long queues outside Metro stations, especially during peak hours, have become a common sight ever since the Metro resumed operations on June 7. The passenger load has almost doubled in the past fortnight, Metro officials said. On June 7, 680,000 passenger journeys, or trips, were carried out. This increased to 1.3 million on June 18. On June 20, 848,000 trips were operated and 852,000 on June 24.The delegation included members of the Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI).“Since Metro services reopened after the Covid-19 lockdown, only limited number of gates are kept open and entry and exit are managed from the same gate. We have asked DMRC to allow more gates to be opened and also to increase the frequency of trains so that crowd does not spill over to markets,” said Brijesh Goyal, chairperson, CTI.Goyal said more entry and exits should be opened at stations around markets such as Chandni Chowk, Kashmere Gate, Red Fort, and Rajiv Chowk. Traders said the intermittent closure of Metro gates to ensure social distancing on the network was causing crowding on roads near stations, and in parking areas.Metro officials admitted that crowding was happening around busy stations, and those that serve as interchange facilities. They added that strictly ensuring Covid-19 protocols inside and outside its premises was critical, leading to a number of gates not being used, and rigorous checks were being carried out to avoid crowding at stations.DMRC officials that the government guidelines for Covid management allow only alternate seats to be used, and do not permit standing. This means that the passenger carrying capacity has been reduced to 10-15% of the normal, the officials said. Another senior official said that each coach now carries 25-30 passengers, compared to about 300 earlier.“The long queues are caused as only single-entry points are permitted at most of the Metro stations. In a mass transit system, it is difficult to regulate the number of people inside the system once full entry is permitted,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications).Though the passenger carrying capacity has been curtailed, the Metro is conducting about 5,100 train trips every day at a peak frequency of 2.5 minutes to 5 minutes on major corridors. “This was the same frequency at which the Metro was operating during the pre-Covid times. The Metro is operating and running at its full frequency/capacity but with a reduced number of passengers due to restrictions,” Dayal said.But experts said that the agencies will have to ensure that while Covid norms are followed inside the Metro system, crowding is controlled outside stations.Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said a mass transit mode such as the Delhi Metro was designed to carry more standing passengers than sitting ones, adding that reducing the carrying capacity of trains to 10% (calculated based on pre-pandemic passenger traffic) will push the system to more losses. He pointed out, at the same time, that it was important Metro stations and trains do not become infection hot spots.“We really need to plan this carefully. It is important that rather than putting the entire onus of ensuring social distancing on the Metro, the government also play its part by controlling passenger load by staggering market hours, office timings, etc,” Ram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/queues-outside-metro-stations-spilling-on-to-markets-traders-101624569873614.html

Sood chose the latter and applied for refund on January 16, 2020.He was assured that refund would be processed within a period of 30 days from the date of application. However, on February 28, the gym refunded only ₹7,870 to him.On this, Sood moved the consumer forum stating that the gym failed to return the promised refund amount despite his several efforts.The registered notice sent to the gym management was returned with the report “unclaimed” and the case proceeded ex-parte.The consumer forum, said, “The gym management chose not to contest the consumer complaint to rebut the allegations of the complainant. We are, therefore, of the view that they have nothing to say about the allegations levelled. Hence, the act of not providing proper services and thereafter not refunding the balance amount to the complainant proves deficiency in service and unfair trade practice on its part.” It directed the gym to pay up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohali-gym-told-to-pay-up-6k-along-with-refund-amount-to-law-student-101624568272031.html

The three hospitals -- Alchemist Hospital, Sector 21, Paras Hospital, Sector 25, and Wings Hospital, Sector 25, -- revised 18 inflated bills. The development comes after the Panchkula administration issued show-cause notices to these hospitals. After reconciliation of 18 bills, the hospitals were asked to refund the overcharged amount by June 23. The patients were charged anywhere between 42% and 345% more than the rates fixed by the government. Alchemist hospital has refunded the overcharge amount to four patients, Wings Hospital revised three bills while Paras hospital, which had the maximum complaints of overcharging, refunded money to 11 patients. Three of 11 patients at Paras Hospital had expired so the money was refunded to their kin. “The hospitals had charged 300 to 350% more than the rates fixed by the government. We had taken these 18 bills as test bills after complaints of overcharging started pouring in. The three hospitals have refunded the overcharged amount,” said BB Singhal, member of the district-level committee that was looking into the complaints. Singhal is also member of the Haryana State Pharmacy Council. The district-level committee has also recommended a self-audit of Covid bills by the hospitals. “The committee will randomly check the self-audited bills to ensure that people are not fleeced in the name of treatment,” added Singhal. MLA had flagged the issue Speaker of Haryana assembly and MLA from the Panchkula constituency, Gian Chand Gupta had even visited Paras Hospital after receiving complaints of overcharging. He had recommended the formation of a panel to look into the matter. Gupta had also written to health minister Anil Vij requesting for an audit of the bills issued by the private hospitals. A district-level eight-member committee, led by ADC Mohd Imran Raza, was constituted which, in its report, had said that the hospitals are not adhering to the government rates. In June last year, the Haryana government had issued an order capping the daily package rate for Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals between ₹8,000 and ₹18,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fleecing-during-covid-treatment-3-pvt-hospitals-in-p-kula-refund-excess-fee-101624568091665.html

Between April and May, when the tricity was battling the second wave of Covid, the hospital had fleeced around 100 patients, charging around ₹50,000 to 1 lakh more than the set limit from each patient. An inquiry by a team led by sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Jagdeep Sehgal had found that the hospital was charging around ₹20,000 a day from Covid patients. As per the rates set by the government, a private hospital can charge ₹16,500 a day from a patient requiring ventilator support while for a bed without a ventilator, the charges are capped at ₹14,500 a day. This includes all expenses including room rent, visiting charges, and PPE requirements. “Mayo Hospital was found to be offering a package of ₹40,000 for the entire span of hospitalisation but was adding ₹6,000 a day as visiting charges, which is illegal,” said report submitted by the SDM had stated. On May 29, a case was registered under Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and Section51 (b) and 58 of the Disaster Management Act 2005, Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Acts at Phase-8 police station. 3 directors write to bank for stop cash credit limit Meanwhile, three of the total eight directors of the hospital have written to the bank to stop the cash credit and overdraft facility, which the hospital is using to refund the money. In a letter to HDFC bank, the three directors – Dr Deepak Tyagi, Dr Manoj Sharma and Dr Virender Dhankhar – said the hospital is facing financial crisis and there is a dispute among board members over operating the said account. When contacted, HDFC branch manager Deepak Wadhwa confirmed that he has received a letter from three directors but added, “We will not act unless we get a resolution from the board of the directors in this regard.” Acting chief executive officer (CEO) of the hospital, Dr Rajesh Gulia said, “We are refunding the overcharged money to Covid patients. To date, we have refunded around ₹25 lakh to 28 patients. As far as the three directors are concerned, one director Dr Deepak Tyagi is already under suspension, and we are holding a board meeting to decide the further course of action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mayo-hospital-refunds-25-lakh-to-28-patients-overcharged-for-covid-treatment-101624567371523.html

This is much higher than the Covid CFR of the city, which currently stands at 1.3% with 807 deaths and 61,542 cases so far.As per the data provided by the UT health department, all 10 black fungus fatalities have taken place at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, which has so far admitted 22 patients from the city. Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has admitted 16 black fungus patients while two patients are undergoing treatment at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16. Another one has been admitted at a private hospital in the city. Of the 10 black fungus fatalities, seven were infected with Covid-19 while three had no history of the viral infection.Professor Surinder Singhal, head of ENT department at GMCH-32, said, “Due to post-Covid complications, many people are getting infected with mucormycosis. Many of them succumbed to post-Covid complications but since they were also infected with black fungus, these deaths were added to the list of black fungus fatalities.”Prof Singhal added, “Most cases coming to GMCH-32 are referrals from other hospitals. By the time they come here, they are already in a critical state and have already been administered amphotericin B antifungal drugs for days at the previous hospital.”He revealed that even before Covid outbreak, the CFR of mucormycosis hovered around 40 to 80%. Prof Singhal advised people who have recovered from Covid-19 to monitor their blood sugar levels and continue wearing masks to avoid getting the fungal infection. Condition better than Punjab hospitalsAs hospitals in Chandigarh also cater to patients from nearby cities and states, the total number patients admitted here (including residents and non-residents) stands at 467, of which 34 have succumbed so far. This takes the total CFR in city hospitals to 7.2%. The figure is lesser than Punjab hospitals where the CFR stands at 9.28%. Symptoms to watch out forMucormycosis is a rare but serious fungal infection which can disfigure people even when it is not fatal. The infection can affect the sinus, eyes, lungs, jaws and teeth and sometimes brain of the patient. Health experts say that Covid survivors, who don’t follow the post-recovery instructions of the doctor, especially those pertaining to blood sugar levels and intake of medicines, are more prone to the fungal infection. Dr Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head, medical microbiology, PGIMER, said, “People with symptoms such as nasal blockade or congestion, nasal discharge (bloody or brown/black), facial pain, numbness or swelling or blurred vision must contact doctors at the earliest to control the infection spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/25-of-those-infected-with-black-fungus-in-chandigarh-succumbed-101624566772636.html
25-06-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Falling prey to gory crimes, kids no longer safe at home||From child marriage to sexual assault and murder, crimes against minors perpetuated by their family members over the last few months point towards a disturbing trend. As many as four such cases have been reported in the district in the last five days alone. Home is not a safe place for numerous toddlers, children and teenagers anymore, more so for girls, as they are stalked by sexual predators, smothered in infancy or married off against their wishes at the earliest convenience. Teenaged girls are already vulnerable to be kidnapped on the pretext of marriage in the district as evidenced by a report of the National Crime Records Bureau. Of the 195 cases of kidnapping reported in the city in 2019, 175 victims were minors and of the 62 rape cases reported in 2019, 17 victims were minors.Children are often brutally thrashed on making small mistakes in several families. As per Dr Rajiv Sharma, consultant psychologist, as children are physically weak, they are easy to overpower and manipulate, which makes them easy targets.“In most of cases, it was seen that the reason for children being abused by family members was drug abuse, lack of education and financial instability. Child marriage has been mostly observed in low-income families,” he said. In case of sexual assault on minors, the abusers are mostly under the influence of drugs or liquor, Sharma said, adding that such incidents leave a lasting impact on the psyche of children. Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said, “We make it a point to act immediately in cases involving minors and women. We have trained officials to deal with these cases sensitively.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-falling-prey-to-gory-crimes-kids-no-longer-safe-at-home-101624565993390.html

For one month, due to the lockdown restrictions, the parking lots remained vacant. In addition to the markets, tourist areas like Sukhna Lake also remained shut. We have requested the MC for exemption for the period.”The civic body may consider their plea. “We have not made any proposal for exemptions so far. We are seeking more information and detailed documents on the issue. The contractors have sought full waiver, but we are analysing how much is justified, if any. The final call on the issue will be taken by the MC general house,” said Jain.Relief plea not for the first time The MC had auctioned both the paid parking zones for over ₹10 crore annually. But so far, the contractors have been given either partial or complete exemption from payment of dues in the past one year.In 2020, in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown, the civic body waived off licence fee for April and May. Thereafter, contractors were allowed to deposit 35% to 45% of the fee for June 1 to August 31.In its October 2020 general house meet, the civic body had decided not to give any further waiver from September. The members had contended that financial activity in the city had picked up and markets and offices had been allowed to open.However, after the contractors threatened to withdraw their services, the MC allowed a partial waiver of the licence fee — ranging from 45% to 65% — for September, October and November. It had decided to charge the full fee from December onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-parking-contractors-seek-waiver-of-licence-fee-from-mc-101624565937295.html

PU vice-chancellor Raj Kumar on the recommendation of screening-cum-evaluation committees ordered the promotion of these faculty members, in anticipation of the approval of syndicate and senate. At present, the governing body of the university is not in place due to pending elections.The senate, which is PU’s supreme governing body, has the power to take the final call on promotion of teachers. The cases are also taken up by the syndicate prior to the senate’s ultimate call.The interview/screening of these faculty members were conducted earlier this year after continuous protests by PUTA. However, the promotion letters were delayed in absence of the governing body.Last month, the PUTA executive in its meeting had unanimously condemned the callous and apathetic attitude of the vice-chancellor for causing an inordinate delay in issuing appointment letters to the teachers under CAS.PUTA President Mritunjay Kumar said, “This was our long pending demand and teachers are satisfied now. The faculty members are also appreciating PUTA’s efforts.”The CAS promotion has remained a key issue in the recent years and was one of main agenda during last year’s PUTA elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/finally-115-panjab-university-faculty-members-get-promotion-101624565936308.html

They were joined by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders and workers, and slogans were raised against the Congress government of the state.As the protesters gathered near the chief minister’s residence, police blocked them with barricades, evicted them from the site and detained them briefly.Taking a dig at the government, the protesters said if it could offer jobs to the sons of two Congress MLAs on compassionate grounds, then there is no reason why it cannot give jobs to them.They were referring to the Punjab cabinet’s decision to appoint Qadian MLA Fatehjang Singh Bajwa’s son Arjun Partap Singh Bajwa as an inspector in the Punjab Police and Ludhiana MLA Rakesh Pandey’s son Bhisham Pandey as a naib tehsildar in the revenue department on “compassionate” grounds.AAP legislator Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer said the special athletes were more qualified and fit for government jobs than the sons of Congress MLAs and leaders.The Amarinder Singh-led Congress government made a lot of announcements for sportspersons, but most of them are living in poverty now, he said.The AAP leader added that para-athletes had staged a ‘dharna’ last year as well to remind the government of its promise of jobs to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paraathletes-protest-near-punjab-cm-s-house-in-chandigarh-demand-jobs-101624565873000.html

Anil Grover, a resident of Sector 50, had made a booking through MakeMyTrip India Private Limited on October 21, 2018, for an international holiday package to Dubai from December 2 to December 7, 2018. He made an initial payment of ₹43,000 and applied for a tourist visa for two people through the firm. However, one of the applications was rejected twice, following which Grover requested the firm to cancel the booking and refund the amount, which was denied. The consumer commission was approached on January, 21 The firm had told court that it facilitates confirmation of the booking and would not have any obligation or liability towards visa services. Hence, there was no deficiency in service or unfair trade practice on their part. The panel observed that trip was purely dependent on the issuance of visa and it was the responsibility of the firm to make fully-refundable bookings and apply for the visa on time. “ (It) ..being a giant travel company needs to design their package and refund policy better, keeping in mind the visa processing time and the possibility of a rejection. The complainants should not be penalised if the trip was cancelled solely on account of visa rejection, which was a pre-requisite for travel,” the commission said, adding that the firm had industry expertise, connections and time to make non-refundable bookings. Thus, it is a case of deficiency in service, it said. Now it has been ordered that travel firm will refund an amount of ₹44,835 along with interest at the rate 9% per annum from the date of payment and pay ₹10,000 as compensation and make another payment of ₹7,000 as cost of litigation. It has been ordered that decision be complied with within 30 days, failing which, rate of interest would go up by three percent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/deficiency-in-service-consumer-panel-asks-travel-portal-to-pay-60k-to-chandigarh-man-101624565871353.html

It was initially suspected that the woman, Manpreet Kaur, and her two children – aged four and two – were being kept in illegal custody in Ludhiana, following which the Ludhiana unit of the police was roped in, said additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, investigation) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti. Manpreet could not be traced in Ludhiana and had kept her phone switched off to avoid detection, Bhatti said. “We learnt that the woman had stayed at a shelter home in Jalandhar and later found out that she had also sought shelter in ashrams in Ludhiana as well. Following her trail, the police traced her at her maternal home, a day after she reached there,” said the ADCP.Manpreet said she had avoided going to her parents’ home for as long as possible and had chosen to stay at ashrams instead because she knew her husband will contact her parents. She had to return to her parents after ashrams refused to accommodate her without informing the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/missing-for-23-days-moga-woman-2-kids-traced-101624565571287.html

25-06-2021||Chandigarh||Money-laundering case: ED allegations frivolous, says Khaira||Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira on Thursday accused the Enforcement Directorate (ED) of levelling “frivolous” allegations against him in a money laundering case. Calling the ED allegations an attempt at “character assassination”, Khaira, who had joined the Congress three weeks ago, said he completely rejects and debunks all charges of financial irregularities. In March, the ED had carried out raids on the premises of Khaira and his family members in a money laundering probe linked to the 2015 Fazilka drugs smuggling case and fake passport racket. The agency has alleged that Khaira is an associate of drug case convicts and fake passport racketeers. The two-time MLA’s statement was in response to the ED notices summoning fashion designers Ritu Kumar, Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Manish Malhotra, from whom Khaira had purchased clothes for the wedding of his daughter. Khaira said these payments, which are nominal, were made in 2015-16. He said he had purchased three wedding dresses for his daughter and his family and these ranged from ₹7 to ₹8 lakh in total. The source of the money paid to the fashion designers was his overdraft account in a bank in Jalandhar, he added in a statement. The MLA alleged that attempts were being made by the ED to malign him by repeating the same old charges of fake passports and the NDPS case. Khaira had won the 2017 election as candidate of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). He rebelled against the AAP leadership two-and-a-half years ago, floated his separate party and then rejoined the Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/moneylaundering-case-ed-allegations-frivolous-says-khaira-101624564431156.html
25-06-2021||Delhi||What’s in a name? New gangs of Delhi, notoriety for old villages||Google the words “Sandeep Singh gangster”, and the search engine shows over 500,000 pages on several alleged criminals named Sandeep Singh. The top results also throw up references to hockey player Sandeep Singh, the former captain of the national team. But there is nothing on Sandeep Singh, Delhi’s most wanted gangster because very few people know the 35-year-old by his real name. Instead, in police files, media reports, and even court papers, he is Sandeep Kala Jathedi, or simply Kala Jathedi.Jathedi is an urban village on the Delhi-Sonepat border.Now search for Kala Jathedi, and the engine will give over 600,000 sites with the fugitive’s name. There are also explainers about the gangster, how he operates in Delhi while he is believed to be in Dubai, and his alleged links to the recent murder case in Chhatrasal stadium in which police arrested two-time Olympic medallist wrestler Sushil Kumar.And, of course, there are details of the nondescript, but now dreaded, hamlet he comes from.Jathedi is not the only Delhi village in recent months to gain notoriety because of its link with a gangster. Several villages in the outer rim of the Capital have become infamous because the names of several top gangsters are attached to the villages. In court and police records, their gangs are known by the village names.Some of Delhi’s other top gangsters — Sandeep Jathedi, Neeraj Bawana, Nitu Dabodia, Tillu Tajpuria and Vikas Langarpuria — have all chosen to adopt their village names. A trend that the residents of these villages say has brought fear and notoriety to the places where they live and grew up in — places that were otherwise harmless and ordinary, but which are now in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.For example, on May 19, when police arrested wrestler Sushil Kumar, he was with his friend Ajay Sehrawat. When confronted by investigators, Ajay told him that his name was Ajay Bakkarwala, a resident of Bakkarwala village in outer Delhi. Police immediately knew they had to take him seriously.Residents perturbedSubash Solanki, a retired DTC bus driver and a resident of Bakkarwala is perturbed by the link that, he says, is sullying his village.“More than 200 years ago, an Afghan traveller was passing by our village and saw thousands of cattle grazing in the open fields. He was surprised that our village had so many cattle. He had never seen a sight like that. We were told that the traveller had given the name of the village as Bakkarwala. Bakkar in Urdu means cattle. Ours was the village of cattle grazers. But today, Bakkarwala is seen as a criminal village,” he said.So notorious is the Bakkarwala gang for carjacking across the city that police officers say the first thing they do when a new case is registered is open the crime dossier and check the status of members of gangs of Bakkarwala gang, to see if any of them were in the vicinity of where the incident took place.One of its residents, Manoj Bakkarwala stole over 500 vehicles and was involved in numerous cases of carjacking until 2012. Nobody in Delhi Police remembers Manoj’s actual second name. Manoj’s son, who was arrested last year for similar crimes, is also simply identified as Ashish Bakkarwala.Thirty-five kilometres away from Bakkarwala, on the Delhi-Haryana border, is Tajpur, another Delhi village that has earned the notoriety for multiple cases of extortion, robbery and land grabbing associated with Sunil Maan, better known as Tillu Tajpuria.Sunil Jaat, who runs a gaushala in Tajpur, said: “People outside our village judge us these days when we say we are from Tajpur. Because of media reports, people think the village is full of criminals. Tajpur is famous for having many wrestling rings and producing many wrestlers. We have Arjuna Award winners such as Om Vir Pehalwan from our village. Even today, most drivers in Delhi Police who work as constables, or in the fire department, are from our village.”Jaat admits that Tajpur will find it hard to shed the label given to it by Tillu Tajpuria. “Tillu Tajpuria became his name after he got into the wrong side of the law. To us, he was a promising wrestler who had a promising future. He may be in jail but his accomplices keep getting arrested, and the name Tajpuria keeps coming up again and again,” he said.The one village that has gained the most notoriety is Bawana. Located in the northern part of the city — 47 kilometres from India Gate — the urban village is a mix of farmers who have been living in the village and tens of thousands of migrant workers who work in the factories.One of its best-known residents, often mentioned in the media, is Neeraj Sehrawat, better known as Neeraj Bawana. Until his arrest in 2015, Bawana was the most wanted gangster in Delhi. Even today, Bawana’s gang continues to operate in several parts of the city and are often arrested in cases of extortion and robbery. Residents of Bawana village, who asked not to be named, say that Neeraj Bawana alone is responsible for bringing their village to disrepute.A Delhi police constable, who lives in Bawana, said: “Neeraj Bawana made our village famous for the wrong reasons. Sometimes, when I tell my own colleagues about my house in Bawana, the first thing they ask me is about Neeraj Bawana. Nobody talks about the many lawyers or a famous judge in the Delhi lower judiciary that our village has produced. Our elders say that among all villages in Delhi, Bawana sent many soldiers in the British army during World War 1. Nobody talks about this. People think that Bawana is a village of gangsters.”‘Sense of protection’Delhi Police officers say it has become fashionable for wannabe gangsters to use their village name as it gives them a false sense of protection.“The younger ones think they are recognised if they say they are from Bakkarwala gang or Tajpuria gang. They choose to use the village names as their second name. This is why the village’s names gets tarnished. When a trader in Delhi received a threat call from a person, who identified himself as XYZ Bawana it makes an impact. If the same person identifies himself as XYZ Jangpura (a place in south Delhi), very few will take him seriously. Unfortunately, this is the level of how much the villages have been tarnished,” a mid level officer from crime branch, who asked not to be named, said.Double-edged swordAdvocate LN Rao, who was in the Delhi Police for over three decades until he retired as a deputy commissioner of police in 2014, said using the names of the villages is a double-edged sword.“For the peace-loving residents, it becomes difficult to shed the village’s tag of notoriety. There are cases where people fear to get a prospective groom or bride from such villages. On the other hand, for the criminals, it works because they are also seen in the league of the notorious names from their village. Many youngsters who are yet to cross the line of the law also get swayed by this notoriety and sometimes take the wrong path in life,” Rao said.Earlier this month, Delhi Police arrested two 17-year-old boys for trying to extort ₹1 crore from an IT executive by claiming to be from Bawana and with links to Neeraj Bawana.On June 4, when police caught them, they confessed they were not from Bawana — had never even been there, had never met the jailed gangster, but believed that they could pull off the heist by simply claiming to be from Bawana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/whats-in-a-name-new-gangs-of-delhi-notoriety-for-old-villages-101624563278609.html

Begin sample collections in the districts of UP that are closer to such states that have confirmed cases of Delta-Plus and then get genome sequencing done on those samples,” he said to officials.The chief minister said that all necessary equipment required for genome sequencing should be arranged at Lucknow’s King George’s Medical University (KGMU).The strategies that the state government had been applying so far proved effective in controlling Covid-19 infection in the state and the policy of ‘trace, test, treat’ must continue with efficiency, he said.He said that in the past 24 hours, a total of 229 fresh cases of Covid were reported in the state, while 308 patients recovered and were discharged from hospitals, and only 3,552 cases were active across the state.

The trader, Barinder Singh, had allegedly availed ₹98 crore input tax credit (ITC) through bogus billing by creating 12 dummy firms. Singh was arrested after DGGI search teams led by additional director Rituraj Gupta and joint director Daljit Kaur, comprising 35 officers, conducted raids at 16 locations. He has been sent to judicial remand till July 7.Incriminating evidence was seized from the residential and business premises of the accused, including electronic and IT devices. Officials said Singh and his family members were operating three firms but had created 12 fictitious firms for issuing fake invoices to avail and pass inadmissible ITC without actually suppling goods through circular trading. The firms were created on the names of Singh’s employees or ex-employees. The accused was found involved in bogus outward supplies of around ₹600 crore, involving ITC of ₹94 crore and bogus inward supplies of ₹630 crore involving ITC of ₹98 crore. It is suspected that the accused had been involved in circular trading for at least three years. The three trading firms of timber and plywood were found to be engaged in making outward supplies to six of the dummy firms. Those six firms were then making outward supplies to another six dummy firms and the goods were ultimately returned to the three firms operated by the accused.An official said that different suppliers and buyers of these trading firms were under the radar of the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/630cr-bogus-billing-racket-busted-plywood-trader-held-in-ludhiana-101624564191964.html

Majithia also expressed “surprise” over the brazenness with which the Congress high command had gone about setting a deadline for the conclusion of the ongoing probe by SIT. “Whose order is the SIT expected to obey — high court or that of the Congress high command?” he asked. The SAD leaders said the Congress high command, its state unit and the state government have come to believe that only illegal arrests of Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhbir Singh Badal can save their credibility which lies in tatters. “We dare them to defy the law on this,” they added. Majithia and Cheema said (former minister) Navjot Sidhu had openly admitted that chief minister Amarinder Singh had told him about Congress’ design to purposely drag the probe till the last six months of their tenure to create a hype and milk the issue in the elections. They said the “political asylum” provided by AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal was also a part of a prior deal on sacrilege report against Akalis and narco test must also be conducted on him to unveil the entire conspiracy.It’s political drama: BJP Terming the questioning the Badals in the sacrilege and police firing cases as a charade, BJP national spokesperson Iqbal Singh Lalpura said the police has to gather evidence first and not make the accused witnesses in the crime.He said in the last 25 years the ruling parties in the state ruined the police institution by making it work fixing their rivals instead of conducting fair investigations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-seeks-probe-against-cong-aap-into-sacrilege-conspiracy-101624563955933.html
25-06-2021||Other||Petty politics on jobs used to target CM: MLA Bajwa||Chandigarh A day after declining the government job offer for his son, Congress MLA Fatehjang Singh Bajwa on Thursday slammed some of his party colleagues, including dissenting cabinet ministers, for using the government decision to target chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. At a press conference, the Qadian MLA, who has been under fire since the state council of ministers approved the decision last week, said that petty politics was played over the decision. He added that his family took a collective decision not to accept the job offer and that he had conveyed it to the party’s central leadership on Wednesday. Last week, the Punjab council of ministers had approved a proposal to appoint Arjun Partap as an inspector in the Punjab Police and Ludhiana North MLA Rakesh Pandey’s son Bhisham Pandey as a naib tehsildar in the revenue department on “compassionate grounds”. Cabinet ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Charanjit Singh Channi, Sukhbinder Sarkaria, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Razia Sultana had opposed the decision during the meeting. Later, Jakhar had also strongly criticised the decision, stating that the party and the government would be accused of promoting nepotism. Fatehjang said that before the cabinet meeting, he had requested the CM to withdraw the agenda of job offer, but the government went ahead. The MLA said his son, Arjun Partap Bajwa, has set a precedent by giving up the job offer. “(Punjab Congress president) Sunil Jakhar and cabinet ministers Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria should follow the same precedent,” he said. The Congress MLA said Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa’s son is the Gurdaspur zila parishad chairman, Sarkaria’s nephew is the chairman of the Amritsar zila parishad and Jakhar’s nephew is the chairman of Punjab State Farmers’ Commission.He also slammed Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal and other opposition leaders for politicising the issue. Thanking the CM for the job offer, Arjun said the issue had been blown out of proportion. “It would have been a tribute to my late grandfather. There are many ways I can serve the people of Punjab,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/petty-politics-on-jobs-used-to-target-cm-mlabajwa-101624563954778.html
25-06-2021||Chandigarh||As big fat weddings shed their flab, mares get kicked to the curb in Ludhiana||With the coronavirus pandemic sounding the death knell for the big fat Indian wedding, the new-age groom is opting to not gallop onto the wedding venue on a decked up white mare, a well-lubricated wedding procession in tow, but is instead zooming to the locale in a car or two-wheeler. While this departure from the age-old tradition has helped brides and grooms-to-be economise, it has certainly cost the equines and their owners dear. Staring at an unprecedented crisis since lockdown was imposed in March 2020, those in the mare business have been struggling to make ends meet, so much so that arranging feed for the animals is becoming tougher with each passing day. Reeling under fiscal losses due to the slump in business, owners of mares have found themselves under a mountain of debt a year on. Unable to feed and groom their mares any longer, many have put their mares on sale, but are finding no takers. Discounting the household expenses, mare owners have to spend ₹200 on each equine per day. However, left in a lurch with no income source, shelling ₹200 a day is also a tall order. No takers for mares on saleGursharan Singh, a mare provider, who inherited the business from his grandfather, says, “People are going for low-key weddings these days and mares are unfortunately not making the cut. With no earnings for over a year, I have had to borrow money to arrange bread and butter for my family. I have two kids and have to pay their school fee as well as such caring for the mares any longer seems infeasible. However, no one wants to buy the animals. The government keeps announcing restrictions but we are still waiting for relief.” “Three generations of our family have been in the business but we have never witnessed such a prolonged dry spell before,” says Singh. Those in the business of renting out mares can be seen sitting idle on the bus stand. In the pre-Covid era they would make a handsome profit between August and April. ‘Resume night-time weddings’ Ask them if the relaxations had helped boost business, the mare providers say day-time relaxations count for little as the slump will continue until night-time weddings resume. With only 50 people allowed in a gathering, hardly any customer is showing up. So, are any of them planning to change their vocation? The mare owners respond in the negative, saying they have been in the business for decades and do not know any other work. “I have 15 mares and the daily expenditure on them comes to around ₹3,000. Even as we struggling to feed our families, we have to arrange feed for these speechless animals. People are blind to our plight as we stare down an abyss of uncertainty. Even if bigger gatherings are allowed and business bounces back, it will take at least two years to clear our debts and get life back on track,” says one Tony.Stable boys rendered dependent on gurdwarasWhile mare owners sit idle and can no longer afford to pay staff, their stable boys have picked up odd jobs to survive. Another mare provider, Arvinder Singh Lucky, says,”While we can only wait for things to normalise, our labour has picked up odd jobs to make ends meet. Many a times, they rely on the local gurdwara for their meals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/as-big-fat-weddings-shed-their-flab-mares-get-kicked-to-the-curb-in-ludhiana-101624563953746.html
25-06-2021||Chandigarh||Capt announces setting up of Bhagat Kabir Chair in GNDU||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday announced setting up a Bhagat Kabir Chair in Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, ₹10 crore for the development of Bhagat Kabir Bhawan in Jalandhar.On the occasion of Bhagat Kabir Jayanti, the CM also announced that the government will soon disburse ₹560 crore to landless farm labourers under the debt waiver scheme.Virtually joining the people in paying respects to the 15th century mystic poet and saint Bhagat Kabir during a state-level function in Jalandhar, the CM said the Chair to commemorate Sant Kabir would undertake research on the life and philosophy of the great mystic poet. The Bhagat Kabir Bhawan, he said, would be built over 0.77 acres, of which 13,000 sq feet covered area would house a community hall with a seating capacity of 500. Of the ₹10 crore, ₹3 crore would be spent on the construction and ₹7 crore towards the land cost, he added. Referring to the post matric SC scholarship scheme, Amarinder said that the state government had released 100% funds during the 2020-21 academic session and had also amicably resolved the issue of pending payments with private colleges, which had been told not to withhold the roll number of any student. Slamming the Centre for abruptly withdrawing from the scheme, thus jeopardising the future of our students, the CM said the state government had launched Dr BR Ambedkar Post Matric Scholarship Scheme to bail out the students left in the lurch by the Centre’s decision, forcing the central government to also restore the scheme. Though the state had paid its 40% share, the central government was yet to release its funds, he added.Cabinet minister Sunder Sham Arora urged the people to follow the path shown by Bhagat Kabir, who vehemently opposed the prevalent caste system during his times. On MLA (Jalandhar West) Sushil Kumar Rinku’s request, the CM asked the sports department to examine the suggestion for an exclusive sports park for women in Jalandhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-announces-setting-up-of-bhagat-kabir-chair-in-gndu-101624563891325.html

We will also have to consider the threat owing to the Delta Plus variant, while planning to ramp up health facilities such as ICU beds, oxygen supply and field hospitals wherever required,” the chief minister said. The state government is on alert after 21 Delta Plus cases were found in the state. It has kept all 21 patients in isolation and they are being monitored round the clock. “For further studies, we will be checking their travel history, if they were re-infected or got infected even after getting vaccinated as the Delta Plus strain is capable of escaping antibodies developed with the help of the Covid vaccine,” state health minister Rajesh Tope said on Wednesday.“Do not take a decision on relaxations in haste even if there is a five-level plan in force. We are not in a position to take risks. If people are flouting rules in the name of relaxation, which can result in reversal of the situation, then we need to conduct a detailed study before taking any decision on relaxation,” Thackeray told district collectors in Thursday’s meeting.Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said the situation in the above districts can become a cause forconcern. “We will improve testing, contract tracing and vaccination in the seven districts. We will also provide required health infrastructure to deal with the situation.” The collectors demanded mobile testing centres to improve Covid-19 testing in their respective districts.The state government is reconsidering its five-level plan imposed for relaxations and is likely to bring stricter restrictions back in the state. This is being done in the backdrop of 21 Delta+ cases found in the state as the transmissibility and virulence of the virus is more than the other variants. The issue was discussed in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. The state task force also told the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that the five-level plan is unscientific and needs to be reconsidered, the officials said.Meanwhile, the state government has set a target of producing 3,000 metric tonnes of oxygen every day. At present, it produces 1,300 metric tonnes.Under its Mission Oxygen, also coined as ‘Swayampurna Maharashtra’, the state has set a short-term goal of 2,300 MT to be achieved in the next six months. The mission, which is expected to cost the state Rs1,100 crore, will have the participation of private players with the aim of at least one new plant in each of the six divisions.Thackeray also held a meeting with representatives of major oxygen producing firms and urged them to improve their production in the next three to four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/plan-keeping-in-mind-3rd-wave-delta-cases-uddhav-to-local-administrations-101624563833903.html
25-06-2021||Chandigarh||Protests against pay panel: CM sets up oversight committee of ministers||Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday constituted an oversight committee of ministers to resolve the grievances of the state government employees. Local government minister Brahm Mohindra, finance minister Manpreet Badal, social justice and empowerment minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, medical education and research minister OP Soni and health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu will be a part of the oversight committee, an official spokesperson said. The announcement came amid protests by the government employees’ unions and doctors against the “anti-employee recommendations” of the 6th Punjab Pay Commission approved by the state council of ministers. The state government employees have rejected the recommendations of the pay panel, particularly the formula used to calculate the increase in pay, and have gone on a five-day pen-down strike from Wednesday. Government doctors have given a call for strike on Friday and also announced mass resignation if the recommendation of the pay panel on delinking non-plasticising allowance (NPA) from basic pay is not dropped. The CM also directed the chief secretary to constitute an officers’ committee to personally listen to the grievances of the employees of various departments. The committee comprises Vivek Pratap Singh, KAP Sinha and Husan Lal, all senior IAS officers of the rank of principal secretary. The officers committee will regularly meet the employees and attempt to resolve their grievances. It will submit its report to the Oversight Committee for appropriate decision. “The state government is committed to redress all the genuine demands of its employees,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/protests-against-pay-panel-cm-sets-up-oversight-committee-of-ministers-101624563712381.html

25-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab falls behind other states in per capita immunisation, blames Centre for bias in vaccine supply||With Punjab lagging behind several other states in terms of per capita free vaccination for the 18-plus, the Amarinder Singh-led government has blamed the Centre for bias in supply of doses as compared to the BJP-ruled states. The state also raked up the issue in a video-conference with the Union ministry of health. “Not only Punjab but other opposition-ruled states have also taken up the matter with the Centre. Punjab was given 1.36 lakh doses on Wednesday with the state’s stock nearly 2.3 lakh doses. We have around 76,000 doses of Covaxin,” said a senior government functionary Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the Centre has not been providing enough vaccine to Punjab even as the vaccination drive has picked up pace in the BJP-ruling states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. “Haryana administered a record 5 lakh jabs in a day because they were having more stock of jabs. Similarly, an average vaccines administered daily in MP before June 20 was 1.75 lakh and it surprisingly increased to 17 lakh on June 21. It is a nine-fold increase. Also, Karnataka has made over five-fold increase in giving vaccines due to adequate supply of shots. The same is the case with Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat,” he added. Sidhu claimed that these BJP-ruled states have received the supply of not less than 5-17 lakh in a single day, while Punjab got just 16 lakh doses from June 1 to June 24. “This exposes the disparity in the supply of vaccine,” he added. The gap between the demand and supply in states is a matter of concern and equal distribution of vaccine is crucial for the success of the world’s biggest immunisation drive to save precious lives, the minister said. “If Punjab will have a stock of 2 lakh doses, it will automatically give 1-1.5 lakh a day. I have written to the Union health minister in this regard,” Sidhu said. In May, the state received just 17 lakh doses, while it got 16 lakh shots in June so far.

25-06-2021||Chandigarh||Death in Amritsar road rage incident: SUV ‘stolen’ from outside victim’s house at behest of accused, says family||A Mahindra Bolero SUV damaged in an alleged road rage incident in which a 29-year-man was killed in Amritsar three days back was forcibly taken away from outside the victim’s house on late Wednesday night at the behest of the accused, his family has alleged. Avtar Singh was bludgeoned to death allegedly by a Punjab Police sub-inspector’s son Anter Kahlon (prime accused) and his aides after an argument over passing of vehicles in the Kot Mitt Singh area of the city. His brother Hira Singh (25), who was accompanying him, was injured in the incident. The vehicle damaged with iron rods and other weapons was supposed to be taken in possession by the police soon after the incident, but was not. The family has alleged the SUV was “stolen” with an intention to destroy evidence in order to weaken the case. They were also issued threats by some unidentified persons, they claimed. The police have booked Kahlon and his seven of his aides but none of them has been arrested so far. The police have also failed to identify the other accused who according to them were involved in the incident. Besides, they are yet to collect the victims’ medical legal reports from hospital. Vipan Kumar, the deceased’s brother-in-law, said, “The vehicle was parked outside the house. Around 2am, two accomplices of Antar came and took the vehicle along. They also threatened to eliminate Hira Singh.” “It was not a road rage incident as is being claimed by the police. My brother-in-law was quite active in the area working with people and the accused wanted to assert his supremacy,” he added. Avtar’s wife Seema said, “No policemen approached us to take the SUV in possession. There has been no arrest due as Antar’s father is a cop. We will hold protest against the police if this goes on like this.” Antar is facing seven criminal cases, most of attempt to murder. Sultanwind station house officer (SHO) Parneet Kumar said, “After the incident, the vehicle was used by the victim’s family to take Hira to hospital. We asked the family to submit the vehicle, but they didn’t. We are investigating the vehicle theft incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/death-in-amritsar-road-rage-incident-suv-stolen-from-outside-victim-s-house-at-behest-of-accused-says-family-101624563651445.html

Police said Billa is an accomplice of one of the key accused, Malkiat Singh, alias Laddu, who was appointed as the Patti Truck Union president by Congress MLA Harminder Singh Gill. Aman Fauji, who was close friend of former SAD minister Adesh Partap Singh Kairon’s right hand man Gurmukh Singh Ghulla, and his accomplice Pooran, were shot dead by two car-borne men when they were returning after paying obeisance at a tomb in Patti on May 27.Earlier, police had arrested Laddu and three others were arrested for the killings. Police said Laddu hatched the conspiracy with one Lakhbir Singh, alias Landa, a notorious gangster presently living in Canada. The police have already got issued a red-corner notice against Landa from the Interpol. SSP Dhruman H Nimbale said Billa had conducted a recce before the murder. He had been absconding and was arrested from his home following a tip off, he said. The police have also identified two more accused involved in the crime. These two men, according to police, had supplied weapon and provided shelter to the accused who had executed the crime. The police, however, refused to identify the two men citing apprehension that they could flee. The duo was gunned down by gangster Preet Sekhon who was hired by Landa and Laddu. Sekhon has also been at large.

25-06-2021||Chandigarh||All-party meet: Some call it a good beginning, others doubt Centre’s intention||As almost all the leaders who attended the all-party meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday demanded restoration of statehood, political leaders and common people have kept their fingers crossed.The political leaders termed it a good beginning, but they still have apprehensions whether the promises would be fulfilled or not and if things that had been taken from the erstwhile state on August 5, 2019 will be returned. Many Kashmiris said that their scepticism over the meeting proved right.However, many are hopeful at least New Delhi will take some positive steps after Thursday’s meeting that last for more than 3.5 hours.Narwav Baramulla BDC chairperson and Congress leader Mir Iqbal said at least the dialogue has started. “But the outcome was not as expected.... Timeline should have been given for restoration of statehood as confidence building measure.”He said the PAGD should have demanded that the case in SC should be heard weekly so that special status issue also is settled down and a way ahead is chosen. The Apni Party leader and senior leader, Usman Majeed, said it was their party that voiced the public’s concerns. “We tried our best to get the people’s apprehensions alleviated at the highest level in the echelons of power in the country.”Adnan Ashraf, spokesman of the People’s Conference, said at least from negativity, things have started going towards a positive direction. “We have never left the hope for good.”Salman Sagar, former Srinagar mayor and NC leader, said former chief minister Omar Abdullah advocated for dialogue. “Yet again, he has shown the ideal representative character. Straight and laconic approach,” he added. Many locals said the outcome of the meeting was on expected lines. “It was no surprise. Talks over Articles 370 and 35 A were shut over the pretext that the case is in Supreme Court. We knew there won’t be any output. Sooner or later they had to take local leaders on board,” said Jan Mir, a businessman from Srinagar.“It was simply an ice-breaker. The Centre wanted to test to which level the local mainstream leaders have become workable with the new reality after spending months in jail and they were successful in that,” he added.Javaid Ahmad, who works in the tourism industry, said the people did not have many hopes from the exercise, particularly from the mainstream leaders.“At least the PAGD should have forcefully raised the issue of special status, but they didn’t even properly discuss that. The Centre had already committed to statehood and elections, but we didn’t even get a date for those. What tangible came out, nothing,” he said.Salim Ahmad, a teacher from the Old City, said the NC and the PDP should look beyond vote-bank politics over the special status of J&K.“Their sincerity over Articles 370 and 35A will be tested only when they will fight elections jointly or in the post-election scenario they will form a coalition. Right now, their talks are merely political rhetoric,” he said. An academic teaching in a degree college, on condition of anonymity, said the people of Kashmir are still processing the development.“It appears so contradictory. Local leaders formed an alliance to demand special status back and today, they appeared in a group photograph with those who jailed and humiliated them and hundreds of their land’s people. The development had no build-up which would have prompted this participation. People have to wait to understand what really happened,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/allparty-meet-some-call-it-a-good-beginning-others-doubt-centre-s-intention-101624563591236.html
25-06-2021||Chandigarh||BJP appeasing Valley leaders at our cost, say pro-Jammu parties||Though statehood remains an emotive issue on either side of the Pir Panjal range, PM’s all-party meeting at Delhi has drawn sharp criticism from pro-Jammu parties, including the West Pak refugees, PoJK refugees and the internally displaced Kashmiri Pandits. West Pak Refugees Front chairman Labha Ram Gandhi said, “We will be happy if Jammu and Kashmir becomes a state again, but we had to wait for 72 years for getting citizenship in J&K… it was not a separate country. However, even after abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A, we have not been given full citizenship rights. Today’s meet meant nothing to us as what Congress government used to do was repeated by the BJP…appeasing Kashmiri leaders at the cost of Jammu.” Chairman of the SOS International, a frontal organisation of PoJK refugees, Rajiv Chuni said, “At today’s meeting, there were more Kashmiri leaders than what used to be during Congress regimes. When J&K Reorganisation Bill was introduced, it rekindled hopes among us of getting 24 seats for PoJK in the assembly, but the government put a freeze on it. We faced the worst genocide. The BJP can’t be called representative of Jammu.” Ikkjutt chairman advocate Ankur Sharma said, “Today’s meeting was a total sell-out of Jammu. Delimitation of constituencies on the basis of fudged Census is again going to give power back to Kashmiris. Jammu will remain under Kashmir’s hegemony. Jammu’s interest has been compromised again.” Chairman of Panun Kashmir, an umbrella organisation of internally displaced Kashmiri Pandits, Ajay Chrungoo said, “More or less, the recognised pro-India parties, which had welcomed changes of August 2019 in J&K, have gradually started shifting towards the type of politics, which the Gupkar group have been projecting.. And that’s not a welcome thing happening”. He further said, “The government should have at its own level realised that the overground regional parties in the Valley like the National Conference, the People’s Democratic Party and segments of the Congress are basically publicly committed to restoring of the old status quo and they are not as yet endorsing the changes which have taken place. So by fulfilling certain of their conditions, the government is giving an impression that they are now moving back and are just reversing their position, which will be politically very destabilising.” Chrungoo further said, “Our stand on delimitation is very clear that it should be on the basis of new Census and there is still time for the government. Otherwise, holding the entire exercise on 2011 Census will be a subversive act.” “It appears the government didn’t want to disturb old Kashmir’s hegemonic order. It look like the Centre has given a signal that they are ready to take a step back and we know that just one step back, the whole thing is going to tumble down,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjpappeasing-valley-leaders-at-our-cost-say-pro-jammu-parties-101624563532483.html
25-06-2021||Chandigarh||PM should also seek opinion from Ladakh people: Ghulam Ahmed Mir||As all leaders across the board demanded restoration of statehood, Congress J&K chief Ghulam Ahmed Mir tells HT’s Mir Ehsan that though nothing was promised, they could feel that Delhi has realised that things need to be sorted out in J&K.How do you see today’s meeting with PM Modi and its outcome?We asked for the agenda but were told that people are free to speak on any line. PM Modi seemed to be curious and heard us patiently. So almost everybody spoke and demanded restoration of statehood in one voice, including the BJP leaders.What did the Congress tell PM during the meeting?We demanded five things during the meeting. The restoration of full statehood, constitutional protection of land and job rights, rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits and other displaced people and holding of elections at an earliest besides release of political prisoners. We told the PM that they should also seek opinion from the people of Ladakh region because there is also strong resentment about the bifurcation of J&K.Do you feel that the Centre is serious or the attitude has changed?Yes, I could feel that there is certain amount of pressure, either internal or from outside, but they have realised that things need to be sorted out in J&K. This was the beginning which has been welcomed by every participant.Did PM Modi promise something to the leaders?Nothing was promised, but the PM and the home minister told us that after delimitation process, elections would be held because that is the legal requirement. They also tried to clear apprehensions about the delimitation process and we assured that people will be involved at district, tehsil and block levels. They, however, said that the government is committed to restoring statehood.Did leaders stress on dialogue with separatist leadership or Pak?Nobody spoke about the dialogue with separatist leaders. PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, though, tried to clear her point of view on her statement about dialogue with Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pmshould-also-seek-opinion-from-ladakh-people-ghulam-ahmed-mir-101624563531257.html

It is also the worst episode of terror in Canadian history and is recognised as its National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism. In a statement, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said this “despicable act of terror remains the deadliest terrorist attack in Canada’s history. Sadly, it was not the last time Canada had to confront the malice of terrorism.”Family members said Canada needed to remain “vigilant” about terrorism. Among them was Deepak Khandelwal, who was just 17 when he lost his elder sisters Chandra and Manju. “I would say that Canada has to learn from the past, from these types of mistakes,” he said, adding he was painfully reminded of their absence particularly as the pandemic rages as both his sisters were in the medical field and could have helped at this time. Susheel Gupta, who lost his mother Ramvati on that doomed flight, went to the Ottawa memorial. Such memorial services, he said, “advocate on behalf of victims of terrorism, and we feel a responsibility to remind people that terrorism has occurred here and could happen again”.Indian officials laid wreaths at the memorials with India’s high commissioner Ajay Bisaria doing so in Ottawa, consul generals in Toronto and Vancouver, Apoorva Srivastava and Manish in their respective cities and the Representative of India to the International Civil Aviation Organisation Shefali Juneja visiting the site in Montreal.A virtual service was also held on a YouTube channel established by the Air India 182 Victims Families Association, where tributes to the deceased were also posted.These commemorative services on Wednesday were held under the shadow of the recent revival of the Khalistan movement in Canada. Events this year came as pro-Khalistan elements in Canada have hijacked protests over three farm laws in India to buttress their movement in the country. Indian officials have flagged this growing menace to Canadian authorities. The Indian consulate in Vancouver was blockaded by protestors on January 26 and pro-Khalistan slogans and speeches resounded outside the building that day, while in February and March, rallies taken out by the Indo-Canadian community to celebrate partnership between the two nations in combating the coronavirus crisis were confronted by groups brandishing Khalistan flags.This has led to plenty of concern being voiced by India to interlocutors in Ottawa in this context and the latest episode occurred this Sunday, when a group of two dozen Indo-Canadians took out a car rally in the Greater Toronto Area to face some violence as an opposing group again came bearing the Khalistan standard.

Rubbishing questions raised by the Bajwa family over the appointment of his nephew Ajay Vir Jakhar as chairman of Punjab State Farmers’ and Farm Workers’ Commission, the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief said that he (Ajay Vir) did not draw any salary or other emoluments. “The Bajwa family, by accepting a government job for its kin, has not only hurt the feelings of thousands of jobless youth but also damaged the reputation of the chief minister and the Congress, besides tarnishing their deceased father’s name,” a statement from Jakhar said. He added that even now by pretending to quit the job on moral grounds and throwing mud on others, Bajwa was trying to hoodwink the public and cover up their monumental blunder. It would be better if they admit the mistake and publicly apologise to the people of the state, he said. Jakhar said that as far as Ajay Vir being the chairman was concerned, he had not drawn a single rupee from the exchequer during his tenure as salary, or any other benefit. “He has a unique identity of his own. Due to his knowledge, vision and understanding of the agriculture sector, even before he became the chairman of the commission, he was being regularly invited by the Government of India for discussions before the annual budget for the past several years,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stop-mudslinging-tender-public-apology-jakhar-to-bajwas-101624562991210.html

Reason? Despite BMC’s tall claims of overachieving its target of removing silt from nullahs, they have remained uncleaned and had floating garbage and hardened silt, which can lead to waterlogging at Santacruz, Khar and Juhu Tara Road, if there is heavy rainfall this monsoon.The possibility that these areas can get waterlogged is backed by the findings of HT’s monsoon audit by a three-member expert panel, on Wednesday. The three experts examined BMC’s desilting and nullah-cleaning work at several areas in Gazdar Bandh at Santacruz. They found that the South Avenue nullah, Main Avenue nullah and P&T nullah were clogged with sewage, silt and a lot of floating garbage discharged on a daily basis from the slums located on the banks of the three nullahs. Citizens residing in slums constructed on the banks of the nullahs were partly to be blamed for discharging waste into the nullahs which are supposed to act as a channel for discharging the rainwater.South Avenue nullah discharges rainwater coming from SV Road towards Gazdar Bandh pumping station, which is located closer to the sea. According to the observation made by experts, not only is the nullah filled with waste, but BMC’s claim of desilting has also washed out, considering the huge amount of silt lying inside the South Avenue nullah.At Main Avenue nullah, the experts have observed that the road running parallel to the nullah was very narrow, which might cause difficulty in removing the cranes and other heavy vehicles amid waterlogging. Here too, one could easily spot waste floating and untouched silt inside the nullah.The scenario was no different at P&T nullah either. The only thing different here was that silt was collected and kept sideways towards the nullah to ensure that the water flow is not hindered. However, silt along with garbage floating in it were not removed. Owing to the condition of above three nullahs, residents in the area face waterlogging on all the roads, starting from the 10th to the 20th road in Santacruz and Khar, along with flooding of major arterial roads, including SV Road and Linking Road.According to BMC, it undertakes 75% of the required desilting every year before monsoon and 15% during the season. The remaining 10% is undertaken after monsoon. Surprisingly the data, prepared by the civic body claims to have achieved 102% of its desilting target for the western suburbs, as on June 2. According to BMC data, a total of 237,561.77 metric tonnes of silt was present in the nullahs and rivers of western suburbs, of which 179,062.18 metric tonnes had to be removed before monsoon. However, BMC claims to have removed 183,771.39 metric tonnes.Udaykumar Shiroorkar, former assistant municipal commissioner,, said, “The visual inspection indicates that no work has been done properly for western suburbs, and there is plenty of silt and garbage floating in it. The silt in the nullah has hardened, indicating that it has not been deposited recently. I would not go by BMC data, and my observation is from what I saw on ground, and that was not satisfactory.”DK Pathak, a former engineer of civic body’s storm water drainage department said that better cleaning of nullahs is needed to ensure that there is minimal scope of waterlogging. “What we saw on Wednesday in the western suburbs was that only half of the desilting work was completed,” he said.Santacruz resident Gautam Rao alleged that locals have been complaining of waterlogging around Gazdar Bandh area for 20 years now.“With time, the situation has worsened, as even Link Road and SV Road get waterlogged now. We had to go to the court to ensure that BMC takes measures to resolve the problem. They [BMC] spent over ₹100 crore and said the problem will be resolved once the Gazar Bandh pumping station is operational. The pumping station has been operational for almost two years, but the situation is the same even today,” said Rao. Bhagyawant Late, deputy chief engineer of storm water drains (western suburbs), said that the nullahs and drains have been cleaned regularly. “The problem of garbage is continuous due to the nearby settlements. It’s not like we haven’t done proper desilting work. We have taken out the required amount of silt,” Late said.“There is an average depth for every nullah that is decided, and silt is removed as per those calculations. Also, as Gazdar Bandh is near the sea, the silt deposits in the drains during high tide. Our system is efficient to handle 50mm of rainfall in one hour. If it rains beyond that, draining out water might get slow, resulting in waterlogging,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/downpour-will-wash-away-mumbai-civic-body-s-claims-say-experts-101624562930705.html
25-06-2021||Mumbai||2 railway lines lead MMR connect in right direction||Two railway projects are all set to increase connectivity and reduce the travelling time between the city and Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) – doubling of the railway line between Panvel and Karjat railway stations and construction of the second phase of Belapur and Uran railway lines. The two lines will cater to thousands of commuters who are living or working in the urban areas of Raigad district, which is expected to witness further growth, when the Navi Mumbai international airport gets operational. Panvel as well as Belapur-Uran belt will be in close vicinity of the airport which is under construction now. With the pandemic affecting suburban local train commute due to crowding, the new suburban railway lines will facilitate in reduction of crowding on the Central Railway’s main line between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Kalyan, and harbour railway between CSMT and Panvel. The railway lines will also help in opening up new growth centres, with the expansion in connectivity of MMR with the city. Belapur-Uran line The new suburban railway corridor between Belapur and Uran in Raigad district is a crucial corridor for expansion of the local train network. Once completed, the railway corridor will facilitate direct travel between Mumbai and Uran and will connect to the new Navi Mumbai international airport and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT). The railway line received sanction in 1967 and first phase of the corridor opened between Belapur and Kharkopar (12.5km) railway station in November 2018. The estimated cost of the Belapur- Uran railway project is ₹1,782 crore and the project is being undertaken on a cost-sharing basis of which 66% is being borne by City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) and 33% by the Central Railway (CR). The second phase of the corridor between Kharkopar and Uran is going on with the construction of two major bridges, two road underbridges and four road overbridges. A parcel of land has to be acquired mainly between Kharkopar and Ranjanpada stations. The railway stations include Gavhan, Ranjanpada, Nhava Sheva, Dronagiri and Uran. The second phase is expected to be completed by 2023. “The Kharkopar -Uran new line construction work is in progress at various sites with the help of construction machinery such as pile boring machines, concrete placer booms and transit mixers. The major construction activities under progress are superstructure work of cover over platform at Rajanpada station, foundation and sub-structure work at Nhava-Sheva, Dronagiri and subway work at Uran railway stations,” said a senior CR official. Panvel-Karjat line The doubling of the railway line between Panvel and Karjat was sanctioned in 2016 and is part of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP) 3. A 56-km of railway line is being constructed between Panvel and Karjat railway stations at a cost of ₹2,783 crore. The project is expected to be completed by 2024. The additional railway lines between Panvel and Karjat will increase connectivity and will also reduce time taken to travel. Currently, a passenger who wants to travel from Panvel to Karjat has to travel by local trains via Kalyan or via Thane railway stations. It takes nearly one hour to travel by local train. After construction of the railway line corridor commuting time will reduce by 15 minutes as passengers would be able to board direct local trains and avoid crossovers. The Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation Limited (MRVC), a joint venture of the Maharashtra government and the Indian Railways, is constructing the project and has begun the on-ground construction work of the railway line. Five railway stations will be a part of the additional railway lines. The railway stations include Panvel, Chowk, Mohape, Chikhale and Karjat railway stations. A rail flyover is being constructed by MRVC between Panvel and Chikle railway stations and the body has invited tenders for construction of three tunnels with ballastless tracks between the railway sections. “MRVC has started work on the new suburban railway corridor on Panvel-Karjat route. We plan to fast-track construction after the monsoon and aim to complete the construction in three years. This will reduce the commuting time by half-an-hour and will push development in this region,” said RS Khurana, managing director, MRVC. Once completed, more than 20 local train services will operate between Panvel and Karjat railway stations daily. Transport experts believe a holistic approach of increasing housing and opening up of employment opportunities between Panvel and Karjat, and Belapur and Uran will have to be adopted. “To decongest and expand the local train connectivity, employment opportunities have to be developed in the areas. Self-sufficient nodal points will improve the standard of living and be meaningful for the development of railway lines. Housing along with opening up offices will be crucial,” said transport expert AV Shenoy. Passenger associations have demanded construction of two suburban railway projects on priority basis. “The on-ground work of the projects is slow and they need to be implemented faster. Priority should be given to both the suburban railway projects. Both the railway corridors will create employment and increase connectivity with Mumbai,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2-railway-lines-lead-mmr-connect-in-right-direction-101624562810659.html

Police claimed the seized Ambergris is valued at ₹7.75 crore.The arrested accused have been identified as Prasad Pingle, 44, and Amit Patil, 36, both residents of Alibag. Crime branch officers got information that few people were allegedly going to sell ambergris in Lower Parel area. Forest officials were informed accordingly, and a trap was laid near Sitaram Mill compound. The team intercepted two persons in possession of 7.75 kilograms of whale vomit, said inspector Sopan Kakad.“During interrogation, we learnt that both the accused are residents of Alibag and one of them was a police constable in Mumbai and dismissed from the service in 2016 when he was attached with the Pydhonie police station,” Kakad added.After confirmation by the forest department, the case was registered in the NM Joshi police station under the Wildlife (Protection) Act. Both the arrested accused were produced in the court and remanded in police custody till June 29 for further investigation.Whale vomit samples will be sent to forensic department in Kolkata for chemical analysis. Ambergris is highly valuable and is used in perfume manufacturing. Found floating in tropical seas, it is in high demand in the international markets. The brownish material comes from an endangered and protected whale species. In a similar case, on June 15, unit 4 of crime branch had arrested three persons at Mulund with 2.7 kilograms of whale vomit worth ₹2.70 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-crime-branch-arrests-two-seizes-whale-vomit-worth-7-75-crore-101624562571852.html

The tours and travels company availed loan from the private sector bank but defaulted in repayment.On the basis of complaint lodged by Ashish Joshi, senior executive from Yes Bank, EOW registered the fresh FIR for loan default of ₹523 crore. Niket Kaushik, joint commissioner of police (EOW), confirmed the development and said the investigation is on.Banking (fraud) unit of EOW has booked Cox and Kings promotor Ajay Ajit Peter Kerkar, his wife Urshila, senior executive Anil Khandelwal and some other directors, auditors and others.EOW sources said various financial irregularities surfaced during the forensic audit of Cox and Kings group accounts, following which details of loan defaults have also emerged. EOW is already investigating six FIRs against the group for alleged frauds involving over ₹2,000 crore. Of the six FIRs, five are registered by private sector banks. Enforcement Directorate (ED) officers are also probing irregularities and money laundering aspect, while EOW is looking into the criminal part.Kerkar and the other senior executives are facing charges under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by a public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) 471 (using as genuine a forged) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.EOW officers said the accused travel company, its promoters, directors, auditors and other accused conspired together and fraudulently availed loan from various banks. “Forged documents were submitted to banks by Cox and Kings group to fraudulently obtain the loan. Later the loan money was diverted and used for other purposes,” said an officer.Previous FIRs against the group were made by Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank, Laxmi Vilas Bank and a private investment firm. EOW officer already interrogated Kerkar, Khandelwal, and others by taking their custody in previous FIRs. ED officers had also interrogated them.

25-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai to have its own climate action plan by October||The city is set to have its own dedicated climate action plan by October, ahead of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) to be held in November, officials in the state environment minister’s office confirmed on Thursday. The action plan will be drafted by the World Resources Institute (WRI) India, which has been engaged as a consultant by the environment department. The action plan is being undertaken pursuant to Mumbai’s entry into the C40 Cities climate leadership group in December last year. C40 connects 97 of the world’s largest cities, enabling them to “collaborate effectively, share knowledge and drive meaningful, measurable and sustainable action on climate change”. Member cities are encouraged to develop and implement action plans in line with goals of the Paris Agreement.Mumbai’s action plan will be executed in seven broad steps, of which two have already been completed, said officials privy to the development, on the condition of anonymity. Step one is referred to as context setting, wherein officials at the city and ward level were apprised of the need for such a plan in light of Mumbai’s burgeoning climate vulnerabilities. Step two involves collating demographic data and defining the socio-economic and ecological features of the city, based on existing literature and land-use studies.The eventual action plan will be featured on the C40 website alongside those of other member cities. “It is an external facing document, and should be easily read by other governments, private companies, people within the innovation and research space, and so on, who may not be familiar with the city,” said Lubaina Rangwala, associate director at WRI India’s Sustainable Cities Centre. Steps three and four, Rangwala explained, are simultaneous processes that involve developing a “climate profile” for Mumbai and conducting a “sectoral analysis” across six different verticals — air pollution, water resources and urban flooding, urban greenery and biodiversity, energy efficiency in municipal buildings, transport and mobility, and waste management.For this, data will be collected from 15 departments of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), and 25 external organisations, both private and state, including the transport department, sewage departments, disaster management department, tree authority, development planning authority, private power distributors, the meteorological department and pollution control board among others.Officials did not comment on the nature and extent of data being gathered, but said it will be analysed using an Excel-based tool developed by the C40 group, called the City Inventory Reporting and Information System (CIRIS). “The data will be fed into the system and analysed in comparison with global benchmarks, to help us identify gaps in each sector based on its overall emission load. These gaps will need to be addressed in our climate plan,” said Rangwala.When it comes to planning concrete action, Mumbai’s climate plan will rely on two approaches — mitigation and adaption. “Under the mitigation head, we will be making a greenhouse gas inventory for the city using the CIRIS tool, and further conduct a ‘scenario analysis’ in which we will identify potential opportunities for emissions reduction,” said Rangwala. The mitigation aspect of the plan will also involve an air pollution analysis to identify emissions trends and pollution hotspots.Under the adaptation head, WRI India will conduct a vulnerability analysis to assess the exposure of different parts of the city to climate change, largely looking at variations in class and spatial distribution among the population. The other component under adaptive action is to conduct a “climate and land use assessment”, which will also include a baseline count of trees in the city.An official in BMC’s environment department involved in the project said, “Right now, we are only at the data gathering stage. Of the 40 departments, 13 departments have not yet sent any data. They have been reminded and given time till July 10 to comply.”The final three steps in the drafting process involve holding stakeholder consultations, setting tangible emission reduction goals for the city, and finally proceeding to implement the policy which is expected to happen before year-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-to-have-its-own-climate-action-plan-by-october-101624562450737.html

With elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh just a few months away, farmers have started mobilising migrant workers against the three agriculture laws implemented by the BJP-led central government.Avtar Singh, a farmer from Bhullerheri village, and associated with Bharti Kisan Union (BKU) Rajewal said, “In our meetings with migrant workers, we discuss new agricultural laws. We try to convince them that the black laws will leave them jobless.”“The BJP made anti-farmer laws. These laws, however, are equally dangerous for migrant workers who are dependent on the agriculture sector. When big corporates will start farming in Punjab, they will use machines. High-level technology will replace labourers and the labour class will face unemployment. We have appealed to migrants hailing from UP that they should oppose BJP’s policies and not vote for this party,” Avtar added.Sangrur block chief of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) Gobinder Singh said, “The BJP is introducing anti-farmer and anti-labour policies. We will hold meetings with migrants at tubewells and ask them to oppose the saffron party.”Migrant workers had returned to their native states last month, when the covid-19 was its peak in the second wave of the disease. They returned to Punjab, in huge numbers, before June 10 in search of jobs. Their presence has enabled farmers to avoid confrontation with local Punjabi labour over wages.Ramadhin, 32, a migrant from UP, said he has been coming to Punjab for the past 10 years, adding, “We are landless. A labourer can’t run his business, he is dependent on farmers. If farmers lose their land, where will we work?” Another migrant Sudhir, 27, said, “Farmers are telling us that the new laws will take away their land, which will also affect our jobs with them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stir-against-farm-laws-now-farmers-mobilising-migrant-workers-against-centre-s-agri-laws-101624562332429.html

He was referring to the PM’s earlier statement that he was just a phone call away from the protesting farmers.“It pains the nation that even after your statement, the government appears to have further withdrawn from engaging with the farmer organisations even as the farmers are waiting at Delhi’s borders,” the RLD chief said.“However, in the face of public sentiment, a sensitive government would not shy away from taking a step back in order to move forward,” he remarked.“It is not clear to the farmers, how these laws improve their market position or pricing power,” he said.He mentioned in the letter that the farmers’ agitation not only had a negative economic impact, but also the failure to resolve the key issues had hurt the pride of the nation’s agriculturists.He signed off by saying, “I urge you to make that call, Mr Prime Minister and let the farmers go back home to the villages to work for the empowerment of India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/rld-president-jayant-chaudhary-urges-pm-modi-to-end-impasse-on-centre-s-new-farm-laws-101624562271902.html
25-06-2021||Bangalore||Don’t project me as CM face: Siddaramaiah to Cong MLAs||Bengaluru Amid growing fissures within the Congress over the chief ministerial face for the 2023 assembly polls, senior party leader Siddaramaiah on Thursday requested legislators not to give any statements projecting him as the future chief minister of Karnataka. In a statement on Thursday, the leader of the opposition requested his party legislators not to say “the future chief minister Siddaramaiah”. He added that there are still two years left for elections and that legislators should not make statements on who the next chief minister will be. The statements come at a time when nearly a dozen Congress legislators have openly endorsed Siddaramaiah as the future chief minister, irking party president DK Shivakumar and other senior leaders who also believe they are in contention for the top job. A video also surfaced on Thursday, where another Congress MLA Byrathi Suresh from Hebbal constituency can be purportedly heard addressing Siddaramaiah as a “permanent CM”. The statements come despite directives not to do so by Shivakumar and the national leadership of the party, including Randeep Singh Surjewala, several party legislators in Karnataka continued to make statements projecting Siddaramaiah as the next chief minister. Siddaramaiah is among the most powerful leaders within the Congress and Shivakumar among others have challenged the former’s dominance over party affairs ever since he joined them in 2006. Siddaramaiah is one of the handful of chief ministers in Karnataka’s history to complete a full-five year term in office from 2013-18. The Sonia Gandhi-led party has seen its top leaders in at least three states--Rajasthan, Punjab and Karnataka--quarrel among themselves and dent its chances against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), its principal rival political outfit in India. The infighting within the Congress in Karnataka has denied them the opportunity to capitalise on the increasing dissent and discord within the state unit of the BJP. Interestingly, several BJP legislators from Karnataka have made open calls for the removal of BS Yediyurappa as chief minister unlike the situation in the Congress where party MLAs have openly endorsed Siddaramaiah for the top chair. Like Shivakumar, several senior leaders like G Parameshwara, Mallikarjuna Kharge among a host of others hone similar ambitions. Parameshwara on Thursday said that this discussion needed to end here as the party high command will decide who will become chief minister once the party secures a majority in the 2023 assembly polls. Downplaying the ongoing rift within the party, Yathindra Siddaramaiah, the legislator from Varuna and the opposition leader’s son on Thursday said, “In every party leaders express their personal opinion but this does not mean that they cannot stand each other or have differences.” He said that the Congress is united and will face the elections together. “When it comes to the party, whatever the president says is final,” he said, not being dragged into a debate that has raised several questions and troubles for the Congress. Notwithstanding its own troubles, the BJP too has joined in the debate to further pile on the Congress and its current predicament. R Ashok, senior BJP legislator and minister for revenue, on Thursday said that there are factions like D-Congress and S-Congress coming up within the party, inferring the groups under Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah. “This is Congress’s internal matter. They have a high command which has become weak. Since the high command has become weak, such problems are cropping up,” Ashok said. He added that the Congress high command cannot even say if Siddaramaiah will be their chief ministerial candidate or not unlike the BJP where the national leadership have made it clear that Yediyurappa will continue in the top post. Lashing out at BJP, Shivakumar said that the party should first sort out its own mess than point fingers at others. “We have seen even the people who lose the elections also become a CM of the state. Not only the 224 elected members can become CM, others too can. Our state has seen such things in the past. Shri Devraj Urs and Shri Ramakrishna Hegde had become CM’s even after losing and not contesting elections,” Shivakumar said, trying to make light of a development that has undermined his authority within the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/dont-project-me-as-cm-face-siddaramaiah-to-cong-mlas-101624562211367.html
25-06-2021||Bangalore||No need to panic: Experts on Delta plus variant||Bengaluru: The detection of the new Delta plus variant of the Covid-19 virus in Karnataka has raised concerns of yet another spike in cases. Even though it has not been proven that the surge in cases in Maharashtra was due to the new variant, the timing of the spike and the detection of the variant are causing concerns in neighbouring Karnataka. Experts, however, said that there is no need to panic and stressed on conducting adequate research into the variant.According to Karnataka’s department of health and family welfare, during the first and second waves, infected interstate travellers from Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu were behind the outbreak in the state. “Our two neighbouring states, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have the highest number of the Delta plus variant cases. Maharashtra has reported 22 cases so far and Tamil Nadu has reported four (as of Wednesday). These are not the total number of the Delta variants in these states but those found in the sequencing conducted. So, this is a matter of concern,” said a senior bureaucrat in-charge of health in Karnataka, who didn’t want to be named. The Union health ministry had classified Delta plus as a “variant of concern’ in India on Tuesday. The Delta variant has been held responsible for the deadly second wave of the pandemic in India. Several other countries also consider Delta as the factor behind the sudden surge in infections. The new variant is a mutated version of the virus. Speaking about the case detected in Bengaluru, BBMP commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that the case was detected much earlier (he didn’t specify the exact date). “The patient has recovered, and his contacts have recovered as well. BBMP will be initiating the process to conduct more genome sequencing to identify the variant in the state. But what is important is that people should understand the virus the still among us and Covid prevention norms should be followed,” Gupta told reporters on Thursday. Despite these concerns, a senior bureaucrat told HT that no discussion on travel restrictions have been held so far. The government also plans to continue with the current relaxations of the lockdown rules, he added. Even though the state bureaucracy is worried about the new variant, experts in the city are of the opinion that adequate research should be conducted into the variant but said that there is no need to panic. Dr Ravi, former head of the neurovirology department at NIMHANS and member of Karnataka’s TAC on Covid-19 said that unnecessary panic around the variant should be avoided. “Whether is it more infectious, there is no evidence to show that. They are tracking the patients to find if the virus spreads faster. We will know this soon,” he said. He added that it doesn’t seem that variant is more virulent. “All of the 41 cases detected in the country, there is no evidence of any deaths (due to the variant). The pattern of disease in Delta plus is no different from what is seen in the Delta variant. Most of the Delta plus cases are from samples collected more than a month ago. My reading is that if it was collected one month back, had it (the Delta plus variant) been so deadly, there would have been a higher number of cases and deaths. In fact, the numbers are coming down,” he said. He, however, pointed out that increasing genome sequencing is very important and ramping up vaccination is the real solution to the Covid-19 problem. Dr Vishal Rao, a member of the expert committee on Karnataka’s Covid task force said that it is important to keep eye on the patients in the ICU to understand the implications of the new variant. “As a doctor, it is important for me to keep an eye on the ICU and those showing severe symptoms and find out genomic patterns exhibited by them… It eventually comes down to conducting more genome sequencing. The government has announced that it would conduct 5% genome sequencing. It is a good sign because we are doing less than 0.5% right now,” he said. Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar on Thursday said that vaccination is the only way out to keep Covid-19 at bay. Government is determined to provide both the doses of the Covid vaccine for all by this December end, he added. “Vaccine is the only solution for Corona. Otherwise, we need to mask up all the time. If we want to be mask free, then everyone should be vaccinated at the earliest,” he said. The minister on Wednesday had confirmed the presence of the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 in Bengaluru. Two cases of the new variants have been reported in Karnataka – one each in Bengaluru and Mysuru, the minister had said. He also said the information has been shared with the Union health ministry and a further course of action is being planned. Adding that the state is monitoring the emergence of new variants and that six genome labs are functioning in the state. “Wherever we have a suspicion, we are doing genomic sequencing.

25-06-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai airport naming: Protest peaceful; cops to book organisers, leaders||Thousands of people including project-affected persons (PAPs) and political party workers staged a peaceful protest to demand naming of the proposed Navi Mumbai international airport after PAP leader DB Patil. The DB Patil Navi Mumbai International Airport All Party Action Committee has warned that it will stop all airport work if the state fails to accept the demand by August 15. Police said cases will be registered against the leaders and organisers for holding a public meeting as they had no permission for the same due to the pandemic. Amid fears of clash between the police and protesters, the public meeting took place on Palm Beach Road near NMMC headquarters. Police said there were around 10,000 protestors, but the organisers put the number over 100,000. Independent sources put the number between 25,000 and 40,000. Shivraj Patil, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), zone 2, said, “We had been asking the leaders to not hold the meeting but since they went ahead, we were ready with a strong bandobast to prevent the protestors from reaching Cidco Bhavan. Cases will be registered against the leaders and organisers. Such a meeting cannot be allowed when Covid norms are still in place.” He claimed the protest was peaceful as the police were constantly coordinating and communicating with protestors and leaders to ensure there is no untoward incident. The action committee had planned a protest of at least 100,000 people to gherao Cidco, which has passed a resolution to name the airport after Shiv Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray. Protestors came not just from Navi Mumbai, Panvel and Uran but also Mumbai and other parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). They carried placards, wore clothes with Patil’s pictures and raised slogans praising him and declaring their demand. There were also several political leaders cutting across party lines, including Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) MLA Raju Patil and Congress MP Hussain Dalwai. The action committee submitted a memorandum to Cidco stating their demand to cancel the resolution approving Balasaheb Thackeray’s name and propose DB Patil’s name. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Panvel MLA Prashant Patil, who has been spearheading the agitation, said, “There was not a single political party flag visible today, proving that this is a movement of the people from all spheres. Sons of the soil have come from all over. The chief minister has got a very strong message today of what the people want.” He added, “We have given time till August 15 to the government to complete the formalities to finalise DB Patil’s name. If it fails to do so, the action committee and the sons of the soil will ensure that all Navi Mumbai airport related work will come to a standstill.” “For me my community comes first and hence it is my duty to be here for DB Patil. Raj Thackeray has only raised a technical issue of the airport being an extension, but the state is playing games and is waiting for something really grave to happen to wake up,” said Raju Patil, MNS leader. Congress leader Hussain Dalwai said, “I have worked with DB Patil in the OBC movement in which he was my leader. He got justice for the sons of the soil and was an inspiration for struggle of the people. MVA wants the issue to be resolved amicably and DB Patil deserves the demand being made for him. He worked selflessly only for the people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-airport-naming-protest-peaceful-cops-to-book-organisers-leaders-101624562030656.html
25-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Fight for OBC reservation heats up||Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation is turning into a hot political issue in Maharashtra as OBC Jan Morcha, an umbrella body of various OBC organisations, staged protests across the state on Thursday. The outfits have been demanding restoration of the 27% political reservation in all local bodies.The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), too, has declared to hold statewide protests from June 26. The party has declared chakka jam (road block) at around 1,000 places in the state. With the state election commission’s announcement on holding bypoll for the vacant seats in five zilla parishads — Dhule, Nandurbar, Akola, Washim, and Nagpur — following the Supreme Court’s order on OBC reservation, the political temperature has also started soaring in the state. All parties have demanded for postponement of the bypolls till the issue is sorted out.The by-poll is slated to be held on July 19 and votes will be counted on July 20.The OBC reservation issue is of political importance as the community, though fragmented into nearly 382 castes, makes up nearly 52% of the state’s population.OBCs are on the verge of losing their political reservation in local bodies across Maharashtra as it was quashed by the Supreme Court last month. The Apex court ruled that the reservation in favour of OBCs in local bodies should not exceed the 50% cap in reservation quota. It also directed the state to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data, based on which the quota would be fixed. It means no seat is going to be reserved for the OBC community in the upcoming local bodies comprising municipal corporations, municipal councils, zilla parishads, panchayat samiti and gram panchayats at least for this year or until the state government completes the entire process.The Apex court decision has come at the time when OBCs were already worried about losing a share in their existing 27% reservation in government jobs and education following demands made by the Maratha community to incorporate them in the OBC category as they have lost their reservation benefits following another verdict of the Supreme Court.Marathas were granted 12% and 13% reservation in government jobs and education, respectively, by enacting the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act in 2018, but the Apex court recently quashed it.“OBC Jan Morcha held dharna outside around 350 tehsil offices across the state and also handed over a charter of demands to tehsildars,” said Chandrakant Bavkar, executive president, Jan OBC Morcha. “The outfit has already sent around 275,000 mails to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, OBC welfare minister Vijay Wadettiwar and social justice minister Dhananjay Munde, requesting them to make attempts to restore the reservation,” he added.The outfits are also planning to hold protests such as human chain, raasta roko and morcha in the coming days if the state fails to proceed on their demands, Bavkar said.State chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, on the behalf of the government, on Thursday wrote a letter to the state election commission with a request to postpone the bypolls as it is not an appropriate time, considering the Covid-19 pandemic and fear of rise in cases owing to Delta plus variants, officials said. “The letter states that it would be difficult for them to provide manpower as the state machinery is busy in handling pandemic and monsoon preparedness,” said a senior official privy to the development.In response, state election commissioner UPS Madan said they will not be able to postpone the by-elections. “The Supreme Court in its order directed the state election commission to hold bypolls on the seats vacated due to its order, thus we are following the Apex court’s directives. We are not in a position to postpone them, until and unless the court asks us to do so,” Madan told HT.The state government is further trying to persuade the community by declaring preventive measures such as filing a revision petition before the Apex court and setting up a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data.On the other hand, the Opposition is looking at it as an opportunity to create more trouble for the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikar Aghadi (MVA) government, which is already in a damage control mode after the Supreme Court quashed reservation for Maratha community.BJP national secretary Pankaja Munde, while interacting with media persons after a state executive committee meeting held on Thursday, said, “We have decided to hold chakka jam andolan at 1,000 places across the state. We also want the bypolls to be cancelled. The state government should intervene and ask the election commission to postpone them. We will also be challenging it in the court.” Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said they would have collected empirical data in four months. “If we were in power, I would have ensured that the process of collecting empirical data is completed in four months. If you can’t do it, tell us we can do it in four months,” Fadnavis said.NCP leader and minister Chhagan Bhujbal said the Centre should provide them with empirical data. “If the Centre provides us with empirical data, the issue will be resolved in only four days but the Centre is not doing so,” he said and asked opposition leaders to bring empirical data from the Centre and take the credit for saving OBC reservation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-fight-for-obc-reservation-heats-up-101624562031299.html
25-06-2021||Mumbai||BJP demands CBI probe against MVA ministers Ajit Pawar and Anil Parab||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is looking to create fresh troubles for the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. The party on Thursday demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe against deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and transport minister Anil Parab based on allegations made by controversial police officer Sachin Vaze.A resolution demanding CBI probe against the ministers was passed in the BJP’s state executive committee meeting held on Thursday.Vaze, who is in National Investigation Agency (NIA) custody in the Antilia bomb scare case, wrote a letter in April, alleging that he was asked by ministers to extort money from businessmen and contractors.Pawar is nephew of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar. A splinter group of NCP MLAs headed by him supported a short-lived BJP government in 2019. Meanwhile, Parab is a close aide of chief minister and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray.“The MVA government is shielding the criminals. In Vaze case, allegations of extortion against the then home minister Anil Deshmukh, corruption in transfer of police officers have ruined the reliability of this government. Based on the allegations made by Vaze in his letter, a CBI probe needs to be initiated against Ajit Pawar and Anil Parab,” said state BJP president Chandrakant Patil.In his letter, Vaze stated that someone claiming to be very close to Ajit Pawar asked him to collect ₹100 crore a month from illegal gutka sellers. He also alleged that Parab asked him to look into the inquiry against fraudulent contractors listed by the Mumbai civic body. The former police officer, dismissed from service in May, also claimed that Parab asked him to collect ₹2 crore from some 50 contractors.Refuting the charges, Pawar had said he never met Vaze. “I have never met Vaze nor have I spoken to him ever. So go ahead and conduct an inquiry if this is what needs to be done,” he said.Parab also debunked the allegations, saying it was BJP’s conspiracy to defame MVA. “In order to defame the chief minister, it was necessary to vilify someone close to him. This is a part of agenda being pursued by the BJP,” Parab had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-demands-cbi-probe-against-mva-ministers-ajit-pawar-and-anil-parab-101624561970622.html

Kapurthala DFSC Geeta Bishambhu had submitted her inquiry report with the director, food and civil supply department, on June 21. The names of four food inspectors of Sultanpur Lodhi have surfaced as key accused in the scam.The report noted that the Sultanpur Lodhi centre of the department didn’t provide record of wheat distribution to the inspection teams despite repeated orders in May; later the DFSC received many other complaints following which a special inspection team was formed on June 9. The report added that depot holder association had brought into the notice of DFSC office that inspectors posted in Sultanpur Lodhi block didn’t release wheat despite repeated requests, while slips of beneficiaries were issued.The probe has recommended action against staff posted at Sultanpur Lodhi centre of the food supplies department because many beneficiaries failed to take benefit of wheat due to their gross negligence. “The state government suffered huge financial loss and a dent in image due to staff negligence,: the report added. “In Sultanpur Lodhi, there are 45 depots, of which 18 depot holders received wheat for distribution from food inspectors but they didn’t distribute the entire wheat as per rules.

The DFSC also issued directions to food inspectors to shift the remaining stock from Khera village to a secure place. as the Food Corporation of India had recommended upgrade of the storage facility at Khera village. The report recommended that the department staff posted at Sultanpur Lodhi had committed huge negligence and did not even listen to the district circle office of the department. “If staff officers had shifted the stock from Khera village, as per earlier orders the stock could have been safe,” it adds.DFSC Geeta Bishambhu refused to comment.

Before the takeover, a joint inspection of ambulances by a team from new firm Ziqitza Healthcare Limited as well as the old company, GVK EMRI, took place on Thursday. The changeover would have no impact on the patients who would continue to get free of cost transport to hospital as before, an official of the new team said. “We are beginning with the joint inspection of ambulances that were already giving services to patients. Our teams along with the previous company and government representatives will assess the condition of the vehicles and the equipment fitted in them,” said Milton Singh, chief manager for the Ziqitza Healthcare Limited. Joint inspection began from Jhansi, Lalitpur, Jalaun, Orai districts, in Jhansi division and Agra, Firozabad, Mainpuri Mathura, in Agra division. By July 20 this process has to be completed in all the 75 districts. The firm is already running ambulances services in several states including Jharkhand and Sikkim. The normal or non-ALS ambulances will continue to be run by GVK EMRI, an official said. While normal ambulances with oxygen support facility are provided for less serious patients, who dial ‘108’ facility for help but for serious patients, the same call centre (108) generates requirement for an advanced life support (ALS) ambulance in case of serious patients. There is another ambulance facility available exclusively for pregnant women who have to dial 102 to avail the service. Asked if there will be change in calling number from the two 108 and 102, the director general medical health Dr DS Negi said, “We are working on it. We shall make sure patients can easily access to ALS and non-ALS ambulances.” The GVK EMRI HR head Lingraj Das issued a circular on Thursday. “The new firm has got tender to run ALS ambulances but none of our staff should be worried as we shall follow services rules and keep you informed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/now-new-firm-to-manage-als-ambulances-in-up-joint-inspection-of-fleet-begins-101624561133012.html
25-06-2021||Mumbai||SSC results to be declared by mid-July; entrance exam for junior college admissions by July-end: GR||Results of the Senior Secondary Certificate (SSC) examinations will be announced by July 15, and an optional physical entrance exam for first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions will be conducted by July-end or August first week, stated a government resolution (GR) released on Thursday.The notification comes nearly a month after the state school education minister Varsha Gaikwad said that admissions to FYJC will be based on a common entrance test (CET).According to GR, an optional CET exam will be conducted based on the Class 10 syllabus and comprising multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for 100 marks. This exam will be first open to FYJC aspirants from all school board. Those who don’t want to opt for the physical entrance exam will be marked according to their performance in the internal assessment of Class 10.“Students appearing for the optional CET exam will be given first preference during admissions to FYJC. After these admissions are completed, the remaining vacant seats in junior colleges will be allotted to those students who do not appear for the entrance exam,” said Varsha Gaikwad, state school education minister. The decision to conduct a CET exam for FYJC aspirants was taken to bring about uniformity and comparability in class admissions, Gaikwad had added. Earlier this year, all school education boards including the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council of Indian Secondary Certificate Examinations (CISCE) decided to scrap Class 10 exams due to increasing Covid-19 cases. Instead, the boards decided to grade the students based on their internal exam performance for the year. The state government’s decision to conduct CET for Class 11 admissions has invited mixed reactions. “As of now it seems like CET will be based on state board syllabus in mind, so we hope this does not pose as a hindrance for students from other school education boards. Also giving first preference only to those who give the entrance exam will automatically push all students to give the exam,” said the principal of ICSE school in the city. On April 12, the state government had postponed HSC exams to the end of May and SSC exams to June. However, following CBSE’s decision to cancel Class 10 exams and a similar decision from ICSE, IGCSE and IB there was growing pressure to cancel exams from students and parents to ensure equivalence across boards which is key at the time of admissions to colleges. On April 20, Class 10 exams were declared cancelled by the state government and students will now be marked based on internal assessmentsAround 17 lakh students appear for SSC in the state.

25-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body to study Covid-19 ward war rooms||Anticipating the third wave, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will undertake a study on the ward-wise Covid-19 war room scheme that was initiated during the first wave. Civic body officials believe the study is likely to help them understand the loopholes and further strengthen their strategy, which helped streamline the management of novel coronavirus infection cases during the first and second wave.When the pandemic first hit Mumbai in March 2020, there was one central BMC helpline — 1916. However, by June, cases were peaking in the city, which increased the pressure on the centralised helpline number. The critical helpline number got completely clogged with calls, following which, BMC commissioner IS Chahal decided on decentralisation and ward-level war rooms were set up subsequently which proved fruitful in timely admission of Covid-19 patients.“We were the first city to initiate ward-wise war rooms which helped channelise timely treatment of Covid-19 patients and thereby control the fatality rate. We have therefore decided to conduct a study which might guide us to strengthen the decentralised disaster management system if we face the third wave,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.Each war room runs 24X7 with teachers and data entry staff working in three shifts — 7am-3pm, 3pm-11pm and 11pm-7am. There are around 15-16 people who work in each shift. However, the number may differ ward-wise.As per civic officials, in April when the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak, the 24 ward war rooms received over 80,000 calls with maximum queries on beds and ambulances.“Last year, in May, when Covid-19 cases surged suddenly, there was too much chaos. The centralised disaster number couldn’t handle the number of calls. But the war rooms helped distribute the burden. So, with all the data available with us, we want to study how the module worked for Mumbai,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC. “We are yet to chalk out the plan, and which ward to select for the study,” she added.However, compared to April, the number of calls has decreased drastically with the flattening of the pandemic curve in the second wave. “The number of calls has dropped drastically compared to April. As 80% beds in hospitals are vacant, now, we are getting around 100 calls which were around 500 calls in April,” said Kiran Dighavkar, BMC assistant commissioner and in-charge of G-South ward that covers Dharavi, Mahim and Dadar.The decentralisation was done to allot beds to critically ill patients on time. Guidelines were issued to prioritise the admission of patients based on their health condition.Explaining the protocol, Dr Dripti Soni, one of the doctors in the war room, said call attendants first enquire if the patient has co-morbidities which includes medical history like blood saturation levels and their blood pressure. If the patient doesn’t have the medical equipment, then the ward war room sends healthcare workers to their house to gather information.“Many patients and their relatives start panicking when they test positive for the infection. Almost 90% callers ask for hospital beds. But patients with oxygen saturation above 95% and with no severe co-morbidities don’t require hospitalisation. So, this prioritisation helped stop unnecessary occupancy of hospital beds,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-study-covid-19-ward-war-rooms-101624561070580.html

The Mumbai Police and the BMC, while responding to the query of the HC, informed the bench that around 2,053 persons had been administered fake vaccines in nine such camps and the perpetrators had been arrested. The court, while expressing its dismay at such instances directed the state government and BMC to formulate policies or guidelines on an immediate basis to ensure that the lives of the citizens were not put to risk and sought affidavits enumerating the same by the next hearing. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation filed by Siddharth Chandrashekhar, was informed by advocate Anita Shekhar-Castellino that in light of news reports of some individuals/groups taking advantage of the problems faced by citizens, while booking vaccination slots on Co-WIN portal, the court should issue directions to the authorities to make the process more accessible for everyone and prioritise vaccination for the elderly and the sick. In light of these submissions, Castellino said strict action was required against the persons who fooled and fleeced people. On June 22, the court had directed the police to investigate the same and submit a report and had also directed the BMC to formulate a policy to ensure such instances were not repeated.Responding to the directions of the court, chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare for the state submitted a confidential status report on the investigation and said that five FIRs had been registered in Mumbai against the perpetrators and probes to get to the root of the scandal was in progress. Thakare submitted that due to the seriousness of the issue, the lower court had refused to grant bail to two of the accused, namely Ashish Mishra of Aditya College of Architecture and Rajesh Pandey, another accused. He added that Dr Manish Tripathi, a third accused was absconding. The group of five had allegedly held private vaccination camps for a society in Kandivli and Versova and their scandal came to light after the certificates issued by them did not reflect on the Co-WIN portal. Thakare sought directions of the court to the authorities and others that the local police station should be informed about the organisation of such vaccination camps in advance.Thakare further submitted that in all 2,053 persons were given fake vaccines and it included 390 vaccinations at Hiranandani Health Club at Kandivli (West), 514 in Borivli, 207 at Poddar Education Society in Parel, 30 at Malad West and around 365 employees of Tips Industries at Khar. He further informed the court that none of the beneficiaries of the fake vaccines had suffered any side effects after inoculation. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC informed the bench that the civic authority has lodged a complaint against the frauds and its investigations revealed that none of the hospitals to which the scamsters had claimed to be attached to, had provided the vials for such camps. Sakhare added that Covishield manufacturer Serum Institute of India (SII) was also requested to look into the issue.After hearing the submissions and being told that guidelines were yet to be formulated by the state and BMC to curb such instances, the bench said, “We want a specific policy on fake vaccination. You cannot delay like this, this is an urgent matter. Every minute is important and time is of the essence.”The bench observed that there was a need to test the beneficiaries of the fake vaccines to ascertain the effect of the fake vaccines so that they can be vaccinated properly. The court then directed the state and BMC to file affidavits and posted further hearing to June 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/2053-persons-given-fake-vaccines-in-mumbai-state-tells-hc-101624561010559.html

25-06-2021||Other||Excessive mining depleting ground water: Dadri farmers||The farmers of Jhojhu Kalan village in Charkhi Dadri district have expressed fear that the groundwater of their tubewells has been depleting as mining activities to extract stone crusher is going on unabated at their adjacent Ramalwas village, which shares boundary with their fields.The farmers said they have been running from pillar to post for the past one year urging the administration to take action against the contractors for allegedly digging up 200-ft pits in the ground to extract stones and continuing mining activities by throwing groundwater outside the mining area with the help of pipes.The farmers conducted panchayat four times seeking action against the contractors.Suresh Kumar Sangwan alias Foji, of Jhojhu Kalan, said scores of farmers from their village had met Dadri deputy commissioner Amarjeet Singh Mann a few days back asking him to take action against contractors who have been extracting stones by depleting groundwater at Ramalwas village site.“Due to rampant extraction, groundwater of nearly 150 tubewells has reached 200-ft. We have no issues with the mining activities but it should be stopped as it reaches the groundwater table. If they continue to do so, it is a violation of the National Green Tribunal’s norms. The DC has assured us of looking into the matter,” he added.Another farmer Anil Kumar Sangwan said they had lodged a complaint with the Haryana chief minister’s window in November last year but no action has been taken against the violators so far.“There is a nexus between the contractors and the officials to extract stone crushers while violating the NGT norms. We had reached out to three former DCs to intervene in the matter but no action has been initiated. Workers at Ramalwas mining site are throwing groundwater in the canal from the site with the help of pipes. When we raised the issue of sand mining, it was stopped in many parts of the district but stone crusher mining is on unabated,” he added.Virender Kumar, a farmer of Jhojhu Kalan, said the officials are ignoring the mining issue and are hesitating to take action against the ‘mining mafia’.“If our tubewells’ groundwater depletes, how will we earn our livelihood? The miners have been extracting stones from groundwater and have created 200-ft deep pits, if anyone falls, they won’t survive,” he added.Dadri mining officer Niranjan said the Dadri DC has formed a two-member committee, including him and a hydraulic engineer, to look into the matter.“Water being thrown out by workers at the mining site is not groundwater. It was extracted from rocks. The mining activities are allowed until the groundwater does not appear,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/excessive-mining-depleting-ground-water-dadri-farmers-101624560891562.html
25-06-2021||Mumbai||Conduct final-year PG exams at the earliest, NMC tells colleges||Nearly two months after the National Medical Commission (NMC) announced the postponement of final year postgraduate (PG) medical examinations by a month, the commission recently released another circular requesting all affiliated colleges to conduct the pending exams at the earliest.In an advisory dated June 22, NMC requested colleges to conduct exams depending upon the local Covid situation. “Covid-19 caused disruption in all walks of life in the country for the last year and a half, expectedly the medical students had to endure the major brunt of this,” said the circular. “The NMC had to issue regular and pertinent advisories regarding matters concerning the examinations and students to tide over the crisis. Fortunately, Covid has started to show a retreating trend and therefore we are advising colleges to hold the pending examinations for PG speciality and super speciality courses at the earliest,” the circular added.In April, the central government decided to extend the final year PG medical and dental exam by a month and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for postgraduate courses (NEET-PG) by four months.Originally scheduled to take place in the month of May, PG final year exams were postponed by a month based on a circular by NMC to ensure all students are working across hospitals as the country was amid the peak of the second wave of Covid-19.Even before the NMC advisory was released, the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) in the last week of May, had announced the examination timetable for these exams. As per the MUHS circular, the pending exams will be conducted in the month of August for all PG speciality, super-speciality and diploma courses. Students, however, are still unsure if they’ll have enough time to prepare for their exams. “Most of us (students) are working every day at hospitals across the state and have had no time to prepare for our exams,” said Dr Prajakta Mhatre, another final year PG medical student.In May, the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) had also approached MUHS as well as the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) to give final year PG students at least 45 days of preparation time for exams. “The authorities accepted our demand but till date, we haven’t received our relieving letters from DMER. Only once these letters are issued will we get to prepare for the upcoming exams, which commence from August 16,” said Dr Pranav Jadhav, vice-president central MARD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/conduct-final-year-pg-exams-at-the-earliest-nmc-tells-colleges-101624560831212.html

In all 13,335 of the around 33,000 inmates are vaccinated which includes 1,539 inmates having comorbidities from the three groups. Responding to the suggestion of Prof Vijay Raghavan, member of Centre for Criminology and Justice in Tata Institute of Social Sciences, who is assisting the court in the PIL to have lady doctors visit prisons for women, Kumbhakoni submitted that prison authorities had been asked to coordinate with government hospitals and ask them to send lady doctors on rotation and need basis to treat women inmates. On the suggestion by senior counsel Mihir Desai on having mobile pathological labs to ensure immediate testing of inmates within jail premises and also avoiding the need for police escorts to take inmates to hospitals, Kumbhakoni submitted that the lab facilities to conduct various tests were present in all nine prisons and collection and analysis of samples was done in the prison hospitals itself. The state added that district health agencies were helping the prison department in the collection of samples and reports of samples are communicated to the prison authority. The state further informed the bench that jail superintendents were instructed on June 22 to check and get all defective machines repaired and to also check the availability of mobile lab facilities by approaching concerned medical officers in the district.After hearing the submissions the bench noted in its order, “We record satisfaction at the progress made in the correctional homes to ward off Covid. Almost 1/3rd of the prison population has been vaccinated and the number of active cases has reduced considerably and presently stands at 20.”Seeking further facts and figures of Covid situation at prisons in Maharashtra, HC posted further hearing to July 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/satisfied-with-vaccination-of-nearly-1-3rd-prisoners-in-maharashtra-bombay-hc-101624560770572.html

The Bhoiwada police have booked six people, who posed as doctors and held an unauthorised vaccination camp, in May at a private educational institute Poddar Centre in Parel. Mumbai Police has, for the first time, charged members of the bogus vaccination camp group with a section of attempt to commit culpable homicide not amounting to murder in the Bhoiwada police FIR.Police officers said the arrested accused - Mahendra Singh, Shrikant Mane, Seema Singh and three others conducted the bogus vaccination camp at Poddar Centre between May 28 and 29. “During the camp, some adulterated medicine in the name of Covishield vaccine was administered to the employees of the institute. The accused collected the Aadhar Card details of the institute staff and issued bogus and forged vaccination certificate in the name of Nanavati and Lifeline Care hospitals. The gang of fake doctors made ₹2,44,800 through this vaccination camp,” said Vinod Kamble, senior inspector of Bhoiwada police station. The case has been registered on the complaint of Badlapur resident Shankar Namdev Kesari, 34, an employee at Poddar Centre.Vijay Patil, deputy commissioner of police, zone 4, said, “The Mahendra Singh-led group organised the camp at the Poddar Centre and allegedly administered bogus vaccines to its 207 employees.” Singh is presently in the custody of Kandivli police and is one of the key members who executed bogus vaccination camps at various places in Mumbai. “As the accused, Singh, is also involved in this case, we suspect that the camp was organised by the same group, but with different nursing staff and doctor,” said a police inspector from the Bhoiwada police station.In Bangur Nagar vaccination was done on May 25 and 38 employees of Bank of Baroda were vaccinated, whereas 514 people were vaccinated from Mansi Share and Stock Advertisers Private Limited at Shimpoli, Borivli (West) on May 26 and May 27. The accused Mahendra Singh, Sanjay Gupta, Manish Tripathi, Shrikant Mane and Seema Ahuja are some of the common accused in other FIRs. The group charged ₹1,000 per jab.During Singh’s interrogation in the Kandivli case, he revealed details about the bogus camp at Parel, following which we started a probe. After contacting Poddar Centre employees in the preliminary probe, it was ascertained that Singh’s group conducted bogus vaccination camp, following which, on the complaint of institute’s employee we registered a criminal offence and have begun an investigation, said DCP Patil.The police have booked the six accused under sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (Forgery for purpose of cheating), and 471(Using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), 269 (unlawfully or negligent act which likely to spread the infection of dangerous disease), 270 (malignant act which is likely to spread infection of any disease dangerous to life), 274 (adulteration of drugs), 275 (sale of adulterated drugs), 276 (Sale of drug as a different drug or preparation), 34 (common intention) and sections 43 (damage to computer system) and 66C (identity theft) of Information Technology Act and 3 of Epidemic Diseases Act.The Bhoiwada police will take Singh’s custody after his police custody is over in other cases. The police are now in process of collecting evidence and recording statements of those employees who were administered bogus vaccines.Fraud group also held camp in ThanePolice officers’ part of the investigation said that during interrogation the accused have revealed that they have also conducted a bogus vaccination drive at the RenewBuy Insurance Company in Pachpakhadi area of Thane on May 26.After this, they organised a vaccination camp in Borivli, Parel (May 28-29) and then at Hiranandani Heritage in Kandivli on May 30, and later at other places in city.A civil contractor (who could become a witness in the case) had taken the jab at the Thane camp. After the Poddar administration showed interest in camp, he then introduced them to Shrikant Mane, who along with Seema Ahuja organised a vaccination camp at Parel through Mahendra Singh, the police said.Singh-led group would mostly tell their ‘victims’ that they had procured the vaccines from Dahisar-based Shivam Hospital, the police said.Majiwada (Thane) resident Mane and Kalyan resident Ahuja are former employees of controversial global tours and travel agency Cox and Kings group. They played the role of mediators in the fake vaccine scam.

These plans will then be submitted to member (water) for verification and further necessary action. On execution of these plans, it is expected that the number of complaints the DJB receives will reduce.”He added, “We need to find a way to supply the available raw water in an equitable manner, either through a piped network or additional tanker trips. DJB’s officers need to ensure that complaints received are redressed promptly without fail.”He instructed DJB officials that a constituency-wise analysis of the database, in terms of the amount of water received by DJB installations, needs to be done at regular intervals to ascertain the gap between demand and supply.Chadha also directed the formation of an emergency response team, consisting chief engineers and superintendent engineers, who will draft special task plans for critical areas under their jurisdiction in consultation with area MLAs and after site visits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-jal-board-discusses-ways-to-streamline-water-supply-101624560352528.html
25-06-2021||Other||Trader body meets DMRC chief highlights problem of crowding outside Metro stations||New Delhi: Long queues outside Metro stations are causing crowding and traffic snarls in markets around stations, a delegation of traders told Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) managing director Mangu Singh on Thursday, officials and members of the delegation said.Long queues outside Metro stations, especially during peak hours, have become a common sight ever since the Metro resumed operations on June 7. The passenger load has almost doubled in the past fortnight, Metro officials said. As per the data, on June 7, 680,000 lakh passenger journeys or trips were carried out which increased to 1.3 million on June 18. On June 20 , 848,000 trips were operated on Sunday and 852,000 on June 24.The delegation comprised of members of the Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) who told the DMRC MD that considering most markets in Delhi are located around Metro stations, the long queues outside their gates were spilling over to markets causing crowding and traffic jams, members of the delegation said. “Since the Metro services reopened after the Covid-19 lockdown, only limited number of gates are kept open and entry and exit are managed from the same gate. We have asked the DMRC to allow more gates to be opened and to also to increase the frequency of trains so that crowd does not spill over to markets,” said Brijesh Goyal, chairperson, CTI. Goyal said stations around markets such as Chandni Chowk, Kashmere Gate, Red Fort and Rajiv Chowk, more entry and exits should be opened. The traders said that the intermittent closure of metro gates to ensure social distancing inside on the Metro network was causing crowding on the roads adjacent to the stations and also around parking areas. The Delhi Metro said crowding was mostly happening around busy stations and those that act as interchange facilities. They said the Metro was strictly ensuring Covid-19 protocols are followed both inside and outside its premises, which is why limited number of gates are being used and rigorous checks are being ensured to avoid crowding on stations. DMRC officials as per the government guidelines for Covid management, sitting is being allowed only on alternative seats with no standing. This means that the system was only operating at 10-15% of its capacity, the officials said, adding this is what causing crowding at some of the stations. “The long queues are caused as single-entry points only are permitted at most of the Metro stations. In a mass transit system, it is difficult to regulate the number of persons inside the system once full entry is permitted,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications). A senior official confirmed each coach now carries 25-30 passengers compared to 300 earlier. Besides restricted seating, only 5,100 train trips every day at a peak frequency of 2.5 minutes to 5 minutes is being managed on all the major corridors. “This was the same frequency at which Metro was operating during the normal pre-Covid times. The Metro is thus operating and running at its full frequency/capacity but with a reduced number of passengers owing to restrictions,” Dayal said. Mohan Taparia, a commuter travelling from Dwarka Mor to Rajiv Chowk on Thursday said that he had to wait over half hour just to get inside the station. “There is no problem once you’re inside the station. But the problem is to get in. There is a long queue and people rarely follow any social distancing. How does any social distancing inside the station help if there is crowding outside,” said Taparia. Experts also said that agencies will have to ensure that while Covid norms are followed inside the Metro system, crowding is also controlled outside station gates. Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said a mass transit mode such as the Delhi Metro was designed to carry more standing passengers than seated ones, adding that reducing the carrying capacity of trains to 10% (calculated based on pre-pandemic passenger traffic) will only push the system to more losses. He also pointed out that it is important that the Metro stations and trains do not become infection hot spots. “We really need to plan this carefully. It is important that rather than putting the entire onus of ensuring social distancing on the Metro, the government should also play its part by controlling passenger load by staggering market hours, office timings, etc. Meanwhile, for the time being, the Metro can focus on increasing the frequency of trains and add more coaches so that the carrying capacity can increase,” Ram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/trader-body-meets-dmrc-chief-highlights-problem-of-crowding-outside-metro-stations-101624560351914.html
25-06-2021||Delhi||Shalimar Bagh dacoity: Suspects yet to be identified||Investigations into the Shalimar Bagh dacoity case, in which five men broke into the house of a businessman in Shalimar Bagh on Tuesday, held his daughter hostage and decamped with cash and jewellery worth over ₹20 lakh, failed to make headway, with the police now suspecting that the five men may be from outside Delhi. Questioning of scores of local criminals has yielded no results or helped the police identify the suspects, officers associated with the probe said on Thursday.Multiple teams of north-west district are working on the case, but despite having CCTV footage in which the suspects are seen, one of them without a mask, police are still clueless about their identities, an investigator said, asking not to be named.“One of the theories we are working on is that the suspects may be from a “transformed version” of the notorious Bawariya gangs as the modus operandi of the five men is similar to that of Bawariyas,” said the officer, adding that the teams are also looking at an Aligarh-based gang that had committed a similar crime in Rohini a couple of years ago. Bawariyas are a nomadic tribe, whose folk have been involved in a string of violent crimes, including murder, rape, burglary and/or assaults, in the states of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.On Tuesday around 2.30am, five unidentified robbers, four of them wearing masks, broke into the ground floor house of Ramesh Bansal, a businessman dealing in steel utensils, in Shalimar Bagh, held his 24-year-old daughter Arushi hostage, ransacked her room and decamped with cash and jewellery worth over ₹20 lakh that the family has purchased for her wedding.The robbers remained in the house for nearly one and a half hours and ransacked the entire room in which the woman slept. Bansal and his 22-year-old son Chetan were sleeping in their respective rooms with the air-conditioners (ACs) on, because of which, they did not hear anything and remained asleep, even as the robbers fled with cash and jewellery, the police said.Explaining why investigators are suspecting that the men are from “outside Delhi”, the officer quoted above said unlike the Bawariya gangs, which usually kill or harm their victims, the five suspects did not harm Arushi. Also, unlike the Bawariya gangs that ransack the entire house, the five only targeted Arushi’s room; particularly the almirah in which cash and jewellery were kept, the officer said.“There are also several similarities. Like the Bawariya gang members, the five suspects also chose a house close to a park, and cut the iron fencing of the park and scaled a boundary wall to enter the house. In the video footage, they are seen wearing tight clothes, the kind that is preferred by Bawariya members,” the officer said.Police are also collecting dump data of cellphones active in the neighbourhood at the time of the dacoity. “The scrutiny of the dump data may help us identify mobile numbers that did not belong to people living in the locality,” another police officer said, also requesting anonymity.The police have not ruled out the involvement of an “insider” as the robbers specifically asked the woman about the wedding jewellery. The robbers took away the woman’s iPhone but left her MacBook. She used the laptop to contact a friend, who in turn called the police control room and informed them about the crime. The woman’s father and brother learnt of the incident only on being woken up by the police knocking on their door.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/shalimar-bagh-dacoity-suspects-yet-to-be-identified-police-say-they-may-be-bawariyas-101624560351310.html

It is currently undergoing testing and security audit. The NIC is also trying to add a face recognition system in the software to ensure there is no proxy test attempt,” said the official. Once implemented, an applicant will not have to visit the RTO to give the test for the learners’ licence. The project is likely to take off in about two months. “It will be an e-learner’s licence with a validity of six months. The process will require applicants to register on the transport department website, that will provide them a date on which they can take the learner’s licence test from their homes. The applicant will go through a standard online tutorial and then take the test. The candidates will also have to sit for a test to check for colour blindness, after which the e-learner’s licence will be issued,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/elearners-licence-software-in-final-stages-101624560350530.html
25-06-2021||Delhi||Four students ‘planning terror activities in Delhi’, detained from Ladakh||Delhi Police on Thursday said they have detained four students from Kargil who were allegedly making a conspiracy to plan and execute terror activities in the national capital.Police identified the four men as Nazir Hussain, 26, Zulfikar Ali Wazir, 25, Aiaz Hussain, 28, and Muzammil Hussain, 25. Officers said the four, who are all residents of Thang village in Kargil district of Ladakh, were detained in a joint operation with Intelligence Bureau, Kargil Police and the Delhi police’s special cell.“They have been taken on transit remand and brought to Delhi for questioning. Further details will be shared in due course,” a police spokesperson said.The police in their statement said the four men were conspiring to execute a terror attack but did not officially specify the nature of the attack that the men were allegedly planning, or if they were part of any recent terror attack in Delhi.But officials privy to the investigation said the four suspects were allegedly linked to the explosion outside the Israel embassy on January 29, 2021.No police officer, who is authorised to issue press statements, commented on the exact role of the four men in the explosion. A mid-level officer, who asked not to be named, said, “The central intelligence agencies had intercepted them. It was their operation. We will question them in connection with this case and the other plans that they had.”According to the police, a low-intensity improvised device went off around 5pm near the Israel embassy on APJ Abdul Kalam Road. No injury to any person was reported in the incident. The window panes of a few vehicles parked on the road were shattered outside the embassy.

Police said around 3pm, the employee, identified as Rajesh, was going from Kucha Mahajani near Chandni Chowk on a scooter to hand over the money to his employer in Pitampura. When he reached metro pillar number 142 in Gulabi Bagh around 3:30pm, four men on two bikes intercepted him and asked him to hand over the bag to them. When Rajesh resisted, the robbers threatened to shoot him, snatched the bag at gunpoint and fled the spot. Rajesh raised an alarm and informed his employer. The police was also informed about the crime.“A case of robbery has been registered at the Gulabi Bagh police station. Several teams have been formed to identify and nab the robbers,” said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse.  Investigators said they are scanning CCTV cameras installed in Kucha Mahajani. They are also scanning the footage of cameras installed on the route that Rajesh took and the place where the robbery took place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4-rob-man-at-gunpoint-101624560293051.html
25-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt lays down guidelines for foster care, invites applications||After a delay of nearly six years, the Delhi government has laid down detailed guidelines for the foster care of children who have been deprived of a family or have parents who have been declared unfit. To that end, the department of women and child development (WCD) has also invited applications from families interested in fostering children.Until now, family-based foster care could never take off in Delhi, despite being mandated under the Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act, 2015, as the policy was stuck in administrative hurdles. But, group foster care has been in place with scores of NGOs taking in children and providing them institutional care.The new guidelines are in addition to the government’s child sponsorship policy -- Hindustan Times reported on this on June 20 -- which allows corporates and individuals to sponsor the education, health, and basic sustenance of children. Till now, such activities were limited to a few NGOs.The new policies and guidelines come in the backdrop of several children losing either one or both parents to Covid-19. As per the recent data collected by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, at least 1,436 children lost either one or both parents to Covid-19 in the city. Of them, 59 lost both parents, while 467 lost their mother and 910 lost their father.Under the foster care system, the government will incentivise foster care by offering a monthly financial assistance of ₹2,000 per child to the foster family.“This foster care scheme will be linked to the Covid-19 compensation scheme of the Delhi government, which was notified on June 22. We will soon begin an intensive awareness campaign about the scheme so that more people come forward to apply to foster children, and, after scrutinising applications, we will get a clear picture of the number of children who lost their parents or have been abandoned during this pandemic or otherwise. Such children, upon thorough social investigation, will either be placed for adoption, if the child is below six years of age, or for foster care, if (s)he is more than six years old,” said a senior official from the WCD department, on condition of anonymity.According to the guidelines, the decision to declare an orphan, abandoned or surrendered child as legally free for adoption/foster care is to be taken only on the concurring opinion of majority members (at least three of them) of the child welfare committee (CWC). When there is no majority, the opinion of the chairperson shall prevail. It also mandates that in the case of siblings, they must be kept together, unless it is in their best interests to stay apart.“The number of children placed with a foster family shall not exceed eight in one unit, including biological children of the foster parents… Children who are not being adopted after being declared legally free for adoption may be eligible for foster care… Short term foster care shall be for a period of one year. Long term foster shall be for a period exceeding one year, which can be periodically extended by the CWC till the child attains 18 years of age…,” read the foster care guidelines, a copy of which is with HT.A family will be eligible to apply for foster care if the applicant and spouse are at least 35 years old and are Indian citizens, owning a house in Delhi. Both spouses have to be willing to foster the same child and have enough income to meet the needs of the child or children. “A final call on putting a child with a particular set of foster parents will be taken either by the CWC concerned or the Juvenile Justice Board,” said the official quoted above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-lays-down-guidelines-for-foster-care-invites-applications-101624560291884.html
25-06-2021||Delhi||NDMC hikes trade licence fee by 7% for fiscal 2021-22||The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has increased the annual fee for renewal of trade licences for fiscal 2021-22 by up to 7%. Senior officials said the new fee will be applicable for restaurants, hotels, coffee shops and sweet shops.In a statement released on Thursday, the NDMC said the maximum hike in licence fee is for five-star hotels, which will now have to shell out ₹65,484 per annum to obtain a licence, instead of the earlier ₹61,200.Generally, the health and trade licence is issued for a period of three to five years, and may be revised after two years, officials said.The NDMC made a similar attempt at increasing the licence fee last year as well, but the decision was rolled back after the intervention of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who cited the Covid crisis as a reason to not put additional financial burden on traders.“The new licence fee for 2021-22 will be applicable from April 1. There would not be any increase for small kiosks, stalls, Mother Dairy booths, water trolleys etc. For the rest of the categories, the increase ranges from ₹100 to ₹1,700 annually, except in the case of five-star hotels,” an NDMC official said.Under the new structure, butchers, fish and poultry traders will have to pay an annual fee of ₹1,284 now, against the earlier fee of ₹1,200.Guest houses with up to 20 beds will have to pay ₹2,568 instead of the earlier ₹2,400, while those with 21-50 beds will have to pay ₹6,527 instead of ₹6,100. Guest houses having 51-100 beds will have to shell out ₹13,054 now as against ₹12,200 earlier. For guest houses with more than 100 beds, the fee has been hiked from ₹24,500 to ₹26,215.For cafes with more than 50 seats, the fee has been revised to ₹13,054; earlier, it was capped at ₹12,200.The NDMC also stated that office canteens, sweet shops, gyms, auditoriums and circuses that were earlier charged a licence fee of ₹1,200, will now have to pay ₹1,284, while movie theatres, dance halls at hotels, clubs and spas will have to pay ₹6,527 as licence fee to the civic agency instead of the earlier ₹6,500.“The NDMC would process around 200 cases (categories) for health licences this year. Of these cases, there would be no increase in the fee for 25% cases, which cover all small shops, stalls, water trolleys etc,” the NDMC statement read.It added, “In 40% cases, there would be an increase of ₹400, 30% cases would have increase of ₹900, 2% cases have ₹100 and 1% cases covering five-star hotels etc. would have an increase of ₹4,300 per case per annum.”In a statement issued by Palika Bazar Association, traders said they had written to the Prime Minister, the chief minister and to their member of Parliament, requesting relief from any tax hike this year. However, no consolation as forthcoming they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ndmc-hikes-trade-licence-fee-by-7-for-fiscal-202122-101624560291186.html
25-06-2021||Delhi||Over 157,000 get Covid vaccine jabs in Delhi as drive picks up||The national capital on Thursday administered a record 157,060 doses of coronavirus vaccines, as the inoculation programme in Delhi kept up its upward momentum, days after a new phase of the drive kicked off across the country.The city also added 288 new vaccination sites on Thursday, taking the number of sites in the city to 1,374, all of which are now open to people of all ages.The Delhi government on Wednesday said it removed age restrictions from vaccination sites, which were previously exclusively for either the 18-45 or 45-plus age bracket, after the Centre began procuring and supplying all shots.Wednesday saw Delhi administer over 100,000 vaccine doses in a day for the first time. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Atishi on Thursday said Delhi has so far given 25% of its population aged between 18 and 45 at least one dose of a vaccine.“There has been an increase in supplies available for the younger age bracket, because vaccine stocks for both groups have now been clubbed,” said Atishi, the AAP legislator from Kalkaji.So far, 5,172,606 people in the Capital have got at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 1,625,630 have received both.The state government on Thursday also said it has planned a vaccination drive for the city’s homeless Friday onwards, beginning with central district’s Yamuna Pushta, which houses several homeless shelters.The immunisation drive picked up pace after June 21, after the switch in vaccination policy allowed the government to use the free doses by the Centre, previously meant for the above-45 age-group, to adults of all ages.Also read | Covid-19: Shots for 60+ group hit hesitancy hurdle“The government started the Jahan Vote, Wahin Vaccine campaign earlier, focussing on those above the age of 45. With more than 70% of the people in the age group already immunised [with at least one dose], the response was not great despite all our outreach efforts. Once the vaccination centres were opened up for the young, the numbers shot up because they were enthusiastic and waiting for the vaccine to become available,” said a senior administration official from Shahdara district.Another official from south-west district added that walk-ins have proved to be a popular choice.“Several people prefer walk-ins, and centres have started seeing more and more people coming in since centres began to allow them at the start of the week,” said the official.These vaccination sites in the Capital can administer over 226,000 shots a day, and districts said they have planned to open more such centres once Delhi receives more shots.“The supply of vaccines has improved over the past week, and bulk supplies are likely soon, as companies increase their production. The plan is to administer 300,000 shots a day; we have planned accordingly. The sites will be started as more vaccines become available,” said a third district official.India’s vaccine drive began on January 16, for health care workers, expanded to include all front-line workers on February 1, and then, everyone over the age of 60 years and people over the age of 45 with co-morbidities, on March 1. On April 1, it was further expanded to include everyone over the age of 45. Then, in response to demand from states and people, the drive was opened up further, to everyone over the age of 18 years, although states were told they would have to pay for the vaccines of those between the ages of 18 and 45. Private hospitals were also allowed to offer vaccinations. However, with supplies constrained, the drive faltered. The country’s Supreme Court too termed the approach “arbitrary”, forcing a rethink.On June 7, Prime Minister Modi announced that the Centre would again be in charge of sourcing and supplying vaccines. It would, he added, buy 75% of locally available vaccines, with the remainder being reserved for private hospitals. And it would bear the cost of the entire 75%, he added.The new phase of the vaccine drive comes even as cases of Covid-19 are declining in the country, with the ebbing of the second wave.The Delhi government’s vaccination bulletin on Thursday said the city currently has 20 days’ stock of Covaxin and nine days of Covishield. Delhi received more than 68,000 Covaxin doses and 80,000 Covishield doses on Wednesday.However, the government is limiting Covaxin jabs to those due for a second dose.“We will need the current stock of Covaxin for those who were given their first shot in May,” said a fourth official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-157-000-get-covid-vaccine-jabs-in-delhi-as-drive-picks-up-101624560290559.html

The injured policemen were identified as assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Vishram, and head constable Vinod. Both of them were admitted to Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) hospital and are undergoing treatment. Police said that though the ASI is out of danger, his condition is still serious. According to deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel, ASI Vishram, head constable Vinod and constable Anoop were regulating traffic at Mangal Pandey Road near Mayapuri traffic signal on Tuesday afternoon. Around 4.30pm, they spotted a Volkswagen car with tinted (blacksheet) glasses coming towards them. The car was nearly 50 metres away when the policemen signalled the driver to stop, said police. “Initially, the driver slowed down the car but as the vehicle was approaching the policemen, he suddenly pressed the accelerator. The car hit Vishram with such force that he flung into the air and fell on the road, sustaining grievous injuries to his head, right hand and hip,” said a traffic police officer, who did not want to be named.According to the officer, Vinod was standing behind Vishram. Due to the unexpected and sudden increase in the car’s speed, he did not get time to move away and jumped over the car’s bonnet to avoid getting hurt. “Instead of stopping the car, the driver sped his vehicle and dragged Vinod on the bonnet for nearly two kilometres. Vinod lost his grip and fell down from the bonnet near Hari Nagar bus depot. He injured his hands and left leg. The car driver fled the spot on his vehicle,” said the officer. Police said that constable Anoop, with the help of the public, rushed both Vishram and Vinod to DDU hospital. Later, a case was registered based on their complaint. The police have identified the culprit and are yet to arrest him. The owner of the car has been identified with the help of CCTV cameras installed on the routes that the vehicle took before and after the mishap, said police on Thursday.“We have registered a case under Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the IPC. Efforts are on to arrest the car driver,” said Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-speeding-car-hits-2-traffic-cops-in-west-hari-nagar-one-critically-injured-101624560231364.html
25-06-2021||Delhi||Sisodia to review cultural plans delayed by pandemic||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia will review various plans of the government’s art and culture department that have been delayed due to the Covid-19 outbreak, department officials said.They said the plans will have to be altered in view of the impact of the pandemic and resultant lockdowns on funding. “A pandemic-influenced view of culture is needed in the current circumstances. Besides, spending towards projects is likely to be reduced,” said an official, who asked not to be named. The official added that Sisodia, who holds the art, culture and language portfolio, wrote to the art and culture department last week and exhorted it to use art as a medium to increase awareness about vaccines.Abhinandita Dayal Mathur, adviser to the deputy chief minister, said Sisodia has underlined the need to review and implement measures in view of the pandemic. “More than ever before, we need a cultural policy amid the pandemic. In such times, we need art and culture to derive hope and keeping the same in mind, plans will be reviewed and implemented,” said Mathur.The Delhi Cultural Policy Advisory Committee, that was set up last year to formulate a comprehensive cultural policy, is also expected to submit its report to Sisodia. “The focus will be on implementing cultural policy reforms in a manner that art can be used to give hope in these difficult times, while ensuring a dignified way of living for artists,” the department official quoted above said.Earlier this year,the Delhi government announced plans to commemorate 75 years of India’s Independence with 75-weeks of celebrations. The plans were stalled amid the spike in Covid-19 cases in April.Sanjay Garg, the chief archivist at Delhi Archives, said many activities, such as plans for the commemoration of 75 years of Independence, might be recalibrated in view of the pandemic, “While we have been planning activities keeping the pandemic in mind, things don’t look very concrete right now in the current scenario. There is uncertainty. We are trying to formulate programmes that can be conducted online while prioritising safety. We might have to wait and monitor the situation for one to two months before we can kick off new activities on the ground,” said Garg.As the city slowly and steadily unlocks itself after a punishing fourth wave of infections, artists who are part of the Delhi government’s street theatre and performing arts fellowship, have started campaigns aimed at quelling vaccine hesitancy. Sisodia launched the fellowship on January 15 this year to promote street art in Delhi. It supports 500 artists from diverse backgrounds including theatre, music, dance and fine arts.The fellowship comes under Delhi government’s department of art, culture and languages and offers a monthly stipend of ₹5,000 to the selected artists.“On an experimental basis, we started the campaign and scaled it up after receiving good response. While some people are a little rigid, we have been able to capture attention and many people have now started paying attention to our message. We have performed at four different clusters in the city in June alone,” said Shyama Manna, 21, a street art fellow.Manna said performances were focusing on making people aware of ‘Jahan Vote, Wahan vaccination’ campaign, besides busting myths pertaining to vaccination.“We tell people about the vaccination campaign, by which they can get inoculated at their polling booth located in the neighbourhood. Often, there are rumours surrounding the vaccines. We dispel these rumours with factual information,” said Manna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sisodia-to-review-cultural-plans-delayed-by-pandemic-101624560230567.html
25-06-2021||Delhi||One more held in GTB hospital shootout case, 16 arrests so far||One more suspect involved in the east Delhi’s Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital shoot-out was arrested from outer Delhi’s Karala village by the Rohini district police on Wednesday. The total number of people arrested in the case has now reached 16, while two juveniles have also been apprehended earlier in the case, said police officers privy to the development.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said on Wednesday, the district’s special staff team received information that Amit Mathur, who was wanted in the shoot-out case, was going to visit his house in Karala village. The information was verified and accordingly, a trap was laid. The team caught Mathur and later handed him over to GTB Enclave police station’s team, that is investigating the case.On March 25, a group of criminals attacked a police team inside the hospital when they had brought gangster Kuldeep Mann alias Fajja for a check-up. In the ensuing shoot-out, one gangster was killed and another was injured. Fajja managed to escape with one of the suspects on a bike which they robbed from a person who was visiting the hospital for his wife’s check-up. Three days later, the police tracked Fajja to an apartment in Rohini and gunned him down.“Mathur confessed to his involvement in the shoot-out and the conspiracy to help Fajja escape police custody. He was roped in by Deepak alias Teetar, who has been emerged as one of the key conspirators. Mathur is also associated with jailed gangster Jitender alias Gogi,” said the DCP.Investigators said nearly 30 criminals from Delhi and Haryana were part of the conspiracy and were divided into three modules, each assigned with a different task. Mathur was part of the module led by Deepak alias Boxer, Teetar, Mohit Badani and Ravi Malik, who was killed in the gunfight at the hospital, according to the charge sheet filed by the police.“Mathur reached the hospital on a bike and he was aksed to help Fajja flee. The conspirators had asked Mathur to keep the bike’s engine on to save time. However, the suspects were not expecting a shoot-out, and hence after gunshots were heard in the hospital campus, the plan went haywire. Fajja snatched a bike at gunpoint at the hospital’s gate number 7 and fled with Deepak alias Boxer. Mathur fled on his bike,” said an investigator, requesting not to be named.The charge sheet in the case names two fugitive dons as the main conspirators – Sandeep alias Kala Jatheri and his key associate Kala Rana – who are currently operating from Dubai and Bangkok respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-more-held-in-gtb-hospital-shootout-case-16-arrests-so-far-101624560170534.html
25-06-2021||Lucknow||Stay alert, Yogi directs officials on Covid’s ‘Delta-Plus’ variant||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday asked for initiating special alertness and caution in the state in view of cases of new coronavirus variant ‘Delta-Plus’ surfacing in several states in the country.“Hold a meeting with the state expert committee on Covid and chalk out a strategy to tackle the new variant. Begin sample collections in the districts of UP that are closer to such states that have confirmed cases of Delta-Plus and then get genome sequencing done on those samples”, Yogi said.According to his statement, the state is barely 3 lakh doses away from achieving the June month’s target of administering one crore doses state and is likely to overshoot the target as the state aims to give six lakh does each day till June 30.The chief minister said this at the high-level Covid-19 review meeting and said that all necessary arrangements and equipment required for genome sequencing should be arranged at Lucknow’s King George’s Medical University (KGMU).Yogi said that so far, the strategies that the state government had been applying proved effective in controlling Covid-19 infection in the state and the policy of ‘trace, test, treat’ must continue with efficiency.Talking about vaccination, Yogi said, “Against June month’s target of the state government of administering one crore doses, the state has already administered 97 lakh jabs. Vaccination is an effective safety shield against the Covid, so that inoculation campaign in the state must continue effectively, with speed, and uninterrupted. From June 21 to 30, the state had made the target of minimum six lakh jabs each day and then from July 1 at least 10 lakh doses each day.”He said that in the last 24 hours, a total of 229 fresh cases of Covid were reported in the state, while 308 patients recovered and discharged from hospitals, and only 3,552 cases are active across the state. He said Covid recovery rate was now 98.5% in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/stay-alert-yogi-directs-officials-on-covid-s-delta-plus-variant-101624559512786.html
25-06-2021||Pune||Kabaddi gets a leg-up, PMC plans to form its own teams||Pune: Corporator Amol Balwadkar’s initiative to have the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) own kabaddi teams, boys and girls, has found some grounds for success. The PMC general body on June 22 passed a motion to plan its own teams of kabaddi players. “I had proposed to create a kabaddi team of international stature, where 15 girls and 15 boys will be selected, and trained by national coaches,” said Balwadkar, corporator, Prabhag 9 Balewadi, adding that he was seeking approval for the plan for the last one year. “The proposed Pune Municipal Corporation team will be registered as a commercial entity under the Pune District Kabaddi Association. They will be eligible to participate in industrial events, contests organised by private and public-sector companies, and local tournaments. It is a welcome development for the promotion of the sport. Let’s hope it will also help players to get job opportunities,” said Rajendra Andekar, joint secretary, Pune District Kabaddi Association. The proposal stated that PMC will help prepare players from district and state for national and international competitions by providing a dedicated space for practice and taking care of their well-being. The criteria and details for player selection will soon be published as an advertisement. “Once the details are out, it will bring clarity on how players and coaches representing the PMC team will get paid,” said Andekar, who added that the proposal’s financials will be decided after it is cleared by the civic administration. Players have welcomed the innovative and said that it will be beneficial for many who although are promising, but are jobless. Pooja Shelar, national player from Bhosari and winner of the state’s Shiv Chhatrapati Award, said that the proposal is a good concept. “We have coaches, but women support is not enough. We need coaches who can hone our skills, guide good diet plan and teach exercises adopted by international players. The concept will also open doors for good work opportunities.” Ankita Jagtap, former captain of Maharashtra team and member of Rajmata Jijau Sangh in Shukrawar Peth, said, “This kind of programme should push for more women kabaddi players to come forward, but we need more professional leagues like the men’s event as playing professionally will also open better job opportunities. We also need a dedicated place for practice and better our game.” Kishori Shinde, assistant commissioner, PMC sports department confirmed that the general body has okayed the proposal. “It will be a good platform for kabaddi players, but the municipal commissioner will take the final call,” Shinde said. Vikas Kale, national player and Pro Kabaddi League participant who represents Haryana Steelers, said, “It is a good initiative for players. PMC teams should have good coaches and trainers who will select players only on performance basis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/kabaddi-gets-a-leg-up-pmc-plans-to-form-its-own-teams-101624546069336.html

McAfee had said he would call her in his last call, the widow has said.John McAfee, the creator of the McAfee antivirus software, was found dead in his cell in a jail near Barcelona, a government official confirmed on Wednesday.The Spanish authorities have rushed to swiftly conduct the autopsy on McAfee's body. However, the officials maintain that everything found at the scene of death points to death by suicide.“His last words to me were 'I love you and I will call you in the evening,'” Janice McAfee said shortly after she recovered her late husband's belongings outside the Brians 2 penitentiary northwest of Barcelona.“Those words are not words of somebody who is suicidal,” Janice said. The widow of the 75-year-old has sought a “thorough investigation” in her first public remarks since the software entrepreneur's death.Embroiled in a tax evasion controversy, McAfee was arrested last year in October from the Barcelona airport on a warrant issued by Tennessee prosecutors who were pushing for a software master's imprisonment for 30 years on the alleged charges of tax evasion running to more than $4 million in taxes.McAfee's death came a day before the Spain National Court had announced its decision to extradite him to the US, which would have resulted in criminal proceedings against him. However, the decision of the court was not final.Tennessee prosecutors charged 75-year-old McAfee with evading taxes after failing to report income made from promoting cryptocurrencies while he did consultancy work, as well as income from speaking engagements and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary.Janice has alleged that McAfee's death is a result of politically motivated charges. “We had a plan of action already in place to appeal that decision,” the 38-year-old Janice McAfee told reporters. “I blame the US authorities for this tragedy: Because of these politically motivated charges against him my husband is now dead.”Authorities have said McAfee's autopsy could take "days or weeks".The couple reportedly met in 2012 in Miami and married the following year. John McAfee met Janice in 2012 in Miami. The two formalised their relationship into a marriage and had several children from previous relationships, Janice said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/his-last-words-to-me-were-i-love-you-mcafee-was-not-suicidal-says-widow-101624634874202.html

China defence ministry spokesperson Ren Guoqiang said that China believes in its complete reunification and expressed Beijing’s opposition towards Washington-Taipei military ties.Guoqiang said that China remains firmly opposed to any official exchanges or military contacts between the US and Taiwan and asked Washington to ‘sever all military ties with Taiwan’.“The complete reunification of China is a historical necessity and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is an unstoppable trend. The common aspirations of the people are peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. ‘Taiwan independence’ is a dead-end road and seeking it means war,” the statement quoting Guoqiang said.Guoqiang reminded the US to fully understand China’s development and growth by external focus and asked the US to abide by the one-China principle. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has recently ramped up political and military pressure.Taiwan foreign minister Joseph Wu said that the nation needs to prepare for a possible military conflict due to China’s increasing intimidation tactics. Taiwan reported several incursions into its airspace by Chinese warplanes. Guoqiang also said that the People Liberation Army (PLA) dispatched multi-type aircrafts to conduct exercises in the Taiwan Strait. He highlighted that the move was necessary in response to the current situation across the Taiwan Strait and China’s need to safeguard its sovereignty. In retaliation, the US stepped up its support to Taipei.The G7 leaders issued a statement earlier condemning Beijing over its human rights abuses and highlighted the need for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The US navy continues to conduct transits through the Taiwan Strait on a monthly basis.(with inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-means-war-china-warns-us-over-military-ties-with-taipei-101624636053348.html

Pakistan has also failed to adequately investigate and prosecute senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terrorist groups, the FATF observed.Despite its efforts to get out of the list, Pakistan has been on the watchdog's list for three years now. A primary reason why Pakistan has not been able to spare the global scrutiny is that it has not tackled the money laundering and terror financing flagged by the FATF.Landing on the 'grey list' for 3 years now, Pakistan will continue to not get any respite in accessing finances in the form of investments and aid from international bodies including the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Here is what Pakistan should do in order to drop its name from FATF list:-Pakistan, as it suggested, has to implement its plans to investigate and prosecute leaders and commanders of all the eight terror groups that have been named by FATF in the past – the Taliban, Haqqani Network, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation, al-Qaeda and Islamic State.Pakistan was asked by the global watchdog in October to deliver on all 27 points by this February but the country was not taken off the FATF list.According to an Islamabad-based think tank Tabadlab, Pakistan sustained a total of USD 38 billion in economic losses due to FATF' decision to thrice place the country on its grey list since 2008, reported ANI.The grey-listing events of Pakistan from 2008 to 2019 has resulted in total GDP losses worth USD $38 billion, the report "Bearing the cost of global politics -- the impact of FATF grey-listing on Pakistan's economy" said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-pakistan-should-do-to-get-off-the-fatf-list-10-points-101624623876849.html

Hancock has however dismissed talks of his resignation, reported Bloomberg.“I accept that I breached the social-distancing guidance in these circumstances,” Hancock said in an official statement.“I have let people down and am very sorry,” he added.A British tabloid published images of Hancock and Coladangelo embracing in the Department of Health’s London headquarter from May 6, while a deadly mutant strain of the virus was going around. The UK government relaxed lockdown norms allowing intimate contact from members outside one’s own household from May 17.The images, which have since been circulated widely on social media, appear to be screenshots of grainy CCTV footage, depicting Hancock and his aide in a close embrace. The opposition Labour Party raised questions about appointment processes in the government and the use of taxpayer’s money in ruminating government personnel, after reports emerged of Coladangelo being paid 15,000 pounds a year for her role as the non-executive director at the department of health.“Today’s revelations about the Health Secretary raise serious questions about the use of taxpayers’ money, appointment processes and why yet again Covid guidance was broken,” tweeted chair of the labour party Anneliese Dodds“Matt Hancock’s position is hopelessly untenable. Boris Johnson should sack him,” she added.Hancock said he’s focusing on working on getting the UK ”out of the ongoing pandemic” and asked for privacy for himself and his family while dealing with a personal matter. “I remain focused on working to get the country out of this pandemic, and would be grateful for privacy for my family on this personal matter,” said the statement released by his office.Hancock has repeatedly come under fire for his handling of the pandemic. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is said to have referred to Hancock as “hopeless” to his ex-advisor Dominic Cummings. The health secretary who heads the National health service has also been accused of rewarding contracts to firms he owned shares in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-health-secretary-apologises-for-breaking-covid-19-norms-after-pictures-of-embracing-aide-emerge-101624625925667.html
25-06-2021||World||Pakistan remains on FATF’s grey list||The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Friday retained Pakistan in its “grey list” for failing to adequately investigate and prosecute senior leaders and commanders of UN-designated terrorist groups. The decision was announced at the conclusion of the multilateral watchdog’s five-day virtual plenary meeting under the German presidency of Marcus Pleyer. However, FATF noted that Pakistan had completed all but one of the 27 items in the action plan drawn up for the country to tackle money laundering and terror financing when it was placed in the list of nations under increased monitoring or the grey list in 2018. “The FATF encourages Pakistan to continue to make progress to address as soon as possible the one remaining CFT (counter-terrorist financing)-related item by demonstrating that TF (terrorist financing) investigations and prosecutions target senior leaders and commanders of UN designated terrorist groups,” the body said in an announcement. Experts pointed out the sole remaining action item was significant as Pakistan has given few indications that it plans to investigate and prosecute leaders and commanders of all the eight terror groups that have been named by FATF in the past – the Taliban, Haqqani Network, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation, al-Qaeda and Islamic State. Also Read | As part of SCO framework: India proposes plan against Pak terror groupsSo far, Pakistani authorities have only investigated and prosecuted senior leaders of the LeT and JuD, including LeT founder Hafiz Saeed and several of his senior aides. Saeed and a few of his aides are currently serving sentences given to them after they were found guilty in a string of terror financing cases last year. However, no action has been taken against leaders of the JeM, such as its chief Masood Azhar, despite the group being linked to several high-profile terror attacks in recent years, or the Afghan Taliban, which has stepped up fund raising on Pakistani soil in recent weeks against the backdrop of the withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan. FATF said Pakistan should continue addressing “strategically important” deficiencies in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regimes by enhancing international cooperation by amending the country’s mutual legal assistance (MLA) law and demonstrating that assistance is being sought from foreign countries in implementing designations under UN Security Council resolution 1373. Pakistan should also demonstrate that “supervisors are conducting both on-site and off-site supervision commensurate with specific risks associated with DNFBPs (designated non-financial businesses and professions), including by applying appropriate sanctions where necessary” and that “proportionate and dissuasive sanctions are applied consistently to all legal persons and legal arrangements for non-compliance with beneficial ownership requirements”, the watchdog said. FATF said Pakistan must also demonstrate an increase in money laundering investigations and prosecutions, and that proceeds of crime continue to be restrained and confiscated in line with the country’s risk profile, including working with foreign counterparts to trace, freeze and confiscate assets, and that DNFBPs are being monitored for “compliance with proliferation financing requirements and that sanctions are being imposed for non-compliance”. The watchdog noted that “Pakistan’s continued political commitment has led to significant progress across a comprehensive CFT action plan”. FATF recognised Pakistan’s progress and noted that since February this year, the country “has made progress to complete two of the three remaining action items on demonstrating that effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions are imposed for TF convictions and that Pakistan’s targeted financial sanctions regime was being used effectively to targeted terrorist assets”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-remains-on-fatf-s-grey-list-101624624315404.html

The Trump administration, however, filed several charges against Assange, and in 2019, charges against him were expanded to include espionage, punishable by a total of 175 years in prison. As of February, the US Justice Department continued to seek his extradition from the UK.Moris, who is a lawyer by profession, stated that Biden has to stop prosecuting Assange if the US wants to be known for defending global press freedom."They can't maintain this prosecution against Julian while saying that they defend a global press freedom." Moris told ReutersAlso Read: After John McAfee's death, Edward Snowden has a warning for Julian AssangeMoris has also urged the UK government to press the Biden administration to drop its call for extradition, stating that Assange would not survive being imprisoned in the US. "I think there's no doubt that Julian wouldn't survive an extradition,"Moris and Assange met during his time at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he was granted asylum for almost seven years. They share two children together. After Ecuadorian President Lenín Moreno withdrew his country’s support Assange was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police in 2019 and he has been detained at Belmarsh ever since.Concerns for Assange’s well-being should he be extradited has mounted since antivirus mogul John McAfee died by apparent suicide in a prison in Barcelona. McAfee is said to have taken the extreme step following news of his extradition to the US on tax evasion charges.President Biden had referred to Assange as a “high-tech terrorist” in 2010, during his tenure as the vice president in the Obama administration. He had also accused WikiLeaks of damaging foreign relations with the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/julian-assange-s-fiance-urges-joe-biden-to-break-with-trump-s-legacy-and-drop-charges-101624620201387.html
25-06-2021||World||Airlines frustrated with 'uncertainty' over UK's plans to ease travel restrictions||Airlines and holiday providers on Friday expressed frustration with the UK's plans to ease travel restrictions, saying uncertainty about how and when the new rules will be implemented make it difficult for people to book summer vacations.The government on Thursday expanded its “green list” of safe travel destinations, allowing people to visit without having to self-isolate for 10 days after returning to Britain. However, all but one of the new additions were also placed on a watchlist, meaning the quarantine requirement may be re-imposed at short notice.Transportation authorities also said they intend to relax travel restrictions by allowing fully vaccinated travelers to visit higher-risk destinations, including the U.S. and most of the European Union, without having to self-isolate. They expect to implement this change “later in the summer.”“The UK has already fallen behind the EU's reopening, and a continued overly cautious approach will further impact economic recovery and the 500,000 U.K. jobs that are at stake,” said Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, which offers mainly long-haul flights to destinations such as New York, Los Angeles and Barbados.Airlines and hospitality companies have pressured the government to ease travel restrictions imposed to slow the spread of COVID-19 following the U.K.'s successful vaccination program. The pandemic has devastated Britain's travel industry, with the number of people flying through London's Heathrow Airport, the nation's busiest, plunging 73% last year.The government has created a traffic light system to manage the reopening of air travel. Destinations with low levels of COVID-19 and high levels of vaccination are placed on the “green list,” which allows pleasure trips and doesn't require self-isolation on return to Britain. Only essential travel is permitted to “amber list” countries, but travelers must self-isolate for 10 days when they return home. The government has banned most travel to destinations on the “red list,” and anyone arriving from one of these countries faces a 10-day quarantine in a government-approved hotel at their own expense.The lists are updated every three weeks.The Department for Transport said Thursday night that the expansion of the green list and plans to ease restrictions on fully vaccinated travelers were the result of the successful vaccination program. Almost 61% of U.K. adults are fully vaccinated, and 83% have received at least one dose.But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said caution was still required.“It won't be quite like it was in 2019 and the old days, but we are moving in a positive direction,” Shapps told Sky News.Public health authorities are concerned about the possibility that travelers may spread potentially more dangerous variants of COVID-19 to the U.K. from countries with low vaccination rates. The delta variant, first identified in India, has already become the dominant version of the virus in Britain.Regardless of U.K. policy, officials in the European Union are considering imposing a quarantine on British travellers because of their concerns about the delta variant which is 40% to 60% more transmissible than previous versions of COVID-19. In minutes released from government meetings earlier this month, experts said the delta variant also may be linked to a higher risk of hospitalization, although “numbers are still small” and there is no evidence the variant is more deadly.Diana Holland, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, said the government needs to change its approach to provide greater certainty for the travel industry and consumers.“The traffic light system is simply not fit for purpose,” she said. “It is impossible for a multibillion-pound industry to make plans for the future when the rug can be pulled from under them every three weeks.”The government on Thursday added more than a dozen countries and territories to its green list, including the popular holiday destinations of Malta, Madeira and the Balearic Islands. All of the destinations except Malta were placed the watch list.The changes, which take effect at 4 a.m. June 30, will expand the green list to 27 countries and territories.The newly added countries are: Malta, Madeira, the Balearic Islands, Anguilla, Bermuda, British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, Pitcairn Islands, Turks and Caicos Islands, Antigua, Barbuda, Dominica, Barbados and Grenada.Britain also added six countries to the red list, including the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Uganda. That brings the number of countries covered to 56.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airlines-frustrated-over-uncertainty-with-uk-s-plans-to-ease-travel-restrictions-101624619979594.html
25-06-2021||World||Covid-19 may have been spreading in China since Oct-Nov 2019: New study||The coronavirus linked to Covid-19 may have been spreading in China as early as October 2019, a new study has found, pushing the date back by weeks before the first case was officially identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.Officially, the first Covid-19 case is said to have been identified on December 8 and linked to Wuhan’s Huanan seafood market.But, the new study by researchers from Britain’s University of Kent pins the most likely date on November 17, saying that it had spread globally by January, 2020.The paper was published on June 24 on the PLOS Pathogens journal.“Our results suggest that the virus emerged in China in early October to mid-November, 2019 (the most likely date being November 17), and by January, 2020, had spread globally,” the researchers said, adding that it suggests a much earlier and more rapid spread than is evident from confirmed cases.The research estimates that the virus spread beyond China by January 2020 with the estimated first case being in Japan on January 3, 2020 and followed by Thailand on January 7, 2020.The researchers added that the virus is likely to have left eastern Asia and arrived in Europe, with an estimated first case on January 12, 2020 in Spain; South Korea is next on the list where the virus appeared on January 14.Following the spread to Europe, the virus appears to have spread to North America with an estimated first case being in the United States on January 16, making it the fifth country, the research suggests.China has maintained that it has shared all relevant data on the origin of the Covid-19 virus during the investigation conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO).The Chinese foreign ministry has been on a diplomatic overdrive suggesting that WHO should investigate the origin in other countries including in the US.“After the outbreak of the pandemic, China took the lead to support the WHO in conducting research on origin-tracing on a global scale…Experts on both sides jointly made field trips, analysed a large number of statistics, issued an authoritative study report, and reached many significant conclusions. This joint study actively promoted the origin-tracing globally,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in May.Doubts over the origin, however, remain, and new studies have raised new questions.In a paper released on a preprint platform this week, Jesse Bloom of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle recovered deleted sequencing data from early Covid-19 cases in China.“The data showed that samples taken from the Huanan market were “not representative” of SARS-CoV-2 as a whole and were a variant of a progenitor sequence circulating earlier, which spread to other parts of China,” Reuters reported in a story.“Why would scientists ask international databases to delete key data that informs us about how COVID-19 began in Wuhan?” said Alina Chan, a researcher with Harvard’s Broad Institute, writing on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-may-have-been-spreading-in-china-since-oct-nov-2019-new-study-101624617894574.html
25-06-2021||World||Hong Kong: Ex-cop John Lee named No 2 official as China fortifies security||China is prioritising security in all its recent legal and political overhaul in Hong Kong, as is once again apparent in a cabinet reshuffle on Thursday which saw security secretary John Lee - former long-time police officer -- being appointed to the city’s No. 2 spot. According to political commentators, this is just the latest in a series of steps that Beijing is taking to crack down on the city's pro-democracy protests, a measure that is essential to the Chinese ruling party's long-term plans for the Asian financial center.Security Secretary John Lee -- a former long-time police official -- has been promoted to the chief secretary for administration, Hong Kong’s top official, Carrie Lam, told a news conference Friday alongside Lee and other security officials receiving promotions. China’s cabinet approved the appointments Wednesday, the official Xinhua News Agency said. The next day a campaign led by Lee forced Apple Daily, the city’s biggest pro-democracy newspaper, to shut down.Lee, 63, will replace Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, and Police Commissioner Chris Tang, 55, move into the security secretary’s role. Raymond Siu, 55, a deputy police commissioner who joined the force in 1988, will take over Tang’s position at the law enforcement agency.David Webb, a prominent Hong Kong investor who has put funds into Apple Daily’s parent, Next Digital Ltd., said the government missed an opportunity to appoint a stronger team to repair the financial hub’s battered economy. “Instead, Hong Kong is starting to look more like a police state, with the No. 2 positions now being filled by a hardliner whose recent achievement is to cripple a newspaper,” Webb said in a text message.China has carried out an unprecedented campaign to curb dissent in Hong Kong, led by national security legislation handed down on June 30 last year in response to a wave of unrest. The closure of Apple Daily, which was under pressure after Lee used the security law to freeze the company’s assets as part of the city’s prosecution of company founder Jimmy Lai, represented one of the biggest blows yet to the local democracy movement.The U.K. and the U.S. condemned the newspaper’s closure, with President Joe Biden calling it a “sad day for media freedom in Hong Kong and around the world.” Lee, one of several Hong Kong officials sanctioned by the Trump administration for their role in implementing the security law, has been a vocal proponent of the legislation.“The relevant remarks by the U.S. politician are totally groundless,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian said Friday at a regular briefing in Beijing, without directly naming Biden.“The law on safeguarding national security in Hong Kong focuses on cracking down on a handful of anti-China, destabilizing forces who seriously endanger national security,” Zhao said. “The law protects the rights and freedoms enjoyed by the vast majority of Hong Kong residents, including press freedom.”The new team will be charged with overseeing a series of elections in the coming months under a Beijing-led revamp that, among other things, created a panel to vet candidates for “patriotism.” Lam, who hasn’t yet said whether she’ll see a second term when her first expires next year, has also been tasked by Beijing to pass local legislation expanding the city’s powers to police national security.“Because the government is going through the enforcement stage of the national security law, I won’t be surprised if the government wants to put people well versed with law enforcement in senior positions,” Regina Ip, who served as the city’s security secretary two decades ago and is a current member of the Executive Council that advises Hong Kong’s leader, told Bloomberg Television before the formal announcement.The chief secretary’s post has been a springboard to higher office: two of the city’s four chief executives since its return to Chinese rule in 1997 first served in the role. The appointment of a law-enforcement officer to the top administrative post, marked a shift for the former British colony, which has long been dominated by career civil servants like Lam.“There is definitely no change in the role and responsibility of the chief secretary,” Lam told reporters Friday. “The mere fact that a particular candidate is coming from a particular background doesn’t mean that the job will fit him by asking him only to perform in an area that he is most familiar with. That’s not the situation.”Senior appointments are made at the recommendation of the Hong Kong government but need final approval from Beijing. Xinhua didn’t explain why the State Council, China’s cabinet, announced the appointment two days after it was approved.Lee has sought to broaden the scope of the security law by formally stating that police surveillance of communications comes under its scope, potentially giving the authorities broader powers to intercept the information.“The implementation of the security law turned Hong Kong from chaos to governance,” he said in the Friday morning news conference. “The ‘patriots-ruling-Hong Kong’ principle and improvement of the electoral system put an end to chaos and times of destruction, opening up a new chapter of development and effective governance.”In a press conference following the arrest of five top Apple Daily executives last week, Lee said residents must distance themselves from the suspects or “you will pay a hefty price.” He earlier warned that prominent Hong Kong activists who had fled overseas to evade the security law -- such as former politicians Nathan Law and Ted Hui -- would be pursued for life.Lee’s appointment “may be a proactive strategy to elicit loyalty from the police force,” said Dongshu Liu, an assistant professor of Chinese politics at the City University of Hong Kong.“The police force has become much more important for maintaining social order and implementing the national security law,” Liu said. “You appoint someone who has been a policeman their entire career -- that’s a symbol of the increasing power of the police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-ex-cop-john-lee-named-no-2-official-as-china-fortifies-security-101624609142090.html
25-06-2021||World||They are out there? US to release the most anticipated report on UFOs||The United States is set to release a landmark report on UFO sightings over the years. Though no specific date has been announced for the release of the report, local media outlets believe that it could be made public as soon as June 25. It was expected to be delivered by the end of June.The office of the director of National Intelligence will be releasing the report before Congress and it includes the work of a US navy-led task force established by the Pentagon in August 2020 to examine "unidentified aerial phenomena" (UAP) incidents. The Pentagon in recent years has confirmed the authenticity of several videos from naval aviators showing enigmatic "aerial phenomena" exhibiting speed and manoeuvrability, unknown to the usual human knowledge.The much-anticipated report will mark a turning point for the US military after decades of being dismissive of the observations of unidentified flying objects and "flying saucers." "We take reports of incursions into our airspace – by any aircraft, identified or unidentified – very seriously, and investigate each one," Pentagon spokesperson Sue Gough said, according to Reuters.What to expect?On June 3, a report by the New York Times said that US intelligence officials have found no evidence that a series of unidentified aerial phenomena observed by the navy's aviators in recent years were alien spacecraft. The newspaper based its report on senior Biden administration officials, who were briefed ahead of the report's release.The report also found that the vast majority of more than 120 UAP incidents over the past two decades - many observed by personnel aboard US navy aircraft and warships - did not originate from any American military or other advanced government technology. The sightings remain unexplained and "have mystified scientists and the military," the officials said in the report.'Tic Tac' breath mintsA retired US navy lieutenant commander Alex Dietrich also recalled a sighting of UAP resembling large "Tic Tac" breath mints in 2004, according to Reuters. During a routine training mission with the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz off the southern California coast in November 2004, Dietrich and her then-commanding officer, fellow pilot David Fravor, were asked by another warship to investigate radar contacts in the area moving in an inexplicable fashion.Dietrich recalled that the oblong object lacked "any visible flight control surfaces or means of propulsion." Dietrich said she believes the episode was "analyzed in a professional, sober way" by the military chain of command after she and her colleagues were debriefed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/they-are-out-there-us-to-release-the-most-anticipated-report-on-ufos-101624607222370.html

The group, considered to be a white right-wing hate group, also painted "PatriotsFront.Us" at the pedestal with white paint. It was discovered vandalised at around 7:20am local time.The New York Police said they are investigating the vandalism. "The HCTF is investigating vandalism, discovered this morning, to the new George Floyd statue that was unveiled at 1545 Flatbush Ave. in Brooklyn @NYPD70Pct this past weekend. If you have any information, you are urged to DM @NYPDTips or call them @ 1-800-577-TIPS," NYPD tweeted.A Democrat and New York City Council Member Farah Louis immediately condemned and called it a "shameful act" and "hate crime" in a statement on Thursday. Louis also asserted that the action will not deter "the efforts to achieve racial justice and equality." Louis also said that her office is working with the artist, Chris Carnabuci, to repair the damage.This came after police in Newark said that they are investigating the defacing of another Floyd bust at City Hall in New Jersey. This was vandalised overnight. The 700-pound bronze statue also had the name of the same hate group painted in white on the front.Floyd was killed last year by a police officer during an arrest. Derek Chauvin, one of four police officers who were at the scene, knelt on Floyd's neck and back for more than nine minutes, while Floyd gasped for breath. A video of the incident recorded by a local teen triggered a huge outrage in the country after it went viral on social media. As he was dying, Floyd said "I can't breathe" which was used as a rallying cry during subsequent protests across the country and globally.The police officer was found guilty of murder in April this year by the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-statues-vandalised-by-white-supremacist-group-101624592435736.html

"Results infer that SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in early October to mid-November, and by January, had spread globally," a study by researchers of Britain's University of Kent said. "The model suggests a likely timing of the first case of COVID-19 in China as November 17," the research paper that was published in the PLOS Pathogens journal said.The study suggested a much earlier and more rapid spread of the contagion than is evident from the confirmed cases. This comes after a scientific paper released on Wednesday revealed that over a dozen of coronavirus test sequences that were obtained during the early months of the pandemic were deleted from an international database used to track the evolution of the virus.Also read | China deleted Covid data ‘gold mine’ in possible cover-up: StudyThe report was authored by Jesse Bloom, a virologist and evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.Critics reiterated that the deletion of the data from the international database shows China's further attempt to cover up the origin of Covid-19. "Why would scientists ask international databases to delete key data that informs us about how Covid-19 began in Wuhan?" asked Alina Chan, a researcher with Harvard's Broad Institute, on Twitter. "That's the question you can answer for yourselves," Chan added.The first official case of Covid-19 in China was recorded to have occurred in December 2019 and was linked to Wuhan's Huanan seafood market. However, some early cases had shown no known connection with Huanan, implying that the virus was already circulating before it reached the market.The data in the report by Bloom showed that samples taken from the seafood market were " not representative" of SARS-CoV-2 as a whole and were a variant of the progenitor sequence that was in circulation earlier and spread to other parts of China.Moreover, a joint study published by China and the World Health Organization (WHO) in March-end also acknowledged that there could have been sporadic human infections prior to the Wuhan outbreak in December 2019.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-covid-19-case-emerged-in-china-in-october-2019-study-101624585897030.html

The in-person extradition hearing of Tahawwur Rana, at the request of the Indian government, was held in the court of magistrate judge Jacqueline Chooljian in Los Angeles. Chooljian on Thursday ordered the defense attorneys and prosecutors to file additional documents by July 15.Rana, whose ankles were shackled, wore a white jumpsuit and black glasses, as well as a mask at the hearing, according to AP. Rana’s two daughters attended the hearing. They declined to comment, as did his lawyers.Also read | Biden admin urges US court to certify India's request to extradite Tahawwur RanaIndia alleges that Rana conspired with his childhood friend David Coleman Headley to assist the Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba in the orchestration of the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai that killed 166 people, including six Americans, and injured more than 200.Prosecutors say Rana’s immigration law centre in Chicago, as well as a satellite office in Mumbai, was allegedly used as a front for their terrorism activities between 2006 and 2008. Rana’s attorneys said their client was not aware of Headley’s terrorism plot and was merely trying to help his childhood friend and set up a Mumbai business office.They also said Headley is a serial liar who has deceived the US government multiple times in several criminal cases and his testimony should not be viewed as credible. The attorneys alleged that Headley had used Rana to further his terrorism efforts without Rana’s knowledge.Also read | Will keep spotlight on epicentre of global terrorism: Jaishankar on 26/11 anniversaryHeadley, 60, was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack. Rana has opposed his extradition to India, arguing that he has already been convicted by a US court in Chicago.US prosecutors, however, failed to prove that Rana had directly supported the Mumbai attacks. Rana’s defense attorneys, in court papers, say because he has been acquitted of the Mumbai-related charges in the US, extraditing him to India would be tantamount to double jeopardy.Ajmal Kasab was the only one of the 10 terrorists who survived and went on trial.

Civil society groups and activists in Pakistan have cried out in outrage over the prime minister's remarks which pinned the blame for rape and sexual assault squarely on women themselves. Noting that these remarks are indicative of "victim-blaming", human rights campaigners have called for a public apology from the prime minister. Incidentally, the latest controversial remarks from Imran Khan are the second time in the last two months where he drew severe condemnation for reducing sexual violence to a mere act of 'temptation'.Also Read | 'Spoke with Bill Gates last night': Imran Khan on Pakistan’s polio eradication programmePakistan's prime minister Imran Khan, in an interview with Axios' on HBO earlier this week, said, "If a woman is wearing very few clothes it will have an impact on the men unless they are robots. It's common sense." Khan also talked about the concept of 'purdah' - a religious and social practice of female seclusion in some orthodox Muslim communities - as a means to avoid 'temptation' in society."... I said the concept of 'purdah'. Avoid temptation in society. We don't have discos here, we don't have nightclubs. It is a completely different society way of life here. So if you raise temptation in society to a point -- all these young guys have nowhere to go --- it has a consequence in the society," he said.Decrying prime minister Imran Khan's comments linking women's attire to rape, as many as 16 civil society organisations in Pakistan demanded a public apology from him and said that it was an inexcusable statement from the head of government."We demand an immediate public apology from the Prime Minister and assurances that his highly flawed perception of how and why rape occurs does not inform the government's attempts to tackle what is a serious and prevalent crime in Pakistan," read a statement by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP).Also Read | ‘Forced conversions, rapes of women daily occurrence in Pakistan’: India at UNHRCOther civil society organisations in Pakistan also voiced similar concerns at a press conference held in Karachi on Thursday and said that prime minister Imran Khan would do well to understand that rape is an act of power, not a lack of sexual control. In addition to HRCP, these groups include -- the Women's Action Forum, Tehrik-e-Niswan, Aurat March, the Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research, and others."Even a cursory glance at the news should make it painfully clear that survivors of sexual violence can include women, girls, men, boys, and transgender persons--and that such acts can occur in schools, workplaces, homes, and public spaces. Gender, age and attire do not 'prevent' rape any more than the time of day or the relationship between survivor and perpetrator," the statement from the civil society groups added.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-imran-khan-under-fire-for-remarks-linking-women-s-attire-to-rape-101624578200899.html
25-06-2021||World||WHO estimates Covid vaccine boosters needed yearly for most vulnerable: Report||The World Health Organization (WHO) forecasts that people most vulnerable to Covid-19, such as the elderly, will need to get an annual vaccine booster to be protected against variants, an internal document seen by Reuters shows.The estimate is included in a report, which is to be discussed on Thursday at a board meeting of Gavi, a vaccine alliance that co-leads the WHO's Covid-19 vaccine programme COVAX. The forecast is subject to changes and is also paired with two other less likely scenarios.Vaccine makers Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc, with its German partner BioNTech, have been vocal in their view that the world will soon need booster shots to maintain high levels of immunity, but the evidence for this is still unclear.The document shows that the WHO considers annual boosters for high-risk individuals as its "indicative" baseline scenario, and boosters every two years for the general population.It does not say how these conclusions were reached, but shows that under the base scenario new variants would continue to emerge and vaccines would be regularly updated to meet these threats.The UN agency declined to comment on the content of the internal document.A spokesperson for Gavi said COVAX was planning to take a wide range of scenarios into consideration.The document, which is dated June 8 and is still a "work in progress," also predicts under the base case that 12 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses will be produced globally next year.That would be slightly higher than the forecast of 11 billion doses for this year cited by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), signalling that the UN agency does not expect a significant ramp-up of vaccine production in 2022.The document predicts manufacturing problems, regulatory approval issues and "transition away from some technology platforms" as potential drags on supplies next year.It does not signal which technologies could be phased out, but the European Union, which has reserved the world's largest volume of Covid-19 vaccines, has bet heavily on shots using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, such as those by Pfizer and Moderna, and has forgone some purchases of viral vector vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson.Worst case scenarioThe scenarios will be used to define the WHO's global vaccination strategy and the forecasts may change as new data emerges on the role of boosters and the duration of vaccine protection, Gavi says in another document, also seen by Reuters.So far about 2.5 billion doses have been administered worldwide, mostly in rich countries where over half of the population has received at least one dose, whereas in many poorer countries less than 1% has been vaccinated, according to Gavi's estimates.This gap could widen next year under the WHO's most pessimistic forecast, as the need for annual boosters could once again push poorer nations to the back of the queue.In its worst-case scenario, the UN agency says production would be 6 billion doses next year, due to stringent regulation for new shots and manufacturing issues with existing ones.That could be compounded by the need for annual boosters for the entire world, and not just the most vulnerable, to combat variants and limited duration of protection.In the more optimistic situation, all vaccines in the pipeline would get authorised and production capacity would ramp up to about 16 billion doses to meet demand. Vaccines would also be shared equitably across the world.There would be no need for boosters as vaccines would show strong efficacy against variants and long protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-estimates-covid-vaccine-boosters-needed-yearly-for-most-vulnerable-report-101624561816418.html

The man, identified as Rajesh Kumar Rathore, is admitted to the district hospital in the town, where his condition is said to be stable. The guard, 45-year-old Keshav Prasad Mishra, was taken into custody, said superintendent of police (city) Ravindra Kumar. According to police, Rahore – an employee of the Northern Railway -- came to the Bank of Baroda office at the Civil Lines area in the town around 11:30am. Mishra denied Rathore entry to the bank because he wasn’t wearing a mask, triggering a heated argument between the two. Soon after, Rathore again tried to enter the bank without a mask, after which Mishra – using his licensed rifle – shot at Rathore’s leg, said senior superintendent of police, Bareilly, Rohit Singh Sajwan. “We have arrested the guard and Rathore has been hospitalised. We are investigating the matter. It was found that the guard objected to Rathore’s entry into the bank as he was not wearing a mask. This led to the argument between them, after which the guard shot Rathore in his leg,” Sajwan said. The bank, in a statement on Friday, said it regretted the incident and extended help to Rathore’s family. Mishra, who was deployed at the bank by a private security agency, has been relieved of his duties, the statement added. Police said Mishra has been booked under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, based on the complaint filed by the victim’s wife, Priyanka Rathore.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bank-guard-shoots-at-man-after-argument-over-mask-101624644835448.html

This comes as states gradually ease curbs on business activity, keeping in mind the decline in the number of fresh Covid cases.The week ended June 13 was at least the third consecutive week in which economic activity sequentially gained momentum, according to three data trackers by research agencies using a range of data available on daily or weekly basis.Indicating that the economy will reach the level where it was in 2019 after suffering two brute Covid-19 waves. "However, these high growth rates are also a reflection of strong base effects since 2021-22:Q1 follows the very steep decline in 2020-21:Q1. At the end of 2021-22 GDP, on constant prices, would still be about the same as ₹146 trillion ( ₹146 lakh crore) as in 2019-20," the NCAER said in a statement.In 2020-21, India's economic growth slowed and contracted by 7.3%, the NCAER said.The second wave of Covid-19 in India was four times worse than the first wave in terms of infections and deaths seen in the country, the report said. The second wave disrupted the already battered growth process from the first wave, it added.The economic activity, according to the think-tank's report, declined sharply at the peak of the second Covid-19 wave in April and May this year as shown by the high-frequency indicators.Economically, in June, India will see activities pick up signalling recovery during the gradual unlocking process.The NCAER report has stressed on a strong positive push to restore the growth process after the Covid-19 waves India has seen.This, combined with a strong expansionary macroeconomic policy thrust, could help revive normal growth, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-economy-may-grow-8-4-10-1-in-2021-22-report-101624639983367.html

Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to chief secretaries asking them to implement immediate containment measures and ensure proper adherence of Covid-19 measures.Bhushan wrote to chief secretaries of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, warning them against allowing people to intermingle and crowd. “You are aware that INSACOG is a consortium of laboratories for whole genome sequencing in the context of Covid-19 pandemic. INSACOG is tasked with not just the whole genome sequencing but also giving timely inputs on appropriate public health responses in specific geographies where variants have been found,” the letter said.The health ministry informed the chief secretaries that based on data received from the INSACOG so far it found that the Delta Plus variants have three main characteristics - increased transmissibility, stronger binding to receptors of lung cells, potential reduction in monoclonal antibody response.Bhushan in his letter said that widespread testing, prompt tracing as well as vaccine coverage on a priority basis is necessary. He highlighted the immediate need of implementing containment measures in these districts and clusters.The following districts have been asked to strengthen their response after Delta Plus variant was found -The government said that it has detected 51 cases in 12 states from 45,000 samples tested. The NCDC director said that 22 cases of Delta Plus variant have been found in Maharashtra, followed by nine in Tamil Nadu, seven in Madhya Pradesh, three in Kerala, two each in Punjab and Gujarat, and one case each in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Karnataka.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-plus-variant-health-ministry-writes-to-8-states-alerts-10-districts-101624641034018.html

Taking that the effect of the vaccination is to reduce the severity of the infection by 60%, the study states that this model illustrates how vaccination could substantially reduce the burden during a possible third wave."Any third wave seems unlikely to be as severe as the second wave. Rapid scale-up of vaccination efforts could play an important role in mitigating these and future waves of the disease," the authors stated.Also Read: Maharashtra records 9,677 new Covid-19 cases while daily deaths drop to 156; fresh infections in Mumbai fall to 693The study also involved examination of four potential mechanisms for a potential third wave; for this, a compartmental model of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission was used. The four mechanisms were: waning immunity restores previously exposed individuals to a susceptible state; emergence of a new viral variant capable of escaping immunity to previously circulating strains; emergence of a new viral variant more transmissible than the previously circulating strains; and release of current lockdowns leading to fresh opportunities for transmission of the disease.India's second Covid-19 wave was at its peak during April-May. During this period, the country registered daily cases and related deaths higher than those in any other country since the pandemic struck early last year. Since then, however, the wave has subsided though daily infections continue to be near or more than 50,000 while fresh fatalities remain above the 1,000-mark(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-third-covid-19-wave-unlikely-to-be-as-severe-as-second-study-101624638509278.html

Experts flag major concernsThe variant is a sub-lineage of the Delta variant first found in India and also carries the spike protein mutation called K417N which is also found in the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.Scientists fear that the mutation combined with other existing features of the Delta variant could make it more transmissible.India has recorded more than 30 million infections since the pandemic began, with Maharashtra accounting for around a fifth of the total cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-30-of-india-s-delta-plus-cases-are-in-south-india-101624634601565.html
25-06-2021||India||At India-China meet, a push to hold early meeting of military commanders||New Delhi/Beijing: India and China agreed on Friday to hold the next meeting of senior military commanders as soon as possible to discuss complete disengagement at friction points on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) while working to maintain stability on the ground.This was the only tangible outcome from a virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, which resulted in what the external affairs ministry described as a “frank exchange of views” on the situation along the LAC in the western sector. The last meeting of the military commanders at the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point was held on April 9.Following a drawdown of troops and armoured units from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February, India and China haven’t made any headway on disengagement and de-escalation at other friction points such as Depsang, Gogra and Hot Springs. The two sides have also engaged in a war of words this week, blaming each other for the year-long standoff on the LAC. On Thursday, India blamed China’s actions of amassing troops in border areas and attempting to unilaterally change the status quo on the LAC for the standoff, and dismissed Beijing’s contention that New Delhi’s policies were to blame for the tensions.Following the WMCC meeting, a statement issued by the external affairs ministry said: “The two sides agreed to hold the next (12th) round of the senior commanders meeting at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement from all the friction points along the LAC in the Western Sector in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols.”The two sides also agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through diplomatic and military mechanisms to reach a “mutually acceptable solution for complete disengagement from all friction points so as to ensure full restoration of peace and tranquillity to enable progress in the bilateral relations”, the statement said.In the interim, the two sides will “continue to ensure stability on the ground and prevent any untoward incident”, the statement said. It added that both sides also agreed on finding an early resolution to remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh in line with the agreement reached between the two foreign ministers in September 2020.This was the eighth round of diplomatic talks under the WMCC mechanism since the standoff began in May last year.The Indian delegation was led by additional secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava, and the director general of the boundary and oceanic department of China’s foreign ministry, Hong Liang, led the Chinese delegation.A separate readout in Mandarin from China’s foreign ministry described the discussions as a “candid and in-depth” exchange of views and said the two sides agreed to “consolidate the results of the disengagement of border troops” and “properly resolve the remaining issues” in the western sector of the border.The Chinese readout also referred to the consensus reached by the foreign ministers, and said the two sides will continue to “promote further de-escalation of the situation at the border, avoid the recurrence of the situation on the ground, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity”.It added that specific time and arrangements for the next round of military talks will be determined through the “border hotline as soon as possible”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-india-china-meet-a-push-to-hold-early-meeting-of-military-commanders-101624635835968.html

25-06-2021||India||'Third Front': Any alternative alliance will include Congress, says Sharad Pawar||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar told reporters on Friday that even though alliances were not discussed at the meeting in his Delhi residence any alternative force of opposition will include Congress“Alliance was not discussed in the meeting (Rashtra Manch meeting) but if an alternative force is to be raised, it will be done only by taking Congress together. We need power like that and I had said this in that meeting,” ANI said quoting Pawar.A collection of opposition parties known as the ‘Rashtra Manch’ met at Pawar’s Delhi residence on June 22. The meeting which lasted over two hours was attended by Omar Abdullah from National Conference, Samajwadi Party's (SP) Ghanshyam Tiwari, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) president Jayant Chaudhary, Sushil Gupta from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Binoy Viswam from the Communist Party of India (CPI), Nilotpal Basu from CPI(M) and Sinha. Also present were Javed Akhtar, Retired Justice AP Shah, and ambassador KP Singh. Pawar’s statements on alliance comes after reports emerged of Congress’s absence from the June 22 meeting.The meeting attracted much attention and media coverage but NCP leaders dismissed the speculations surrounding the meetings as "over-hyped and highly speculative", reported PTI. "It was not an anti-BJP political front meeting called by Sharad Pawar. It was a meeting of Rashtriya Manch held at his residence. Like-minded individuals or people with the same ideology attended the meeting and there were several apolitical personalities present in the meeting," NCP leader Majid Menon told PTI.Pawar, whose party is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra along with Congress and Shiv Sena, also responded to Congress leader Nana Patole’s claims of fighting future elections in the state alone. Every political party has the right to expand itself. To increase the energy of our party workers we also make such statements. Similarly, if Congress says something like that (to fight next elections alone) we welcome it because it's their right (to expand their party),” he said in response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sharad-pawar-of-ncp-says-any-alliance-will-include-congress-101624632643960.html

Taking to his Twitter account, Tharoor wrote, “Raviji, the same thing just happened to me. Clearly DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) is getting hyperactive.”Tharoor also attached a video clip, stating that the same was deleted by Twitter because it includes the copyrighted BoneyM song ‘Rasputin’.The Congress MP said that Indians “creatively make videos” using short snippets of foreign music, and most people would deem that “fair use”.Raviji, the same thing just happened to me.

Though I just retweeted it, I’m not about to contest their act,” Tharoor added.He noted that the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), which is zealously defending Sony Music’s rights to ‘Rasputin’ was the complainant in the case. “Ironically, at their last conference in India, I was a keynote speaker,” Tharoor tweeted.Tharoor pointed out that however “stupid and pointless the request was,” unlike Ravi Prasad, he will not be blaming Twitter for denying him access to his account as the social media platform had “no choice but to honour a DMCA takedown notice.”However, the former Union minister said that as chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, he can state that they’ll be “seeking an explanation” from Twitter India for blocking access to him and Ravi Prasad, and the rules they follow in their operations in the country.So I won't blame @Twitter for this action or attribute the motives to them that @rsprasad does, though it wasn't pleasant finding my account locked. Clearly they had no choice but to honour a DMCA takedown notice, however stupid & pointless the request was.His remarks come after Ravi Prasad claimed that calling out Twitter’s “high-handedness and arbitrary actions,” have “clearly ruffled its feathers.” “Twitter’s actions indicate that they are not the harbinger of free speech that they claim to be but are only interested in running their own agenda, with the threat that if you do not toe the line they draw, they will arbitrarily remove you from their platform,” Ravi Prasad wrote on his Twitter, which was eventually unblocked.The social media giant and the Union ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) have been at loggerheads after the new IT (Intermediary Guidelines and Ethics Code) Rules were announced in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raviji-same-thing-happened-to-me-tharoor-says-twitter-blocked-his-account-too-101624627178826.html

However, further progress over the remaining parts of the country is unlikely during the next seven days,” IMD said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/storm-gusty-winds-break-delhi-s-humid-spell-imd-says-light-rain-thunderstorm-expected-101624626923320.html

According to news agency ANI, the bride said that she and her parents were “uninformed” about the groom’s condition. “When the baraat (groom's side) came to the house, we got to know that the groom could not walk without wearing his glasses,” the bride told ANI.She also demanded valuables, gifted to the groom's side, be returned, reported ANI.Last Sunday, a similar incident took place in the state's Jaunpur district. A newly-wed bride reportedly slapped the groom after reaching her in-laws’ house and later returned to her parents’ home. Reports suggest that the incident occurred in Lavayen village under Khutahan block of Jaunpur district.The drama unravelled when the groom’s family was preparing to welcome the bride following the completion of the wedding ceremony. The wedding was reportedly held with great enthusiasm, and the bride did not say anything till then.As per a preliminary probe, the groom was having an affair and that came to the bride’s attention, which is why she slapped him, Zee News reported. The matter escalated and the police were informed.Before that, police had to intervene after a fight broke out between the families of the bride and the groom in the Jaunpur district. This happened when the groom slapped the bride during the garland exchange ceremony after a man from the groom’s side attempted to climb on the stage and the bride’s side opposed it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bride-calls-off-wedding-says-groom-can-t-walk-without-glasses-101624626156005.html

Report in 7-10 days||In a first-ever study in the world, India will come up with its finding on how effective the vaccines are against Delta Plus, Dr Balram Bhargava, the director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research said on Thursday. Such data is available nowhere in the country, Dr Bhargava said, adding that the report will be available in 7 to 10 days.In a presentation that he made on Friday during the health ministry's press conference, Dr Bhargava said Delta Plus has recently been cultured and it is being examined whether the vaccines are effective against this variant. "India was also the first country to culture Delta variant. Now we are working on Delta Plus, as we have enough information on Alpha, Beta," Dr Bhargava said.48 Delta Plus cases in 11 states: More study needed, cases very localised, says health ministryAccording to international data, presented by Dr Bhargava, Bharat Biotech's Covaxin remains equally effective against the Alpha variant, though against Beta and Delta variant its neutralising capabilities reduce threefold. Covishield's capabilities reduce 2.5 to 9 fold against Alpha and two-fold against Delta. The data also show that Pfizer and Moderna's capabilities reduce significantly against the Delta variant."You may have a vaccine with very high antibody response. But its response may get reduced to a great extent against a variant. Then you may have another vaccine that does not have such a high level of antibody response but it does not get reduced much against the variant. So both will be almost of the same platform against a variant," Dr Bhargava said explaining why knowing the effectiveness of vaccines against specific variants is significant.Both Covaxin and Covishield are effective against all variants of Covid-19, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, Dr Bhargava said. "Delta Plus is a new variant. 12 countries in the world and 11 states in the country have reported this variant. It has been found in a very localised way - one patient here, two there. But we have isolated it and work is going on," the ICMR DG said.How effective Covaxin, Covishield, Pfizer, Moderna, Sputnik, Novavax and J&J are against variantsAlpha: Covaxin remains unaffected by the Alpha variant while Covishield's neutralising capability gets reduced 2.5 to 9 fold. The fold reduction figure is 0-4 for Pfizer 0-2 for Moderna, 0 for Sputnik, 2 for Novavax and less than 1 for J&JBeta: Covaxin's effect gets reduced three fold against this variant. the figure is 0-31 for Covishiedl, 1-4 for Pfizerm 1-28 for Moderna, 7 for Sputnik, 15 for Novavax and 5-10 for J&JGamma: This variant results three-fold reduction in Covishield's capabilities, 1-7 fold in Pfizer's and 3-5 in Moderna's vaccine.Delta: 3-fold reduction in neutralising antibody levels, 2 fold in Covishield, 7-10 fold in Pfizer and 7 in Moderna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-effective-are-covishield-and-covaxin-against-delta-plus-report-in-7-10-days-101624626339807.html

Till such time we have more data on the vaccination of children, we won't be in a position to vaccinate children at large," Bhargava said at a press conference, according to news agency ANI."However, we have started a small study on children between the age of 2 and 18, and we shall have the results of that by September or so.

25-06-2021||India||Uttarakhand high court pulls up government for allowing Char Dham Yatra||The Uttarakhand high court has pulled up the state government for allowing Char Dham Yatra from July 1 despite fears of a third Covid-19 wave. It directed a review of the decision. The court said the Yatra needs to be postponed or cancelled while citing the cancellation of Amarnath Yatra in Jammu & Kashmir.“Considering the fact that large gathering invariably leads to a spike in the COVID-19 pandemic, this Court is of the firm opinion that a catastrophe like COVID-19 pandemic should not be re-invited by holding and permitting large gathering at religious shrines, and by permitting the Char Dham Yatra by the State government. Therefore, this court directs the State government to review its decision to commence the Char Dham Yatra on July 1,” the court said.The court issued the directions while hearing a bunch of pleas related to the Covid-19 pandemic on Wednesday. The order was made available on Thursday.On June 20, the state government announced the start of the Char Dham Yatra in two phases. From July 1, it will be allowed for the residents of Uttarakhand’s Chamoli, Rudraprayag and Uttarkashi. The pilgrimage to four temples will be allowed from July 11 for people from the rest of the state. On April 29, the state government postponed the pilgrimage, which was scheduled to start on May 14.Also Read | Char Dham Yatra in two phases beginning July 1: UttarakhandThe court cited the Kumbh Mela held in April and said a large congregation of tens of thousands of people for the event was “clear cut proof of the failure of the civil administration” in ensuring precautionary measures “...the possibility of a large congregation descending on the temples and shrines of Char Dham cannot be ruled out…Once the devotees start gathering in large number, invariably the first victim is the SOP (standard operating procedure) itself; the second victims are the people at large.”The court cited media reports and said 59% of deaths due to Covid-19 in Uttarakhand were reported in May. “Thus, there is a clear co-relation between the holding of Kumbh Mela in April 2021 and the consequent deaths which occurred in Uttarakhand in May 2021. Furthermore, it is common knowledge that in April and in May 2021, the entire country was devastated by the second wave of COVID-19.”The court cited the government’s affidavit and added there are hardly any medical facilities available at the Char Dham shrines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-high-court-pulls-up-government-for-allowing-char-dham-yatra-101624625635429.html

25-06-2021||India||SC gives fresh chance to Mamata Banerjee, minister to respond to CBI charges||The Supreme Court on Friday allowed West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and minister Moloy Ghatak to respond by Monday to the grounds the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has cited in its plea before the Calcutta high court for the transfer of the Narada corruption case out of the state. The CBI has claimed that violent protests allegedly orchestrated by the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) over the arrest of four politicians in the case last month hampered its probe and intimidated lower courts. It has named Banerjee, Ghatak, and TMC lawmaker Kalyan Banerjee as respondents in the case.The high court on June 9 refused to accept the responses of the TMC leaders, citing the delay in filing them while hearing the CBI plea for the transfer of the case. The Supreme Court said the TMC leaders, in their application, shall give reasons in support of bringing the affidavits on record at this stage of hearing. It added that an advance copy should be sent to the CBI to enable it to come up with a response by Tuesday.A Vacation Bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari set aside the high court’s June 9 order. It requested the five-judge Constitution Bench of the high court to consider the applications of the two “de novo” (a second time over) before proceeding with the merits of the case. On June 18 and 22, the Supreme Court requested the high court to defer its proceedings in the case.Also Read | Leadership, asset split key concerns for air force on theaterisation move“We are of the opinion that the petitioners ought to have filed an application (before the high court) to take their respective counter affidavits on record, especially when submissions or arguments were going on and had progressed substantially….Lest any prejudice is caused to the parties, the order of June 9 is annulled and the High Court shall decide the application de novo,” the top court said.The CBI filed its transfer petition on May 24, but notices were issued on May 27 to Banerjee and Ghatak. The agency has accused Ghatak of leading a mob outside the trial court, which first granted bail to the four politicians including ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee in the Narada case, on May 17. The high court later stayed the bail.The four, who have since been released on bail, were arrested in May in connection with the 2014 sting operation (details of which went public in 2016). The arrests triggered protests by the TMC and a six-hour-long agitation at the CBI office by Banerjee.In its transfer petition, the agency claimed the protests and stone-pelting mob prevented CBI officers from physically producing the accused in court.The case pertains to a two-year-long sting operation whose videos were uploaded months ahead of the 2016 assembly elections. The sting, conducted by online news portal Narada News, purportedly caught TMC leaders accepting money in exchange for alleged favours to a fictitious company.The TMC has linked the arrests of the four to Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government’s alleged vendetta after Banerjee swept back to power in the state in May. The BJP has rejected the allegation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-gives-fresh-chance-to-mamata-banerjee-minister-to-respond-to-cbi-charges-101624622575214.html

He said that this vaccine has the potential to protect children and teenagers. He also congratulated the team for its efforts.Excited to witness the first batch of Covovax (developed by @Novavax) being manufactured this week at our facility in Pune. The vaccine has great potential to protect our future generations below the age of 18. Trials are ongoing. Well done team @seruminstindia! pic.twitter.com/K4YzY6o73A“Excited to witness the first batch of Covavax (developed by @Novavax) being manufactured this week at our facility in Pune. The vaccine has great potential to protect our future generations below the age of 18. Trials are ongoing. Well done team @seruminstindia!,” Poonawalla said in a tweet.The SII had earlier said that it will introduce the Covavax in the country by September. The vaccine is the version of US firm Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate. The SII will also begin clinical trials of Novavax for children starting next month.The Novavax vaccine showed strong efficacy against the emerging variants of Covid-19, its makers Novavax Inc said citing data from a large trial on June 14. Novavax is the fourth vaccine the United States has added to its arsenal in its fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. The data also showed that Novavax has shown a 93% effectiveness against variants of concern. These results were based on a second analysis which mostly consisted of cases of the Alpha variant of Covid-19, which is predominant in the United States.The vaccine efficacy rate of the vaccine developed by Novavax is similar to that of the vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc. with BioNTech SE and by Moderna Inc., as well as the Sputnik V vaccine from Russia. All of these vaccines are messenger RNA shots and use viral vector technology.India’s health ministry earlier said that the data shared by Novavax regarding its vaccine is ‘encouraging’. NITI Aayog member (Health) VK Paul on June 17 said that the SII making the vaccine in India makes Novavax relevant to India’s vaccination plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-manufactures-first-batch-of-covavax-vaccine-poonawalla-congratulates-team-101624622221819.html

Among cities, Indore and Surat were adjudged joint winners. Among Union Territories, Chandigarh was ranked first.The awards were announced on Friday to commemorate 6 years of the three urban transformative missions of the Central government -- Smart Cities Mission (SCM), Atal Mission for Urban Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U), which were launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 25, 2015.These awards were given across the themes of social aspects, governance, culture, urban environment, sanitation, economy, built environment, water, urban mobility. Some new themes were also added this year for Sustainable Business model of Integrated Command and Control Centres, and Innovation award specially in Covid management.“Since 2018, we have felicitated the top-performing cities through the India Smart Cities Award Contest. This year’s best proposals range from the use of Integrated Command and Control Centres in governance or in response to Covid-19, enhancing safety and security of citizens, intelligent traffic management, innovative use of open spaces, enhancement of urban environment, innovations in the improvement of urban mobility, smart water management, waste-to-energy generation and many others,” Union housing affairs minister Hardeep Puri said.There are a total of five award categories in ISAC 2020. Winners for three of these five categories were decided through a two-stage submission process. Stage-I involved an overall assessment of the city’s performance. Stage-I submissions were evaluated by a Technical Support Team and 71 Smart Cities qualified for Stage-II.“Indore has been a forerunner among the Smart Cities in the past year...It is implementing projects worth ₹5,099.6 crore under the Smart Cities Mission of which ₹4,711.6 crore is dedicated to the projects within the ABD [area based development]. Improvement of city identity through revival of old heritage structures, development of public and commercial places, and waste management within the ABD area is an approach well received by the people of Indore. The Smart City has made visible gains in a timebound manner – exhibiting strong local support for the smart city projects undertaken,” the ministry said.At present, 69 Smart cities have developed and operationalised their ICCCs in the country. These function as war-rooms for Covid management, and along with other smart infrastructure developed under the mission, have helped cities in fighting the pandemic through information dissemination, improving communication, predictive analysis and supporting effective management. These are being developed across all 100 Smart Cities of the country, the ministry said.HT on April 7, 2020 reported the government’s plans of using ICCCs designed for National Smart Cities Mission, an urban renewal and retrofitting programme, for real-time surveillance and monitoring of Covid-19-affected districts across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-top-performer-under-smart-cities-mission-followed-by-mp-and-tamil-nadu-101624621495040.html
25-06-2021||India||48 Delta Plus cases in 11 states: More study needed, cases very localised, says health ministry||The Union health ministry on Friday said 48 cases of Delta Plus variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been found in the country, spread across 11 states including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Rajasthan, Jammu and Karnataka. "Wherever you find a cluster, you have to contain it," Dr Balram Bhargava, director-general, Indian Council of Medical Research said adding that the second wave of the pandemic is not yet over. Giving a detailed presentation of the genome sequencing work, Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh of the National Centre for Disease Control said, "Forming a scientific opinion on a variant takes time. Genome sequencing takes 10-12 days. Then some more samples are sometimes sought from the state to find out whether the particular variant is linked to the spike in the cases." Dr Singh said the plus in the name of Delta Plus does not denote more virulence. "The plus is an addition of an existing variant. It does not mean that it is stronger than Delta. At least the name does not. If scientific evidence suggests so in future, we will inform the public about it."Delta Plus: List of states where this new Covid variant has been reported so farHow Delta variant spread in India since December 2020In his presentation, Dr Singh said the Delta variant, first reported in India, had a minimum presence in the country in December. In March 2021, the variant spread to 52 districts and in June there are 174 districts reporting the variant. But the trend is declining, Dr Singh said. At present, the Delta variant can be found in 174 districts in 35 states, the highest being reported from Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Telangana, West Bengal and Gujarat. The distribution was not uniform. In some places, Delta variant cases were minimum at the beginning and then gradually Delta took over Alpha, Dr Singh said, adding that Delta is stronger than Alpha. Why more study required to understand the nature of the Delta Plus variantThe number of Delta Plus variant cases in the country as well as in the world is not enough for extensive study. For example, Dr Singh said, Delta Plus cases have been there in India sporadically for three months. "It can't be said that this is a growing trend. This variant has the same mutations as Delta. Only one mutation K417N is different for which Delta variant is believed to be immune-escape and monoclonal antibody-resistant, but more studies are required," Dr Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/48-delta-plus-cases-in-11-states-more-study-needed-cases-very-localised-says-health-ministry-101624620167457.html

25-06-2021||India||Kerala women panel chief resigns after row over ‘Then you suffer’ remark||Kerala women panel chairperson MC Josephine, who recently landed in controversy for her “then you suffer” remark on a domestic violence victim during a live television show, tendered her resignation on Friday.“MC Josephine has tendered resignation for her callous remarks to a domestic violence victim. Merit and empathy should be the criteria for the appointment of new chairperson,” Kerala BJP chief K Surendran tweeted.Josephine drew flak from all quarters, including supporters of the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Kerala, of which she is a central committee member.The incident unfolded when a woman called in the show, a special programme held by a Malayalam channel to lay attention on women experiencing harassment and abuse at home. The woman spoke about her husband and mother-in-law beating her up, and informed that she has not yet registered a complaint with the police or even told a single person about her ordeal at home. Josephine said, “Then you suffer, OK,” and snapped the line.While the state women panel chief attempted to justify her response, she later issued an apology after she and her party came under fire. “I was talking to her with motherly affection. If my words have pained anyone, I regret,” Josephine said, adding that she was angry about women suffering silently.Earlier today, she told news agency ANI that she didn’t make the remark. “There are women who aren’t listening to us. We suggest women file complaints, making the case stronger as we can’t reach everywhere,” Josephine added.However, soon after Josephine stated that she realised she shouldn’t have reacted to the woman’s plight in “such manner,” ANI reported.Both Kerala Congress and state BJP unit demanded action against her. While the women’s wing of state Congress burnt Josephine’s effigy to make their point, K Surendran called for registering a First Information Report (FIR) against her.The incident comes in the wake of three dowry-related deaths reported in one week in Kerala. In one case that happened on June 21, a 23-year-old woman, who married a government official last year, died by suicide. Initial police investigation suggest that her husband allegedly beat her up for months over scorn with the dowry she had brought.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-women-panel-chief-resigns-after-row-over-then-you-suffer-remark-101624618971072.html

The bullet train connects the provincial capital Lhasa and Nyingchi, which is a strategically located Tibetan border town close to Arunachal Pradesh.The Lhasa-Nyingchi section is a part of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway and the 435.5km-long corridor has been integrated ahead of the centenary celebrations of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) on July 1.Also read | China’s amassing of troops, bids to change status quo to blame for LAC standoff: IndiaNyingchi is the prefecture-level city of Medog, which is adjacent to the Arunachal Pradesh border. China claims that Arunachal Pradesh is part of South Tibet. The claims have been firmly rejected by India. The India-China border row stretches over China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet, which is firmly rejected by India. The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC).This is the first electrified railway to be made operational in the Tibet Autonomous Region. The Sichuan-Tibet Railway will be the second railway into Tibet following the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, which will travel through the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, reported to be one of the world's most active geolocation.Chinese President Xi Jinping had directed officials in November last year to expedite the construction of the new railway project, connecting Sichuan Province and Nyingchi in Tibet, as he said that the new rail line would be a key player in safeguarding border interest and stability."If a scenario of a crisis happens at the China-India border, the railway will provide a great convenience for China's delivery of strategic materials," Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University told the official daily Global Times, reported PTI.Through the train, which has a speed of 160km per hour, the travel time between Lhasa and Nyingchi has reduced from five hours to approximately 3.5 hours and the travel time between Shannan, which is one of the stations where the train will stop and Nyingchi from six hours to approximately two hours, as per a report by Xinhua news agency.The Sichuan-Tibet Railway starts from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, goes through Ya'an and enters Tibet via Qamdo.

25-06-2021||India||No alternative to two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians: India||India has emphasised that there is no alternative to the two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, and said the peace process can’t be put on the back burner amid concerns about tensions increasing again in Gaza. New Delhi’s position was outlined in a statement by Vikas Swarup, secretary (West) in the external affairs ministry, at a UN Security Council meeting on the Palestine issue on Thursday. India urged all parties to honour the May 20 ceasefire arrangement to ensure the situation doesn’t “spiral out of control”. The ceasefire, declared after 11 days of rocket and air attacks across the border area between Gaza and southern Israel, has come under strain following a march by right-wing Israeli activists through Jerusalem’s Old City and rallies in Gaza Strip by Islamic forces that led to incendiary balloon attacks at Israel. “The peace process can no longer be kept on the back burner. The continuation of the impasse only exacerbates the trust deficit between the parties and increases the chances of cycle of violence to recur,” Swarup said. “There is no alternative to a two-state solution for ensuring meaningful and enduring peace,” he said, adding that India wants all parties to “de-escalate the situation [and] refrain from acts of provocation, intimidation and incitement that exacerbates tensions”. The UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Tor Wennesland, told the Security Council meeting that the world body is working closely with all parties and partners to solidify the ceasefire, allow the entry of humanitarian aid and stabilise the situation in Gaza.  Also Read | India seeks concerted action to tackle terror, radicalisation across AsiaThe hostilities in May left more than 240 people dead, including more than 230 Palestinians and 12 people killed in Israel in rocket attacks by Hamas and other extremist groups. Wennesland urged all sides to “refrain from unilateral steps and provocations” and to reduce tensions. Swarup expressed concern at the fresh tensions. “After a period of brief calm, tensions are rising again in Gaza. The launch of incendiary balloons from Gaza targeting civilians in Israel and the retaliatory strikes into Gaza threaten to restart the cycle of violence, which caused immense suffering and resulted in deaths recently,” he said. Describing the situation in West Bank as volatile, Swarup said that India is “concerned at the potential for renewed violence in East Jerusalem and other parts of West Bank over the legal process that could lead to possible evictions in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem”. He added, “Any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo that undercut efforts to advance a negotiated two-state solution should also be avoided.” Incitement and inflammatory rhetoric, as witnessed during the recent escalation, would only drive and fuel violence, he noted. The world community’s attention shouldn’t be diverted from the immediate needs of humanitarian aid for the Palestinian civilian population, particularly in Gaza, and there should be reinforced cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian authorities for humanitarian aid delivery, including food and medicines and movement of patients in and out of Gaza, the Indian statement said. The rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza should be prioritised, and India recognises the centrality of the Palestinian Authority for delivering international aid to the local people, Swarup said. “We take note of the postponement of the reconciliation meeting of all Palestinian parties that had been facilitated by Egypt and hope that the parties overcome the current stalemate. We believe that intra-Palestinian unity is critical for achieving a peaceful settlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict,” he said. Referring to the stalled Middle East peace process, the Indian side emphasised the need to immediately resume the process and direct negotiations between Israel and Palestine. “India supports all diplomatic efforts, including by the Quartet, which are aimed at strengthening the collective commitment of the international community to resume these negotiations and facilitate the peace process,” Swarup said, while reaffirming India’s “unwavering commitment” to establishing an independent, viable, democratic state of Palestine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-alternative-to-two-state-solution-between-israelis-and-palestinians-india-101624619094827.html
25-06-2021||India||Twitter denied me access to my account: Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad||Union electronics and information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday said Twitter denied him access to his account for almost an hour citing alleged copyright infringement. He linked the action to his statements calling out Twitter’s “high-handedness and arbitrary actions”.Prasad called the denial a gross violation of Rule 4(8) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021. He said Twitter did not provide him any prior notice before denying him access.“Something highly peculiar happened today. Twitter denied access to my account for almost an hour on the alleged ground that there was a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of the USA and subsequently they allowed me to access the account,” Prasad wrote on Koo, India’s alternative to Twitter. “It is apparent that my statements calling out the high handedness and arbitrary actions of Twitter, particularly sharing the clips of my interviews to TV channels and its powerful impact, have clearly ruffled its feathers.”HT reached out to Twitter for comments but did not receive a response immediately.Also Read | Twitter executive gets HC relief from arrest in Ghaziabad caseTwitter has been at loggerheads with the government over the new controversial social media and intermediary guidelines. The government has pulled up the company for failing to comply with the guidelines. It has said the non-compliance could result in Twitter’s loss of safe harbour protection under the Information Technology Act. Twitter has raised concerns about the safety of its employees in India and flagged police intimidation.The firm and the government have also faced off over orders to block access to content and marking of posts by Bhartiya Janata Party leaders as manipulated media.Prasad said it is apparent why Twitter is refusing to comply with the guidelines. He added it is because if Twitter does comply, it would be unable to arbitrarily deny access to an individual’s account which does not suit its agenda. “Furthermore, in the past several years, no television channel or any anchor has made any complaints about copyright infringements with regard to these news clips of my interviews shared on social media.”Prasad slammed Twitter saying that its actions showed that it was not the “harbinger of free speech that they claim to be but are only interested in running their own agenda, with the threat that if you do not tow the line they draw, they will arbitrarily remove you from their platform”. He said no matter what any platform does, it will have to abide by the new rules fully and there shall be no compromise on that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-denied-me-access-to-my-account-union-minister-ravi-shankar-prasad-101624618914999.html
25-06-2021||India||Galwan Valley deployment showed India’s intent to seek peace: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said that the Indian Navy’s proactive forward deployment during the Galway Valley standoff with China last year signalled India’s intent of seeking peace as well as its readiness for any eventuality.Speaking at the Southern Naval Command after reviewing the construction work of the Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC) in Kochi, Rajnath Singh said that the project was originally given a nod by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government and has made significant progress despite Covid-19.“Yesterday, I also reviewed Project Seabird at Karwar, which will be the largest naval base of the Indian Navy in future, and will provide the facilities and infrastructure to support the navy's operations in the Indian Ocean region and beyond,” news agency ANI quoted Singh as saying.The defence minister said that their urge towards modernisation, utilising India’s indigenous know-how and industry, is a primary priority and that 42 of the 44 warships being constructed at Indian shipyards are testimony to this.Singh also praised the navy for its efforts in times of crisis such as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and Cyclone Tauktae, which affected Gujarat and Maharashtra last month. “The navy has also made significant contributions in the fight against Covid, bringing back citizens from overseas during Op Samudra Setu-I, and much needed liquid medical oxygen during Samudra Setu-lI, despite dangers of Covid spread onboard warships. SAR efforts by the navy during Cyclone Tauktae showcased the spirit of daring and courage among our men and women in whites,” he added according to ANI.Earlier in the day, Singh said that India will commission the first IAC next year. Terming the moment as the country’s pride and a shining example of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, the minister noted that it will also be a “befitting tribute to 75 years of India’s Independence.”During the event, Singh also talked about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Security and Growth for All in the Region or SAGAR and said that our efforts are in alignment with his vision of the initiative and that the wider goal of a Free, Open and Inclusive Indo-Pacific is to ensure peace and stability in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/galwan-valley-deployment-showed-india-s-intent-to-seek-peace-rajnath-singh-101624617442276.html

25-06-2021||India||Maharashtra brings back some Covid curbs after Delta Plus cases found in state||The Maharashtra government on Friday decided to bring back some Covid-19 restrictions in the state after Delta Plus variant cases have been reported in the state. Instead of a five-level unlock, which the government announced earlier, there will be three-level restrictions now. The decision has been taken considering cases of Delta plus variant cases found in the state, the government said. In the first week of June, the Maharashtra government announced a 5-level unlocking plan, ending the month-long lockdown-like period. The number of daily cases started to climb down, but the government decided to unlock in levels allowing districts with better Covid-19 situation to reopen the maximum, while district with higher positivity rate retained restrictions. But now there will be no district complete relaxations, the government has said."Given that the virus causing Covid-19 is undergoing mutations in various geographic and that their mutations are displaying more transmissibility and potential reductions in monoclonal antibody response, a state-level trigger mandating all the administrative units, irrespective of values of the indices of weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy percentage to remain at a level, not below 3 is to be in operation till withdrawn by specific order of SDMA," the order said.Levels of restrictions for safe Maharashtra pic.twitter.com/FOAKTSrI9AThe Delta variant of the Covid-19 has emerged as a variant of concern and another mutation of Delta, Delta Plus, has been found in India. The first case of Delta Plus was detected in a sample collected in Maharashtra in April, the government has said. This indicates that though the variant has been reported recently, cases were already there in India in April during the peak of the second wave. Ratnagiri and Jalgaon are the two areas where the Delta Plus samples were found, the Centre said and asked the government to focus on containment.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope recently said though the Covid-19 situation of the state was improving, the number of daily cases is not coming below 8,000, which is concerning. The Covid-19 task force of the Maharashtra government has also warned that Delta Plus variant might be the reason for the third wave of the pandemic in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-brings-back-some-covid-curbs-after-delta-plus-cases-found-in-state-101624615595007.html

Government's response is Elections first and Statehood later," Chidambaram tweeted."The horse pulls the cart. A state must conduct elections. Only such elections will be free and fair. Why does the government want the cart in front and the horse behind? It is bizarre," he added in a subsequent tweet.At the all-party meet which took place at the Prime Minister’s official residence in the national capital J&K political outfits unanimously demanded that J&K’s statehood be restored. The Prime Minister is said to have emphasised on the need to carry out free and fair elections for strengthening “grassroots democracy”.“Our priority is to strengthen grassroots democracy in J&K. Delimitation has to happen at a quick pace so that polls can happen and J&K gets an elected government that gives strength to J&K’s development trajectory,” PM Modi tweeted after the meeting ended.Union home minister Amit Shah assured the leaders present that statehood would be restored once the delimitation exercise is completed and fresh elections are held.“The future of Jammu & Kashmir was discussed and the delimitation exercise and peaceful elections are important milestones in restoring statehood as promised in Parliament,” Shah said.This is the first such meeting between the Centre and local representatives of J&K since the bifurcation exercise of 2019. Along with the Prime Minister and the home minister, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha were also in attendance.Congress leader Gulam Nabi Azad who was also present in the meeting said the party has put forth five demands, “the first is that the dissolution of the state into union territories was carried out without the consent of the elected representatives so statehood should be restored. We have also asked for conducting elections to the Vidhan Sabha, rehabilitation of Kashmiri pandits and protection of domicile rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-bizarre-chidambaram-hits-out-at-centre-for-insisting-on-polls-in-j-k-before-restoring-statehood-101624613812660.html

US Embassy official Don Heflin answers||With the new academic session starting in US schools and colleges in August, it is time for the last-minute scramble for Indian students as the situation has become more challenging owing to issues regarding travel restriction, Covid-19 vaccinations etc. In an exclusive interview to Hindustan Times' Aditi Prasad, minister-counsellor for consular affairs in US Embassy New Delhi, Don Heflin, gave a clear picture of when the United States can lift travel restrictions for India, whether Indian students will need a second vaccination after reaching the United States etc.On travel restrictionsAt present, no one can travel from India to the United States if they have been in India in the last 14 days. There are exceptions for American citizens, students and those who can prove their travel to the US as of national interest. "It is hard to predict when the travel restrictions will be lifted. But one signal for India will be to look for the lifting of the restriction from Europe's Schengen area, which was placed under travel curbs before India. Once those countries come out of restrictions, India can expect to see the lifting of the US travel ban," Don Heflin said. The Schengen area comprises 26 European countries including France, Germany, Italy, Denmark etc.Watch: HT's Aditi Prasad speaks to Don Heflin on India-US travel, visa restrictionsNot getting visa appointments?Don Heflin said that the embassy is working towards increasing the number of visa appointments and more will be opened in July. But how will the July visa appointment help if the classes start in August? "There is no need to panic. Schools will let you come late. Try to reach by August 25. If that is not possible for any reason, then contact the department concerned," Heflin said. The second wave of the pandemic in India delayed the appointment process in India, but the embassy has already opened 45,000 visa appointments and is aiming to achieve the pre-covid number of visa appointments.Also Read: US travel ban strategy doesn’t make sense, ex-FDA chief saysWill you get vaccinated again if you have got Covaxin in India?As Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is yet to receive a nod from the World Health Organization, this question has been raised. The minister-councillor said the United States, as yet, has no vaccine requirement. It only requires an RT-PCR test report but schools, universities are following their own guidelines regarding vaccination. "When you come for a visa interview, we won't ask you whether you are vaccinated. Airlines won't ask you whether you are vaccinated. immigrant officials won't probably ask you about this either," Heflin said adding that vaccines are widely available in the US. But the single-point guideline will be to check with the college and also the CDC website, Heflin said.Here are some additional specific questions regarding US travel and visa requirementsCan a green card-holding Legal Permanent Resident maintain their status and travel to the United States if they have been in India for more than one year due to Covid restrictions? What steps should they take?A permanent resident (called lawful permanent resident or LPR) must return to the United States within one year of departure to maintain permanent resident status. There is currently no change to the requirement that LPR(s) maintain their status. We encourage you to review the information on our website for additional detail and application instructions for a re-entry permit or returning resident visa.Can individuals in the United States with valid F-1 visas and approval for Optional Practical Training status travel to India, then return to the United States in a timely manner? What should they do to prepare for their travel?Given the current demand for visa appointments and COVID-19 related restrictions, we cannot guarantee a student’s timely return to the United States following short-term travel to India. Students with valid F-1 or M-1 visas, including those with active OPT approval, who are resuming their programs in the United States on or after August 1, 2021, do not require a National Interest Exception (NIE) before travelling to the United States from India within 30 days of their programme resumption date.How have the US Embassy and consulates in India been impacted by Covid-19? If you are only processing visas for emergency cases, how do you prevent this from negatively affecting Indians aspiring to work in the United States?The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns in India have caused delays in visa processing. The embassy and consulates resumed processing visas, focusing first on returning workers and now students, as soon as conditions allowed. Please note that H-1B workers in India who hold valid visas may be eligible for a National Interest Exception (NIE) from Presidential Proclamation 10199. To date, we have processed thousands of NIEs for qualified returning workers.Are H-4 minors with lapsed visas eligible for interview waiver processing if their H-1B parent is currently in the United States and their H-4 parent holds a valid visa?Yes. We resumed limited interview waiver processing for certain categories of visas, including H-4s. There are some H-4 visa holders who plan to attend school in the United States on F-1 visas.Is there a provision for these individuals to change their status and prepare for study without travelling to India for the visa interview?We encourage you to contact US Citizenship and Immigration Services for information regarding the planned change of status within the United States.Are F-2 derivative relatives of F-1 students currently in the United States permitted to travel to join them? What timing and National Interest Exemption waivers should they bear in mind?F-2 visa holders must be approved for a National Interest Exception prior to travel to the United States; the blanket waiver for F1 students does not apply to F2 derivatives. Please refer to our website for information on the National Interest Exemption process: https://in.usembassy.gov/visas/national-interest-exception-frequently-asked-questions/How does the visa and travel process differ for F-1 PhD students or others with independent or flexible programs without a set start date? Are there limitations in travel dates? Is a National Interest Exemption required?Students who are starting new programs should refer to their I-20 for their official “program start date”. Students with valid F-1 visas and active SEVIS status can enter the United States up to 30 days prior to a program resumption date that is August 1 or later. You should work with your school to confirm your specific resumption date.Do fully vaccinated students need to quarantine in the United States?Please consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for the latest information on quarantine requirements upon US entry. According to current guidance, fully vaccinated individuals do not need to self-isolate upon entry.Hindustan Times received many queries regarding the US travel and visa restrictions from its readers/viewers including from Smriti Sharma, Avi Seth, Asha Khatri, Shiven Panya, Shweta Chhajed, Rashmi Bogapur, Dr R Jeevakumar, Haseena Begum, Maneshker Mathivanam, Ved Garg, Shashwat Kumar, Sandeep, Geetha Sundar, Ashwin Kumar, Sravanthi Kuthuru, Pradeep Kumar, Ankit Hatalkar, Rishi Kesh among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-will-us-lift-travel-restrictions-for-indians-us-embassy-official-don-heffline-answers-101624607728793.html
25-06-2021||India||Delhi govt, BJP spar over SC-appointed panel’s report on oxygen utilisation||A political battle has broken out between Delhi’s Aam Aadmi Party government and the Bharatiya Janata Party over an interim report submitted by a Supreme Court-appointed panel to conduct oxygen utilisation audit in Delhi that has indicted the Delhi government over “gross discrepancy” in recording the requirement of medical oxygen by its hospitals, besides inflating the demand by more than five times of its actual consumption between April 29 and May 10. Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said: “The Supreme Court set up an oxygen audit committee. We spoke to members of the committee. They said that they have not approved or signed any report till now. Then what report is it? Where has it come from? I challenge the BJP to get a report which has been signed and approved by the oxygen audit committee.”The panel is headed by AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria. Its other members are Subodh Yadav, a joint secretary in the Jal Shakti ministry, Dr Sandeep Budhiraja from Max Healthcare, Bhupinder S Bhalla, principal secretary, home, Delhi government, and Sanjay Kumar Singh, the controller of explosives at the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO). Dr Guleria couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.Also Read | Mamata case judge reminisces of days as lawyer, reserves orderThe BJP was quick to respond to the findings. “It is unbelievable to see that Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi government politicised oxygen supply when Covid was at its peak. This is such petty politics. The data presented by Oxygen Audit Committee in the report is shocking,” party’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra said in a press conference.“The demand for four times more oxygen was made by the Delhi government, due to which the oxygen tankers remained on the road. Had this oxygen been used in other states, many lives could have been saved. This is a heinous crime committed by Arvind Kejriwal Ji,” he added.HT has reviewed a copy of the audit sub-group’s report. The controversial report marks the latest chapter in a long-running spat between the Union government and the Delhi government fought across the Delhi high court and the Supreme Court. The Delhi government’s position, in the arguments in court, held against the backdrop of the raging second wave of the coronavirus disease pandemic in the Capital, was that the Union government was not allocating it enough oxygen. The Centre’s position was that Delhi’s needs were overstated and that the local government wasn’t able to even lift supplies of oxygen that had been allocated to it. With social media filled with pleas of people scrambling for oxygen, the courts had to step in. While the issue was resolved with Delhi finally receiving adequate oxygen, the apex court also constituted an expert panel to look into the usage of the precious medical commodity. The interim findings of the audit sub-group of that panel, now leaked, have become the subject of controversy. Even in a response in the report itself, the Delhi government describes the panel’s proceedings as “a perfunctory desktop exercise, conducted hurriedly” which resulted in “erroneous entries and even more erroneous conclusions”. Terming the allegation of excess supply “incorrect,” it told the panel that it was “sad and shocking” that the panel arrived as “sweeping conclusions” without lending it an opportunity to explain. The sub-group was constituted by the Supreme Court-appointed 12-member national task force. The task force was set up by the apex court on May 8 when the bench, led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, called for an immediate oxygen utilisation audit in Delhi. At the same time, the bench also directed that Delhi should get 700 metric tonne (MT) of the life-saving medical input every day despite the Union government’s reluctance to give it that much. Also Read | Borrowers’ nod needed to alter interest rates, says commissionThe interim report cited a study conducted by PESO and responses received from 183 hospitals in the national capital regarding their oxygen requirement to observe that while the city government’s statistics claimed actual consumption of oxygen by its hospitals as 1,140 MT, the actual consumption turned out to be just 209 MT after correcting faulty reporting by four city hospitals. If the Centre-recommended formula for oxygen allotment was employed, the requirement would have been 289 MT and with the Delhi government’s formula, it would have been 391 MT, stated the report. It noted that four hospitals, Singhal Hospital, Aruna Asaf Ali Government Hospital, ESIC Model Hospital and Liferays Hospital erroneously claimed extremely high oxygen consumption with very few beds, “leading to extremely skewed information and significantly higher oxygen requirement for entire state of Delhi.” HT has reached out to the hospitals and will update the story once they respond. The sub-group has added that the oxygen consumption did not go beyond 350 MT on any day between April 29 and May 10. This meant that when Delhi government gave data of 1,140 MT as actual consumption by 183 hospitals, none had reported excess supply. The panel, which met seven times between May 11 and May 21, recorded in one of its meetings a finding by PESO “that there is a gross discrepancy of about four times in that the actual oxygen consumption claimed of 1140 MT was about four times higher than the calculated consumption by formula for bed- capacity, which is 289 MT.” On May 13, the sub-group also noted that the actual requirement of oxygen was 332 MT as per bed-occupancy formula of the Centre before it made an interim recommendation to the Supreme Court that 400 MT of daily oxygen with an additional 100 MT per day in exigency reserve should be adequate for the national capital for the time being since the Covid-19 cases have dropped significantly. The panel further cited a PESO report that contended that actual requirement of Delhi during the peak of second Covid-19 wave was much less than what was demanded, making other states such as Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir “suffer badly”. The report, prepared after carrying out a study between May 5 and 11, also contended that AAP government was neither auditing its usage of oxygen nor was assessing its realistic demand. However, the interim report attached documentary replies of the Delhi government to the findings of the sub-group as well as to the PESO report, refuting that the city government ever demanded oxygen in excess of its requirement. Disagreeing with the formula used by the sub-group to compute oxygen requirement, the Delhi government, in its communication to the panel, said: “The finding that Delhi received excess oxygen is incorrect. Delhi has never received excess oxygen. Only on May 5, it received 730 MT which was more than its requirement. Moreover, the oxygen requirement is dynamic and as soon as Delhi’s requirement decreased, a proactive communication was sent to the Central government restating its current requirement.” In another letter, it added: “From a perusal of the minutes and the proceedings, it appears to have been a perfunctory desktop exercise, conducted hurriedly, without even conducting an audit of a single institution in true sense... sadly, it is noted that none of the experts actually visited a single institution or interacted with their heads to get first-hand account of the grim realities which were created by supply shortages.” Also Read | Now, SC judge recuses from hearing pleas in Narada caseThe Delhi government also disputed the sub-group’s pro forma on requirement of oxygen as per bed occupancy, saying the sub-group has proceeded on an assumption that only 50% of non-ICU beds used oxygen which was not correct in the context of a respiratory disease like Covid-19. “The (audit) committee needs to begin with the GNCTD calculation of 568 MT, which is the scientifically modelled and data-driven estimate (arrived at by the Delhi government) and then points out where it feels that our requirements could be higher or lower. This fact cannot be determined through an armchair paper exercise but through an actual survey on the ground.”It also disputed a minute of the meeting on May 13 when Guleria expressed “anguish” over the fact that the oxygen tankers in Delhi were not able to upload oxygen and were lying idle since oxygen tanks in various hospitals were completely filled. The Delhi government called Guleria’s observations “strange”, pointing out that several SOS calls had been received for tanker supplies for his own institutions, AIIMS, Delhi. “It is only when the system has stabilised that this strange narrative is finding place in the committee of experts,” it complained. The Supreme Court is yet to hear this matter after May 6 and the court website, as on Friday, also did not indicate any next date of listing. Sisodia said: “Such misleading statements and conspiracies are not okay in matters that are subjudice. We are all aware of the oxygen crisis in Delhi and the central government’s failure in oxygen management across the country. Instead of taking the responsibility, the BJP is citing reports that do not exist. The BJP created this report in its headquarters and called it the report of the oxygen audit committee.”“It is an insult to people who lost their loved ones because of BJP’s oxygen mismanagement. Were the patients, doctors, and hospitals lying? So many parties went to the court – were they all lying? BJP leaders are lying,” said Sisodia.Abhishek Dey and Malavika PM in Delhi contributed to this story.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-bjp-spar-over-sc-appointed-panel-s-report-on-oxygen-utilisation-101624609554675.html

Let us pledge to do everything possible to strengthen India’s democratic spirit, and live up to the values enshrined in our Constitution,” tweeted Modi on the 46th anniversary of the declaration of the state of Emergency. “This is how Congress trampled over our democratic ethos. We remember all those greats who resisted the Emergency and protected Indian democracyWe remember all those greats who resisted the Emergency and protected Indian democracy,”the PM wrote in another tweet.The Emergency was imposed by then prime minister Indira Gandhi for a 21-month period from 1975 to 1977, when curbs were imposed on the fundamental rights of people.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said during the Emergency, the Congress even banned movies about freedom fighters Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad, quotes of Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore, songs of Kishor Kumar, and India’s right to dissent. Also Read | What J&K leaders said after meeting PM ModiUnion home minister Amit Shah called the emergency a period of “brutal tortures” and “ruthless rule of 21 months” to “quell the voices against one family.”“Emergency imposed to quell the voices against one family is a dark chapter in the history of independent India. Salute to the sacrifice of all the countrymen who fought relentlessly for the protection of the Constitution and democracy of the country while suffering the brutal tortures of the ruthless rule for 21 months,” he said. Defence minister Rajnath Singh termed the 1975 emergency as a “dark chapter” in the history of Indian democracy and saluted all those who have played a role in the safeguarding of democracy.“Emergency is known as a ‘dark chapter’ in the history of Indian democracy. The manner in which the Constitution was misused to attack the democratic traditions of the country can never be forgotten. Even today that era is fresh in the memories of all of us,” said the Defence Minister in a tweet.Responding to the criticism, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor attacked the BJP-ruled central government and wrote on Twitter, “We are suffering a nationwide shortage of doctors to battle #Covid19, but continue to spurn fully qualified Foreign Medical graduates. Why can’t we recognize foreign medical degrees at least during this period of national emergency?”Congress spokesperson Gaurav Vallabh said that it was pointless of BJP to preach about democracy as India is going through a “Modigency” since the last 7 years which have witnessed “trampling down of all the democratic institutions”. “All the institutions have been eroded, parliament has lost its credibility and even the pleas for protecting the democratic rights are seen by this government as anti national acts,” Vallabh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-46th-anniversary-of-emergency-in-1970s-pm-modi-hits-out-at-congress-101624607514311.html

Now the court has asked Barbhuiya to be present for a hearing on August 4 and produce his documents. Justice Kalyan Rai Surana issued an order on Thursday in this regard. All India United Democratic Front candidate Barbhuiya defeated Bharatiya Janata Party’s Aminul Haque Laskar to become an MLA from Sonai constituency in this year’s assembly election. Laskar has alleged that Barbhuiya declared himself a graduate from Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, but this was untrue. He claimed that he had filed an RTI in Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, and the reply stated that Barbhuiya never graduated from that university. Also Read | Doctor held for raping colleague in Assam’s DibrugarhTalking to Hindustan Times, Laskar said, “This is not the first time that Barbhuiya has produced fake documents. In the 2016 election, he said he had a diploma in engineering, but he did not mention this while submitting his nomination in the 2021 election. This year he claimed that he graduated in 2019 from Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Meerut, which is also fake. We informed election officials before polling day but they didn’t scrutinise the issue. Later we decided to knock on the door of honourable high court, and the court has decided to hear the matter. I am sure the court will cancel Barbhuiya’s legislatureship.”However Barbhuiya called this a political conspiracy. He said, “In an RTI to Chaudhary Charan Singh University, Laskar wanted to know if I have done my graduation through distance education. But I did it from a private college. I think he has got confused a bit. He also lodged a complaint before Election Commission of India (ECI) in the past and demanded the cancellation of my candidature. But the ECI rejected it and allowed me to contest and I won. He has a long list of complaints against me but none of them are true. I have not received the court’s order yet but if they have called me, I will be there with all my documents to prove myself truthful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accused-of-submitting-fake-degree-assam-mla-asked-by-hc-to-prove-credentials-101624607453967.html

The Indian Navy remains poised and combat-ready to tackle any challenge.Lauding the efforts made by the Navy in times of crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic and Cyclone Tauktae, he said: "The Navy has also made significant contributions in the fight against Covid-19, bringing back citizens from overseas during Op Samudra Setu-I, and much needed Liquid Medical Oxygen during Samudra Setu-lI, despite dangers of Covid-19 spread onboard warships. SAR efforts by the Navy during Cyclone Tauktae showcased the spirit of daring and courage among our men and women in whites."He also spoke about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and stated that our efforts are in alignment with his vision of SAGAR and the wider goal of a Free, Open and Inclusive Indo-Pacific, to ensure peace and stability in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-commission-first-indigenous-aircraft-career-next-year-rajnath-singh-101624603095053.html

Several Union ministers and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders criticised the Arvind Kejriwal-led government in Delhi for inflating the Capital's oxygen requirement and said that it "affected other states"."Because of Arvind Kejriwal's lies, 12 states were affected due to the oxygen supply as the quantity of oxygen had to be cut off from everywhere and sent to Delhi," BJP leader Sambit Patra said during a press briefing. "It is unbelievable to see that Arvind Kejriwal and the Delhi government politicised oxygen supply when Covid was at its peak. This is such petty politics. The data presented by Oxygen Audit Committee in the report is shocking," Patra also said.Union minister Prakash Javadekar was among those to slam the Kejriwal government. "Their demand for oxygen was four times more than what was needed and because of that the rest of the states had to bear the loss. One must learn how to make noise from Delhi government," Javadekar's tweet, roughly translated from Hindi, read.BJP lawmaker from East Delhi Gautam Gambhir also took to social media and asked Kejriwal to hold a press conference and apologise to the nation. "If you have any shame left Arvind Kejriwal, hold one of your PCs now & apologise to the nation for inflating oxygen need BY FOUR TIMES during second wave!" he tweeted.If you have any shame left @ArvindKejriwal, hold one of your PCs now & apologise to the nation for inflating oxygen need BY FOUR TIMES during second wave!Union minister Piyush Goyal tweeted, "Hope accountability is fixed for disrupting oxygen supply across India."On his part, Delhi's deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the Bharatiya Janata Party was lying about the report. He said that the BJP is sharing a fake report created by them in the headquarters and appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to control the actions of the party. "The Supreme Court constituted oxygen audit committee has not approved any report yet. Then, which is this report that BJP leaders have been quoting? I challenge the BJP to bring this report signed by members of the oxygen audit committee," Manish Sisodia said at a press conference.The Supreme Court's oxygen audit panel was led by AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria and included Delhi government principal home secretary Bhupinder Bhalla, Max Healthcare director Dr Sandeep Buddhiraja and Union Jal Shakti ministry's joint secretary Subodh Yadav. HT has not seen the report.Several hospitals sent out SOS calls to authorities saying that their oxygen stock was running out during the peak of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. On May 2, 12 people died in Delhi's Batra Hospital after the hospital ran out of oxygen. The Supreme Court, responding to this crisis, directed the Centre to ensure a supply of 700 MT of oxygen to the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-audit-team-says-delhi-inflated-oxygen-need-4-times-bjp-leaders-slam-kejriwal-101624601115637.html

We suggest women file complaints making the case stronger as we can’t reach everywhere,” MC Josephine was quoted as saying by ANI.Josephine lost her calm during a live television show when a woman, who called in, spoke about her husband and mother-in-law beating her up. She said that she had not filed any complaint to the police or even informed a single person about the abuse she was suffering at home. “Then you suffer, OK,” Josephine said and disconnected the line.The show, a special programme where the women's panel chief was present, was put together by a Malayalam channel to throw light on women harassed and assaulted at home.Josephine’s reaction to the woman’s condition drew major flak off and on social media. Several people noted that the woman in the abusive relationship had taken the first step by calling into the show and that she should have been motivated instead of being ignored.In fact, among those who criticised her response were many who are otherwise known to support the Communist Party of India (M), of which she is a central committee member.The Kerala Congress asked the state government to remove Josephine and the party’s women’s unit even staged a demonstration and burnt her effigy to strengthen their demand. Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP's) Kerala unit chief K Surendran said that a first information report (FIR) should be registered against her. “Strongly condemn the indecent, insensitive and rude behaviour of MC Josephine to a domestic violence victim. How women can expect justice from this women’s commission? She no longer has the moral authority to continue in office. She is a disgrace to humanity,” Surendran tweeted on Thursday.Josephine later issued an apology saying that a woman would get justice if she files a complaint. “I was talking to her with motherly affection. If my words have pained anyone, I regret,” she said, adding that she was angry that women suffer silently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-then-you-suffer-remark-kerala-women-panel-chief-begs-to-differ-101624599469400.html

It was done following the FIR filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) after suspended Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh levelled allegations of corruption against Deshmukh.Singh wrote a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in which he alleged Deshmukh indulged in "malpractices." He also told the chief minister that Deshmukh asked Sachin Vaze, a suspended police officer, to collect ₹100 crore every month, including ₹40-50 crore from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Vaze was suspended during the probe by National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the Mukesh Ambani bomb scare case.The CBI filed an FIR based on section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act) and criminal conspiracy (IPC 120 B). Following this, Deshmukh resigned as the state home minister.In April, CBI also conducted searches at four premises of Deshmukh and claimed to have recovered incriminating documents and digital devices.On May 4, Deshmukh had moved the Bombay High Court seeking the quashing of the CBI FIR against him. The court adjourned the petition and refused to give any interim protection to Deshmukh from any coercive action by the CBI.Waze was arrested in March in connection with the NIA probe into the case of recovery of an explosives-laden SUV near Mukesh Ambani's house in Mumbai and the subsequent murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exmaharashtra-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-s-nagpur-residences-searched-101624599125731.html
25-06-2021||India||India's vaccination not fast enough to foil Covid-19 3rd wave: Report||On June 21, India made a record by vaccinating around 80 lakh people against Covid-19 in a day. It marked the beginning of a fresh phase of India's ongoing vaccination drive, where the Central government has taken the control of the vaccination in the states - 75% of it. But according to experts, even this pace, which may not be sustainable going forward, is not fast enough for India, Bloomberg reported.Bloomberg interviewed experts who questioned the record vaccination figure and interpreted it as an artificial push in the number engineered by some states.What these experts saidGautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University, who also works on modelling outbreaks, said to Blomberg, "The single-day spike seems to have been the result of a concerted effort by some states, who may have stockpiled doses for this purpose. We would need to get to about 10 million doses per day to ensure that a future wave is less potent."Delta, Delta Plus: Which vaccines are effective against these Covid-19 new variantsChandrakant Lahariya, a New Delhi-based epidemiologist and co-author of a book on India’s battle against Covid, called it “an overzealous attempt” to hit a record that would drain limited stocks, the news agency reported.What are the issues?As pointed out in the report, India has covered only 4 per cent of its population so far, despite banning exports of vaccines. While the availability of the doses is a concern, vaccine hesitancy in rural areas is also a serious issue, experts have said.India to vaccinate all citizens against Covid-19 by December 2021, says Union minister Javadekar"If an average pace of about 3.2 million daily doses is maintained, India will be able to vaccinate 45% of its adult population by year-end and 60% by the end of March 2022, Anubhuti Sahay and Saurav Anand, South Asia economists at Standard Chartered Plc, wrote in a report on Wednesday. They said that if more vaccines become available and the pace increases by 30%, India could fully immunize 55% by the end of 2021" -- the Bloomberg report said.Covid 3rd wave and India's vaccination promiseThe advent of the third wave of Covid-19 in India is in the realm of speculation and prediction. Experts working with the Centre have reiterated that both vaccines and Covid-appropriate behaviour are required to minimise the impact of a Covid wave. With the declining number of Covid cases, if people start crowding, the third wave will strike sooner -- within weeks, experts have said. As far as vaccination is concerned, the Centre earlier said India will be completely vaccinated by December 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-vaccination-not-fast-enough-to-foil-covid-19-3rd-wave-report-101624597297031.html

25-06-2021||India||Only 10% of Covid vaccine breakthroughs in Odisha needed hospitalisation: Study||The first-ever study of Covid infection in Odisha among those fully vaccinated, by Bhubaneswar’s Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), an ICMR organisation, has found that around 10% of those reporting a breakthrough infection required hospitalisation.A breakthrough infection is defined as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen in a respiratory specimen of a person more than 14 days after receipt of all recommended doses of an approved Covid-19 vaccine.The preliminary study, yet to be peer-reviewed, was conducted during March 1 and June 10 with nasopharyngeal swab and serum samples from 274 fully vaccinated healthcare and other workers found that 9.9% required hospitalisation with no significant difference between Covaxin and Covishield recipients. Around 83.2% were symptomatic.Of those, 274 samples (186 male, 88 female) who were found to be positive after 14 days of receiving both the doses, 35 had received Covaxin and 239 Covishield.Anecdotal reports from India and published reports from USA show that breakthrough infections are rare. In a study in 75 skilled nursing care facilities in Chicago, among 627 persons with Covid infection, only 22 residents and staff members were fully vaccinated. A study done in a Delhi-based hospital among 113 of its fully vaccinated staff found symptomatic breakthrough infections in just 13.3% and only 1 required hospitalisation.In the Odisha study too, only one healthcare worker died post infection during the study period. The median duration of hospitalisation among the reported cases was 11 days with 1 person still in hospital.The most common symptoms found was fever (88.5%), followed by cough (77.6%) and sore throat (59.6%). Co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and asthma were present in about 64 (23.3%) people.Also Read | Odisha Police arrest drug company MD for selling fake, overpriced Covid medicineMeanwhile, the seropositivity, the production of antibodies in an individual, in people receiving Covishield was 96.7% as against 77.1% in those who got Covaxin jabs. The authors of the study, however, pointed out two limitations of the study. Firstly, the number of documented vaccination breakthrough cases may be significantly a small fraction of all such cases and secondly, the data is based on passive and voluntary reporting of individuals, and might not be complete representation of breakthrough cases as most asymptomatic individuals or those with mild illness post vaccination may not have got tested.Noted microbiologist Dr TM Mohapatra, who has worked with ICMR, said the study is consistent with similar studies done for Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.“The study has once again proved the necessity of taking vaccines to survive Covid infection. In case of a breakthrough infection, hospitalisation may be needed only in case of vaccinated old people with co-morbidities,” he said.However, he added that the study should have been done for detecting neutralising antibodies in the body rather than spike protein antibodies. “The seropositivity rate of Covishield would naturally be higher as it is made more of a spike protein antibodies that make it difficult for SARS-CoV-2 virus to attach to the cells. Covaxin is a whole virion vaccine and can create more neutralising antibodies. In that respect, the RMRC study has a limited value as the sample size is low and did not check neutralising antibodies for both the vaccines. More studies in different age groups are necessary,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-in-odisha-reports-75-breakthrough-infections-101624593473203.html

There were reports of frequent human rights violations and the press being censored to a repressive extent.The court verdict that prompted Indira Gandhi to declare EmergencyThe June 12, 1975 verdict of the Allahabad High Court convicting then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of electoral malpractices and debarring her from holding any elected post was one of the factors that led to the imposition of the Emergency.Indira Gandhi had won the 1971 Lok Sabha election from Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh convincingly defeating socialist leader Raj Narain, who later challenged her election alleging electoral malpractices and violation of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. It was alleged that her election agent Yashpal Kapoor was a government servant and that she used government officials for personal election related work. While convicting Indira Gandhi of electoral malpractices, Justice Sinha disqualified her from Parliament and imposed a six-year ban on her holding any elected post.The imposition of EmergencyInterestingly, the very next day Indira Gandhi imposed the Emergency suspending all fundamental rights, putting opposition leaders in jails, and imposing censorship on the media.The Congress government cited threats to national security, highlighting the recently-concluded war with Pakistan as a plank for its argument. While many within the party still remained opposed to the idea of a declaration of a state of emergency, a few loyalists, including the then chief minister of West Bengal, Siddhartha Shankar Ray, advised Indira Gandhi to go ahead with the measure. The prime minister's younger son, Sanjay Gandhi, too, had grown to be a proponent of "extra-constitutional" measures, according to historians, and hence was in support of his mother's declaration of the Emergency.The legacy of the EmergencyThe chequered legacy of the Emergency meant that the topic would forever remain hotly contested in India's hyperpartisan political climate, even nearly half a century later. In its immediate aftermath, top newspapers condemned the 21-month period of state repression in their respective editorials, while academics highlighted the need to bring checks and balances in the Indian constitution through amendments, to prevent future scenarios such as this.Also Read | JNU’s tryst with Indira’s EmergencyAs years went by, the issue of the Emergency became a primary point of contention between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Many of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)'s senior leaders were arrested during this period, and BJP leaders have made it a point to call attention to this phase repeatedly in their addresses to the public.On June 25, 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid homages to all "those greats" who resisted the Emergency imposed by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on this day in 1975 and said democracy had prevailed over authoritarianism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/june-25-on-this-day-in-1975-indira-gandhi-imposed-the-emergency-what-remains-of-its-legacy-101624589306289.html
25-06-2021||India||What J&K leaders said after meeting PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday met political leaders from Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) for the first such engagement since the region was stripped of its semi-autonomous status and statehood on August 5, 2019. Here is what the leaders and their parties said after the meeting:Former chief minister Farooq Abdullah-led National Conference (NC) demanded the restoration of statehood and said they told Modi that the decisions taken in August 2019 were not in the interest of the people and should be reversed.NC leader Omar Abdullah said they sought the restoration of the J&K cadre of the all-India services, which was merged with the Arunachal, Goa, Mizoram, and Union Territories cadre. He added the Centre refused to discuss the restoration of special status claiming it was a “sub-judicial matter.” On delimitation, he said NC conveyed to Modi that it was not needed. “We told the Prime Minister that we do not stand with what was done on August 5, 2019. We are not ready to accept it. But we would not take the law into our hands. We will fight this in court,” he said.Also Read | Statehood, delimitation: Key takeaways from PM Modi-J&K leaders meetPeople Democratic Party leader Mehbooba Mufti said she highlighted the issue of “ongoing persecution” of Kashmiris and also asked Modi to resume dialogue with Pakistan “to boost trade and maintain peace in Kashmir”. She added the atmosphere has become “suffocating” in Kashmir. Mufti said she also spoke against the culture of booking people under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. She added she told Modi the government illegally abrogated J&K’s special status and conveyed to him they would get it restored legally through courts.J&K Congress unit chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir said Modi’s “body language” reflected there has been a backlash from the voters of the Bharatiya Janata Party over how the abrogation of the region’s special status was carried out.Former chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said Congress put forward five demands: immediate restoration of statehood, protection of land and jobs for the domiciles, return of Kashmiri Pandits, the release of political prisoners and assembly elections.Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami said he told Modi it would have been wiser if this meeting was conducted before the nullification of Article 370. “We made it very clear Jammu & Kashmir is committed to remaining with India, but constitutional guarantees of Indian constitution should be given back.” Tarigami said there was “no assurance at all” regarding the fulfilment of the demands.J&K Panthers Party chief Bhim Singh said he demanded full statehood and elections and that a delimitation process should be initiated only after an elected government is in place. Singh added he also complained about the absence of representatives from Ladakh.People’s Conference leader Sajad Lone said there was a lot of “emotional bonding” between Modi and Kashmiri leaders and the meeting was held in a “cordial atmosphere.”Apni Party leader Altaf Bukhari said he also requested protection of land and jobs, improvement in infrastructure, and employment. He added Modi said delimitation would take place and this would be followed by the assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-j-k-leaders-said-after-meeting-pm-modi-101624592273115.html

25-06-2021||India||'Delta plus' variant evades vaccines? Experts flag major concerns||The emergence of the Delta and Delta plus variants of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), has once again put India, and by extension the world, in a state of high alert. Delta plus, reportedly a variant with increased transmissibility, is the latest in a long list of new mutant forms of the Delta Covid-19 strain which was first detected in India. While the earlier version had largely been blamed for the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India, the new, more virulent variant is being feared ahead of a potential third wave. With the Delta plus Covid-19 variant being detected in as many as 11 countries so far, here's everything that the public health experts are currently talking about.What is the 'Delta plus' Covid-19 variant?First things first, one ought to know what exactly is 'Delta plus', the new coronavirus mutant strain that's got the world worried ahead of a potential third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.Also Read | Delta Plus: List of states where this new Covid variant has been reported so farDelta plus (B.1.617.2.1/(AY.1) is a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus formed due to a mutation in the Delta strain of the virus (B.1.617.2 variant). Since it is still technically a new mutant strain, not much is known about its severity or resistance to antibodies. Some reports claim that the Delta plus (AY.1) is resistant to monoclonal antibodies cocktail, but more research is required in this area.How dangerous is 'Delta plus' from the earlier Covid-19 variant?Additionally, one of the emerging variants of the Delta plus mutant strain has also acquired the K417N mutation, found in Beta variants in South Africa. Some scientists fear that the mutation combined with other existing features of the Delta variant could make it more transmissible, but again, further studies are needed to ascertain this idea.Efficacy of vaccines on 'Delta plus' variantsOne of India's top virologists and a former member of the Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG), Professor Shahid Jameel, expressed concerns regarding the Delta plus variant earlier this week. He said that the new mutant variant may just be capable of dodging immunities, both from Covid-19 vaccines as well as from earlier infections. This is because the Delta plus variant not only has all the symptoms that the original Delta variant had, but also carries symptoms from its partner Beta variant (K417N mutation), Professor Jameel explained. We already know that the Beta variant evades Covid-19 vaccines much better than the Alpha or the Delta variants, as evidenced by the fact that the South African government had returned a consignment of AstraZeneca vaccines, reasoned the virologist.WATCH | How to check spread of Covid's Delta Plus variant? Dr Randeep Guleria explainsHowever, the central government, on the other hand, has quoted studies as saying the Covishield and Covaxin are 'broadly effective' on the Delta plus variant. Further studies are required in this area to properly ascertain the claims on either side.Major concerns around the variantMultiple studies are ongoing in India and globally to test the effectiveness of vaccines against the Delta plus Covid-19 mutation. India's health ministry warned that regions where it has been found "may need to enhance their public health response by focusing on surveillance, enhanced testing, quick contact-tracing, and priority vaccination." Authorities have spotlighted that Delta Plus can likely inflict another wave of infections on India after it emerged from the world's worst surge in cases only recently.Also Read | No need to panic: Experts on Delta plus variant"WHO is tracking this variant as part of the Delta variant, as we are doing for other Variants of Concern with additional mutations," the World Health Organization (WHO) told Reuters.Around 200 cases of the new Delta plus variant had been found in as many as 11 countries till June 16 -- Britain (36), Canada (1), India (8), Japan (15), Nepal (3), Poland (9), Portugal (22), Russia (1), Switzerland (18), Turkey (1), and the United States (83).In India alone, around 40 cases of the Delta plus variant have been detected sporadically in Maharashtra, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh. However, no deaths have yet been reported of the new variant in India and the UK. Britain said its first 5 cases were sequenced on April 26 and they were contacts of individuals who had travelled from or transited through Nepal and Turkey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-plus-variant-evades-covid-19-vaccines-all-you-need-to-know-about-major-concerns-101624583935282.html

I was very lucky to be the only passenger on the entire flight. I feel like a Maharaja during my travel,” Oberoi told ANI.Oberoi, who holds a ten-year golden visa and operates a business in Dubai said that when he bought the ticket for the three-hour flight for dirham 750. “I was treated very well by the entire crew and was photographed in an empty plane, I took pictures with the crew and pilots of the aircraft,” he said.On travelling without any co-passengers, Oberoi said: “If I get a chance to travel solo next time I will refuse. It is good for once in a lifetime experience. It was very boring.” He added that he resorted to counting the number of seats and windows of the aircraft to pass the time.Oberoi was refused permission by Air India to board the flight but was allowed after the intervention of the Ministry of Civil Aviation. “I was carrying all travel documents including authorized UAE full vaccinations proof. I finally boarded the flight after the intervention of Hardeep Singh Puri’s ministry.” Oberoi said.Later, once the issue was resolved, a senior airline officer said the pilot and crew ensured Singh had a unique experience. “Taking pictures on flight and allowing him (Singh) to roam around were a few of the perks that Singh, as a solo passenger, was allowed to enjoy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lone-passenger-flies-like-maharaja-101624575154272.html

25-06-2021||India||Amikacin may have been used at fake Covid-19 vaccination camp in Kolkata||People who went to take their Covid-19 vaccine at the fake vaccination camp organised by the man who was impersonating an IAS officer, may have been injected with Amikacin, an antibiotic. Sleuths of the Kolkata Police’s detective department, who raided Debanjan Deb’s office in south Kolkata on Thursday, found a large number of Amikacin vials. Fake labels of Covishield have also been recovered. “In some of the Amikacin vials we found fake labels of Covishield had been pasted. Interrogation revealed that Debanjan Deb used to purchase Amikacin from chemists impersonating as a top official of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation,” said a senior officer of Kolkata Police. On Wednesday, Kolkata Police busted a fake Covid-19 vaccination camp organized by 28-year-old Deb, who was masquerading as the joint commissioner of the city’s civic body. Trinamool Congress MP Mimi Chakraborty was also duped as she attended the vaccination camp on an invitation and took a dose. She however, grew suspicious when she didn’t receive any message on her mobile. Police have lodged another case against Deb on Thursday after interrogation revealed that he had organised a similar camp at a college in north Kolkata a few days ago. Several students were injected. “The vials used by Deb had a label with Covishield written on it in green colour. It didn’t have any batch number, any manufacturing date, expiry date or the company’s name. It was only written ‘recombinant vaccine’. The vials were also smaller than actual Covishield vaccine vials,” said Ranita Sengupta, deputy chief medical health officer at KMC. Police suspect that as Deb was impersonating an IAS officer and a top civic official he was also arranging funds by negotiating with some microfinance companies. “He had employed security personnel and used to move around in a car with a blue beacon and the flag of KMC,” said the police officer. Further investigation is going on and the samples, recovered from his office and the fake vaccination camp, have been sent for examination. “Amikacin is a very important antibiotic which is given to patients suffering from sepsis and septicaemia. We still don’t know which injection was given. But if it was Amikacin then it won’t have much effect on a normal human being. But if the patient is suffering from kidney ailments and Amikacin has been given in high doses, then it could create problems,” said Dr Manas Gumta, general secretary of the Association of Health Service Doctors in the state. The BJP has raised allegations that Deb could be having links with senior leaders of the Trinamool Congress after pictures of Deb posing with senior TMC leaders surfaced. Recently, Deb attended a program organised by the TMC at Sonarpur in the southern fringes of the city. TMC legislator Lovey Maitra also attended the program on an invitation. Recently a bust of Rabindranath Tagore was unveiled at Taltala in Kolkata. Along with names of TMC MPs and MLAs, Deb’s name was also carved on the stone. “How can a MP (referring to TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty) attend a fake vaccination camp, without verifying it and speak highly of the camp? Does this mean that she is also associated with this? Deb’s picture can also be seen with TMC’s leaders including ministers and ward councillors. There has to be some connection,” said Dilip Ghosh, BJP president in West Bengal. “The way everything was camouflaged we admit that there was a fault. A crime has been committed. The police will investigate how he managed everything. Mimi Chakraborty didn’t speak highly of Deb. She tried to encourage vaccination. But we don’t want to hear it from the BJP. Could they identify the fake BJP leaders who joined the party in large numbers before the elections and are now willing to switch sides?” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson A few hundred people took injections in various camps organised by Deb. Police said that citizens who took the fake jab in south Kolkata were told that they were getting Covishield, those who got the fake jabs in the north Kolkata College were told they had got Sputnik. His office employees were also given fake injections and were told they were getting Pfizer vaccine. Such a camp was also organised at Sonarpur too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amikacin-may-have-been-used-at-fake-covid-19-vaccination-camp-in-kolkata-101624564851378.html

How come all the thieves have Modi as the common surname?” He was the Congress president when he had made this alleged remark.Purnesh Modi has also moved the Gujarat high court, seeking to call Kolar district collector and a videographer, who recorded the speech, as witnesses in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-not-defame-those-with-modi-surname-rahul-gandhi-to-gujarat-court-101624564396850.html

Sitharaman discussed India’s potential for rapid growth and investment opportunities due to its wide-ranging reforms that would position the country as an attractive destination for foreign investors, a finance ministry statement issued late night on Thursday said.She highlighted India’s efforts to fight the Covid-19 pandemic effectively that saw a significant drop in new Covid-19 infections in the country, it said. The finance minister participated in the roundtable through video conferencing, which was also attended by foreign investors such as Mastercard, MetLife, Prudential, Air Products, Dell, SoftBank and Warburg Pincus amongst others. The finance minister said the government’s over ₹20 lakh crore relief-cum-stimulus package helped in rapid recovery of the Indian economy after the pandemic that led to a nationwide lockdown for 68 days since March 25, 2020.She underscored the continued macro-economic stability and resilience in economic recovery. The 68-day national lockdown plunged the economy into technical recession. Indian economy contracted 24.4% in the first quarter, and 7.3% contraction in the second quarter of 2020-21. The ₹20.97 lakh crore stimulus package -- Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-reliant India Initiative) – helped a V-shaped recovery. The economy expanded by 0.5% in the third quarter and 1.6% in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2021. In her concluding remarks at the forum, Sitharaman spoke about going ahead with an overall vision to build a self-reliant modern India driven by five ‘I’ -- Intent, Inclusion, Investment, Infrastructure and Innovation, the statement said. “The Finance Minister stated that the country is committed to a long-term relationship with US investors and proposes to meet twice yearly,” it added. USISPF is a non-profit organisation, with the primary objective of strengthening the India-US bilateral and strategic partnership through policy advocacy in the fields of economic growth, entrepreneurship, employment-creation, and innovation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-economic-powerhouse-sitharaman-on-stability-infra-led-growth-and-reforms-101624563231224.html
25-06-2021||India||Nagaland Governor, NSCN (IM) in war of words on ‘taxation’ by armed group||Kohima: The government of India’s interlocutor for Naga peace talks, RN Ravi and the Isak-Muivah-led National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN-IM) are in the middle of a war of words on the armed group’s right to collect money from people.The trigger was a claim by the NSCN (IM) that representatives of the government of India who engage in political dialogue with NSCN leaders recognise their right to collect taxes from its citizens and this was a legitimate right of any government.The statement provoked Nagaland governor RN Ravi, who is also the Centre’s interlocutor for the peace talks, to fact check the armed group. Without naming the organisation on Tuesday, Ravi said the statement was “erroneous” and one that is likely to cause confusion among the people.“Taxation is a sovereign function which can be exercised only either by the government of India or the state government,” Ravi stated, adding that the government does not recognise any such right by any other entity.“Forcible collection of money by any entity is extortion which is a criminal offence punishable under the laws. In fact all the Naga armed organisations engaged in the peace process have given a commitment against such collection,” Ravi maintained.The NSCN (IM) hit back at Ravi on Wednesday, claiming that Ravi was trying to criminalise the Naga political movement by questioning the right of the NSCN to impose its tax after more than 23 years of Indo-Naga political dialogue.“NSCN puts on record to go back to history to point out that taxation is something which is deeply rooted in the history of the Naga resistance movement even before the Naga National Council (NNC) came into the scene. Now the focus has been shifted to the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN) which is at the helm of affairs leading the Naga political struggle. As brought about by the 23 years of Indo-Naga political talks, the Nagas’ stand for sovereign existence is before the world domain and not a question of obscurity,” the NSCN (IM) stated.The statement said the group collected taxes to support the Naga people’s political movement which started in 1929, even before India got independence from the British, and opposing the Naga tax is nothing short of obstructing the Naga movement. It asserted though that the organisation stands opposed to extortions and excesses committed by collectors.The NSCN (IM) also claimed that the government opposing taxations by the organisation instantly violates the “framework agreement” signed between them in 2015 wherein the two entities stated to have agreed to coexist peacefully as two different entities sharing sovereign power.“Following the signing of the Framework Agreement of the 3rd August, 2015, this taxation was included in the competencies. No one can deny these factual records of the Framework Agreement and the competencies,” the NSCN (IM) stated.The Naga peace deal is yet to be finalised as critical issues are waiting to be considered from the perspective of the “framework agreement”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-governor-nscn-im-in-war-of-words-on-taxation-by-armed-group-101624563111330.html
25-06-2021||India||Scientists urge President to recall draft rules for Lakshadweep||A group of 60 scientists and researchers has requested President Ram Nath Kovind to withdraw the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (LDAR) 2021 that seeks to develop the islands as a major tourist destination, underlining that the region’s unique geography, ecology, and long human history places natural limits on the kinds of development the archipelago can support.In a letter sent to President Kovind on Wednesday, the group sought “a serious re-evaluation” of the developmental paradigms being promoted for the archipelago and underlined that Lakshadweep, an archipelago consisting of 36 islands with an area of 32 sq km, was already among the worst affected places due to the climate crisis.The 60 signatories to the appeal include herpetologist Romulus Whitaker, ecologist Katik Shanker, wildlife biologist Bivash Pandav, marine scientist Divya Panicker, and ecologist Harini Nagendra.Earlier this month, a group of 93 former civil servants also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the LDAR envisages land-use, which can destroy the islands.The regulation is among the new rules and proposals introduced in the region that has triggered loud protests in Lakshadweep. Some of the measures provide for the removal or relocation of islanders from their property for town planning. On Thursday, the Kerala high court stayed, for the time being, two decisions taken by the administrator to close dairy farms and exclude meat products from the midday meals in the island’s schools.The group identified Lakshadweep’s inherent environmental vulnerability, LDR’s impact on local livelihood, its legal status vis-a-vis existing laws and commitments and what it described as a questionable developmental paradigm as their four key concerns around the regulation.HT sought a response from Lakshadweep Administrator’s advisor A Anabarsu to the concerns raised by scientists but he did not respond.The group cautioned that Lakshadweep has already “experienced catastrophic climate change-related coral mass mortality events” over the last two decades.“Some reefs, including the capital, Kavaratti, are already eroding more than they are growing. Unless urgent action is taken now to reverse these trajectories, scientific studies conclude that between reef decline, sea-level rise, land loss, cyclones, and declining freshwater, the majority of low-lying atolls like Lakshadweep will become unlivable by mid-century.”“Atoll islands’’ are recently formed ( less than 4000 years), low-lying (with a mean elevation generally less than 3 metre) islands. They are composed mostly of biologically derived carbonate sand, gravel and boulders, generated on coral reefs according to scientific literature referred to in the letter.The researchers also insisted that the proposed regulation, which is designed to boost tourism, is in direct conflict with the rights of local people to land, livelihood and healthy ecosystems. Lakshadweep society, they argued, is organised around its limited land and freshwater resources. “… by granting authorities unqualified rights to appropriate land, beach and lagoon resources, the LDAR acts directly against the livelihood interests of local communities and jeopardises a way of life, and an entire economy.”The group said LDAR is also against India’s laws like the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, the Biological Diversity Act 2002, the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the Ecotourism Guidelines, 2019, along with international and national legal obligations.The researchers argued that the regulation was based on the understanding that Lakshadweep is woefully underdeveloped and needs to be fast-tracked on a path of rapid growth. “This embraces a narrow interpretation of development that favours investment in physical infrastructure, high-end tourism, market mechanisms and resource exploitation over local rights, societal wellbeing and existing ecological infrastructure,” the letter said.Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology said rapid warming in the Arabian Sea has increased the number of cyclones by 50% in the basin. “As Arabian Sea continues to warm, climate projections indicate more extremely severe cyclones in the future. The storm surges from these cyclones, along with heavy rains and a rising sea level can be a threat multiplier to islands like the Lakshadweep,” said Koll.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-urge-president-to-recall-draft-rules-for-lakshadweep-101624562811294.html
25-06-2021||India||Will drop cases filed against protesters during AIADMK regime: Stalin||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on the last day of the current session of the legislative assembly, announced that cases against those who protested the eight-way Chennai- Salem expressway, Kudankulam nuclear power plant, hydrocarbon extraction projects, the three new farm legislation and several others during the previous AIADMK would be dropped. “All these cases filed against citizens for protesting will be withdrawn,” Stalin said on Thursday, adding that the intention is to uphold their right and protect the freedom of expression. In the assembly, he also announced that ₹1,000 crores will be allocated to temple renovation in the state.Activists say that more than 10,000 cases were registered against protestors across five districts in Tamil Nadu where the Salem-Chennai expressway project cut through. “We welcome the government dropping cases against us, but this is not a conclusion,” said A Chandramohan, state secretary, All India Kisan Mahasabha (AIKM).“The DMK government has to pass a resolution in the legislative assembly insisting that the central government scrap this project. Tamil Nadu revenue department is the local authority to do the land acquisition process. Without the government support, the project by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) cannot implement it.” In December 2020, the Supreme Court upheld the land acquisition notifications for the expressway, partially allowing appeals of the Union government and the NHAI and overturned a Madras high court judgement.A few of these protests were supported by the DMK when they were in the opposition. When Stalin met Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month in Delhi, he urged him for several centrally sponsored schemes and projects to be scrapped, including the Salem-Chennai expressway. Stalin has already announced that a resolution will be passed against the farm laws and the Citizenship Amendment Act in the budget session of the assembly scheduled in July. Earlier on June 13, Stalin wrote to the PM that the state is of the firm view that hydrocarbon projects should not be taken up in the protected agriculture zone in the interests of the agrarian community and the ecology of the region.After coming to power, Stalin ordered for most of the cases to be withdrawn against anti-Sterlite protestors on the eve of the third anniversary in May of the police firing that killed 13 civilians who participated in the demonstration in Thoothukudi district. The new government also decided to provide no-objection certificates (NOC) to those arrested during the protest for pursuing higher education and jobs.The previous AIADMK regime, before the assembly elections, had dropped a majority of cases against CAA protestors, Covid-19 lockdown violators and pro-jallikattu activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-drop-cases-filed-against-protesters-during-aiadmk-regime-stalin-101624562570715.html
25-06-2021||India||Centre’s autocracy has tarnished India’s image: Mamata Banerjee||The scrapping of Article 370 and alleged mismanagement of Covid-19 vaccination by the BJP-led Union government has tarnished India’s image, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday. “Why was it necessary to take away statehood? People first want to enjoy freedom. If freedom is lost, then everything is lost. This has not helped the country at all. Tourists could not go there for two years. It became a question of the country’s prestige. The autocracy has tarnished the country’s image, similar to what the Covid-19 vaccination drive has done,” Banerjee said while adding that she was not aware of the all-party meeting and its agenda. Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired an all-party meeting on Jammu and Kashmir. Fourteen leaders, including four former chief ministers (CMs) of the then state were invited. It was the first high level interaction to be held between the central government and Kashmir’s political leadership since 2019, when the Centre scrapped Article 370 and 35A, which gave special status to J-K and its people. “What does she know about Article 370? There was a time when bloodshed was regular in Kashmir. Today there is peace and the people of Kashmir and Ladakh are thanking Modi ji. She is into appeasement politics and that’s why she is saying such things. She should first manage the vaccination drive properly in the state before commenting on India’s vaccination programme,” said Rahul Sinha, BJP leader. The TMC chief also slammed the BJP-led Union government over the three contentious farm laws. “BJP is always trying to prove that only they are nationalistic and the rest are anti-nationals. If people raise their voice, they become terrorists? They (BJP) can’t manage vaccines and they don’t keep records of how many bodies are flowing down the River Ganges. I salute the farmers,” she said. Banerjee also sent a letter to Modi on Thursday requesting the Prime Minister’s intervention so that Covaxin gets approval from the World Health Organisation. “It is learnt that Covaxin is still not approved by WHO and it is not possible to travel abroad as many countries are allowing only those people who are fully vaccinated with WHO approved vaccines,” Banerjee wrote in her letter to the Prime Minister. She also said that as a large number of Indian students go abroad to pursue higher studies and many have taken Covaxin, they were facing problems.Elections to more than 107 civic bodies in Bengal, including the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, have been pending for over a year and these bodies are currently being run by administrators appointed by the Mamata Banerjee-administration. On being asked whether the TMC government had any plans of holding the civic elections, Banerjee said: “First let the Election Commission of India hold the by-elections in seven assembly constituencies. We will hold the civic elections on time. We are waiting. We have nothing to fear (to hold the civic polls). We are ready.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-autocracy-has-tarnished-india-s-image-mamata-banerjee-101624562151996.html
25-06-2021||India||Relatives of men linked to Bengaluru riots struggle to pick up the pieces||Bengaluru: On the black grill outside an apartment complex in north-eastern Bengaluru’s Shampura, a clutch of “To Let” notices have appeared . While such posters are common in the city during the Covid-19 pandemic, in this particular housing complex, the reason for vacancies is different. A resident of the building, an elderly woman, said occupants of most of the vacant houses were arrested following the violence near DJ Halli police station last year. “As the breadwinners were in jail, the families had no choice but to vacate their houses. In some cases, the residents wanted to get away from the locality to avoid further police trouble,” the woman added, requesting anonymity. On the night of 11 August 2020, a mob resorted to arson in DJ Halli and KG Halli areas after Naveen P, nephew of Congress MLA from Pulakeshinagar constituency R Akhanda Srinivas Murthy, allegedly posted a derogatory image of Prophet Mohammad on Facebook. Two police stations were attacked, houses were burnt, and scores of vehicles burnt, according to police FIRs. Police resorted to firing, in which three people died; one more succumbed days later to the bullet injuries. Subsequently, police arrested at least 400 people, including several from the building in Shampura. Tabrez Hussain, a 35-year-old executive in a multinational company, was picked from his apartment by police a day after the violence. According to Hussain, he was playing carrom in the parking lot of his apartment with three others when police barged in. He said three Muslim men including him were picked up while the Hindu watchman was left behind. “I asked them what was going on, but we did not get an answer. They took us to the main road and made us kneel. Soon, a government bus came, and we were all loaded in it. They initially took us towards KG Halli police station but later changed course,” Hussain told HT. The bus took them to police quarters in Adugodi, where around 90 men were locked inside a room. “They took our phones and started scanning through them. At that point, I didn’t know why I was picked up. I wanted to explain that I was nowhere near the spot of violence, but there was no one to tell,” he said. For another two months after his arrest, he remained in dark about the charges slapped against him by police. From the adjacent building, three men in their 20s from a family were also picked up by the police. All three were asleep when the police came . They were transported in the same bus as Hussain and were lodged in the same room. “All three of us were at home when the violence happened. They took every man they saw. In the room where we were locked in, they kept asking why we attacked the police station and they didn’t listen to us,” said the youngest brother, who didn’t wish to be named. Another man, who was in quarantine after contracting Covid-19, was also picked up by the police during the raid. “There was no questioning or checking our whereabouts. They had come with the intention of arresting every person in the building,” said the second brother, requested anonymity. Hussain said after spending hours locked in the room in the police quarters, they were presented before the magistrate through a video call, where a policeman panned the phone to show all the people in the room. “Even at the point, we were not sure what was going on. It was only when I saw one of the forms held by a policeman, which had Parappanna Agrahara central prison written on top, that I realised we were being sent to jail,” said Hussain. “The day I was arrested, my family didn’t know that I was picked up. It was only after pleading with the prison guard that they allowed me to make a phone call home to tell my family that I was in custody. Some other didn’t even get that chance,” Hussain added. For the next two months, they were locked up in a cell and they were not allowed to step out . “There was no sunlight and fresh air for two months, and there were 109 of us in the barrack. It was during this time that we heard that we were booked for rioting under UAPA (Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act). It was more than two months later that we were let out of the barracks for short walks,” said one of the brothers quoted above. Between 2015 and 2020, Karnataka reported 971 cases of riots, either communal or political, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. This includes the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Mangaluru (in December 2019), which saw unprecedented violence – including death of two persons. However, it was only in the DJ Halli riots case that the Bengaluru police invoked the stringent UAPA, according to police records accessed by HT. Following the arrests, Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant on August 20 had said no innocent person had been arrested by teams investigating the August 11 riots. “Arrests were made only after making proper verification and collection of evidence. The investigations are on the right track.” . In September 2020, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the case. When NIA filed a charge sheet in the case, almost six months later, it drastically reduced the number of people booked under UAPA, and added sections of the Indian Penal Code against most of the others. “In the charge sheet filed by NIA, only 47 people have been booked under UAPA. At least 370 people have been booked under various sections of IPC. Initially when the case was filed, most of them were booked under UAPA by Bengaluru police, which the NIA changed. Most of them were denied bail for six months because of the UAPA charges,” said Mohammad Azhar, a lawyer representing some of the accused in the case. While the UAPA charges being dropped came as a big relief for many like Hussain and the three brothers, their lives changed for the worse during those six months. Hussain said he lost his job while he was in prison. “The company was initially supportive knowing my situation but sometime later, they hired another person as my replacement. Even though the UAPA charges have been dropped and there is enough evidence to prove my innocence, I don’t have a job,” he said. After he was released on bail in the last week of February, Hussain managed to get another job; however, he was sacked by the company citing the case against him, the 35-year-old said. Another resident of the building, a 31-year-old transport lorry driver was arrested following the violence and was released on bail after NIA dropped the UAPA charges against him. “The tempo (transport truck) was my only source of income. When I was arrested, my wife was alone at home. Since there was no income, the house owner began cutting rent from our deposit money. Eventually, my wife had no option but to sell the tempo. I lost everything I owed in those six months,” he said, requesting anonymity. In the same housing complex, at least four families vacated their houses after the men were arrested by the police and the families didn’t have the means to pay rent. For the three brothers, the expenses during the six months of jail have put the family in severe debt. “We had to keep sending money to the boys for availing facilities in the jail, such as making calls home. The lawyer’s fees and other expenses have come up to ₹1.5 lakh, which is a big amount for us. All three of them have lost their jobs also, which makes our situation worse,” said their mother. Three senior Bengaluru police officers refused to comment on NIA dropping UAPA charges against several accused, claiming the case is sub-judice. However, one senior officer, on the condition of anonymity, said the trial was yet to begin, and that they were preparing a watertight case. Officials of NIA Hyderabad, which is investigating the case, didn’t respond to calls made by HT for a comment. However, NIA has claimed that the violence in Bengaluru’s DJ Halli, on August 11, 2020, was coordinated through a WhatsApp group. The central agency made the claim in its charge sheet filed on February 9. The federal agency claimed that a WhatsApp group “DG Halli 45” was actively organising the mob to gather in front of the two police stations. “Analysis of the WhatsApp group revealed that more than a hundred members were present in the said group during the riot and had hidden their identity… the WhatsApp group was used for spreading incriminating messages, images, videos, audio clips etc related to the incident to instigate people to assemble unlawfully in front of both KG Halli and DJ Halli police stations for participating in the violent activities,” the charge sheet read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kin-of-men-linked-to-b-luru-riots-struggle-to-pick-up-the-pieces-101624562150626.html
25-06-2021||India||Persuade people to get vaccines, not force them: Meghalaya high court to govt||The Meghalaya High Court on Thursday told the government not to coerce people to get their Covid-19 vaccine but use persuasion instead. The advice from a two-judge bench of the high court came after it took a dim view of the authorities barring people from opening shops or operating taxis unless they got the jab.The bench comprising chief justice Biswanath Somadder and justice HS Thangkhiew said the government cannot put an embargo on the fundamental right to life of individuals by strippng them of the right to livelihood except according to the procedure adopted by law. This procedure too, the court added, has to be fair, just and reasonable.“Till now, there has been no legal mandate whatsoever with regard to coercive or mandatory vaccination in general and the Covid19 vaccination drive in particular that can prohibit or take away the livelihood of a citizen on that ground,” the bench ruled.The bench has taken suo moto (on its own motion) notice of orders by deputy commissioners barring shops, commercial establishments and passenger vehicles from resuming business in their respective districts unless their staffers have been vaccinated.Instead, the bench ordered shops, commercial establishments and passenger vehicles to put up a notice board that indicates if the staffers have been vaccinated.“In the event, any shops/establishments/local taxis/auto-rickshaws/maxi cabs and buses flout the above directions, the concerned authority of the State shall immediately direct its closure/stoppage of plying,” the court ordered.“Compulsory administration of vaccines without hampering one’s right to life and liberty based on informed choice and informed consent is one thing. However, if any compulsory vaccination drive is coercive by its very nature and spirit, it assumes a different proportion and character,” the bench reasoned.The court said the issue of vaccine hesitancy needs to be dealt with by the state government in a manner that will commensurate with the seven-point fresh guidelines issued on Tuesday that advocates the “nudge” approach as a primary tool to effect change in the Covid vaccine compliance.The court cautioned the authorities that it will monitor the situation closely and underscored that the problem must be addressed at the earliest while expecting that all eligible persons in the state are vaccinated within the timeframe as specified by the government.The matter has been listed for hearing on June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/persuade-people-to-get-vaccines-not-force-them-meghalaya-high-court-to-govt-101624561731334.html
25-06-2021||India||The doctor who went out of his way to help humanity||Delhi: “I am suffering from Covid-19; I have Covid pneumonia which is progressive. But even then remember the words of Raj Kapoor, the show must go on. Picture abhi baaki hai,” said Dr KK Agarwal, 62, in one of the last videos he put out as part of his practice to educate people about coronavirus disease (Covid-19).At the time of making the video, Agarwal was on oxygen support.A renowned cardiologist in the National Capital Region and the head of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) from 2016-17, Agarwal was known for his effort to educate people through social media and healthcare festivals.He was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences after contracting the coronavirus disease in May; his condition deteriorated and he was in need of ventilator support.He died on May 17 at the age of 62.The doctor had received both doses of vaccine against Covid-19; indeed, to combat vaccine hesitancy, he had even live streamed getting the jab. In January, he achieved a degree of virality when, after returning from getting a jab, he attended a call from his wife, Veena Agarwal, who scolded him for getting the jab without her.Later, Agarwal said that he was happy that people had achieved a “moment of levity” at his expense, but it was important for him to show people that nothing would happen if they got the vaccine.The Heart Care Foundation of India, which Agarwal started in 1986 to help treat patients with heart conditions, continues to run his social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.Dr Prem Aggarwal, owner of Sanjeevan hospital in Darya Ganj and a cardiologist, stood against Agarwal for the post of president of the Delhi Medical Association – and lost.“He was very malleable person; he could adjust to any situation and get along with anyone. He got along with me even as I wholeheartedly opposed him in the elections for the Delhi Medical Association. He won but we went on to do many events together,” Aggarwal said.Dr OP Yadava of the National Heart Institute remembered his colleague for over 30 years as someone whose reformatory zeal never dimmed.Agarwal was known for his classic look: he would wear a beret over his bandh gala, and had a stethoscope around his neck at all times. “People called him boastful for having the stethoscope around his neck all the time. But I think he just took pride in being a doctor. That’s an identity he wanted people to know him by, so that he could help them in their time of need,” Yadava said.Agarwal started the Sameer Malik fund in 2014 under the aegis of the Heart Care Foundation to conduct cardiac surgeries like bypass, installing pacemakers, and valve replacement for those who could not afford it. The fund was also used to treat children with congenital heart defects, particularly girls.“He could have earned a lot more if he wished to, but he wanted to help the society. We used to do the surgeries sponsored by the Sameer Malik fund and KK said that we should focus on the girl child because often parents would seek treatment for their boys but the girls remained neglected,” Yadava said.Born to a family that lived in a small one-bedroom house as the seventh child, Agarwal wanted to be a doctor from a young age. He joined Delhi’s Moolchand hospital in 1983 as a junior resident under Dr HK Chopra, a preventive cardiologist. Within a span of few months, he got five promotions and became a specialist at Moolchand hospital.Agarwal was one of the first cardiologists to bring echocardiography to Delhi after being trained in the United States. The technology is now an integral part of heart care in the country.He went on to win the highest award in the medical profession, the Dr BC Roy award, in 2005 and the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award, in 2010.“He brought medical journalism to the forefront with his reporting on issues in the country’s healthcare system,” said Aggarwal, co-founder of medical reporting site, Medical Dialogues.He was a stickler for organization, Yadava said. “He had made a detailed point by point note on who would take over his newsletter, who could take over what work. Everything had been taken care of even when he was in the hospitals. He was clear-headed till the end.” His newsletters were about awareness and findings of new studies.“He was methodical and wouldn’t waste even a minute.”He is survived by his wife, Veena, daughter Naina and son Nilesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-doctor-who-went-out-of-his-way-to-help-humanity-101624561252207.html
25-06-2021||India||People may have got antibiotics at fake jab camp in Kolkata: Cops||People who went to take Covid-19 vaccine at the fake vaccination camp, organised by the man who was impersonating an IAS officer, in south Kolkata might have been injected with Amikacin, an antibiotic, police said on Thursday.Sleuths of the Kolkata Police’s detective department, who raided accused Debanjan Deb’s office in south Kolkata on Thursday, found a large number of Amikacin vials. Fake labels of Covishield were also recovered, police said.“In some of the Amikacin vials we found that fake labels of Covishield have been pasted. Interrogation revealed that Debanjan Deb used to purchase Amikacin from chemists impersonating as a top official of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation,” said a senior officer of Kolkata Police.On Wednesday, Kolkata Police busted a fake Covid-19 vaccination camp organised by 28-year-old Deb, who was masquerading as the joint commissioner of the city’s civic body.Trianmool Congress MP Mimi Chakraborty was also duped as she attended the vaccination camp on an invitation and took a dose. She, however, grew suspicious when she didn’t receive any message on her mobile.Police lodged another case against Deb on Thursday after interrogation revealed that he had organised a similar camp at a college in north Kolkata a few days ago. Several students were injected.“The vials used by Deb had a label with Covishield written on it in green colour. It didn’t have any batch number, manufacture date, expiry date or the company’s name. Only ‘recombinant vaccine’ was written on it. The vials were also smaller than actual Covishield vaccine vials,” said Ranita Sengupta, deputy chief medical health officer at KMC.Police suspect Deb, who was impersonating an IAS officer and a top civic official, was also arranging funds by negotiating with some microfinance companies.“He had employed a security guard and used to move around in a car with a blue beacon and the flag of KMC,” said the police officer.Police said further investigation was going on and the samples, recovered from his office and the fake vaccination camp, have been sent for examination.“Amikacin is a very important antibiotic, which is given to patients suffering from sepsis and septicaemia. We still don’t know which injection was given. But if it was Amikacin, then it won’t have much effect on a normal human being. But if the patient is suffering from kidney ailments and Amikacin has been given in high doses, then it could create some problem,” said Dr Manas Gumta, general secretary of Association of Health Service Doctors in the state.Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has raised allegations that Deb might have links with senior TMC leaders after pictures of the accused posing with senior leaders of the ruling party surfaced.Recently, Deb had attended a programme organsied by the TMC at Sonarpur in the southern fringes of the city. TMC legislator Lovey Maitra had also attended the programme on invitation. Besides, a bust of Rabindranath Tagore was recently unveiled at Taltala in Kolkata. Along with names of TMC MPs and MLAs, Deb’s name was also carved on the stone, people aware of the matters told HT.“How can an MP (referring to Mimi Chakraborty) attend a fake vaccination camp, without verifying it and speak highly of the camp? Does this mean that she is also associated with this? Deb’s picture can also be seen with TMC leaders, including ministers and ward councilors. There has to be some connection,” Dilip Ghosh, BJP president in West Bengal, said.Reacting to BJP’s allegations, Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson, said, “The way everything was camouflaged, we admit that there was a fault. A crime has been committed. The police will investigate how he managed everything. Mimi Chakraborty didn’t speak highly of Deb. She tried to encourge vaccination. But we don’t want to hear it from the BJP. Could they identify the fake BJP leaders who joined the party in large numbers before the elections and are now willing to switch sides?”A few hundred people took injections in various camps organised by Deb. Police said those who took the fake jab in south Kolkata were told that they were getting Covishield, those who got the fake jabs in north Kolkata College were told they got Sputnik.

25-06-2021||India||India asks OPEC to restore oil supply to calm inflation||Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday asked oil producers’ cartel -- Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) -- for restoring output to bring down international crude oil prices to a reasonable band, adding that their strategy of production squeeze is stoking inflation and restricting economic recovery of energy importers such as India.In a consultation meeting with Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC secretary general, Pradhan flagged concerns over the increasing crude oil prices and its impact on consumers and emphasised that high crude prices were adding significant inflationary pressure on India, a petroleum ministry spokesperson said.India has been witnessing unprecedented jump in pump prices of petrol and diesel as auto fuel rates, which are linked to their respective international benchmarks, are moving northward unabated in the last 52 days. Due to a spike in international oil rates, petrol and diesel have become costlier by ₹7.36 and ₹7.57 per litre, respectively, since May 4.Prices of the two fuels are breaking their own record almost every day as petrol breached the ₹100 mark in various cities across the country, particularly in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana and Laddakh. Fuel was costliest in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar, where petrol was sold at ₹108.94 per litre and diesel at ₹101.48 a litre on Thursday.Pradhan discussed recent oil market developments with Barkindo, the spokesperson said. The minister “reiterated his request of phasing out production cuts and also emphasised that crude prices should remain within a reasonable band, which will be in the collective interests of both consumers and producers and will encourage a consumption-led recovery,” he added.One of the key reasons for high domestic fuel rates is production curbs by the oil cartel. OPEC and its allies, including Russia (together known as OPEC+) on April 12 last year announced an unprecedented 9.7 million barrel per day cut in oil output, a 10th of the global output, from May 1, 2020, but did not adhere to the planned restoration of the supply.Output cut was initiated when international oil rates fell below $20 a barrel in April last year. Benchmark Brent crude on April 21, 2020 fell to $19.33 a barrel. It, however, rose to over $50 per barrel in early 2021. With rising demand and supply constraints, oil prices hit $75.78 a barrel on Thursday intraday trade, while WTI (West Texas Intermediate) hit a session high of $73.61 and was trading close to its highest in almost three years.India imported 227 million metric tonnes (MMT) of crude worth $101.4 billion in 2019-20 and about 78% of that came from OPEC countries, which include Algeria, Angola, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-asks-opec-to-restore-oil-supply-to-calm-inflation-101624561191131.html
25-06-2021||India||Delta variant bypassed immunity, triggered repeat infections: Study||Delta grew to become the dominant variant in India due to its improved ability to jump to new hosts and by wiping resisting the large parts of population immunity in people from the first wave of Covid-19, a new study awaiting peer view has suggested, reporting finding that show the unique set of mutations makes the virus more infective, leads to higher viral load in people and causes larger outbreak clusters.The findings are by researchers in India and India, and takes into account outbreak patterns among healthcare workers in three Indian cities, and lab analysis of how the variant reacts to antibodies as well as the way in which the virus infects human cells, particularly in the lungs.The study made several crucial findings, some of which, to be sure, have also been reflected in real world data coming from the UK. The researchers included scientists from Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in collaboration with Cambridge University’s Gupta Lab.“The main finding of the paper is that the Delta variant has a good immune escape potential as shown in the lab. It also quickly replaced other variants and caused most of the breakthrough infections (infection after complete vaccination) in healthcare workers. For the people, what this means is that we have to be very cautious and behave appropriately, especially now that we are also seeing cases of Delta Plus. We still do not know anything about its immune escape potential. The studies have just started,” said Dr Rajesh Pandey, one of the authors of the paper and senior scientist at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology.“Delta variant has the maximum transmissibility yet seen, and reduces neutralisation protection from previous infections and vaccines,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, one of the authors of the study and the director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology.The mathematical model based on cases and deaths reported from Mumbai showed that by the end of January, there was a 2% increase in the transmissibility of the Delta variant against all others in circulation, and a 32% increase in immune evasion from a previous infection (if the researchers assumed that there was 30% under-reporting of deaths). The proportions go up if the assumption is 50% and 70% under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths.“We find that Delta is both more transmissible and better able to evade prior immunity elicited by previous infection compared to previously circulating lineages. While there is substantial uncertainty in our estimates, we find that in Mumbai, the Delta variant was 10% to 40% more transmissible than previously circulating lineages, and able to evade 20 to 55% of the immune protection provided by prior infection with non-Delta virus,” said a tweet from the collaborating Gupta Lab from Cambridge University.The in-vitro, or laboratory studies, looked at sensitivity of the variants of concern to neutralising antibodies from a previous infection by the virus that originated in Wuhan. It showed that Alpha variant, seen first in the UK, was 2.3 fold less sensitive and, Beta -- seen first in South Africa -- was 8.2 fold less sensitive as compared to 5.7 fold for Delta variant.The researchers also found that Delta variant had a replication advantage over Alpha variant in the lab. The researchers also found that when samples of over 100 healthcare workers from three Delhi hospitals who got breakthrough infections were sequenced, most of them were caused by the Delta variant.“However, by the time a significant proportion of the healthcare workers were fully vaccinated, Delta variant was the most common variant in circulation, accounting for 60% of cases. So, that could also be the reason why most breakthrough infections were caused by delta variant,” said Dr Pandey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-variant-bypassed-immunity-triggered-repeat-infections-study-101624561130559.html

Now Shakun Singh, wife of the late former MLA Ajit Singh, will be the party candidate for the district panchyat chairperson,” Rawat said in a statement. The party’s decision came after the rape victim appealed to President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath in this regard. She thanked the PM and CM on Thursday for instantly dropping Singh’s name as the candidate for chairmanship.On Wednesday night, Rawat had declared that Arun Singh, who is the son-in-law of state minister Ranvendra Pratap Singh, would be the party’s candidate for the zila panchayat chairperson’s post from Unnao.After the announcement, Singh even came to the district BJP office where he was felicitated by some party workers on Thursday. But the scenario changed after the Unnao rape victim’s appeal to the top BJP leadership.In her appeal, the rape victim said that Arun Singh was one of the co-accused in the case registered in connection with the accident involving her car on July 28, 2019, in which her two aunts were killed while she and her lawyer were critically injured. Claiming he was being framed, Singh had that the Central Bureau of Investigation, which was probing the case, had given him a clean chit. He said he would write to the state government against those who had dragged his name into the controversy. The BJP had in April replaced Kuldeep Sengar’s wife Sangeeta as the party candidate for the zila panchayat ward member 22 after a similar uproar against her candidature. On Thursday, shortly before the UP BJP chief ordered the Unnao district unit to replace Singh, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said, “I think the party would be taking an appropriate decision.” Earlier, in a viral video, the rape victim had alleged that local BJP functionaries were supporting those who were plotting to eliminate her.She had said that her complaints against her abuse were not acted upon by the police due to the influence of Sengar, a four-time lawmaker.Sengar, a former BJP MLA from Unnao’s Bangarmau seat, was accused of rape by the victim in 2017. A Delhi court had sentenced Sengar to life imprisonment in the case in December 2019.In March 2020, a special court sentenced Sengar, his brother Atul Singh and five others to 10 years’ imprisonment in two cases linked to the death of the Unnao rape victim’s father in 2018.Kuldeep Sengar was expelled from the BJP and disqualified as member of state assembly after the trial court convicted him.Meanwhile, Shakun Singh thanked the party for her nomination. “I am grateful to the leadership,” she said.The election for the zila panchayat chairperson would be held on July 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-replaces-zilla-parishad-chief-candidate-after-unnao-rape-victim-s-objection-101624561011202.html
25-06-2021||India||Two NHRC teams arrive in Bengal to probe post-poll violence complaints||A team constituted by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) visited a part of North 24 Parganas district in south Bengal on Wednesday to probe allegations of post-poll violence while a second team arrived in north Bengal in the afternoon. Police officers aware of the development said the NHRC teams, which are part of a committee, will be touring parts of north and south Bengal over the next few days.There are seven people in the committee, including a member of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission and a member of the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority.On June 21, the Calcutta high court’s five-judge bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal dismissed a petition by the West Bengal government seeking recall of the June 18 order that asked the NHRC to probe allegations of human rights violation during alleged violence after the recent assembly polls.The NHRC was asked to submit its report before the court by June 30, the next date of hearing.Hours later, the NHRC constituted a seven-member panel to “enquire into complaints of post-poll violence in West Bengal” and told the panel to identify people who were prima facie responsible for the violence and the officers who maintained a “calculated silence”.The committee is led by Rajiv Jain, the former Intelligence Bureau chief who assumed charge as NHRC member on June 2, a statement by the human rights body said. The committee also comprises National Commission for Minorities vice-chairman Atif Rasheed, National Commission for Women member Rajulben L Desai, NHRC’s (director) investigation Santosh Mehra and DIG (investigation) Manzil Saini, West Bengal Human Rights Commission registrar Pradip Kumar Panja and West Bengal State Legal Services Authority member secretary Raju Mukherjee.The high court, which heard several petitions on the violence that erupted after the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) won the state elections, ordered on June 18 that the NHRC has to constitute the committee. The state government rushed to the high court the following day with a review petition, requesting the five judges to recall their order.The judges heard out the state government on Monday but were not convinced. The bench made a pointed reference to complaints of police inaction and observed that the conduct of the state did not inspire the confidence of the court.The court also pointed out that the NHRC received 541 complaints while the state human rights commission did not receive a single one.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has mounted a relentless campaign against the Mamata Banerjee government, alleging that its supporters are being targeted. The BJP has alleged that more than 30 people have been murdered and women have been raped and molested as well for supporting the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-nhrc-teams-arrive-in-bengal-to-probe-post-poll-violence-complaints-101624560892027.html
25-06-2021||India||Cong plans protests on economy, fuel price; to boost Covid outreach||The Congress party will launch nationwide protests early next month against economic issues like inflation and rising fuel prices, and rapidly expand its Covid outreach to cover 3 crore households in 30 days, a major political manoeuvre to make its presence felt on ground after losing elections in Kerala, West Bengal and Assam, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday after Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with top party officials.Gandhi, in her opening address at the meeting with the party’s general secretaries, state in-charges and state leadership, referred extensively to the Covid pandemic. She stressed that it was “absolutely essential that our party plays an active role” to ensure full vaccination coverage and encourages people to register for the jabs. In addition, the Congress should also continue to put pressure on the Narendra Modi government to treble the daily rate of vaccination to ensure at least 75% of India’s population is inoculated at the end of 2021.Gandhi also spoke about the “intolerable burden being imposed by rising fuel prices” and how “prices of many other essential commodities like pulses and edible oils too have skyrocketed causing wide-spread distress.”The Congress followed up the concern, announcing that it will launch a 10-day-long nationwide agitation from July 7 with programmes at block, district and state levels. The party’s frontal organizations will also step up. A cycle yatra at district levels, march and processions at state level and even a signature campaign at petrol pumps to demand reduction of prices of petrol and diesel would be part of this programme.The Congress hasn’t been able to carry out “political activities” due to Covid restrictions and needs to get back in the game. a senior Congress leader said.“We did campaign in the recent assembly elections, but round-the-year movements were missing. And in some states, lack of opposition activities has been a key reason for electoral losses,” said the leader who was present at Thursday’s meeting.The Congress’ Covid care campaign, which asks each volunteer to reach out to more than 200 households every day for a month, is targeted to cover 7,199 blocks and 7,935 towns across the country’s 736 districts. This is a part of the plan detailed in a circular by general secretary organization KC Venugopal reported by HT on Thursday.In the urban and semi-urban areas, the party wants to approach “auto/battery and cycle rickshaw drivers, plumbers, electricians, gardeners, mechanics, domestic workers, slum dwellers, delivery boys and street vendors” under its covid care programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-plans-protests-on-economy-fuel-price-to-boost-covid-outreach-101624560830603.html
25-06-2021||India||Covid-19: Shots for 60+ group hit hesitancy hurdle||The pace of vaccination among people above the age of 60 has fallen 75% from peak levels despite more than half the population in this age group yet to be administered even a single shot – igniting fears of vaccine hesitancy hampering the coverage of the population group most vulnerable to Covid-19.According to data shared by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Thursday, a little over 66 million (66,161,004) of the population above 60 years of age has received their first dose so far. Based on projections of population by the Census of India for 2021, there are an estimated 138 million people above 60. This means that around 52% of the country’s elderly are yet to receive a single shot – a massive proportion for an age group that has been eligible for shots for nearly four months now.But the worrying aspect of this trend is the drop in the pace of vaccination in this age group.The seven-day average of first dose administration among elderly peaked for the week ending March 27, when 1.48 million people got their shots every day on average. Through April and May, as the drive progressed, the number of new people above the age of 60 years getting shots started dwindling. By mid-May, this number dropped to 113,906 shots a day on average (for the week ending May 16), the lowest ever. And while it has inched up slowly since then (376,948 people above the age of 60 have got their first shots in the past week), it remains 75% below peak levels.Experts said vaccine hesitancy appears to be the main reason for this drop, as those who wanted to get their shots did so as soon as they could, but the remaining people appear to be staying away from vaccination centres. A rework of vaccination strategy may be needed to deal with this issue, they said.“The rush definitely has gone down of the elderly and it is largely younger people that are coming to get vaccinated... If 50% or so are still left in this population group, then we really need to reassess our approach,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals. “Those among the elderly who have been left could either be those who cannot travel for some reason, or those who are hesitant to get jabbed. To manage this, requires a two-pronged strategy that includes providing vaccination at their doorstep for those who cannot travel, and to change the communication strategy to allay their concerns about safety,” he added.Vaccine hesitancy and patchy supplies are the primary concerns that people involved in the vaccination process have had to deal with, and Union health ministry has been issuing advisories to look at ways through which hesitancy can be effectively dealt with.“Certain challenges are foreseen that needs to be countered well in time. These may include the challenge of ensuring over 1.3 billion people in India receive factual and timely information and updates on vaccine roll-out progress and benefits, public’s anxiety and queries ... apprehension about the vaccines ... and fear of adverse events, misconception about vaccine efficacy, rumours and negative narrative…,” said ahealth ministry guideline on vaccine hesitancy.Also read | Pfizer says its vaccine highly effective against Delta variantTo address these probable challenges, the Centre has asked states to have in place an integrated 360-degree comprehensive advocacy communication and social mobilisation strategy in place, to include mechanisms by which four key areas around vaccination introduction, vaccine eagerness and hesitancy can be handled.“As part of the measures, information education communication material was asked to be distributed among target population to send out the right message, and alley their fears regarding vaccination. Volunteers were trained to go into community for conducting awareness generation campaigns among the target population, among other activities,” said a government official aware of the developments, on condition of anonymity.Experts, however, say that the Centre needs to draft an evidence-based communication strategy to address hesitancy in a more targeted age-based approach.“Since it is clear that there is huge vaccine hesitancy among this group, we need to get to the actual reasons behind it and then look for ways to tackle it. The government should hire a professional agency that understands communication to generate data on reasons behind vaccine hesitancy among different age groups as the reason for being hesitant may not be the same in all age groups,” said Dr Chandrakant Lahiriya, senior public health and vaccine expert.“Not just age-level, there should also be subgroups such as rural and urban as people in these groups may have different reasons for not coming out to get vaccinated. The data that is generated like this should be used to draft targeted, evidence-based communication strategy for their messaging to be more effective,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shots-for-60-group-hit-hesitancy-hurdle-101624559391650.html
25-06-2021||India||Mamata case judge reminisces of days as lawyer, reserves order||Calcutta high court judge Kausik Chanda on Thursday observed that he was put on a “media trial” for his association with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) prior to judgeship, and reserved the order on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s plea that he drop out from hearing her petition against BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari’s election win in Nandigram.Banerjee was present in the court through video conferencing, as per the requirement under the Representation of People Act to present her election petition seeking re-evaluation of the Nandigram assembly poll results. The Trinamool Congress chief lost by a margin of less than 2,000 votes to her former aide though her party stormed to a massive victory to retain power.The judge did not specify the date of the verdict on Banerjee’s plea for his recusal.The 90-minute hearing in the high court saw an intriguing debate between justice Chanda and senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for Banerjee, and claimed that there was overwhelming material to show that the judge had been “an active member of BJP” and held a “deeply personal, professional and ideological association” with the party.Justice Chanda, during the proceedings, not only expressed his displeasure against Banerjee’s counsel for not citing “likelihood of bias” when the matter first came up before his court on June 18, but also quipped repeatedly about how he helped BJP in several legal wrangles before the high court when he was a lawyer.While Singhvi took justice Chanda through various news reports and photographs mentioning him as a counsel for BJP in political cases relating to permission for Amit Shah’s rally, and the conduct of panchayat polls in 2014, the judge retorted: “When I look back at these cases as a lawyer, it fills me up with joy that I appeared in these important cases. After Amit Shah’s rally was allowed by the high court, I was one of the last ones to join the rally in front of the Victoria House in Kolkata. I was given a grand welcome with garlands and applause. All newspapers in the state carried my name and photograph too.”As Singhvi continued showing the newspaper clippings, mostly from between 2010 and 2014 when justice Chanda was appearing for the BJP before the Calcutta high court, the judge recollected that the BJP was not a popular party in the state when he was initially representing it.“I can still remember the first matter when I appeared for the BJP. I told the division bench that I was appearing for Bharatiya Janata Party. The bench asked me twice – which party. I had to repeat – BJP. In those days, it was beyond the imagination of the high court that anybody from BJP would come to them,” he said.The high court judge also told Singhvi that the BJP got its first major publicity in West Bengal after it jumped in the fray in support of the state election commission, which was batting for panchayat polls in the state before the high court. “Anandabazar Patrika (newspaper) carried the BJP’s name on its front page...you are now showing me reports of Hindustan Times and Times of India too. I did not know national newspapers also carried this.”Singhvi conceded that BJP has come a long way and made great strides since 2010. The senior lawyer then proceeded to read out social media posts from TMC leader Derek O’Brien and advocate Prashant Bhushan with photographs of justice Chanda sharing a stage with West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh when he was a lawyer. Singhvi said that justice Chanda had also attended the party’s legal cell programmes.“There are some reactions to these tweets asking if these are my photographs or they are morphed. I can confirm these are my pictures.... Mr Singhvi, are you aware of the composition and structure of BJP? How the BJP functions? I was never the chairman of the legal cell though,” the judge said.Singhvi, on his part, told the judge that individual cases come and go, and that no case should be worthy of this much controversy. “With this plethora of materials, your lordship will only be elevating your stature by recusing from this case. Recently, two judges in the Supreme Court also recused from two cases in the state. Recusal is a normal thing. It is the perception of bias that should be enough. I should not have had to argue so much,” he added.To this, the judge asked Singhvi if it was not the duty of Banerjee and her legal team to raise their objections on the first date of hearing when the case was taken up on June 18, especially because she had by then already written to the chief justice of the high court to assign the election petition to a different bench.“You don’t say a thing before me when the case is taken up. But when the judge goes back home, he finds a flurry of social media messages and tweets, creating a furore. There is already a media trial going on before the matter is taken up by this court. Hundreds of tweets are there asking me to recuse. Is it not that there is already a media trial and I can’t decide this without getting influenced? If I recuse now, will I not be giving in to this media trial?” justice Chanda asked Singhvi.Singhvi submitted that public opinion does not matter for a judicial determination but the principal issue remained of perception of bias and the controversy surrounding the judge’s links with a party in opposition. He added that the CM had earlier this year also “conveyed her objections and reservations” about justice Chanda’s confirmation as permanent judge.Justice Chanda pointed out that while Singhvi was a member of Congress, he was being assisted in this matter by senior lawyer SN Mookherjee who was from BJP while the two appeared for a TMC leader. “If you both can appear together, why cannot the judge be trusted?” the judge asked Singhvi, who replied that judges had a higher duty than the lawyers.“I am only concerned about a case that has been assigned to me and there is a recusal application filed. I will decide this legally. Let me consider this and pass the judgment. Judgment is reserved,” said justice Chanda.Justice Chanda was designated as senior advocate in June 2014. He served as an additional solicitor general of India from April 2015 to September 2019 and was elevated to the high court as an additional judge in October 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-case-judge-reminisces-of-days-as-lawyer-reserves-order-101624559390521.html
25-06-2021||India||Centre throws door open to J&K election, statehood||Prime Minister Narendra Modi met mainstream leaders from Jammu and Kashmir at a landmark meeting in Delhi on Thursday, signalling the start of political engagement in the Valley after two years despite lingering disagreement over key issues, including the restoration of the region’s special status.Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah stressed on grassroots democracy and the importance of conducting elections in J&K, stating their commitment to restoring the region’s statehood, and urging mainstream leaders to participate in the ongoing delimitation exercise, a contentious process of redrawing poll constituencies.“Our priority is to strengthen grassroots democracy in J&K. Delimitation has to happen at a quick pace so that polls can happen and J&K gets an elected government that gives strength to J&K’s development trajectory,” Modi tweeted shortly after the meeting.Shah said the Union government was committed to the “all-round development” of J&K and brought up the promise of restoring statehood.“The future of Jammu & Kashmir was discussed and the delimitation exercise and peaceful elections are important milestones in restoring statehood as promised in Parliament,” he said, referring to his statement in the Lok Sabha in February this year.The event was the first such outreach of the Union government since August 5, 2019, when it controversially voided Article 370 of the Constitution, which bestowed special status to the region, and bifurcated the erstwhile state into two Union territories. Prominent leaders were detained, all communications snapped and curfew-like restrictions imposed for months. But local sentiment remained bitterly opposed to the decision.Also read | PM Modi meets J&K leaders, says he wants to remove 'Dilli ki Duri, Dil ki Duri'Thursday’s meeting was attended by 14 leaders from Jammu & Kashmir, including four former chief ministers and prominent members from the Opposition and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Everyone agreed that the talks happened in a cordial environment.“The PM said that he wants to remove Dilli ki Doori [distance from Delhi] as well as Dil Ki Doori [distance from the heart,” said a person familiar with the happenings at the meeting who asked not to be named.But politicians from the People’s Alliance for the Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) -- a five-party alliance of parties in Kashmir -- indicated that crucial disagreements remained.Former chief minister and National Conference (NC) leader Omar Abdullah said there was a loss of trust between J&K and the Centre, and it was the Union government’s duty to plug the breach. “We told PM that we don’t stand with what was done on August 5, 2019. We’re not ready to accept it. But we won’t take the law into our hands. We will fight this in court, and hope that we’ll get justice there,” he said. A batch of petitions challenging the effective abrogation of Article 370 are pending in the Supreme Court since 2019.Abdullah also questioned the delimitation exercise, and said the NC is yet to decide if it will take part in the process.Former chief minister and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti said she told the PM that the people of J&K didn’t accept how Article 370 was nullified “unconstitutionally, illegally, and immorally”.“The people of J&K will struggle constitutionally, democratically, peacefully. Be it months or years, we will restore Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir as it is a matter of our identity. We did not get it from Pakistan, it was given to us by our country, by Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Patel,” she said.The all-party meeting appeared to have discussed four main issues: the delimitation exercise, which is currently being boycotted by NC and PDP; holding fresh elections in the state for the first time in seven years; restoring full statehood to the Union territory and development goals for the region. Reinstating Article 370 also came up.At the meeting, Modi assured that the demand for full statehood will be met but Kashmiri politicians pushed for its restoration before new elections are held, said a person aware of developments.The regional leaders were told that elections could not precede the delimitation exercise as the 2019 Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act laid down the conditions for carving out new constituencies for polls, said the person quoted above.“The home minister explained why the process of delimitation has to be completed before elections can be scheduled,” said Congress leader and former chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.Azad said the parties were assured that delimitation would be carried out after extensive consultation down to the panchayat level. There is concern in the Valley that the exercise will shift the balance of power from Kashmir to Jammu. In the current arrangement, Kashmir has 46 seats while Jammu has 37.“The next important step in the democratic process in J-K is assembly polls and we have to move to it together. For this, the delimitation process will have to be completed swiftly…all parties participating in the meeting assured to be part of the delimitation process,” Union minister Jitendra Singh said.The issue of restoration of special status was also discussed. “The parties themselves said the issue is pending in the Supreme Court,” said the person cited in the first instance.On the issue of timing of assembly elections, the person quoted above said no time limit was set for the completion of delimitation and the commission has till March 2022 to wind up the exercise.“It is unlikely that elections will be held by the end of the year as winter sets in and the process of conducting elections is not feasible. At the same time, it is unlikely that the polls will be coincided with the five-state elections in early 2022 as J&K requires additional security detail which may not be possible if there are elections scheduled elsewhere. But the final decision will rest with the election commission,” the person added.The meeting – which happened after weeks of backchannel talks by national security adviser Ajit Doval and the home ministry -- represented a sharp change in the central government’s policy and was seen as an effort to break the ice with regional parties and reset the political process in the UT.Many of the other attendees hailed the event and said the PM expressed satisfaction with the acceleration of development in the region. “Our democracy’s biggest strength is the ability to sit across a table and exchange views.

25-06-2021||India||Kabul will fall to Taliban after US leaves: Intel||US intelligence has warned that Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, will fall to the resurgent Taliban within six months of the departure of the last of US and international troops, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, days ahead of a White House meeting between President Joe Biden and top Afghan leaders Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah.The warning comes at a time there is growing international concern about terror outfit Taliban making gains in Afganistan since May 1, when the US and allied troops began leaving the country in accordance with a timeline announced by President Joe Biden for complete withdrawal by September 11 this year -- the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks that brought on the invasion of Afghanistan.India, which is a key stakeholder in Afghan reconciliation and reconstruction, called for a UN-led “permanent and comprehensive ceasefire” in Afghanistan during a UN Security Council debate on Monday, pointing specifically to the sudden escalation in violence since May 1, to “ensure immediate reduction in violence and protection of civilian lives”.The Journal report said that US intelligence experts had earlier assessed that the government of President Ghani would survive for two years after the US withdrawal. This timeline was based roughly on the time it took for the fall of Saigon in Vietnam after US withdrawal in 1975.US intelligence and military analysts have since revised their assessment and now believe that Kabul could fall in six to 12 months after the departure of American troops, the Journal reported, adding that officials in other western countries have a far worse assessment of three months.US military has planned to wound up the withdrawal process by as soon as July, going down from the 3,500 troopers currently still there to zero, barring a small force left behind for the protection of American diplomatic missions and officials.“I will say that while, in general, we are seeing elevated attacks on ANDSF (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) and Afghan government versus a year ago, we have not seen an increase in attacks on our military presence since February 2020,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesdayin response to a question about the rapid military gains posted by the Taliban.“We also assess that, had we not begun to draw down, violence would have increased against us as well after May 1, because that was what the Taliban was clearly conveying. So, the status quo, in our view, was not an option,” she said.American lawmakers are also worried by Taliban’s advances and sought assurances from US defense secretary Lloyd Austin and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff General Mark A Milley at a congressional hearing on Wednesday.Milley said, “Yes, we’re concerned we’re watching it, but there’s a 300,000 plus or minus, military force” of the Afghanistan army and the police “and it is their job to defend their country”. The Taliban control 81 of the country’s 419 district centres, but not any of the provincial capitals yet ,he added.Secretary Austin sought to address concerns expressed by lawmakers about the US’s ability to prevent Afghanistan from sliding back under the control of terrorists after the withdrawal, saying America has a “very” effective over-the-horizon capability in keeping an eye on Afghanistan, currently from partner countries in the Gulf and platforms at sea, but they are from a distance.“What we’d like to do going forward is shorten the legs that were required to utilise by getting an agreement with one of the neighbouring countries to base some of our ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) in one of those countries,” he said at the congressional hearing.Austin did not name these countries, but Pakistan may have been a leading candidate, as has been clear from repeated public protestations from Prime Minister Imran Khan, who first said that Pakistan will “absolutely not” agree to give US bases and expounded his reasons for doing so in an Oped in the Washington Post on Monday.Asked about Khan’s declarations, a State Department spokesperson told Hindustan Times, “As President Biden said, the United States will reorganise our counterterrorism capabilities and substantial assets to prevent reemergence of terrorist threats, in Afghanistan or anywhere else.The United States respects the sovereignty of other nations and their ability to make decisions about what is in the best interest of their national security.”Central Asian countries such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are considered to be among the other candidates because of their shared boundaries with Afghanistan — US had bases there once, people familiar with the region said, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s blessings might be a problem.Afghan President Ghani, who begins a visit to Washington on Thursday, has been pressing the Taliban to accept a role in some sort of interim unity government until elections can be held.But the insurgents, emboldened by their battlefield gains since May 1, appear to have little interest in further negotiation and are intent on taking full control and restoring Afghanistan to an emirate ruled by religious elders.They have recently issued several statements about how they would govern -- broadly outlined, but light on detail. And peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government remain stalled.New Delhi, too, has raised growing concerns over the recent surge in violence across Afghanistan, with external affairs minister S Jaishankar last month expressing unease about the withdrawal plan for “political expediency”.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kabul-will-fall-to-taliban-after-us-leaves-intel-101624559271299.html
25-06-2021||India||Leadership, asset split key concerns for air force on theaterisation move||The setting up of a high-powered government committee to iron out details of the theaterisation plan has turned the spotlight on the Indian Air Force’s (IAF) traditional resistance to the setting up of integrated theatre commands, and the need to bring IAF fully on board for speedy roll-out of new joint structures, people familiar with the developments said on Thursday.The panel was set up last week after a lack of consensus on the theaterisation model emerged earlier this month during a key meeting of top government officials who reviewed a draft Cabinet note on the new joint structures.Theaterisation has the full backing of the government, and it expects chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat to bring about jointness among the three services by January 2023.IAF has been arguing in favour of having only one single theatre as its assets are inadequate for more than one such construct, said one of the persons cited above, on condition of anonymity. Several top IAF officers and former chiefs have backed the one-theatre argument.Terming a theatre as land-centric or martime-centric essentially “treats airpower as an adjunct rather than a joint partner in war-fighting,” he said.But some experts point out that the three services cannot work in silos any longer, and air defence is integral to fighting future wars in an era of standalone aerial weapons such as armed UAVs, rockets, missiles, and swarm drones.The air force also has reservations about the division of its air assets, nomenclature of commands, leadership of theatre commands and dilution of powers of chiefs, as reported by HT on June 21. Put simply, it fears key commands will be led by army generals.“Deliberations are on to remove differences and build consensus. Theaterisation will be carried out within the prescribed timeline,” a top official said.IAF’s opposition to theaterisation also stems from its belief that it has the speed, reach and potential to project military power across geographies without being confined to theatres.“The operational tempo of the army and navy is relatively slow as compared to the reach and speed of the IAF which is many times faster. Fighter planes can be quickly deployed and redeployed for missions anywhere,” said the first person.A former IAF chief publicly flagged concerns over theaterisation three years ago. In April 2018, then IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa disapproved of the concept of theatre commands, arguing it would require the creation of more assets. “Compartmentalising will require more assets. We believe in one country, one theatre,” Dhanoa said. The IAF currently has 30 combat squadrons with 16-18 fighters each, compared to a sanctioned strength of 44.While IAF’s resistance to the concept of theaterisation was well known, an explicit acknowledgment of that opposition by a serving chief was then seen as rare. In December 2018, then navy chief Admiral Sunil Lanba, who was also the chairman of the chiefs of staff committee (COSC) at that time, acknowledged that the IAF was opposed to the creation of theatre commands.A senior IAF official, who did not want to be named, said the air force can operate from anywhere and carry out any mission assigned to it demonstrated three years ago during Exercise Gaganshakti-2018 that saw the IAF move its assets from the western to the eastern front in less than 48 hours.“Fighter planes can take off from a base in south India, hit targets in the Bay of Bengal and land in the east. Division of assets under the current theaterisation model will rob the IAF of its flexibility,” the official said.IAF is down to barely 30 squadrons and it’s not a good time to split its assets, said Air Marshal Anil Chopra (retd), director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “India should have a single military theatre considering the threat it faces from the Western Theatre Command of China that covers a geographical area larger than the size of India. More deliberations are required between the services for creating a robust system,” Chopra said.But theaterisation is also how the forces of most countries, including the US and China are organised. It has obvious advantages: better command and control, faster decision making and superior cross-service synergy, and India is very keen on it.No service should feel that they will have an upper hand or become subordinate to another service, said Lieutenant General DB Shekatkar (retd), who headed a top committee that recommended the appointment of CDS and creation of theatre commands in a comprehensive report on military reforms submitted in December 2016.“Such thinking does not reflect sound national strategic thinking. We should all be mature enough to take India’s long-term interests into account,” he said.Rawat on Tuesday said new reforms do face hurdles, but the three services were in agreement on taking theaterisation forward. He said hurdles were necessary as they underscored the need for holding more discussions to fine-tune plans.In March, Rawat said India’s military leadership will have to “more than match the political vision” that has mandated the creation of theatre commands to address future security threats. He said “service parochialism” will have to make way for “a combined services outlook” to take theaterisation forward, calling for the military’s transformation to “outthink and outfight” India’s adversaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leadership-asset-split-key-concerns-for-air-force-on-theaterisation-move-101624559270502.html
25-06-2021||India||HC pulls up Uttarakhand on Covid-19 deaths data||The Uttarakhand high court has called into question the state government’s Covid death figures and said it cannot accept them. The government had submitted a death audit in court on Wednesday following the HC’s June 9 directive.Uttarakhand has so far reported over 3.39 lakh Covid cases and 7,068 deaths. Of these deaths, 978 were ‘backlog’ deaths or deaths that were reported late by hospitals.A division bench comprising Justice R S Chauhan and Justice Alok Verma punched holes in the state government’s report on the ground that the reason of death given by the chief medical officer of Almora for all 111 cases for the month of May was identical – ‘cardiopulmonary arrest’ or heart attack.“It is rather surprising that 111 persons have died due to the same cause…Moreover, if the report is supposed to mean that the heart had stopped functioning, it is common knowledge that a dead body does not contain a beating heart,” the court observed.It added that the cause of death is suspicious, so the court cannot accept the “veracity and validity of such documents”.HT has seen a copy of the order.The court also said that it had asked for the death audit to be accompanied by death certificates, but the order hasn’t been complied with. “Furthermore, it has not even been informed by the government as to how many persons have died of Covid-19 in the wake of the second wave…” the court said.The court was hearing a bunch of petitions covering different aspects about the fight against Covid-19 in Uttarakhand filed by individuals named Sachdanand Dabral, Dushyant Mainali, Anu Pant and Rajendra Arya.Anoop Nautiyal, founder of an NGO named Social Development for Communities Foundation (SDC), said there has been a lot of ambiguity about the Covid fatalities in the state with some hospitals delaying their reports. He said the backlog deaths were all reported between October 17, 2020, and June 23, 2021.He also doubted the death count of Haridwar, which hosted the Mahakumbh that attracted nearly 6 million pilgrims in April. “Haridwar reported 91 Covid deaths in April and 591 in May. We need more clarity on how Haridwar, which was visited by millions of people, had just 91 deaths,” Nautiyal said while appreciating the HC for raising doubts about the government’s figures.When contacted, Abhishek Tripathi, nodal officer for Covid in Uttarakhand, said the issues raised by the HC will be looked into and a reply will be filed in court.On Wednesday, while questioning the state government’s preparedness to check the spread of the pandemic and the Delta plus variant, HC directed the state government to file a detailed affidavit in this regard by July 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-pulls-up-u-khand-on-covid-deaths-data-101624559030444.html
25-06-2021||India||As part of SCO framework: India proposes plan against Pak terror groups||National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval proposed an action plan against Pakistan-based terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) as part of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) framework. He said this during the meeting of national security chiefs in Tajikistan’s capital Dushanbe on Wednesday.Doval also said that there is a need to monitor new technologies used by terrorists, including drones for smuggling of weapons, and misuse of the Dark Web, artificial intelligence, blockchain and social media.Strongly condemning terrorism in all forms and manifestations, the NSA emphasised on the need for full implementation of United Nations resolutions and targeted sanctions against designated terrorist individuals and entities. He said perpetrators of terrorism including cross-border terror attacks should be expeditiously brought to justice.He also said that there is a need to preserve gains made in last two decades in Afghanistan and give top priority to the welfare of its people. “India fully supports SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan, which should be more active,” said Doval.“Though India became SCO Member in 2017, it has physical, spiritual, cultural and philosophical inter-linkages for centuries with countries that now make up SCO,” Doval further said.On the sidelines of the meeting of SCO’s national security chiefs, Doval had a long meeting with Russian NSA Nikolai Patrushev. They discussed contemporary developments of bilateral, regional and global significance.The two leaders also exchanged their views on the evolving situation in Afghanistan and the Asia-Pacific region during the meeting.The Beijing-based SCO is an eight-member economic and security bloc and has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations.India and Pakistan became its permanent members in 2017.The SCO was founded at a summit in Shanghai in 2001 by the Presidents of Russia, China and the four Central Asian countries of Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-part-of-sco-framework-india-proposes-plan-against-pak-terror-groups-101624558970444.html
25-06-2021||India||Twitter executive gets HC relief from arrest in Ghaziabad case||The Karnataka High Court on Thursday gave interim protection from arrest to Twitter India executive Manish Maheshwari in relation to a FIR that has been filed by the Uttar Pradesh police over a video showing an attack on a Muslim man in Ghaziabad. The police’s claim is that the video was manipulated to present a skewed communal narrative, and it was amplified by its spread on Twitter.The court also said that the police could “communicate” with Maheshwari by “virtual mode”, which saves the Twitter executive the trouble of appearing before the police in person as he was asked to. Maheshwari was expected to visit Loni Kotwali in Ghaziabad on Thursday at 10.30 am.“He did not arrive, and we came to know that he moved high court. So, we will now wait for the...directions of the court on the next date of hearing. In case the petitioner (Maheshwari) wishes to come on his own, he can come and give his statements to the police,” said Atul Kumar Sonkar, circle officer of Loni.Maheshwari’s argument is that he is an employee of Twitter India, not responsible for circulating the video, nor uploading it, and in charge of sales and advertising in the region.“The order is no coercive action; let not the investigation be hampered; and the IO (Investigating Officer) is at liberty to record his (Maheshwari’s) statement through video conferencing after keeping him informed beforehand,” CV Nagesh, the senior counsel who appeared on behalf of Maheshwari told Hindustan Times.Nagesh said that on June 17, the investigating officer issued a notice under section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to the Managing Director of Twitter India but the fact is that Maheshwari is not managing director.Twitter India did not respond to mails and texts from Hindustan Times seeking comment. This is Maheshwari’s second brush with the law in recent weeks. In late May, he was questioned by the Delhi police’s special cell over the company tagging the post of BJP leader Sambit Patra “manipulated media”. That tweet spoke of a Congress social media campaign orchestrated to show the government in bad light. The Congress claimed this “toolkit” was forged. The police have said that because Twitter tagged the tweet “manipulated media” it must have some information on it. Maheshwari’s defence in that incident too is the same -- that he is not responsible for such tagging.According to Nagesh, a notice under section 160 can be issued by the investigator for a cognizable crime for securing the presence of a person as a witness in the prosecution.Maheshwari responded to this notice , pointing out he was only an employee and knew nothing of this case but offering to appear before the investigating authorities and record his statement through VC as he was in Bengaluru.“Then in the next two days, the investigator issued a notice under 41(A) ” Nagesh said.“Clarification given by you is inappropriate. Being the MD of Twitter in India, you are the representative of the company. Therefore, you are bound by the Indian law to cooperate in the investigation,” the notice sent by the police said, Hindustan Times reported on Thursday.“But the rider for the issuance of 41(a) is only against a person against whom the crime has been registered or suspected to have been involved in the commissioning of the crime . Otherwise they can’t issue a notice,” Nagesh said.The senior counsel stated that Maheshwari was willing to travel to Uttar Pradesh if the counsel representing the state gives an undertaking to the Karnataka HC that they will not arrest him.The case will next be heard on June 29 in Karnataka HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-executive-gets-hc-relief-from-arrest-in-ghaziabad-case-101624558910466.html
25-06-2021||India||HC seeks DRDO, Centre replies on Covid-19 drug||The Madras high court on Thursday directed the Centre to respond by Friday and explain why the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has tied up with only Dr Reddy’s Laboratory in Hyderabad to develop the 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a drug for Covid-19 treatment. The court wondered why the DRDO has not issued licences to other reputed labs to augment production of the oral drug since studies have shown that it is effective against all Covid-19 variants. Besides DRDO, the high court also sought a response from the ministry of defence and the Union health ministry. Justices N Kirubakaran and T V Thamilsevli issued the interim direction based on a public interest litigation (PIL) that contended that a monopoly over this drug would not be wise when lakhs of lives were being lost in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The petitioner, D Saravanan from Chennai, stated that it was ‘shocking’ that the licence for manufacturing was granted only to Dr Reddy’s after the Drug Controller General of India had authorised the 2-DG drug for emergency use as adjunct therapy for moderate to severely affected patients. Developed by DRDO’s Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, the lab planned to price it at ₹990 per sachet containing 2.34 grams. He insisted that it should be manufactured on war-footing. The drug comes in a powder form packed in a sachet. Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan had in May released the first batch of the 2-DG drug. The petition sought to urge DRDO to share the technical know-how for the production of the drug, the licence to be granted to multiple pharmaceutical companies, and to ensure that the pricing is affordable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-seeks-drdo-health-ministry-response-on-only-1-lab-to-produce-covid-19-drug-101624541449532.html

25-06-2021||India||CBI books 18 policemen in 1994 Isro fake spy case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday filed a First Information Report (FIR) against former Kerala police chief Sibi Mathew, former Intelligence Bureau deputy director R B Sreekumar and 16 other police personnel over an alleged conspiracy to frame Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Nambi Narayanan in a 1994 espionage case.The filing of the FIR comes two months after the Supreme Court ordered CBI to investigate the conspiracy behind the framing, calling the matter “serious” and requiring“deeper investigation” into the role of the officers responsible. It accepted the report of a committee constituted by the court in 2018 to probe the circumstances that led to the framing. Narayanan, 79, was arrested in 1994 in the alleged espionage case. He was exonerated two years later following a CBI closure report.The accused police personnel have been charged with conspiracy, framing of false evidence, and illegal custody. “As per the directions of the Supreme Court, the agency has registered a case against 18 persons,” CBI spokesman R C Joshi said.Narayanan said the country suffered badly due to the case. “The cryogenic project (of ISRO) was delayed. Let conspiracy come out,” he said.Some of the accused said they were not heard by the Supreme Court-appointed Jain Commission. “I will move the court,” said S Vijayan, who is among the accused and allegedly tortured Narayanan in police custody.Sreekumar, a former Gujarat cadre India Police Service officer who was on deputation with the Intelligence Bureau when the case surfaced, has said he had no role in it. HT could not reach Sreekumar for his comments on the FIR.Mathew said he was not heard by the Jain Commission. “Hope the CBI will give me enough time to put forward my contention,” said Mathew.Police arrested Narayanan and Sasikumaran Nair after their numbers were found in a dairy recovered from two Maldivian women arrested in 1994 on charges of overstaying in the country. Narayanan and Nair were later charged with espionage before they were acquitted in 1995 after a CBI inquiry.The Supreme Court ordered compensation for Narayanan and constituted the committee that recommended a central agency probe the conspiracy angle.The state government paid ₹1.80 crore to Narayanan as compensation. He was decorated with the country’s third-highest civilian honour, Padma Bhushan, in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-books-18-police-personnel-in-isro-spy-case-101624535507062.html

Last Sunday, the high court granted interim bail to Sultana and she appeared before Kavaratti police. The administration informed the court that the filmmaker was advised to stay in home quarantine except when called for interrogation. It said Sultana met people and talked to the media during her stay, flouting Covid-19 norms. She also visited the panchayat office and attended some functions, it said. “The violation of quarantine norms after giving assurance to the nodal officer shows that she has no respect for the law of the land and legal obligations,” said the administration’s petition, adding that Sultana had abused the protection granted to her by the high court. It requested the court to consider this while hearing her anticipatory bail application.Two days ago, Lakshadweep collector Askar Ali had also warned Sultana for allegedly flouting Covid protocol. But she said she was only accompanied by her lawyer while appearing for questioning, as permitted by the court. On June 11, the Kavaratti police registered a case against her under sections 124 (A) (sedition) and 153 (B) (acts against national interests) of the Indian Penal Code. The FIR was based on the complaint of Lakshadweep BJP president C Abdul Khadar Haji that in a debate on a Malayalam news channel, Sultana called the Union Territory administrator, Praful Khoda Patel, as a bio-weapon. While Haji said her words were in a bad taste, Sulatana expressed regret over her words. Both Lakshadweep administration and the Union government opposed her bail plea, her words were used by many foreign journals to show the country in a poor light.Residents of the archipelago have been protesting against the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (2021) that includes developing the islands as a major tourist destination, saying that the changes “will affect unique culture and tradition” of the island. They allege it will destroy the islands’ character and identity since 97% of the islands are covered by pristine forests and 95% of its Muslim population belongs to the protected scheduled tribe category. Many parliamentarians, former bureaucrats, artists and cine actors have described the draft regulations as “arbitrary” and aimed against the majority community of the islands. Earlier this week, the high court stayed two regulations -- closing down of dairy units and removal of meat from the midday meal scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/filmmaker-violated-covid-protocol-lakshadweep-administration-tells-hc-101624531366582.html

25-06-2021||Today's||Investigating gender disparities in India’s vaccine rollout||While less than 20% of India’s adult population has received their first Covid-19 vaccine dose, clear gender disparities have arisen in the rollout. A recent analysis by Ashoka University shows that for every 100 men, around 86 women were vaccinated. This is significantly lower than India’s sex ratio of approximately 924 women per 1,000 men. In only three states, women have received equal or higher vaccine shots than men: Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala. Union Territories including Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Jammu and Kashmir, and Chandigarh, and states such as Delhi fare poorly. As the vaccination programme continues, addressing these gaps is an urgent priority.When India started its vaccination drive, women comprised a majority of recipients because of their roles in frontline work. However, as the general population started getting vaccinated, these numbers began reversing, with more men being vaccinated. In April alone, 2.4 million fewer women were vaccinated than men.Also Read | Prostate cancer drug may improve Covid-19 survival: StudyHow did we get here?A primary barrier to getting women vaccinated is the limited understanding of the disparate impacts Covid-19 vaccines have on them. While few clinical trials capture the sex-differentiated impacts, those that exist suggest that women experience more frequent and more severe adverse effects post-immunisation.Stories of what might happen post-vaccination reflect the fallacies on the ground. In a study released recently by the Self-Employed Women’s Association, poor women expressed their fears of how the vaccine might inject a virus into them and disable them from using the only asset they have – their health. There are also concerns about the effects on pregnant women, menstrual cycles, and fertility rates. Many public health researchers rue the lack of data on the gendered impacts of the vaccine, making it harder to pass on accurate information on the vaccine’s after-effects.The digital divide worsens the prospects for women seeking vaccinations. The reliance on online registrations (in English only) ignores the lack of access to digital devices and the internet among women. In rural areas, only 33.9% of women have used the internet compared to 55.6% of men, according to the National Family Health Survey-5. Further, only 54.8% of women have their own mobile phone, with far less owning a smartphone.Mobility restrictions further impede women seeking health services, as they tend to rely on male members of the household to accompany them. The burden of unpaid care work also dissuades women from travelling long distances to health clinics. Some women hesitate to get vaccinated by male health workers, stemming from cultural and religious norms. The lockdown has also prevented health workers from bringing elderly women to wait in long queues in vaccination centres.But there is a larger narrative around gender-based inequalities within households and the social norms that structure them. Previous studies show gender gaps in the immunisation of children in India. In a study tracking immunisation rates for male and female siblings, fewer females were immunised when compared to their male siblings. Since the comparison is between children in the same household, the study concluded that the gap cannot be due to household factors that drive immunisation (e.g. poverty or access) and, therefore, could be explained by intra-household gender inequalities. Unfortunately, we are not collecting data on intra-household Covid-19 vaccination rates to confirm this hypothesis.At IWWAGE, we are exploring the links between existing gender inequalities and vaccine coverage. Using data from the government’s CoWin dashboard, we found that states with a higher percentage of female vaccinations are likely to have lower poverty levels, higher female education levels, and a higher share of women reporting intra-household bargaining power.Two indicators stand out. First, the share of vaccinated women is positively correlated with women’s labour force participation rates, and negatively with the share of women not working due to household care work. Second, the political involvement of women in Panchayati Raj Institutions matters as well. Our findings suggest that states performing better on gender outcomes are more likely to have higher female vaccination rates.So what can be done?First, vaccine delivery must account for women’s barriers to information, digital access, and mobility. Greater engagement with community organisations in planning and targeting women, along with effectively communicating with them can help identify barriers and dispel misinformation.Second, vaccinations drives should be planned based on context-specific needs and preferences of women.Third, India needs to rely on its overstretched female frontline health staff to ensure the vaccine’s rollout. But to do so, it must ensure that they are vaccinated, trained, and adequately remunerated.Fourth, sex-disaggregated data needs to be collected to better target vaccines for those in need. On the CoWin dashboard, data on sex has not been reported for nearly 20% of those vaccinated until May. If India were to exclude this population, the share of women receiving the vaccine dips further to 74 women per 100 men.Above all, we must recognise that improving gender equality on other fronts can improve gender-balanced vaccination efforts. Without this, women will continue to face a disproportionate burden of the pandemic, threatening India’s much-needed recovery.Soumya Kapoor Mehta and Steven Walker work at the Initiative for What Works to Advance Women and Girls in the Economy (IWWAGE), an initiative of LEAD at Krea UniversityThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/investigating-gender-disparities-in-india-s-vaccine-rollout-101624626595289.html
25-06-2021||Today's||Challenging patriarchy in religion||When the pujari (priest) at the Durga temple in Nalluthevanpatti village, Madurai, fell ill and could no longer perform the ritual pujas, his only child, a daughter, Pinniyakkal, stepped up. Two years later, when he died in 2006, she staked her claim to be the full-time pujari, a hereditary position at that temple.The local populace was appalled. Even though the temple deity was female, tradition dictated the pujari could only be male. So, Pinniyakkal went to court. Agreeing with her claim, Justice K Chandru of the Madras high court ruled: “The altars of the God must be free from gender bias.”Some 15 years later, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)’s state minister of temple administration announced earlier this week that women — and non-Brahmins — can apply for positions as temple priests, provided they have undergone training in “agama sastra”, the manual that lays down rituals of prayer and worship. “Women must be given opportunities to participate in every sphere of life, whether spiritual or material,” Justice Chandru, who retired in 2013, said to me on the phone.Also Read | In their quest for power, UP’s Brahmins keep parties guessing about 2022The idea of women and non-Brahmin priests is not new. In 2006, the DMK set up training centres for non-Brahmins. In Maharashtra, training centres for women were first established in Pune and Ahmednagar. In Mumbai, Anjali Kale, now 82, founded the Rudrani Purohita Mandal in 1990 and has trained 250 women priests, including her daughter Kshama Mangesh Joglekar, who has a day job at the Life Insurance Corporation. “I sought her out because I believe that if women don’t support women then who will?” said Dr Manisha Nadkarni, a Mumbai-based gynaecologist who has been using Joglekar’s services for over a decade.Scholars say Hinduism does not ban women from becoming priests. But over time, patriarchal notions have seeped into some practices —prohibitions on women during “impure” menstruation, for instance. These are being challenged by younger feminists and the Sabarimala judgment that lifted the ban on women of menstruating age was hailed as a landmark in feminist jurisprudence.Women priests are adapting to changing times but are treading with caution. When couples ask Mumbai-based Anagha Mule, 70, to officiate at their weddings, they often ask her to do away with rituals they find abhorrent: The bridegroom’s feet being washed by the bride’s mother, or the kanyadaan. She is happy to accommodate those requests. “I understand that a woman is not a thing to be given away,” she said. But, if she’s asked to do puja at a home that already has a male family priest, she won’t go as she doesn’t want to take away another person’s livelihood, she added.While a growing number of women are finding acceptance as private priests who conduct rituals, they are almost never seen in the larger, public temples. Now, the Tamil Nadu government has acknowledged their right to do so. It’s not as if women are waiting to storm the breach, but the move certainly signals the beginning of the end of another male stronghold.Namita Bhandare writes on genderThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/challenging-patriarchy-in-religion-101624626355563.html
25-06-2021||Today's||After the storm, when Delhi and Kashmir meet||What leaps out first from the photograph of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi flanked by varied representatives of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), in the first such outreach since the effective abrogation of Article 370, is the sheer irony of it all. In 2019, some of these very men and women were treated not just as political pariahs; they were regarded as dangerous to law and order and placed under prolonged detention. Today, the very fact of the three-hours plus discussion — one that someone present at the meeting described as “emotional and full of pain” — is an inevitable acknowledgment of the limitations of realpolitik and past failures of both the Centre and Kashmir Valley’s mainstream. For the Modi government, the calls for a “Naya Kashmir” has paradoxically led them right back to old established political parties after a failed experiment at propping up an “alternative” regime in the form of the Apni Party and other such flirtations. This is not the first time that the imprint of intelligence agencies is seen on the political fabric of the Kashmir Valley. But after the dramatic developments of August 2019, the fact that the PM had to call this meeting is an admission that the government’s move to treat elected representatives as if they are criminals, apart from being morally questionable, brought no tangible gains at all. It has had to offer respect and legitimacy once again to the very politicians it dissed and dismissed. Also Read | Bridging Kashmir’s ‘dil ki duri’ with DelhiIn this, the government must come to terms with the fact that its bluster and aggression eventually has to be tempered with softness. For the Kashmiri politicians among the group — because the faultlines have been wrenched open in the Valley and not in Jammu — the decision to engage with those who humiliated them is not just an expression of pragmatism. It is also a tacit acknowledgment that irrespective of who leads the government in Delhi next, the special status of J&K is almost certainly never coming back. To that extent, the BJP has been able to set the boundaries within which a new framework has to be found for dialogue. Despite the maximalist articulation of demanding the restoration of Article 370, these stakeholders are far too experienced to not recognise the inevitable outcome — the middle ground will be found in giving J&K full statehood again and possibly some exceptionalism with domicile rules similar to what a few other states enjoy. The mainstream will need to confront the fact that its arrests and the unfairness with which it was treated was not able to rally popular opinion. Piecing together what was said behind closed doors, one now knows that the PM did reference the 2019-2020 detentions that lasted up to eight months, but within the larger context of the power of India’s democracy. According to those present at the meeting, Modi remarked that despite those arrests, here they all were, around the same table, talking again. This, he said, is what makes democracy so remarkable. But what also makes democracy remarkable is that within J&K, thousands of political workers have risked their lives and often paid with it, just to participate in the electoral process. Unlike the rest of us for whom a streak of indelible ink on our fingers is material for a cliched selfie, for those in the mainstream of J&K’s politics, both voting and contesting can literally be a matter of life and death. And so, among the leaders present in the room, Sajjad Lone, the first separatist to turn mainstream when he fielded proxy candidates in the watershed election of 2002, also the man who likened Modi to an elder brother, is reported to have underlined that words used by either side could be either enablers or obstacles. He is understood to have also underlined that even as the ideological quarrel over the Kashmir issue is not likely to get resolved in a hurry, other deliverables for the people of the erstwhile state should not stop. This round of dialogue should be seen perhaps as a moment of chastening all around. It is a reminder that in the ferocious contestation of dogmas, a sledgehammer only goes so far and no further. The call by the Prime Minister to end “both Dil Ki Duri and Dilli Ki Duri” is also a testimony to how the more things change, the more they remain the same. But above all, it is a calling out of the shamefully bigoted prime time hatemongers who never missed an opportunity to demonise the Kashmiri people and mainstream politicians. It is their stunned silence today that speaks volumes.

25-06-2021||Today's||Bridging Kashmir’s ‘dil ki duri’ with Delhi||Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s meeting with the leaders of various political parties from Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) is significant for several reasons.First, not a single invitee skipped or boycotted the meet. Second, this was perhaps the longest all-party meeting held on J&K in several years. The leaders spent close to four hours with the PM and his team. Third, not one of them has complained about the proceedings. On the contrary, everyone, including Mehbooba Mufti, admitted that the meeting was cordial, and they got the opportunity to candidly convey their views without anybody contradicting or interrupting them.Delhi should draw the right inferences from it. Although delayed, as the PM admitted, this was an important move by him to complete the process initiated two years ago by annulling Article 370 and 35A. The response of the political stakeholders at the meet, especially those from the Valley, should be seen by Delhi as a reflection of the current sentiment among the people.Also Watch | ‘Not ready to accept...’: After Modi meet, Omar, Mehbooba raise demandsKashmiris have been fed on the staple of special status, autonomy, and similar rhetoric for decades. There will continue to be the echoes of it for some more time. But, broadly, the urge today is for restoration of political authority. That dominant sentiment was expressed by majority of the leaders at the Delhi meet when they talked about the restoration of statehood, formation of new legislature and return of the reins of power to people’s representatives.Condescension should not be the way to look at this important change of heart, nor should Delhi gloat derisively over the “capitulation” of the Kashmiri leaders. Instead, it must be understood as their willingness to leave behind contentious issues and move on. In that, the most important message that the Valley leaders have delivered to Delhi was that they trust the leadership.“Kashmir needs a stern state,” Jagmohan told me in early 1990s soon after he served as the governor of J&K. “We have pampered it like a mother. We should also be stern like a father”, he explained. Delhi has shown its sternness in the last couple of years. Kashmiris have got the message. Now is the time, not for pampering, but for positivity.Mufti Mohammad Sayeed had made an important submission at the time of the formation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Peoples Democratic Party government that by agreeing to join hands with the BJP, six million Kashmiris had placed their trust and fate in the hands of a party that they perceived as Hindu. “Dil ki doori” can be bridged when Delhi understands the message of the present meeting also, not from the hyperbole of 9 pm television news, but with a pragmatic eye.The Delhi meet was also significant because of the prominence given to the political leadership by relegating non-political operatives, including officials and agencies, to a backseat. The travesty of J&K has been that it was sought to be handled through non-political players over all these decades. The metaphorical “Delhi ki doori” was a result of this cockeyed handling only.One of the achievements of Mufti-BJP government, during its short-lived stint of less than a year, was to restore primacy of the political leadership. PM Modi gave a clear indication of similar intention when he said at the meet, “Our priority is to strengthen grassroots democracy. Delimitation has to happen at a quick pace so that polls can happen, and J&K gets an elected Government that gives strength to its development trajectory.”The annulment of Article 370 was the first step in building a “Naya Kashmir”. The next natural step should be to build a “Naya Agenda”, new agenda. The PM had set the tone for it at the meeting calling for a “corruption-free, developed and progressive J&K, where all-round growth is furthered”. ‘All-round growth’ also meant attending to the injustices meted out to sections of the population such as the Kashmiri Pandits, people of Jammu, refugees, among others.The scrapping of Article 370 has paved the way for that. But the traditional Valley parties have an aversion to this agenda. They thrived on an agenda of separatism and hate. Some of them continued to peddle that fake agenda by invoking issues such as the restoration of Article 370 and special status at the meet. But these parties have increasingly lost their relevance in the state over the last few years. People are in no mood to fall for their jumlabazi anymore.That should lead to the rise of a “Naya Netritva”, new leadership, in the state. Indications of the rise of that new leadership were discernible at the Delhi meeting itself where the traditional players such as the PDP and National Conference were seen sharing the platform with relatively new entrants such as Sajjad Lone and Altaf Bukhari, with all getting an opportunity as equal stakeholders.There was a time when the Valley’s politics was dominated by one party and one family. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee years brought a new player – PDP – into the ring. The time has come for more such parties to occupy political space in the state. Some in Delhi expect the new players to be the amplifiers of Delhi’s ruling establishment. National parties such as Congress and BJP are there for that. What the state needs are not “mouthpieces” of Delhi, but genuine representatives of the people. The PM’s message that “it is the people, especially the youth, who have to provide political leadership to J&K, and ensure their aspirations are duly fulfilled” should be understood in that spirit.Ram Madhav is a member of the national executive of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, and member of the board of governors of India FoundationThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/bridging-kashmir-s-dil-ki-duri-with-delhi-101624617174569.html
25-06-2021||Today's||In their quest for power, UP’s Brahmins keep parties guessing about 2022||One has to travel back in time to probe the Brahmin community’s alienation from its old flame, the Congress, its flirtations with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and the reignition in 2014 of a courtship with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which, some believe, could now be reaching a breaking point in Uttar Pradesh (UP).With an approximate 12-14% share in the population, Brahmins, who continue to be opinion leaders at various societal tiers, have for years been a leaderless community in the key Hindi state.The era of titans such as GB Pant, Kamalapati Tripathi, HN Bahuguna, Umashankar Dikshit, ND Tiwari (all from the Congress stock) and the BJP’s Murli Manohar Joshi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who hailed from Madhya Pradesh but contested several times from UP, has long passed. This perhaps explains the community’s vagrant ways in the race for political space in a socially competitive polity.In the post-Mandal phase, the community lost as much relevance as did its original safe harbour, the Congress. It was left to fend for itself as the BSP and the Samajwadi Party (SP) ran away with the Dalit-Muslim components of the party’s once-formidable social compact. The resultant churn nudged the Brahmins into the Hindutva tent in the course of the Ram Temple movement. That has been a long-term legacy of the short term VP Singh regime the BJP propped up in conjunction with the Left after the 1989 polls. It was Singh’s government which enforced the Mandal Commission report in 1990.The crisis of leadership It is their broader social acceptability that has helped the Brahmins fare better than other forward identities in moving subaltern groups with them. In the Hindutva sweepstakes, the community’s superior adaptability faced pushbacks from the Rajputs and certain Hindutva-aligned, Mandal-empowered Other Backward Classes (OBC) sub-groups.Notable among them were the Lodhs and Kurmis, besides sections of the Yadavs. In the resultant tussle for prime political space, two Brahmin BJP leaders widely considered as chief minister material met with untimely, unnatural deaths.The first to go in 1997 was Brahmdutt Dwivedi. A Kanyakubj Brahmin and a sitting Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Farukkhabad, he had clout in the Doab area between Braj (Mathura-Vrindavan) and Avadh (Lucknow-Ayodhya-Allahabad). What made him a celebrity of sorts was his chivalrous rescue of Mayawati during the 1995 Lucknow guest house assault involving elements from Mulayam Singh’s SP.Also Read | In Indian politics, a crisis of leadershipDwivedi was a favourite of Vajpayee. The latter’s rise as prime minister could’ve earned him the chief ministerial spurs. But that was not to be. Instead, Kalyan Singh, a weighty Lodh leader whose administration was dismissed after the Babri mosque demolition in December 1992, held the office twice while Vajpayee ruled Delhi in the politically uncertain late 1990s.In 2004, another notable Brahmin in the BJP’s ranks, Ghanshyam Shukla, died in mysterious circumstances. A freak road accident had his family alleging murder. Be that as it may, the tragedy came with political repercussions. The deceased leader was popular among the sizeable Brahmin electorate in the Barabanki-Balrampur stretch including Bahraich, Gonda, Sitapur, Ayodhya and Shrawasti.The area is famous for political turf-battles between the Brahmins and Rajputs. The Jana Sangh had pockets of influence there even when the Congress was the dominant force. Vajpayee first entered the Lok Sabha from Balrampur in 1957. Located at nearby Gonda is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) icon, Nanaji Deshmukh’s Deendayal research institute for rural development.In the 2007 assembly polls, the Brahmins went on a rebound to Mayawati against this backdrop. She won them over with her seemingly inclusive cry of “Haathi nahi, Ganesh hai, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh hai”. The slogan marked a 360-degree turn from her reactionary anti-forward caste chants of “Tilak tarazu aur talwar, inko maaro jutey chaar.”The Brahmin value-add got her a majority of her own. In seeking to expand her base, Mayawati learnt perhaps from her bitter rival and Yadav chieftain, Mulayam Singh, who forever kept by his side three prominent upper-caste faces: Janeshwar Mishra (Brahmin), Rewati Raman Singh (Bhumihaar) and Mohan Singh (Rajput). A reminder at once of his socialist pretence, their companionship lent his image an inclusive touch beyond the sectarian.How the Congress squandered the 2009 gainsIn the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the BSP (20) came third after the SP (22) and the Congress (21) in terms of the number of seats they won. The results signalled the preference of Brahmins for the Congress over regional parties, notably the BSP, in parliamentary elections. It indicated as much their search for a pan-Indian platform other than the BJP.The thaw between the Congress and the Brahmins — who brought with them sections of the Dalits and Muslims — has to be contextualised to dissect the reasons for its short life. The party failed to nurture and expand the ground-level narrative which yielded electoral dividends across the state, especially in the Brahmin strongholds. The parliamentary seats the Congress wrested included eastern UP’s Barabanki (won by PL Punia), Faizabad (Nirmal Khatri), Bahraich (Kamal Kishor), Shrawasti (VK Pandey) and Gonda (Beni Prasad Varma).The phase also marked the last electoral win of Jitin Prasad — who recently crossed over to the BJP — from Dhaurehra in Lakhimpur Kheri adjoining Bahraich. But more on that, later.The eastern UP areas where the Congress did well have a sizeable presence of the omnibus, geographically identified Kanyakubjs and their sub-group, the Saryupari Brahmins. The broader identity inhabits several north Indian states; the latter hail from across the Saryu river near Ayodhya. Of their strength, the Kanyakubjis are also a factor in Farukkhabad (Salman Khurshid’s constituency) and the Saryuparis in Khushinagar (RPN Singh) besides Basti, Gorakhpur, Deoria, Ballia, Ghazipur, Varanasi and Mirzapur.From 1997 — when Dwivedi was shot dead — till 2012, when Akhilesh Yadav of the SP became the chief minister, the Brahmins weren’t en bloc in the BJP camp. The community was on the prowl for a respectable sinecure. Its 2009 rapprochement with the Congress happened after its disillusionment with the BJP and Mayawati. The Congress’s campaign in those elections was led by the Manmohan Singh-Sonia-Rahul Gandhi trinity which seemed a reassuring mix of experience, inclusivity and youth in the aftermath of the 2008 global economic crisis.The entente broke when the Congress projected a Kurmi leader, Beni Prasad Varma, then the sitting Member of Parliament from Gonda, as its face in the assembly polls. Akhilesh Yadav won by a thumping majority.Also Read | 30 years later, the life and legacy of Rajiv Gandhi“Had the Congress showcased a Brahmin leader in those elections, they could’ve built on the 2009 success,” said Amresh Misra of the Rashtravadi Kissan Kranti Dal.The times had changed but not the Brahmin investment in self-respect and search for leadership. The party failed to provide the influential community with even a hint of the sense of belonging reminiscent of free India’s early decades. That apart, the Congress didn’t come across as fighting for an honourable defeat leave alone a victory against a charged-up BJP under Narendra Modi.The BJP’s wooing of Brahmins: A replay of 2014As the 2014 general elections drew closer, the Congress remained inert while the critical importance of Brahmin support dawned early and tangibly on the BJP. The party of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement appointed Meerut’s Laxmikant Bajpai as its state unit chief in December 2012. His clean image and organisational skills worked well for Modi‘s prime ministerial challenge. The party won 71 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats.Not surprising that Bajpai was among the multiple contenders projected as a possible BJP CM face in the 2017 assembly polls — there was no official CM face - after making room for an OBC leader, Keshav Prasad Maurya, the current deputy CM, as the party’s UP president. What put paid to the possibility was the Brahmin leader’s shock defeat in Meerut against the run of the electoral play. Besides him, Kalraj Mishra, a Saryupari Brahmin from Deoria, who is now the governor of Rajasthan, was retained as a central minister in the run-up to the UP elections. In order not to annoy the Brahmin electorate, he was allowed to continue beyond the age of 75, the limit set for active politics by Modi.Had Bajpai not run out of luck, UP could’ve got a Brahmin CM after a quarter century; the last to occupy the office (1988-89) was the Congress’s ND Tiwari. A testimony to the BJP’s flagging support in the community is the call made recently on Bajpai by Swatantra Dev Singh, the party’s incumbent UP chief and a vocal supporter of the beleaguered CM, Yogi Adityanath.It’s difficult to guess where Jitin Prasad fits in the broader BJP plan — except being an ornamental Brahmin face. He lacks the heft to be a catalyst for his clansmen’s rapprochement with Yogi, who is seen as partisan to his Thakur (Rajput) base. Such is the deficit of trust that the Brahmins view as a “caste encounter” the killings of dreaded gangster Vikas Dubey and his cohorts. The UP Police had gone after the gang after suffering casualties in an earlier gun battle.Also Read | From 1991, the lessons for the India of 2021Not just that, the Yogi regime’s 2017 decision to cancel Parshuram Jayanti as a state holiday has also become an issue in the lead up to next year’s polls. “In response to the BJP’s Jai Sriram, the Brahmins’ chant Jai Parshuram,” said Misra of the RKD. Jitin Prasad was among the leaders who appealed to the CM in recent years to restore the jayanti its due place on his government’s calendar.The pleadings that haven’t hitherto been heard might find consideration in the ongoing season of political expediency. The Brahmin rebellion came to the fore in the recent panchayat polls in which the BJP did poorly. In Shrawasti for instance, the party gave 20 candidates from the community. All of them lost.A joke doing the rounds in UP these days is that the CM could have become PM had he not lacked Vitamin B (Brahmin). The messaging turns serious when read with another jibe, that of Yogi running a (Thakur) T-series in UP.It is a bit early to say how much of a force multiplier would he be. But the lateral induction in the UP BJP of AK Sharma (a former IAS officer perceived to be close to Modi) has had the grapevine working overtime. It’s a flashback of sorts to the leadership search after the 2017 polls which brought in circulation the name of Manoj Sinha, currently the Lt Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. But Yogi had his way.The bureaucrat-turned-politician initially tipped to take over as deputy CM is, like Sinha, an eastern UP Bhumihaar who claim to be Brahmins. Their caste-moniker suggests their land-owning status.Yesteryear BrahminsHistorically, the one Brahmin defection that changed the course of an election in UP was that of HN Bahuguna in the post-Emergency 1977 polls. He quit the party to set up the Congress for Democracy with Jagjivan Ram and Odhisha’s Nandini Satpathy. The fledgling outfit merged later with the Janata Party. A keen political observer and former student leader of Allahabad University, Baba Abhaya Awasti rated the event as the “beginning” of the party-hopping phase that has since turned from the sublime to the ridiculous.Bahuguna famously justified the switch with the reasoning that only the dead and the foolish don’t change their line of thinking: “Sirf murdey aur murkh hi vichardhara nahi badalte.” The cryptic one-liner is part still of Allahabad’s oral history.Also Read | The politics of foreign aid in IndiaBelatedly though, Bahuguna walked out not as much on Indira Gandhi as on her autocracy, her actions that vilified democracy. In so deciding, he did not show himself as a Brahmin leader — but a leader who happened to be a Brahmin.What was true of Bahuguna — who took pride in a riot free UP on his watch as the CM — applied to many leaders of the early generation. Their stewardship wasn’t driven by primordial caste identities. Their acme was their strong moral fibre, their probity, progressive learning and personal integrity. The Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Manoj Jha, a Maithil Brahmin from Bihar, said the regressive journey began some three decades ago; caste predominance cleaving the polity into silos and leaders into votaries of inward-looking social groups.Exemplifying that is Bahuguna’s progeny that moved from the Congress to the BJP the way Jitin Prasad has. The one thing common between them is their commonplace curriculum vitae. The retrogressive metamorphosis is visible across parties, more so in the vastly diminished Congress.Little wonder then that the Brahmins are leaderless. And it is this search for leadership that continues to drive their political calculations, keeping all of UP’s major political players in suspended animation about how the community would swing in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-up-the-story-of-brahmin-politics-and-community-s-quest-for-political-leadership-101624615914730.html
25-06-2021||Today's||The Taste with Vir Sanghvi: The Strange High Command Culture||For all of this week, political observers have been enthralled by the spectacle of the Congress setting fire to the best part of its own house. Punjab is one of the few North Indian states where the Modi wave has made no real impact. The Congress’s charismatic and experienced Chief Minister (CM) Capt. Amarinder Singh has not only kept the BJP at bay, he has also left the Akalis in disarray and prevented Aam Admi Party from growing.His reward for all of this was on display last week when the Congress high command which had nourished and encouraged Navjot Singh Sidhu, the celebrated former cricketer and former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP, decided to treat Sidhu and Amarinder as being on par. It listened respectfully to the CM’s detractors, did not act against Sidhu when he called the CM names and made Amarinder seek the approval of an internal committee of mostly second division leaders. The Gandhis, who have known Amarinder for decades, did not meet him.While Indian political observers wondered why the Congress might want to destabilise one of the few states where it is comfortably placed only a few months before an election, observers of Indian politics from abroad had a different question.“What exactly is a high command?” they asked.Good question.In fact the concept of a high command is one of India’s many contributions to global democracy. In most countries with a Westminster-style system of government, there is no such concept. Nor is it common in countries with a federal structure. In the United States, for instance, a Democratic governor may respect President Joe Biden but he knows the President does not have the power to remove him or even, to discipline him.So why do we have high commands in India? Does the term, with its martial associations, really have any place in a democratic society?Well, in Jawaharlal Nehru’s time, the Congress had no high command to speak of. The prime minster (PM) had an enormous moral stature (throughout the country, not just in the Congress party) and the party president was usually a well-respected figure. But state CMs were also powerful men with their own political bases. Some of them even openly disagreed with the PM who respected their views and their right to do things their own way.The Congress developed a high command structure only under Indira Gandhi. When PM Lal Bahadur Shastri died suddenly in Tashkent in 1966, it was the powerful state CMs and Congress leaders who selected Indira Gandhi to be his successor. But the leaders expected her to do their bidding and within three years Mrs Gandhi had rebelled.In 1969, she split the Congress, calling her faction the Congress (R) while the state leaders controlled the organisational faction called the Congress (O).Mrs Gandhi wiped out the Congress (O) in the 1971 election and never again allowed any powerful state leaders to grow too strong in the Congress. Assembly elections were fought in her name and she would nominate CMs herself. Generally, she chose people who had no independent support bases and owed their positions only to her.All important decisions were referred to Delhi and the concept of a high command to which these obedient lance naiks reported, took hold in the Congress.In 1977, Mrs. Gandhi was ousted from the Congress after a massive defeat following the Emergency, so she split the Congress again, calling her faction the Congress (I). In the 1979/80 election, the Congress (I) emerged victorious and the high command structure reasserted itself. It remained that way through Rajiv Gandhi's reign too.While PMs liked the idea of the high command that kept state CMs in their place, this concept only worked if the PM could win elections for the state leaders. The deal was: I get you elected and you do whatever I say.This arrangement collapsed towards the end of Narasimha Rao’s term when it became clear that he was no election-winner. State leaders realised the central leadership could do nothing for them.So they rebelled. For instance, Mamata Banerjee walked out and started her own party. In Tamil Nadu every Congressman of note left to found the Tamil Maanila Congress.When the Congress finally returned to office eight years after Narasimha Rao led the party to defeat, the high command structure re-emerged but it was no longer as strong as it once had been. For instance, the Congress leadership needlessly alienated the family of the late YS Reddy (YSR) which led to the emergence of the YSR Congress, founded after Jagan, YSR’s son, walked out of the Congress. In 2004, Andhra had been the key to the Congress’s victory. Now, after the exit of the YSR faction, the Congress hardly counts for anything in the state.Ever since its collapse in two successive general elections, the Congress has struggled to impose the high command model on its states. In Madhya Pradesh, it disregarded Jyotiraditya Scindia’s claims and appointed Kamal Nath as CM. In Rajasthan, Ashok Gehlot was appointed over Sachin Pilot’s objections. Only in Punjab, was there no other obvious candidate for the job so Amarinder became CM.But the high command model did not work. Scindia departed for the BJP leading to the collapse of the Madhya Pradesh government. Sachin Pilot rebelled and the government survived only after he had been mollified. His aides now suggest that the high command has not kept its end of the bargain and Rajasthan remains a ticking time bomb for the Congress.In Assam, the high command model led to Hemanta Biswal Sharma leaving for the BJP after he had an unsatisfactory meeting with Rahul Gandhi. (He is now CM and the BJP has won two elections in a row in Assam.) In Maharashtra despite the high command’s reservations (if not outright objections) the Congress’s MLAs, opted to join a coalition with the Shiv Sena.So, in many ways, Punjab is the last gasp of the high command model. Amarinder Singh is old-school enough to make the journey to Delhi to explain himself. But another leader in his place (say, Sidhu, who has form in this regard) could simply threaten to walk out of the party, as so many others have done, so successfully.None of this is to say that the growing failure of the High Command model within the Congress is a triumph of inner-party democracy. It is much more pragmatic than that. If the High Command wants people to listen to it, then it must assure them that their legislative seats are safe, that they can win elections in the name of the High Command. This was why the model worked in the Indira-era.The problem is that the present Congress High Command is not able to offer any such assurances. The Congress’s electoral record is dismal, while many of those who have left have flourished outside the Congress. (At least five non Congress Chief Ministers are people who walked out of the Congress complaining about the High Command.)If Rahul Gandhi can demonstrate that he is a vote winner, then the high command model would seem strong and unchallenged again. But, as of now, this has not happened.But the high command model remains one of India’s great — if slightly dodgy—contributions to global democratic practices. It may be dying in the Congress but just look at the BJP.As the party continues its transition to becoming a mirror image of the Indira Gandhi Congress, the high command model has never seemed stronger. Nothing of note happens in the BJP without the involvement of Narendra Modi or Amit Shah who appoint all CMs. State leaders know who the bosses are.So yes, the Congress high command model is on its way out. But the BJP’s high command model looks set to rule and rule.For more stories by Vir Sanghvi read here||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-taste-with-vir-sanghvi-the-strange-high-command-culture-101624610570952.html
