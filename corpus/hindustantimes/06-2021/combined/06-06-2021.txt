06-06-2021||Noida||Hindon pollution worsens, officials insist STPs working fine||The pollution in river Hindon has continued to worsen with the water samples registering a very high presence of faecal coliform, a clear indicator that untreated sewage is flowing into the river, contrary to the tall claims by officials that the sewage treatment plants (STPs) are “up to the mark”.According to Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), an analysis of samples collected from downstream of Kulesra in Noida in April 2021 found the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) to be 55 milligrams per litre (mg/l) against 30mg/l in April and December last year. The permissible limits for BOD — or the minimum levels of oxygen required to diffuse biological matter — is up to 3 mg/l.Similarly, faecal coliform was found to be 13,00,000 most probable number (MPN)/100ml (against 4,00,000 in April 2020), which is about 520 times the max permissible levels of 2,500 MPN/100ml, the UPPCB report said. The higher levels of faecal coliform shows that a high volume of sewage is reaching the river.Earlier in October, a report by National Mission for Clean Ganga had stated that 10 of 14 STPs along the river in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar were not complying with the discharge standards and that all 14 STPs were underperforming. Officials in the two districts later said the STPs have been fixed and are now “working fine”.But the UPPCB data contradicts the claim, as the pollution level after the STPs were fixed (October 2020 onwards) had only worsened.The data also showed that dissolved oxygen level in the river was nil throughout the year against a minimum requirement of 5mg/l. Dissolved oxygen level (required to sustain aquatic life) is the life of a river, which being nil means that the river is virtually dead with water unfit for consumption of any kind.According to officials, it’s the unauthorised and untapped sewer from illegal settlements along the river that is polluting the Hindon.“All STPs have been fixed and are complying with discharge norms in Ghaziabad.A few STPs were earlier not performing but we had them checked and later inspected. They are now complying with the norms. There are 10 STPs in Ghaziabad of which four are along the Hindon, and all are currently working,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UPPCB, Ghaziabad.The pollution control board officials from Noida also stated that STPs in their jurisdiction are working.“We are diluting the sewage that we are receiving from upstream. There was one STP in Sector 123 that was found non-compliant for faecal coliform but we had fixed it. Noida has six STPs and all are complying with norms; only the Sector 123 STP discharges into the Hindon,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida.He admitted that there are some drains that empty into the river untreated.“There are some drains like the one in Dasna that empties into the Hindon near Gaur City untreated. Though we ensure that whatever industrial effluent it carries is treated, the drain takes a long route after originating in Dasna and flowing through Ghaziabad, Dadri, villages along GT Road and merges with Hindon near Gaur City. The best we can do is to alert the civic authority concerned to take care of the local waste,” said Kumar.Officials also pointed out that there are a number of illegal settlements along the river.“The truth is that we can tap the illegal sewage from authorised settlements but there are a number of large settlements such as the ones in Khulsehra, Chhajarsi, Vijay Nagar, Kinauni village and other areas of Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar that are situated along the river and discharge untreated effluents into it -- the reason for the presence of high levels of faecal coliform. The issue persists as the sewers in these villages are untapped, there is no data on them either. Besides, in Ghaziabad, the river is diverted toward the Hindon canal for irrigation, so that the flow of the river is affected. This issue remains unaddressed,” said a senior UPPCB official, on the condition of anonymity.According to environmentalists, the major cause of pollution is “official apathy”.“The national mission for Clean Ganga in its report had ordered the district administrations to take appropriate action against officials or organisations responsible for polluting rivers. It also ordered legal action against officials who were responsible to ensure that STPs are functional. Unfortunately, there is no accountability, nor is anyone held responsible. The result is that the condition of the Hindon continues to deteriorate by the day,” said Vikrant Tongad, a Noida-based environmentalist.The Hindon – west Uttar Pradesh’s most important river – has a basin area of about 7,000 square kilometre. Its tributaries include the Krishni and Kali, which are also highly polluted. The Hindon originates from the Shivalik range in Saharanpur district, flowing down to Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar to finally meet the Yamuna in Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/hindon-pollution-worsens-officials-insist-stps-working-fine-101623003750740.html

Over 380 of them have been inoculated so far while the remaining 130 employees will be administered the shot by next week.”“We have around 1,700 employees in the 18-45 age group. We are preparing a roster to provide them slots. The drivers and conductors are being given priority in the vaccination as they are more exposed to the common people. All our employees are strictly following the standard Covid-19 protocols,” he said.

However, the weekend curfew will continue, as per the new unlock guidelines of the district. On Sunday, the district officials said that the partial Covid curfew, which was in prevalence from the night of April 30, would be lifted from Monday as the active cases in the district dropped below 600.“Most business owners are happy to resume their work, though some are still opting to stay shut. We have incurred heavy losses during both the lockdowns. However, a chance to resume work will start helping us financially. However, it all depends on the customers’ turnout,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector 18 market association. Now, shops will be allowed to open between 7am and 7pm and markets will operate for five days a week. “I doubt if I will get business from new clients, especially as the shop will remain closed on weekends. Though I suffered losses, I continued paying one of my assistants while the other one went back to his hometown,” said Vicky Yadav, a photography shop owner in Sector 76. Earlier, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that shops and markets outside containment zones have been allowed to remain open from 7am to 7pm from Monday to Friday, while vegetable markets located in the densely populated areas have been instructed to function in open places. “Restaurants will have only home delivery options,” he said. Under the new guidelines, shopping malls will continue to remain closed while there will be a complete curfew on the weekends which are to be used for cleaning and sanitisation purposes.Shop owners feel that to keep markets from becoming Covid hot spots, implementation of guidelines is also imperative. “We will have to make sure that social distancing norms are followed. Vendors are allowed to operate in compliance with guidelines. We have 240 registered vendors in our market. But there are many more in the market. It is important to keep a check on all of them,” said CB Jha, president, Atta market association. Police officials said they will ensure that the guidelines are not being violated. “Only registered vendors will be allowed to operate in market areas. Others will have to go to designated vending zones. Our teams will be on alert and action will be taken against anyone found flouting the unlock guidelines,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/traders-relieved-as-markets-set-to-reopen-from-monday-101623003630198.html

Now the ashes can be sent from post offices to Varanasi, Prayagraj, Haridwar and Gaya through speed post, where asthi visarjan (immersion of ashes) and shradha rituals would be done by Om Divya Darshan (ODD), informed Krishna Kumar Yadav, Postmaster General of Varanasi region. Yadav said that recently the organisation submitted a proposal for this to the directorate, postal operations division, India Post, New Delhi. The directorate accepted the proposal, and an arrangement was made for sending ashes through speed post. He said that to avail of this facility, one would have to register on the portal of Om Divya Darshan (http://omdivyadarshan.org) After having registered for asthi visarjan or shradha ceremony on the ODD portal, one could send the packet of asthis (ashes) by speed post to Varanasi, Prayagraj, Haridwar and Gaya. He said the ashes should be packed properly and ‘Om Divya Darshan’ should be inscribed on the packet in bold letters, so that it would be distinguished. The sender would have to write his full name, address and mobile number etc. on the packet. The speed post charges would be borne by the sender. After booking the speed ​​post, the sender would have to update the booking details, including speed ​​post bar code number, on the portal of Om Divya Darshan Sanstha. Once the packet was received at the post office, it would be delivered to Om Divya Darshan’s address, he said. After that, Om Divya Darshan Sanstha, through the empanelled pandits, would perform the shradha ceremony on the pre-decided date and time. The ceremony would be webcast live to the family members of the deceased. Thereafter, a bottle of Ganga water would be booked by ODD and delivered to the family members of the deceased through speed post from Parliament Street post office, New Delhi, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-speed-post-ashes-to-temple-towns-for-post-death-rituals-101623002550184.html

The passengers will be able to raise an alert in case of any emergency to get prompt help. After the Central government recently provided around ₹52 crore grant to the state under the Nirbhaya framework, the UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) has prepared the request for proposal (RFP) and uploaded the same on its website for prospective bidders to implement the ambitious project. “Having floated the RFP, we will hold a pre-bid conference on June 11 after which we will invite bids from expert agencies to carry out the project for equipping all the public service vehicles, including UPSRTC and private buses, with VLT devices (AIS-140 specifications) and emergency buttons to provide immediate assistance to passengers in emergency,” UPSRTC managing director and transport commissioner Dheeraj Sahu said. “The final project that will make real-time seamless tracking vehicles possible may be rolled out very soon this year after the implementing agency is selected,” he added. As per the scheme, the public service vehicles fitted with VLT devices and emergency buttons will be integrated with the state-of-the art centralized 24x7 monitoring centre being set up in the transport commissioner office. The backend system of the monitoring centre will be hosted on the NIC cloud. “Any emergency alarm raised by a passenger will land on two VLT platforms simultaneously—on the transport department’s monitoring centre as well as on the national 112 police helpline. These centres will verify and communicate the message to the nearest interceptor/response vehicle to make the assistance available promptly to the passenger concerned,” explained another UPSRTC official aware of the project. The project, according to him, would help the UPSRTC to keep a close watch on all its 11,500 buses and 100 interceptors remotely. “Apart from enabling passengers to get prompt help in situations like sexual attack on a woman passenger, hold-up of a bus or a road mishap, the project will also help us keep a close watch on our buses for many other purposes , helping us plug in leakages and improve services,” the official said. Of the ₹52 crore that UP has got as grant from the Centre to execute the project, ₹5 crore will be spent on publicity campaign alone to make people aware of the project and how to seek emergency help when they are in any trouble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/decks-cleared-for-fitting-panic-buttons-in-upsrtc-vehicles-101623002430176.html

In a statement, he alleged that the condition of farmers has deteriorated the most in the state under the BJP government and they were badly hit financially. Akhilesh also blamed the three new farming laws introduced by the union government for “breaking down the agricultural economy”. He said that there was a big farmer movement against the new laws and even after a long time the anger of the farmers had not subsided. “The unity of the farmers will shatter the arrogance of the BJP. The farmers did not get remunerative prices for their crops from the BJP government. The BJP government had made tall claims about doubling the income of farmers just to grab their votes. To mislead them, the BJP government promised MSP (minimum statutory price), but in reality, the crop procurement was not done on MSP. The MSP of wheat of ₹1,975 per quintal was only in the advertisements. In reality the farmer are forced to sell wheat to middlemen at throwaway prices.” On sugarcane farmers in the state, Akhilesh Yadav said, “Sugarcane farmers are badly hit in the state. Even in the crushing season, their produce was not procured. Even today, sugar mills owe farmers more than ₹20,000 crore. There is also a provision of interest on the arrears, but when the principal is not being paid, who will pay the interest?” “The farmers are being cheated by reducing the weight of the sacks of fertilisers and increasing the price. Farmers are already badly affected by the increase in the price of diesel, food items and transportation cost. They are fed up with these tricks of the BJP and now they have resolved to give a befitting reply. Justice will be done to the farmers in 2022 when the Samajwadi Party government will return to power,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/akhilesh-farmers-worst-hit-under-bjp-govt-101623002250186.html

The farmers’ vehicles left around 11:30am with the union’s state president Gurnam Singh Charuni leading it. He claimed that more than 2,500-3,000 vehicles were part of the contingent.This even as another group of farmers were staging a sit-in outside the Tohana Sadar police station demanding the release of two of their activists who were jailed for protesting outside a Jannayak Janta Party legislator’s house. Farmers from Patiala and Mohali in Punjab also joined their Haryana counterparts in their march towards Delhi. Among them was a 11-year-old boy, Amanjot, who came with his father Harpreet from Mohali. When asked, he said he is aware of the gravity of the situation and hence came to support the farmers. “The government wants to suppress the protests in the name of Covid but no farmer will leave any protest site till the laws are taken back,” he said.Another agitator, an 81-year-old former Air Force officer, said he has been registering his protest by wearing black clothes since August 15 last year. “I have been wearing black clothes and a turban of the same colour as a mark of protest against these black laws,” he said.Will start mission UP soon: Charuni When asked about the possibility of talks with the Modi government, Charuni told reporters that even if there is no discussion with the government on a solution, laws have to be taken back.“They are more scared than us. Just look at their situation. Bharatiya Janata Party is losing everywhere. We showed them what we can do in West Bengal, now we are preparing for mission UP against them,” he said referring to the state polls scheduled next year. On the Tohana controversy, he said the matter had almost ended after an apology by JJP MLA Devinder Babli but farmers will agitate till their fellow activists are released.In November last year, farmers from most of the north-Haryana and Punjab region had gathered in Ambala to move towards Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dilli-kooch-2-0-charuni-leads-farmers-contingent-from-ambala-to-delhi-101623002130098.html

The suspects were identified as Zarar Haider of Mumbai in Maharashtra, Pratesh Patel of Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh and Nishgar of Ahmedabad in Gujarat. The police said they made at least ₹50 lakh, as they were paying workers ₹15,000 to ₹25,000 per month.Karan Goel, the assistant commissioner of police, said that Haider was the team leader, while Patel used to handle technical operations and Nishgar used to handle voice and accent training along with process training. “Three of them were masterminds. They had taken up a house on rent in Sector 23 and were paying ₹45,000 a month. The call centre was operational for the last six months. These suspects were duping US nationals and taking money through gift cards and Pay Pal,” he said. A case was registered on Sunday at Cyber police station under sections 420 (cheating) and 120B (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 66D and 75 of the IT Act. They will be produced before the district and sessions court on Monday.The callers posed as officials of law enforcement agencies and coerced their victims into paying fines, the police said. The suspects used to threaten US citizens that their social security numbers (SSN) would be blocked or that they would be booked for consuming drugs or taking loans on the basis of forged documents, the police said. Data of US citizens, two laptops, one hard disk and two mobile phones were recovered from the premises. The police said that at least 2,000 people based in the US were targeted.Goel said that they conducted a reconnaissance of the area on Sunday. “There were more than six men and three women making calls in the room. They all were graduates who had work experience at other call centres. There were around 15 workstations and training was given to the employees before hitting the floor. They also set up a toll-free number, to which they received calls from their targets,” he said. The police said the suspects developed several fake websites, which would direct the victims to call the toll-free number for assistance. The police said the confiscated hardware will be sent to a laboratory in Madhuban of Karnal for forensic examination to ascertain the total number of frauds committed. “Payment was generally done through virtual gateways, credit and debit cards, gift cards and iTunes cards,” said Goel, adding that the call centre used to earn nearly ₹2 lakh a day, but due to lockdown, the operations were closed for two months in the interim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/illegal-call-centre-set-up-to-dupe-us-citizens-busted-in-sector-23-101623001110093.html

Following this, we will use machineries deployed by GMDA teams and NHAI at these locations to drain out the water. This will give us an idea of how well we can deal with the waterlogging issues during the peak of monsoon, and how the remedial measures taken in the past are working.”“We are planning to make barriers along the stretch from Vatika Chowk to Southern Peripheral Road — with low habitation and waterlogging issues — so that the water can be diverted to low-lying areas. Thus, the excess water won’t accumulate at Narsinghpur, and can be used for groundwater recharge,” added Kumar.Meanwhile, during a meeting with several agencies on Friday, GMDA chief executive officer Sudhir Rajpal instructed all the departments to coordinate with each other and ensure that the residents do not face any issue this monsoon. The NHAI officials apprised Rajpal that “a permanent solution has been found for waterlogging issues at Subhash Chowk, with different sides of the road being connected to an underground pipe passing below it”.Rajpal also ordered the departments to install pumping machines and make arrangements to divert the excess water to green belts or areas with natural depression, so that the water can be used for groundwater recharge.In May 2021, different parts of the district witnessed heavy waterlogging, with Narsinghpur-Khandsa stretch, Sohna Road, Gurugram bus depot, Rajiv Chowk, and sectors 9 and 10 being some of the worst-affected areas. The district authority has already made diversions at certain stretches near Shiv Nadar School to prevent waterlogging along the Golf Course Road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-to-hold-mock-drill-on-june-9-to-get-monsoonready-101623001051334.html

Despite the increase in recoveries, 343 Covid-19 deaths — the highest in the district in a month — were recorded in May.“With the cooperation of the residents, the spread of coronavirus has been contained. There is only one mantra to defeat Covid-19 and it is that when we come out of the house, we must wear a mask covering the nose and mouth, keep a distance of two yards from others, and keep washing hands with soap or disinfect hands with an alcohol-based sanitizer. The cooperation of the people is vital in the prevention of this epidemic,” said Dr Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram.On Sunday, 7,835 doses of Covid-19 vaccines were also administered, of which 7,386 were the first dosage for the 18-45 age group while 449 people were second dosages.Of the 7,835 doses, 88 were administered at a solitary drive-through facility set up by the district administration at the parking of JMD Regent Square on Mehrauli Gurgaon (MG) Road. All the vaccines administered in this camp were Covishield, for people above the age of 45. Overall, more than 735,000 people have been vaccinated in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/55-new-covid-19-cases-two-deaths-in-gurugram-101623001050141.html
06-06-2021||Gurugram||MCG focuses on safe public transport||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has turned its focus to finding solutions to aid the recovery of public transport systems in the Covid-19 era, officials said on Sunday. For this purpose, the MCG will be taking the assistance of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), social enterprises, and academic and research institutes to improve the mobility needs of the city and understand the problems faced by residents and transport operators.“As our city braves through these challenging times, the MCG is committed to making our buses, trains, and other transport services like shared autos, e-rickshaws Covid-safe,” said Surender Singh Saharan, additional commissioner of MCG.He said that as part of the process, the MCG will be participating in the Central government’s Transport4All challenge to come up with possible solutions for recovery as well as address transportation issues within the city.Saharan said that through the Transport4All challenge, the city will work towards resolving the most critical problems which citizens face, such as crowding in vehicles, unaffordable fares and long travel times, in order to rebuild people’s trust in public transport.“Better public transport will help all citizens move safely during the pandemic and make the system more resilient to such outbreaks in the future,” said Saharan.Sarika Panda Bhatt, a city-based transport expert, said, “Gurugram has multiple options in regards to public transport but there is no clarity or assessment on the exact public demand for each of the options. This challenge will, hence, be beneficial in determining the exact number of buses, e-rickshaws, autorickshaws or metro stations the city requires and accordingly, build around it.”At present, city residents mostly depend on autorickshaws or e-rickshaws for travel due to the paucity of public transport options. While the Delhi Metro’s Yellow Line and the Rapid Metro network connect areas from the Sirhaul border up to Golf Course Road, there is no connectivity to the older parts of the city. The Gurugaman bus service was also launched due to demands for better public transport and currently caters to select routes.The MCG officials said that the role of citizen groups, NGOs, social enterprises, academic and research institutes will be crucial in assessing the city’s transport needs. These expert groups can capture the mobility problems citizens, especially vulnerable groups, face through surveys. They can also develop solutions that meet the needs of citizens and evaluate the impact of these solutions after testing them with citizens, among other such measures, said officials.The challenge is a new initiative by the ministry of housing and urban affairs. “This challenge will be among the cities which have a population above 500,000. It is regarding safe, convenient and affordable transport facility. By participating in this challenge, Gurugram will improve its public transport and better serve the mobility needs of all citizens, during and after this pandemic,” Saharan said.As per MCG officials privy to the matter, the main focus areas of the challenge will be on conceptualising digital innovations, developing and testing them, and scaling them to provide the best possible options to residents.Other important aspects of this challenge are to figure out the best possible modes of payment with an emphasis on digital forms, creating control rooms that can help monitor different modes of public transport, and creating various platforms through which passengers can get relevant information, such as waiting time, fare, routes, distance, as well as set up a centre from where they can ask queries on such information, either through an operator or a digital interface.MCG officials said that the last date for registering for the transport challenge is June 15, with the initiative set to go on till December 2022.Barring Gurugram, only Faridabad and Karnal are eligible for this challenge in Haryana, as these are the only three cities that have a population above 500,000 in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-focuses-on-safe-public-transport-101623000992436.html
06-06-2021||Gurugram||With four robberies in 10 days, criminals train their guns on collection agents||Armed robbers are targeting collection agents on their way to banks to deposit cash since the latest lockdown curbs were eased in Gurugram on May 24, the police said, citing four such instances in a 10-day period and the arrest of four persons in connection with the cases. On Sunday, the Sector 40 crime unit arrested a suspect, identified as Veer Singh Saini of Hisar, from Bhiwani and recovered ₹90,000 from his possession, along with documents pertaining to the targets. The police said that Saini was involved in two robberies and is being questioning to ascertain more details.The police said that most of the targets collected cash from retail outlets and liquor vends, with incidents being reported from Farrukhnagar, Pataudi, Palam Vihar and Sector 17/18 dividing road since the last week of May.Officials said that police teams, upon collating and scanning CCTV footage from more than 11 locations in connection with the four cases, found that the same modus operandi was followed by all robbers and that those responsible for planning the robberies were affiliated with one another.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that a common feature in the four incidents was the role of an insider. “All the collection agents are given a route for collection, and as per the roster, the route is shared within the team. In three cases, we arrested supervisors who had shared the information with their close associates and planned the robbery incidents,” he said.In the latest incident, a 26-year-old collection agent of a chain of retail stores was robbed of ₹4.5 lakh at gunpoint by three persons in Sector 52, outside Ardee City Gate 4, on June 2. Sangwan said, “Our crime units started an investigation on June 2. Within 24 hours, they cracked the case and arrested the suspects for attacking one of the victims, identified as Jeetu Kumar, outside Ardee City Gate 4 on June 2. The suspects allegedly followed him, intercepted his motorcycle, and snatched his bag at gunpoint. When the agent tried to raise the alarm, they threatened to kill him and threw red chilli powder in his eyes before escaping with the bag on a motorcycle. It had a fake number plate,”Three suspects, identified as Chetram of Rajasthan, Ramakant of Bihar, and Vishal alias Monu of Haryana, were arrested in connection with the incidents, while the police are on the lookout for another affiliate.Chetram used to run a kiosk in residential areas where he ironed clothes, but due to a financial crunch, took up a job in an end-to-end logistics solutions provider company in Sector 15, where he came in contact with Vishal. The duo masterminded the robberies, the police said.Gunpal, the sub-inspector and in-charge of Sector 40 (crime) police station, said that Chetram often discussed his financial issues with Vishal and sought his suggestions to make more money. “The latter shared his plan they decided to rob collection agents as they usually carry large amounts of cash.”As per the plan, they coordinated and followed Jeetu Kumar, who undertook cash collection for their office and other retail outlets. The police said that the duo was in a conference call with the others and directed them to converge on him when he slowed down before a speed breaker ahead of Ardee City Mall.During questioning, the suspects revealed that they generally followed their targets for three days to ascertain their schedule. “Prior to this, they said that they used to sit outside a private bank in Sector 52 for hours to check if anyone would come carrying a bag to withdraw cash. As they did not find targets for over a week, they started targeting collection agents as they were easy targets and were alone on their motorbikes, without any security,” said Gunpal.The police said the gang was active for over a year and they robbed their targets only after ensuring they were carrying at least ₹4 lakh.On May 26, a 28-year-old collection agent was robbed of ₹4 lakh at gunpoint by two persons in Palam Vihar. On May 29, three persons on a motorbike robbed a liquor store operator in Farrukhnagar while another liquor store collection agent was robbed on the Sector 17/18 diving road. On April 19, a collection agent of a chain of liquor stores was allegedly robbed of ₹6 lakh at gunpoint by four armed persons in Sector 18, near a private bank. The police said that one of the robbers fired two gunshots in the air to intimidate the victim, before escaping with the money in a car. The police said that the car, a Swift Dzire, was recovered from a road in Palam Vihar an hour after the incident was reported.Sangwan said that they have asked banks and agencies involved in cash collections to send along a security guard with the collection agents, and not to share routes and money details with the entire team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/with-four-robberies-in-10-days-criminals-train-their-guns-on-collection-agents-101623000991665.html

As per schedule, vaccines for this group are likely to arrive in another five days. It is a concerning situation because many people are scheduled to take their second doses now and several of them have travelled long distances to places, such as Meerut and Bulandshahr, to get vaccinated. We appeal to the Central government to scale up vaccine supply for Delhi,” said AAP legislator Atishi while reading the government’s vaccine bulletin in a live-streamed video briefing.All the 368 vaccine centres of the Delhi government for the 18-45 group are suspended for more than two weeks now as they have run out of vaccine stock. The Delhi government gets vaccines directly from the central government for the 45+ age group. But for the 18-45 age group, they buy directly the vaccines from the manufacturers – Covishield from Serum Institute of India and Covaxin from Bharat Biotech. However, a formula applied by the central government automatically ends up imposing a cap on the supplies.“For the 45+ age group, we currently have 584,000 total doses available. There is a shortage of Covaxin. So it is being used for only second doses. A third wave of Covid-19 can only be stopped by vaccinating more people. The central government should promote state-run vaccine centres, which offer vaccines for free. A large number of people cannot afford to pay to get their families vaccinated in private hospitals,” said Atishi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-seeks-centre-s-help-in-scaling-up-vaccine-supply-101623000990815.html
06-06-2021||Gurugram||Sewage overflow yet to be resolved for month, allege Ardee City residents||Residents of Ardee City in Sector 55 said that drainage overflow has become a common sight over the last month and that there has been no resolution despite repeated complaints to the developer and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG).Residents alleged on Sunday that the lack of de-silting of drains has led to a blockage and subsequent overflow, following recent spells of rain. They said that due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the authorities are not paying any heed to their problems and they have to deal with the unhygienic situation on their own. Praveen Yadav, president, Ardee City residents’ welfare association (RWA), said that they have been raising the issue for the past three weeks. “The administration is turning a blind eye to this serious problem. We have also taken to social media to highlight the issue as our requests are not been heard. Residents of Block D-2 lane have been left to live with this. We are still wondering how to wake up the department for a permanent solution,” he said.Anil Haseeja, the vice-president of Ardee Infrastructure Private Limited, on Sunday, refused comment in the matter. MCG’s chief engineer TL Sharma said that the area falls under the developer’s jurisdiction, but they will get it checked at the earliest. “Though we have started the tendering process and expect monsoon preparedness measures to start by May-end, on-ground work, such as de-silting and clearing of stormwater and sewerage drains, have been started and will be completed within a week. A team will be sent to Ardee city on Monday to check if the master sewerage pipelines are blocked,” he said. Residents alleged two lanes have turned into breeding grounds for mosquitoes due to overflow and stagnation of waste, with recent spells of rain evoking unbearable stench from the refuse. Besides, the electricity infrastructure is also located in the vicinity of the overflow, with residents fearful of the situation.Chaitali Mandhotra, an RWA member, said that there are around 300 residents directly impacted by this condition. “We are already struggling with Covid-19 and black fungus, and don’t want another epidemic to strike just due to apathy of the department concerned. Several reminders have gone unheard and residents are fearing to exit their houses,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/sewage-overflow-yet-to-be-resolved-for-month-allege-ardee-city-residents-101623000990184.html

According to police, the woman allegedly planned the murder as she suspected her husband of having extra-marital relationships. While the woman has been arrested, investigators are still looking for her friend.Deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parminder Singh said the police control room received a call regarding a murder in a house in Nilothi Extension on the morning of June 3, after which a team found the body of the victim, identified as Anil Sahu, who ran a placement agency, with multiple injuries on face, neck and head.Police said that Sahu’s wife, Bhuvneshwari Devi, was present at the rented home along with their two children and two other women. While Devi told police that two outsiders had come to meet her husband and murdered him, investigators found gaps in her story and also questioned her about the injury marks and blood spots found on her body and clothes. Police said her children and the two women, who were present in the house, were unaware of any such visit. “Devi was further questioned and asked about the injuries. She broke down and confessed to the crime and the involvement of her friend, Raj. We arrested her,” said DCP Singh.During questioning, he said, Devi disclosed that she had a regular fights with her husband and had even filed a dowry, assault and threat case against him last year at their hometown in Jharkhand. However, the issues were resolved and she again started living with him in Delhi.“The marital discord began again as Devi suspected her husband of having affairs with other women. Whenever she confronted him, he would beat her. When she could not bear the atrocities of her husband, she planned to kill him with the help of Raj,” added the DCP.According to police, on the night of June 2, when Sahu returned home from work, Devi allegedly spiked his dinner and after he fell unconscious, she allegedly tied him up with Raj’s help. However, he gained consciousness after a while and it lead to a scuffle. Devi and Raj allegedly overpowered him and stabbed him with a sharp tool. Thereafter, they dressed up the crime scene to make it look like a murder by outsiders. After Raj left, Devi alerted her family members and neighbours, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/on-suspicion-of-extra-marital-affair-woman-her-friend-kill-husband-in-outer-delhi-101623000870819.html

The resident of northeast Delhi’s Yamuna Vihar said, “My son is three and my daughter is just one-year-old. None of them are enrolled in a school yet; otherwise they would have got dry ration from there. Some NGO people visited our locality last month to distribute food. When I told them about my issue, they put me in touch with an anganwadi worker who later helped me enrol my kids in a centre.” Singh, 28, is a single mother and lives with her parents. Like Uma, several thousand people have enrolled their kids in the city’s anganwadis after losing their source of income amid the pandemic. According to a recent survey conducted by the Delhi government, 247,293 children and pregnant/lactating women have enrolled in anganwadi centres across the Capital amid the lockdown enforced by the Delhi government in April. The trend, experts said, shows that the income of families has been more severely hit this time compared to the last lockdown. These anganwadi centres, part of the central government’s Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), provide supplementary nutritious meals to children up to age six as well as pregnant and lactating women. They also provide pre-school education, health education, immunization and medical check-ups for the children. While the city’s 10,700 anganwadi centres have been shut since March, the Delhi government’s department of women and child development (WCD) has been providing children and pregnant/lactating women supplementary nutrition - including dalia, black chickpea (chana), jaggery, nutritious ladoos, and roasted chickpea - through door-to-door services each fortnight.Government data seen by HT showed that in March last year, 534,741 children and women were enrolled in the ICDS programme, which increased to 782,034 (46.24%) by April this year. The latest survey report also stated that the coverage of supplementary nutritional diets also increased by 68% from the last lockdown.“As per the latest round of survey results from the DCPCR, 91% of the beneficiaries reported that they are receiving nutritional supplements whereas in May 2020 when only 23% of the beneficiaries surveyed had reported that they received the ration,” the document stated.Dilshad, who lost his job at a garment store in Lakshmi Nagar in April last year, had initially registered his two children in a local anganwadi and recently also enrolled his four-month pregnant wife as well. “My children--a four-year-old son and a five-year-old daughter--were enrolled in a private school in Seelampur. I had to pull out my children from the anganwadi as I was not able to pay the fees in July. I am still out of work and we are struggling to arrange daily meals.”“I enrolled my children in an anganwadi in August. In March, I got to know that my wife is expecting again. I am still hardly earning anything by cleaning cars in Dilshad Garden. I cannot provide her with the basic nutrition she requires now. Therefore, I had to enrol her at the same centre,” he said.In some cases, the workers of the child development department themselves identified children whose families’ income was severely hit amid the lockdown. Ankur (goes by the first name), who was working as a cleaner in a factory in Okhla Phase-3, said he is out of work since last year. He said last month, when some officials of the department visited their neighbourhood in Jahangirpuri, the family had nothing to feed their two daughters aged three and five. “They not only provided us with dry ration and some supplementary nutrition but also enrolled my two daughters in an anganwadi,” he said.Senior officials said the increased enrolment in the programme was also because of the enhanced efforts of officials and workers engaged in these projects. “During the pandemic, maximum efforts have been taken to enhance the outreach services and make the workers serve the needs of vulnerable children in a holistic manner, including having knowledge of children at risk. Massive training exercises were undertaken to sensitise all our workers to identify and help vulnerable children, children in need, and orphaned children,” said a woman and child development department official. The department trained 11,248 field functionaries between January to May on various themes such as special needs of children, children’s health and nutrition, pre-school education, various child-related acts, and protecting children from any form of physical or mental abuse during the pandemic. According to the latest data collected by the Delhi Commission for Child Rights Protection (DCPCR), at least 1,436 children lost either one or both their parents to Covid-19. Of them, 59 children lost both parents, 467 lost their mother while 910 lost their father. The anganwadi workers were also asked to call on helpline number 1098 to report about any children in distress. Officials said the number receives around 500 calls every day. For instance, on May 31, the helpline number received 634 calls, of which 45 were related to Covid-19 or the lockdown. Apart from this, the other dedicated helpline number - 9311551393 - for information about children who need any help or support received at least 2,800 calls as on June 1, data showed.The Delhi government, in its budget 2021-22 presented in March, announced setting up of 500 Saheli Samanvay Kendras (SSKs) for better outreach to vulnerable women and children. Of the 500, about 101 such SSKs have been made operational as of now. Dr. Rashmi Singh, director of the women and child development department, said SSKs have emerged as emergency response centres catering to women whose livelihood and socio-economic condition have been hit by the pandemic and the lockdown. “Distribution of additional relief, ration, health supplies, raising awareness on vaccine and other issues related to the Covid-19 is taking place through these centres that are located in densely populated areas which are low on resources and where a large number of migrant workers have settled,” she said. Meanwhile, civil society organisations in Delhi, said the number of enrolment in the ICDS scheme is still low as compared to the population of the national capital. Amrita Johri of Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan said, “Income of families has been severely hit amid this second wave due to two reasons. First, the loss of jobs following the lockdown and, second, the unexpected health crisis that had unfolded around us. Many families, who were earning ₹20,000-30,000 a month, lost all their savings in arranging Covid resources for their loved ones. If we consider this all, the number of enrolment in the ICDS scheme is still low in Delhi.”“The number of families hit this year was also high. While last year, the number of SOS calls for ration was in thousands, this time, amid the second lockdown, we have received over 1.5 lakh such calls. Hence, more effort needs to be taken to enrol every child and woman in distress under the scheme,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/46-more-children-women-enrol-in-delhi-s-anganwadis-amid-second-lockdown-101623000811371.html
06-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s malls, markets and district in sync as precaution takes centre stage||As Delhi prepares for its second phase of reopening after seven weeks in lockdown, market welfare associations in the city said they are trying to vaccinate as many shop owners and employees as possible, shopping malls said they are going to invest on managing footfall in real-time, while district administrations said they will ensure stricter enforcement of distancing and mask norms. On Monday, around 250 enforcement teams of the Delhi revenue department will be deployed in markets and public spaces that are likely to see large crowds, said a senior government official. “Liquor stores will be under watch. They are likely to witness huge crowds for the next few days. If things go out of control, officers in sub-divisions have been directed to close the shops immediately for the day,” said the government official. Dharmendra Kumar, west Delhi’s additional district magistrate, said, “Enforcement will be scaled up. We have to ensure social distancing and high mask compliance at any cost. We cannot let Covid-19 cases go up again.” Pushpa Bector, executive director, DLF Shopping Malls and director, Shopping Centres Association of India, said the mall industry has been ready to reopen for some time. “Apart from the guidelines recommended by local authorities, we have got stringent measures now like live footfall trackers, apart from getting all mall employees vaccinated. It is important that we give an environment of safety to both consumers and to build staff confidence during these testing times. We hope that business will soon come back to normal,” said Bector. Yogeshwar Sharma, executive director and CEO, Select Citywalk, said the reopening has been mapped out, with extensive standard operating procedures in place, including temperature checks at entry points, sanitization across all public areas and retail outlets, and air-conditioning practices in accordance with government guidelines. “We will also work in tandem with our occupants to ensure best practices [are in place] for the safety of our visitors,” said Sharma. Atul Bhargava, owner of a store at Connaught Place and president of New Delhi Traders’ Association, said the body conducted a vaccination drive on Saturday for their staff and family members ahead of the Monday’s reopening. “Our members paid for the vaccines for their staff,” said Bhargava. The Khan Market traders body also said the association is in touch with a private hospital to vaccinate staff. Sanjeev Mehra, president of Khan Market Traders’ association, said, “It will take another two or three days for us to streamline the vaccination process. We have taken care of other precautionary measures,” said Mehra. He said that crowding might not be a problem initially since people were unlikely to throng the markets in the first few days. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday announced that restrictions, including those on markets and transport, were being eased in the Capital starting Monday, after a seven-week lockdown that was necessitated by a devastating fourth wave of Covid-19 cases that overran the city’s health care system and led to shortages in critical medical supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-malls-markets-and-district-in-sync-as-precaution-takes-centre-stage-101623000750755.html

The police have recovered 34 computers along with accessories, optical fibre routers, LAN servers, Wi-fi routers, Wi-fi-switches, mobile phones, incriminating evidence of foreign payment gateways, fraud bank accounts and data of lakhs of UK income taxpayers.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel said the call centre had been operating since February this year. The racketeers duped UK-based citizens of their money by claiming that discrepancies were found in the audit of their income tax. The number of UK-based citizens cheated and the total money the gang has earned through the illegal business is being evaluated, she said.Goel said the employees at the call centre in Naraina industrial area approached UK-based citizens through phone service over the Internet (VoIP) and posed as HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, United Kingdom) officials.Police said the call centre was raided on June 3 after the Naraina police station received information. A team was formed and 21 employees at the centre, including a floor manager, two supervisors, and 14 agents were caught.During the interrogation, the DCP said, the frauds revealed they used illegal techniques, VOIP calling, by passing the legal International Long Distance (ILD) Gateways, thus causing wrongful loss to the government exchequer. They used costly software and cheated UK-based citizens on the pretext of income tax frauds and violations of government regulations by impersonating as HMRC officials of the UK, said Goel. “These fraudsters are suspected to have links abroad who helped them by providing data of international citizens and also assisted them with international payment gateways,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-bust-fake-international-call-centre-arrest-21-for-duping-uk-citizens-101623000690059.html

The score card and rankings in the Anemia Mukt Bharat Index are based on certain parameters like coverage of IFA supplementation across beneficiaries to support assessment of progress and performance of the programme.“Himachal Pradesh was at rank 18 in the year 2018-19, but with consistent efforts of the government and the field functionaries, the state was able to achieve the third spot,” said Dr Jindal.Anemia remains a major public health issue with high prevalence across the country irrespective of gender, age and geography. India is one of the countries with anemia as a serious public health concern today. Almost 50% of the pregnant women, 59% of children fewer than five years of age, 54% of adolescent girls and 53% of non-pregnant non-lactating women in India are anemic.Anemia during pregnancy is associated with post-partum haemorrhage, neural tube defects, low birth weight, premature births, stillbirths and maternal deaths. In other populations, anemia is associated with lowered immunity, poor cognitive development and decreased work productivity. The morbidity and mortality risks associated with anemia calls for an urgent need to design an effective strategy to address this public health problem. The decline in anaemia prevalence will in turn contribute in improved maternal and child survival rates, and improved health outcomes for other population groups.Considering the slow progress that is less than 1% per annum in reduction of anemia from 2005 to 2015, the Government of India launched the Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) strategy under the Prime Minister’s Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nourishment (POSHAN) Abhiyaan with the target to reduce anaemia by 3% per year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/himachal-jumps-to-third-spot-in-anemia-mukt-bharat-index-101622999437291.html

He later became part of the Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) that contested the district development council (DDC) polls jointly last year. He, however, parted ways from the alliance after winning eight seats.“The newly elected DDC members seem to be fed up of the government. People seem to be fed up of the newly elected DDC members. And the government is fed up with both the DDC and people. Government of the day is comfortable with a non-political set up. I think aiming at a non-people non-DDC set up,” Lone said in a tweet.Lone’s party now controls two DDC councils -- Baramulla and Kupwara -- in J&K, however, he seems to be annoyed with the bureaucracy and has been targeting them on social media. Earlier, he also made a veiled attack at former J&K chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam, stating that the latter nursed hatred towards the people of Kashmir.“Will be remembered as the darkest person in the darkest hours of Kashmir. A person consumed by the self and also consumed by hatred for Kashmiris. Saw expression of naked hatred for Kashmiris and belittlement of Kashmiris as a means of upward mobility for his self,” Lone had said in a series of tweets.“Trespassed into a domain which belonged to the political class. Made statements which were unambiguously political in nature. Made a trespass into the dividing line between politics and bureaucracy,” he said in another tweet. “Actually had delusions of Godliness. Thought of himself as God. Dropped big names. Boasted of having kicked out gubernatorial entities,” Lone had written.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-comfortable-with-non-political-setup-in-j-k-lone-101622999436092.html

He has created a story which is everything but science. The contents of the letter are intimidating and harassing. This has demoralised the whole medical fraternity …,” it said quoting DAK general secretary Dr Suhail Shah.“If a doctor will not do the talking during the pandemic, then who will,” it questioned.On June 2, Hassan, who is a regular at updating about various aspects and research regarding Covid and has been a strong advocate for vaccination, had said, “If you are allergic to any component of the vaccine, you are advised not to take it”.“However, if you have a history of allergic reactions that aren’t related to Covid vaccine such as food, medicine, latex, insects and environmental triggers, you may take the shot,” he had said.The DC’s letter to the government has sought action against this statement.Asad said as of June 1, 33,23,862 doses of Covid vaccine have been administered in Jammu and Kashmir, and no severe/ adverse effects of its ingredients have been detected in 99.99% beneficiaries.“The statement has created apprehensions among general public about the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccine. Such kind of unscientific, un-researched statements lead to erosion of faith in medical science and dampen the efforts to vaccinate the targeted population,” the DC’s letter said.Condemning the letter, DAK spokesperson Dr Riyaz Ahmad Dagga said the contents of the letter are “baseless, unscientific and defamatory for the DAK president.“Dr Nisar is a senior consultant at GMCH Srinagar and is also an influenza and pandemic expert. He has been at the forefront in the fight against the pandemic by treating Covid patients tirelessly since the public health crisis began in 2020,” said DAK’s Sunday statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/srinagar-dc-doctor-slug-it-out-over-covid-vax-safety-101622999372105.html

06-06-2021||Pune||​Ajit Pawar hints of two-member ward system for civic polls||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has hinted at a two-member ward system for next year’s civic polls in the state after deputy chief minister and NCP senior leader Ajit Pawar expressed his opinion in the favour of a two-member ward system. The then Devendra Fadnavis government had introduced four-member ward system before 2017 municipal elections in nine local bodies including Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad while in Mumbai, there was a single-member ward system. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Pawar said, “In my view, there should be two-member ward system in the upcoming civic polls. However, senior leaders in Maha Vikas Aghadi senior will take a final call on the panel system.” The change in ward-system is key to strategizing civic polls, as seen in the past. After clarifying that it is his personal opinion, Pawar added, “There are many civic polls and Zilla Parishad elections scheduled between November 2021 and February 2022. However, the state election commission will take a final decision on the background of Covid-19 pandemic situation.” Having lost the last civic polls in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, NCP has already started preparations with Pawar conducting a party meeting in Pune. Pawar said the previous BJP government took the decision for their convenience. Pawar has also instructed party workers and leaders to be prepared for the civic polls and demanded suggestions for an alliance and strategy to win the civic body polls. In the meeting with NCP leaders and workers, many had demanded scrapping of the present four-member panel system of wards and introduced a two members system to keep away the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which is the ruling party in PMC with a majority. NCP believes that smaller ward arrangement is beneficial for the party to win more seats. Smaller size of wards forces the voters to focus on the candidates rather than party and voters tend to vote for a party as there are more ‘unknown’ or ‘lesser known’ candidates in the fray in the larger size of wards (prabhags). Of the total 164 seats, BJP currently has a majority with 98 corporators and it is the ruling party in PMC. The NCP is the second largest party with 42 corporators followed by Shiv Sena and Congress 10 each, MNS 2, AIMIM-01||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ajit-pawar-hints-of-two-member-ward-system-for-civic-polls-101622996429938.html

The department of women, child development and social security has so far identified 234 such children, officials said on Sunday.The identification of such children, that was started last month after chief minister Hemant Soren’s direction, is still on. Special secretary at the department DK Saxena said, “Till now, we have identified as many as 234 children who have lost either one parent or both during Covid-19 pandemic. The identification process of such children is, however, still on and will continue.” The department has, however, still not segregated the number of children left with a single parent and those orphaned. “Details about children left with single parent or with none is being separated at the district level. It will be uploaded on the NCPCR (National Commission for Protection of Child Rights) website by the districts,” Saxena said. Chief minister Hemant Soren recently said that the government will take care of children who lost their parents to the pandemic. The government has also issued a centralised helpline number, besides helpline numbers at the district level for information of such children.The chief minister also directed district administration officials to ensure proper care for such children, as many of them were left vulnerable to exploitation and child trafficking.Soren also said if any other family member of such children agree to look after them, they will be given monthly sponsorship assistance.Identification of such children was being done in coordination with district child welfare committees (CWC). The committees were also chalking out strategies for rehabilitation of such children. Ranchi’s CWC chairperson Rupa Verma said, “There are 19 cases under process so far in Ranchi district. Many phone calls are also coming from outside Ranchi. We are coordinating with respective districts for such cases.”Citing an example, she said an 18-year-old boy from Jamtara, who emerged as the district topper in matriculation examinations, called and narrated that he lost both his parents to Covid-19. “The meritorious boy, who is a single child, sought help for education and livelihood. Even though this is not a case of our district, we talked to many educational institutes, who agreed to teach him free of cost.”Verma said they were also getting several cases where orphaned children do not want to stay with their relatives. “We are chalking out alternative plans such as child care home for such children,” she said.She said a school student, who lost both his parents, was now staying with his uncle in Ranchi. “When this boy was asked the help he expects from the government, he said he will like to continue his education at a boarding school. He doesn’t want to stay with his uncle,” she said.About the financial assistance scheme for such children, Verma said under a state government scheme, orphaned children will be given an assistance of ₹2,000 per month, besides other facilities, including food and education.Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also announced a number of welfare measures for children who lost their parents to Covid-19. The Centre recently announced that PM-CARES fund will contribute through a specially designed scheme to create a corpus of ₹10 lakh for each of them, when he or she reaches 18 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/over-234-j-khand-children-lost-parents-in-covid-19-second-wave-101622995889936.html

06-06-2021||Patna||Patna’s 12 pvt clinics under scanner for overcharging Covid patients||At least 12 private hospitals in Patna are under the scanner for charging patients more than the rate fixed by the state government for treatment of coronavirus while many others have been let off the hook because of the grey area in the health department’s order, silent on investigations and drugs. The Patna district administration has lodged FIRs against four private health facilities in this connection so far. It has also facilitated in refunding excess payment to as many as five patients, encouraging them to withdraw their complaints. The Patna district administration, which has been proactive in this regard, has received 31 complaints against private health clinics overcharging patients. Twelve among them have been examined and show-cause notices issued. The complaints have been filed either directly by patients or their relatives and friends, generally, after they were discharged from health centres. “In as many as five cases, we succeeded in facilitating the refund of excess amount to patients or their relatives. FIRs were registered against private health centres who did not cooperate with our investigations,” said Chandrashekhar Singh, Patna’s district magistrate (DM), who constituted a special task force, comprising administrative officers, doctor, drug inspector, magistrate and police officers, for this purpose. The Patna district administration had empanelled a total of 91 private health facilities for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. They were, however, supposed to charge patients within the government-approved treatment rate, capped at a maximum of ₹15,000 per day for non- National Accredited Board of Hospitals (NABH) hospitals in Patna and ₹18,000 per day for NABH hospitals. “We found that some empanelled hospitals were charging patients up to ₹50,000 per day. In some cases, they would charge patients ₹1,00,000 in the first couple of days and then release patients or threaten to release them, taking the alibi that the government was not making oxygen available to them. We dealt sternly with all such hospitals and lodged FIRs against a few, sending a strong message across all private hospitals. Automatically, many others fell in line and began toeing the government order,” said Singh. “Inquiries into several other similar complaints are on and we will take them to their logical conclusion,” said Richie Pandey, Patna’s deputy development commissioner, also the senior nodal officer, treatment cell of Covid-19, constituted by the DM. The Hindustan Times has accessed a “provisional in-patient bill” of a well-known NABH-hospital in Patna that raised a bill of ₹2.44 lakh for 10-day hospitalisation between October 25 and November 4, 2020. Interestingly, the hospital has levied ₹38,000 as bed charges in Covid “daycare unit” (ward type), ₹42,495 for laboratory investigations, ₹29,000 as miscellaneous charges, ₹23,960 as ward procedure, ₹9,240 under hospital procedure and ₹5,200 as in-patient consultation charge. A whopping ₹94,070 has been raised against in-patient drug sale. Closer scrutiny of the bill revealed that the patient was prescribed costly investigations, either daily or every second day. Some of the common investigations prescribed included liver function test, renal function test, complete blood count, D-Dimer (helps rule out the presence of a serious blood clot), ferritin (it helps understand how much iron the body stores), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) test, which looks for signs of damage to the body’s tissues, interleukin-6 (to check for chronic inflammatory disorders), C-reactive protein test (to check the level of c-reactive protein, produced by liver, in blood), urine culture and sensitivity test, etc. The August 20, 2020 order of the health department, fixing treatment rates for Covid-19, however, did not specify tests and drugs. As such, the hospitals exploited this loophole to the fullest and charged patients, prescribing these tests at their whims and fancy. Patna district magistrate accepted having come across several such cases. “We came across many such cases where costly drugs and investigations were prescribed repeatedly to patients. We could not do much because the government order fixing treatment rates only mentions basic medicines and tests, without specifying them. We have flagged it to the health department,” said Singh. “Doctors should tickle their professional morality and not exploit patients in crisis,” he added. In Gaya, two complaints were lodged of patients being overcharged, said its district magistrate Abhishek Singh. In both cases, the private facilities refunded the excess amount to patients as soon as the district administration proceeded against them. The district administration even de-empanelled one of the 17 facilities for treatment of Covid-19 in the district after it overcharged a patient for high resolution computed tomography of thorax (chest), the government-approved being ₹3,000..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patnas-12-pvt-clinics-under-scanner-for-overcharging-covid-patients-101622995409920.html

Meanwhile, he had been at home for 15 days before his murder as he was undergoing treatment for Covid-19 infection. This had created hurdles in the woman’s extra marital affair. That is the reason the two decided to kill him and blame it on Covid. On the night of April 23, Sutar bought and gave sleeping pills to the man’s wife,” read the police statement.

They are not even gangsters,” the Additional Sessions Judge stated in an order dated June 5.He further said that the plea is not required at this stage as the accused are not being produced in the court physically due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The judge also noted the replies submitted by the Superintendent of Mandoli and Tihar jail, Additional DCP (Special Cell) and DCP of third battalion of Delhi Police, on the plea.The DCP told the court that in the aftermath of an attempt made by armed assailants to free an undertrial prisoner at GTB Hospital, the police had decided to request the court for permission to handcuff high-risk prisoners who are prone to escape.“As part of the exercise, the current application for handcuffing UTPs Umar Khalid and Khalid Saifi was moved for the consideration of Hon'ble Court,” the senior police officer stated in a reply submitted to the court on April 26.However, in the reply given by the Additional DCP of Special Cell, it was stated that no such application seeking to produce both the accused in handcuffs, was filed before any court or other authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/they-are-not-gangsters-court-rejects-plea-to-produce-umar-khalid-khalid-saifi-in-handcuffs-101622990947470.html

On one side there is Covid, people are confined to their homes and on the other hand, they want to allow the yatra. Who will stop them? They are the owners. Whatever decision they have to take, they will do it,” she said. The 56-day yatra is scheduled to start from June 28 this year, though there have been demands for cancelling the pilgrimage amid the lurking threat of another wave after the second wave ravaged the country. Last year too, the government had cancelled the yatra amid the first wave.Mufti said the government does whatever it wants. “Do they listen to the people of Jammu and Kashmir? If they would have listened to what people want, they would not have booked 15 year olds under Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. They do whatever they want to do,” she said.She condemned the killing of BJP leader and municipal chairman of Tral Rakesh Pandita, who was fired upon by suspected militants on Wednesday. “We condemn the killing of Rakesh Pandit. There is no outcome of such actions. Instead, we get defamed here in J&K by such actions. And the whole state has to bear the consequences,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mehbooba-on-amarnath-yatra-decision-does-govt-listen-to-us-101622990969662.html

On Saturday, deputy commissioner (DC), Srinagar, Mohammad Aijaz Asad wrote a letter to the UT’s Medical Education Department seeking action over Hassan’s statement and called it “antithetical to the scientific evidence”.On Sunday, the DAK issued a strongly worded statement against Asad terming his letter “unscientific and defamatory”.“The contents of the DC’s letter were unscientific and misleading. He has created a story that is everything but science. The contents of the letter are intimidating and harassing. This has demoralized the whole medical fraternity …,” the statement quoted General Secretary of DAK, Dr Suhail Shah.“If a doctor will not do the talking during the pandemic, then who will?” it questioned.On June 2, Hassan, who is a regular at updating about various aspects and researches regarding Covid-19, and has been a strong advocate of vaccination, said, “If you are allergic to any component of the vaccine, you are advised not to take it”.“However, if you have a history of allergic reactions that aren’t related to the Covid-19 vaccine, such as food, medicine, latex, insects and environmental triggers, you can get the vaccine,’’ he said.Asad’s letter to the government sought action against this statement by what it said was a “so-called self-styled DAK president” Dr Nisar-ul-Hassan.“… the above statement is antithetical to the scientific evidence,” Asad wrote.He said that so far 33,23,862 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir as of June 1, and no severe/adverse effects of its components have been detected in 99.99% of the beneficiaries.“The statement has created apprehensions among the general public about the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines. Such kind of un-scientific, un-researched statements lead to erosion of faith in medical science and dampen the efforts to vaccinate the targeted population,” the letter said.Condemning the letter, DAK spokesperson, Dr Riyaz Ahmad Dagga said the contents of the letter are “baseless, unscientific and defamatory for the clean and honest image” of the DAK president.“Dr Nisar is a senior consultant, medicine, GMC Srinagar, and is also influenza and pandemic expert. He has been at the forefront in the fight against the pandemic by treating Covid-19 patients tirelessly since the public health crisis began in 2020,” the statement said.The spokesperson further said when people, including healthcare workers, were initially hesitant to take the vaccine, Dr Nisar was among the first to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.“The DAK has set up helpline numbers to address the public concerns related to Covid-19. And recently, we received a call from a young male, an engineer by profession, who developed severe anaphylaxis to Covaxin for which he was hospitalised. He wanted to know if he can receive a second dose of the same vaccine,” he said.“In response to this, the DAK issued a statement asking people who are allergic to the components of the vaccine not to take the jab, lest they might face any severe reaction, hampering their lives and also creating doubts in the minds of people vis-à-vis the vaccine,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/what-is-scientific-doctor-bureaucrat-fight-it-out-over-covid-19-vaccination-in-kashmir-101622989530446.html
06-06-2021||Kolkata||BJP intensifies campaign on post-poll violence in Bengal after man’s murder||Violence by Trinamool Congress (TMC) after the West Bengal assembly polls continues unabated, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged on Sunday afternoon after Jaiprakash Yadav, a labourer, was killed by a crude bomb in the Jagaddal area of North 24 Parganas district.The BJP alleged that with Yadav’s death, the number of party workers killed since the announcement of poll results on May 2 touched 27. The party has been carrying out a relentless campaign not just in Bengal but other states as well. On Sunday, the issue was discussed at a meeting held at the Delhi residence of BJP national president JP Nadda. Claiming that Yadav was a BJP supporter, Arjun Singh, the party’s Lok Sabha MP from the district’s Barrackpore constituency, said, “TMC has unleashed terror in the district and other parts of Bengal. I have informed the governor,” said the former TMC leader who joined the BJP before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He also virtually attended the meeting held by Nadda. Local police officers said Yadav’s murder took place hours after a raid was conducted to nab known criminals and three firearms were seized. “We have started a probe,” an officer from the local police station said on condition of anonymity. Somnath Shyam, TMC legislator from Jagaddal said, “The incident has nothing to do with politics. It is the fallout of the BJP’s internal feud. Local people said Yadav’s killer lost his arm in the explosion. Police are conducting raids.” Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar accused the administration of inaction and asked the chief secretary to meet him on Monday.“Extremely alarming law & order scenario @MamataOfficial. Security environment is seriously compromised. In such a grim situation called upon Chief Secretary to brief me on the law and order situation on Monday 7th June and indicate all steps taken to contain post poll violence,” tweeted Dhankhar. “There is rampant post poll retributive violence @MamataOfficial. Disturbing that this ostracisation has graduated to social boycott & denial of benefits they are otherwise entitled. They are made to suffer “extortion fee” for living in their own house or run their own business,” Dhankhar wrote in a second tweet, referring to an alleged incident of social boycott of 18 people by the TMC at Mahishda in West Midnapore. A host of national leaders of the BJP, including Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, targeted Bengal’s ruling party on this issue on Saturday. While the TMC alleged that the list circulated on social media was fake the local police registered a case of rumour-mongering. TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh, who was made a state general secretary by chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday, said, “The governor feels unwell if he does not write tweets against the state government. He is an agent of the BJP. Before the polls, he called for a change in the government. No governor can do that.”In the recent polls, the TMC bagged 213 of the state’s 294 seats while the BJP could wrest only 77. “It is the governor’s job to look after the welfare of citizens. He can always summon the chief secretary and ask why BJP workers are being targeted. These incidents are sending a message to people across the nation,” said BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar. To make the alleged violence a political issue across India, leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, has held virtual meetings with BJP leaders across several states. On June 2, more than 600 academicians from several states signed a joint statement against the alleged post-poll violence in Bengal. They appealed to the National Human Rights Commission, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and the National Commission for Women to conduct probes. Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear some petitions seeking a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the alleged violence. On May 24, as many as 146 retired public servants, including former judges, bureaucrats, ambassadors and police and army officers wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking an SIT headed by a retired Supreme Court judge. Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “If the Hathras incident in Uttar Pradesh can become national news and prompt opposition parties to target the BJP, why should not the violence in Bengal be discussed by people across the nation? Ten people were killed between May 2 and May 5, the day Mamata Banerjee took the oath as chief minister. After that, 27 more were murdered.”Bhattacharya alleged that many women were raped or molested but nobody dared to file a police complaint either fearing social ostracism or because of threats. TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said the BJP is carrying out a malicious campaign. “There is no such widespread violence,” he said. Police investigation into some of the alleged murders has pointed at death by suicide. Days after taking the oath, Banerjee said 16 people were killed in post-poll violence and half of the victims were TMC workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bjp-intensifies-campaign-on-post-poll-violence-in-bengal-after-man-s-murder-101622989470532.html
06-06-2021||Pune||Action against 33 dilapidated wadas this year, redevelopment on the cards||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has taken action against a total of 33 dilapidated wada structures this year which is more in comparison to last year. In 2020, the PMC demolished only 12 structures due to lockdown restrictions. PMC officials observed that the dispute between developers and tenants is dropping due to the extra Floor Space Index (FSI) and 300 sq ft of free tenement. Therefore, the problem of dilapidated wadas will be resolved completely in the upcoming years. The wadas hold a unique characteristic and legacy of Pune, the structure is two to three storied tall and these old structures are mostly located in the heart of the city. Usually, they are square or rectangular in shape having a courtyard at the centre. During the rule of the Maratha dynasty, the wada culture was introduced in the Pune region. As per statistics of the PMC, there were 1,204 wada structures existing in the city. However, the number has gone down due to cave-in incidents, PMC’s demolition drive and development by builders. At present, there are only 330 wadas left in the city. As per state government guidelines, PMC has categorised wada structures in three categories such as very dangerous (C-I), repair structure with vacating (C-II), repair structure without vacating (C-III). According to the statistics of PMC, there are four structures in the class-I category. There are 211 wadas in the class-II and 115 in the class-III category. All the remaining 330 wadas are located at Sukhrawar peth, Raviwar peth, Sadhashiv and Navi peth, Shaniwar peth, Narayan peth, Somwar peth, Mangalwar peth, Budhwar peth, Rastha peth, Bhavani peth, Ghorpade peth, Nana peth, Ganesh peth, Kasba peth, Guruwar peth, Mahatma phule peth. Rajendra Raut, superintendent engineer of building permission and development department said, “Every year before beginning of monsoon, the PMC conducts a survey of dangerous structures which are mainly old buildings such as wadas in the city and issues notices to vacate them. If residents deny vacating the structure, we forcefully vacate them and demolish the structure. But it happens in very rare cases. Last year, we took special permission from the High Court to demolish dangerous structures and have demolished 12 such structures so far. Some are completely demolished, and some are partially demolished. The action was limited due to strict restriction of lock down.” He further said, “This year, the number has increased, and it went to 33 as Covid restrictions are not so strict as compared to last year. Four structures were demolished completely and the remaining part of the wada structure was partially knocked down.” Disputes lower; redevelopment gathers momentum Disputes among owners, tenants and developers are the major hurdle in the development of wada structures in the city. To resolve the issue, the state government issued guidelines in 2015 to provide certificates to tenants to maintain their claim in property in wadas which are in dilapidated condition. Sudhir Kadam, executive engineer of building permission and development department said, “The state government’s decision to issue certificate to tenants and PMCs offered to give extra floor Space Index (FSI) and 300 square feet tenements to wada tenants in 2017 Pune city’s development Plan (DP) opened new era of development of the long pending wada issue. There is another wada cluster policy pending at the state government level to boost the development of the wada. If approved, it will speed up the development of the wada in the heart of the city as most of the wadas are located in the heart of the city. Redevelopment of wadas is a key factor of development of the heart of the city as there is no open space available in these areas.” He further said, “ From 2017, the redevelopment of wada structures has got momentum as builders are getting extra FSI as well as permission to develop some part of the structure for commercialpurposes. The wada structure problem will be sorted out in the coming four-five years.” Nirmala Kolhe, owner of Gaikwadwada located at Rasta peth, said, “Due to extra FSI and free tenements to tenants helped us to develop our wada. The developer is happy with these new rules, and he undertook the redevelopment of our wada in 2017. The redevelopment of wada was pending for more than two decades. Now, it is almost solved. We are happy that every stakeholder is getting their share including tenants.”  Dilipidated wadas by the numbers Type I Total structures: 4 Action taken: 4 Action pending: 0 Type II Total structures: 211 Action taken: 155 Action pending: 56 Type III Total structures: 115 Action taken: NA Action pending: NA Total structures: 330 Action taken: 159 Action pending: 56 PMC identified 33 dangerous dilapidated wada structures Name of area Number of structure Kasba peth- 02 Shaniwar peth- 06 Narayan peth- 03 Bhavani peth- 04 Budhwar peth- 02 Rastha peth- 02 Ganesh peth- 05 Raviwar peth- 01 Somwar peth- 01 Nana peth- 02 Shukrawar peth- 01 Guruwar peth- 01 Ghorpade peth- 01 Mahatma phule peth- 01 Navi peth- 01 Total 33||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/action-against-33-dilapidated-wadas-this-year-redevelopment-on-the-cards-101622988809723.html
06-06-2021||Pune||City-based architect converts terraces into productive landscapes||Lockdown has been tough on many professionals, however, Saleel Savarkar, a city-based architect and urban designer has found a way to release stress and convert it into a sound investment.Savarkar cofounded My Homestead, an urban farming company with likeminded friends who help people convert their terraces into productive landscapes. “Gardening is all soulful searching. It is all about life and passion and at a time when the pace of life was in peril, the pace of growing plants seemed more encouraging and blissful. It was my single source of enjoyment and encouragement. My garden has a unique blend of fully trees popping into it and my own planted shrubbery,” said Savarkar. He lives in a quaint family in a condominium complex in Erandwane. Calling it as level four of his house, this barren terrace has now become the reason to look forward to, being together and sharing and generating positive vibes with family members and friends. “As an avid gardener, I had always found my love for plants often not matching the mark of my actions. The lockdown following the global pandemic last year gave us an opportunity to relook at a vacant terrace space and reimagining it as a thriving mini ecosystem. It has been a year into this process of gardening and home farming that have been a seamless integration into my daily routine,” he added. Over the years, the terrace seemed to have gathered over 100 pots lying unused. What started off as a sowing and planting exercise in May 2020, assumed the proportion of careful planning, making budgets and finally ordering and planting shrubs, plants and even trees on a terrace. “The idea was to give a sense of signature ‘Gharchi Baug’ a recollection of the bungalow garden which I had always heard from my grandparents and parents as a treasure they enjoyed through their childhood and growing years. We chose a selection of flowering plants, typically Indian flowers. Along with it we chose certain Ayurvedic herbs, kitchen herbs and some flowering trees that can grow in large pots. To fill the gaps and give a sense of evergreen, we chose certain minimum exotic flora like crotons and grass,” he added. “My father, Sanjay Savarkar, was an avid gardener. He would have been 60 this year. We initially coincided the culmination of our phase 1 in June last year to celebrate what would have been his 60th year with 60 potted plants. Gradually new ideas, new efforts and new inspirations has now made level 4 a thriving garden of over 250 plants and some trees,” said Savarkar. He encountered many people who had to give away a part of their home plants because of relocation and redevelopment last year, that he happily adopted their plants. “Covid lockdown has got its tremendous downside in our personal and professional lives. But it also taught us the essence of time, patience and joint efforts and the taste of hard work and family values, just as I learned through home gardening,” said Savarkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/citybased-architect-converts-terraces-into-productive-landscapes-101622988509756.html

The garbage is also falling out of the crevices of the tin-sheets and no efforts were being taken to plug the holes in the walls and tin-sheets, residents allege. A spot visit to the site revealed that the cement concrete walls of the project had developed holes and cement was falling to pieces due to lack of repairs. The PMC building permissions department recently ordered audit of four walls which are unsafe for the residents but seems to have missed its own wall which too required immediate restoration and repairs, residents and commuters said. The site located on the main road opposite Rajiv Gandhi Zoology Park and Wildlife Research centre was started eight years ago to cater to garbage segregation generated from five wards of the corporation. The plant segregates an average of 400 tonnes of garbage and the dry garbage is sent to Hadapsar garbage depot for further processing. Nandkumar Shinde, an area resident said, “There is a lot of garbage accumulated inside the campus and it is loaded onto the walls due to which they are breaking while garbage is flowing out of the crevices from the sides which have been protected by tin sheets. The garbage is flowing out on the road and is creating problems for commuters and residents alike due to foul smell and possibility of airborne viruses attacking the residents due to the polluted nature of the waste. Also, there is a possibility that the walls might collapse, and it could be dangerous for the commuters and citizens passing near the site.” Solid Waste Management department engineer ( Zone 3) Latika Mhaske said, “An onsite inspection has been conducted to look at the current state of problems at the garbage plant. A fresh tender seeking repairs and restoration of the protective walls and other essential works be released and the work will be completed at the earliest under the guidance of the seniors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/protective-walls-of-katraj-garbage-segregation-plant-in-urgent-need-of-repairs-101622988449614.html

A notification to this effect was issued on Friday night."The state government is taking a calculated risk and hence people have to take care of themselves. Nothing is going to be eased immediately. Some criteria and levels have been fixed and the local administration will take decisions on whether to ease restrictions and further tighten them," the chief minister said.As per the 'unlock' notification, areas with positivity rate of five per cent or less and oxygen bed occupancy of less than 25 per cent will be in the first category, and can open up completely.Whereas in the fifth category areas, with positivity rate of more than 20 per cent, only essential shops will remain open and office attendance will be capped at 15 per cent.During the meeting, Thackeray also said that the state should set an example before the country by showing that the industrial sector can function uninterrupted by following all Covid-19 norms during restrictions."We should not let ourselves be knocked down by the virus," he said."Neither a lockdown is required nor do we want to get knocked down by the virus. So all health related rules have to be followed," Thackeray added.He said if there is a need to go for another lockdown after the possible third wave, there should be no impact on manufacturing."Industries should set up temporary accommodations in their premises for their staff and employees.

06-06-2021||Pune||Your Space: Vaccination vital to handle Covid wave||Pune city is seeing a drop in Covid cases and positivity rate. The administration has partially eased lockdown restrictions and allowed non-essential shops to reopen. With medical experts predicting a third wave, residents share suggestions that authorities and residents can take to tackle it? PMC action plan ready for third wave “Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has prepared an action plan to tackle the possible Covid third wave. The civic body is setting up 160 oxygen beds and 40 ICU beds at a special paediatric ward in Rajiv Gandhi hospital at Yerawada. PMC has also reserved beds at COEP Jumbo facility and Baner hospital, besides appointing paediatricians. The civic administration has reserved more than 1,000 beds at private hospitals which include 623 oxygen beds, 177 ICU beds and 95 ventilator beds. At the oxygen concentrator library, PMC has 117 concentrators. Dr Ashish Bharati Vaccine is the strongest protection There was an unexpected spike in Covid deaths and acute shortage of hospital beds during the second wave of Covid-19. Vaccine is the most potent tool to fight the Covid infection. Though we do not have a concrete data on the level of protection offered by the various vaccines against the mutant strains, most of the experts agree that some degree of protection against severe infections do exist. Therefore, relying on vaccines is the most rational way to prevent a third wave. But it is not also on war footing. We are still struggling to purchase vaccines from different companies. Manoj Shetty Follow precautions regarding kids Learning from the first wave experience, we should not be casual. I appeal to parents to follow precaution regarding their kids. Though the government and private hospitals have made preparations to tackle the third wave, we should also be alert. Maximum vaccination can develop herd immunity. The vaccination is not up to the mark at present, so we should have to be more cautious. We should have to boost the immunity of our children with healthy food. Dr Kalpana Baliwant Not learnt from past experience The city reported record cases during the first and second wave of Covid. Child is the main concern of every family and I am very much concerned about my kids. I cannot rely on the government machinery as far as my experience is concerned. Many lost their lives for lack of proper medical help. Our country and city have not learnt from past experience. Rohit Bhujbal Govt’s plan doesn’t involve parents association We are worried about kids. Kids cannot tell or express what they are feeling? So, it is difficult to face the third wave. Kids are already irritable due to lockdown restrictions. They have become impatient. Now, what kind of restriction should we put on them? It is a very sticky situation for kids and parents. We cannot totally depend on the government as they are claiming to be prepared for the third wave. But, where is the plan? The government has not involved any parents association in their plan of action. Devendra Dhumal Parents are confused We are aware about news reports regarding the possible Covid third wave and its effect on kids. But, no one tells us what kind of precautions parents should take to avoid infection to kids. Parents are confused and don’t know what to do. We are getting only warnings from authorities. It is good that schools are closed, but still parents are worried as they are going outside for work and therefore are at risk of getting infected. Vandana Belsare Kids should be vaccinated Actually, the government should give priority to children’s vaccination. We don’t want to be careless when it comes to kids. The percentage of children is less as compared to other age groups. It will take less time and less dosage. No parent wants their kids to fall sick and get infected. The government should show some mercy at least towards kids. Mrunal Kirve Waiting for government guidelines I am worried as the government has failed to tackle the second wave. I am concerned for my one and a half month old baby. Many people have lost their lives to Covid. When it comes to kids, I panic. We can take care of ourselves, but what about kids? There is no clear direction from health experts. We are eagerly waiting for guidelines and steps taken by the government. I cannot imagine if it hits our kids. When we discuss the issue in the family, we become restless. Shrutika Randhir Vaccination is key factor The pace of vaccination will be a key factor in preparing for the third wave. We are inoculating the elderly, and it is showing results, but it is important that we vaccinate the younger population as well. We can’t emphasise this enough. Now, the third wave is predicted and we are back to square one. Yogesh Dhudhal Give jab to parents on priority The preparations for the third wave have to go beyond just medical infrastructure and oxygen supply. The younger population might be the most vulnerable group in the third wave. With most senior citizens getting vaccinated by then, those below 18 years, if not vaccinated, would be the most vulnerable. Infections among children would be a bigger concern. Home isolation of infected children is very difficult without parents’ supervision; therefore, vaccination of parents should be given priority. If they are immunised, the risk of them getting infected while handling Covid positive children will be minimal. Sachin Potdar Proactive steps needed from authorties I am afraid of the third wave. I cannot imagine what will happen to kids. How does the government provide medical facilities to parents? I have two kids. I am taking extra care of them. But, I don’t know what the government is doing for our children. We survived the first and second waves. But, we are more concerned for our children. Government should have to show readiness to tackle the third wave.

06-06-2021||Delhi||Just interested in abusing Kejriwal: Sisodia slams BJP over ration delivery plan||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday hit back at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for impeding the launch of doorstep ration delivery and said the party is only interested in abusing chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and not controlling the ration mafia. Sisodia also accused the BJP of aiding the theft of ration of 800 million people across the country, reported news agency ANI."I was hoping that the BJP leaders would understand the matter and would take note of the fact that if pizza can be delivered then why not ration. However, listening to Sambit Patra's press conference, he did not utter a word about this scheme. He did mention that 80 crore people get ration but skipped highlighting the problems faced by the poor in procuring their ration. He is not interested in stopping the stealing of the poor's fraction of ration but instead, he is more interested in abusing the chief minister," the news agency quoted the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader as saying.Also read: Kejriwal says Centre stalling doorstep delivery of ration in Delhi, aiding mafiaThe BJP wants the ration theft to continue in India and its leaders will 'abuse' anyone who is against it, Sisodia added, referring to Patra's comments on Kejriwal. Earlier in the day, Sambit Patra accused Delhi's chief minister of doing drama for politics and called the home-delivery of rations scheme a scam."Chief Minister @ArvindKejriwal ji wants that ration reaches every poor's house. BJP says there is no need to do anything against theft of ration. If home delivery of pizza can be done then why not ration for the poor man?" Sisodia also tweeted, drawing forward the line of argument that the chief minister gave earlier in the day during a virtual press conference."They are not only saving the ration mafia but are also promoting it," the deputy chief minister added, as he continued accusing the BJP of ration theft.Kejriwal claimed that the home delivery of ration scheme was stalled by the government and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow the rollout of the scheme for the benefit of 7 million people in the national capital. Kejriwal also claimed that the ration shops have the potential to become 'super spreader' locations in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/just-interested-in-abusing-kejriwal-sisodia-slams-bjp-over-ration-delivery-plan-101622971615519.html
06-06-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: Learning from children the fine art of acting||I jokingly say that I had five “first films”. I had been trying to get one made for about a decade and that “one” film kept changing. One even came very close to entering production before the financers backed out at the last moment. And finally, the process of the film that became my first directorial — “Dhappa” — was so fast and unexpected that at every turn I was expecting it to stop. But thankfully it didn’t! When Girish Kulkarni narrated the story to me, he took me on a ride of the world he had created. He is a master at narration and creating many characters, each one complete with their personal motivation and traits. I had fun listening to him! When we wrote that story down on paper and listed the characters I realised that there were eight characters in the lead, and seven of them were kids! I had never worked with kids before, but I had performed in a play for children. The one thing I remembered distinctly was how unfiltered their reactions were! If they loved something they would be all praises but if they didn’t like it, then god help you! A friend of mine had conducted workshops for children while prepping them for a film and I decided to take the same route. Since it was also my first film, I knew I was going to be overwhelmed with unknown pressures and I wanted to be mentally prepared to face it all. And not knowing how to extract performances from children was never an option. We conducted an open round of audition and received an excellent response from nearly five hundred children. Out of those we shortlisted around a hundred. We conducted another round of audition for the shortlisted ones and out of them I personally selected thirty such children who were promising and were also close to our characters. While the script was being written on the one hand, we decided to conduct a weeklong workshop of all thirty children. Even they and their parents seemed interested in it. “Dhappa” dealt with a socially relevant topic and I was looking out for children who were sensitive, who could empathise and, of course, who could act at the drop of a hat. Without giving the idea of the film away, I asked them to improvise scenes which were totally similar to the ones in the film. Slowly but surely they started becoming friends even though they were of different ages. Even I started seeing my characters in them. The most interesting situation I faced was that there was a girl named Deepali Borkar who had such an amazing presence and was quite the performer, but unfortunately she wasn’t suitable for any of the roles. I talked to her and her parents if she would still like to be a part of the film, we could develop her role along the way. They were gracious enough to accept and she was cast as the younger sister of one of the principal characters who follows him everywhere! She doesn’t have too many lines, but her presence brings energy and warmth to every frame she is in. The cinematographer – Swapnil Sonawane - decided to keep the camera movement fluid and go handheld, without restricting their movement and limiting them by giving them positions. We felt that they might get caught up in the technical aspects and wanted to keep their performance as natural as possible. So, I used to choreograph a scene and never did any of us ever show the children “how” to act. We tried to help them to understand the scene and be present in the moment – whether it was a fun scene or an emotional one. And they became masters in that! I particularly remember one incident. There was a key scene which I had never narrated to them in detail. We had even skipped that scene from their script copies. So, the scene was that while the children are rehearsing for a play, some goons arrive, break their set and threaten them with dire consequences if they still went ahead with it. Feigning fear is one of the most difficult things and so I had decided to directly shoot the scene without informing the children about what was going to happen, so that we could get their natural reactions. We rehearsed with the camera and sound and the adult actors involved in it, but without the children. Then we called them and started rehearsing the play. Or so they thought. They were clueless when the actors playing the goons arrived and when the mayhem started, their reactions were amazing, which are now part of the film! For a few years I used to pat myself on the back for this scene and how I had managed to evoke those reactions. But one fine day I realised, that in that minute-long scene, which is a single take without a cut, not a single child has looked in the camera directly or has broken character! Even when they didn’t know that they were a part of the scene, they played their characters perfectly. And that got me wondering, perhaps it is time to learn something from them!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-learning-from-children-the-fine-art-of-acting-101622976270437.html

Villagers won the battle against the virus with self-discipline and fine on villagers for violation of Covid-19 protocol.”Within a month and a half, the village panchayat was declared Covid-19 free. Not only Sidhi panchayat, but more than 13000 village panchayats contained the infection after a ban on MNREGA work.People were not allowed to come out of their houses, all evening chaupals were dismissed, children were banned from playing outside while only two people were allowed to go out to purchase items from the shops for 740 families of the village panchayat. The state government divided more than 23,000 village panchayats into three parts - red zones, with more than five Covid-19 positive cases; Orange zone, having 1-5 positive cases; and green zone, with zero cases - after a surge in Covid-19 cases. The government banned MNREGA work in red zones to contain the infection, said an official.In April, 13,500 village panchayats were declared as red zone and 6,000 under the orange zone. Now, about 3,000 villages are under the orange zone and 130 under the red zone. In the second wave, rural Madhya Pradesh was badly affected and up to 60% Covid-19 positive cases in a day were reported from villages. In many villages, people died in suspicious circumstances without any tests. Crematoriums and graveyards were flooded with bodies to an extent that in many village panchayats people banned cremation.In Seoni malwa block of Hoshangabad district, which is located on the bank of Narmada river, villagers claimed that cremation of bodies increased pollution in the river. “We had never seen so many cremations in the village. People from the neighbouring villages were coming to cremate the bodies on the bank of the river so we decided to ban cremations as a large number of fish were getting killed in the river,” said Ramesh Markam, a resident of Bhiladiya village of the district. Now, the number of Covid-19 positive cases are on the decline and has even dropped to zero in many villages, he added.The state government said early detection and self-disciplined of people from rural Madhya Pradesh helped in containing the spread of Covid-19. Panchayat and rural development department principal secretary Umakant Umrao said, “Unlike urban population, seriousness and self-discipline of people in the villages of MP helped in curbing the infection.Village panchayat officials, Aganwadi and ASHA workers conducted a survey in March and identified more than 80,000 suspects in rural MP. “We established at least 14,000 Covid-19 care centres and quarantine centres for infected people. Our strategy and the effort of villagers worked and Covid-19 infection was curbed to a great extent,” he added.However, an activist, who accepts a decrease in positive cases, demanded a social audit on deaths and positivity rate in rural Madhya Pradesh.Ekta Parishad’s state general secretary Rann Singh Parmar said, “The positive cases have been reduced but the state government shouldn’t forget the suspicious deaths of so many people in rural areas. In rural MP, many people, who were suffering from many symptoms of Covid-19, died without test and treatment in April and May when the second wave hit the country but neither the villagers nor the administration knows the reason behind these deaths. A social audit should be done across all 23,000 village panchayats to know the reality.” (With inputs from Jitendra Verma from Hoshangabad)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/after-ban-on-mnrega-work-mp-villagers-contain-covid-19-spread-in-13k-panchayats-101622975729655.html

"We should not start metro immediately. For 1-2 weeks, we must experiment with 33-50 per cent occupancy. We should go slow. Otherwise, the lid will open up and we will not be able to suppress it," Dr Wig, HoD of Medicine and chairperson of AIIMS Covid task force said.While Delhi came under movement restriction from April 19 in the wake of a sharp increase in the number of cases, metro services — its lifeline — were operational for essential travel till May 9. From June 7, the services will resume in a graded approach. As experts are advising, services will first resume with 50 per cent seating capacity and standing will not be allowed. As the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation sought the co-operation of the general public and the authorities to maintain the law and order outside the stations, it also informed that only half of the available trains will be inducted into the service on Monday. The full strength of trains will be pressed into service in a graded manner by Wednesday.But this would not mean the services would be anything similar to the pre-lockdown period as passengers will have to wait outside the stations for their turn.The peak of the second wave of the pandemic in the Capital has gradually subsided but experts have already warned that this is only due to the restrictions that were maintained in the last 50 days. As the unlocking process is also starting in Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram — the National Capital Region — it is time to be on guard, experts have advised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-unlocking-aiims-doctor-has-a-word-of-caution-for-metro-services-101622971895587.html
06-06-2021||Other||Assam government launches ‘war on drugs’ to free state from menace||Two kilograms of drugs named brown sugar valued at ₹2 crore in the international market and nearly 100,000 illegal tablets valued at around ₹1.5 crore were recovered from two women on Saturday in a joint operation by Assam and Meghalaya police on the outskirts of Guwahati, officials said.“Police has caused a huge dent in the drugs network today. Now the organised cartel is under attack,” Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma tweeted soon after congratulating the team.Assam police DGP Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta informed that a special recommendation has been processed for the team involved in the operation as well as a reward for the Kamrup (Rural) district police.Though it was one of the biggest drug hauls in recent weeks, it isn’t the only such operation Assam police is involved in at present. Every day, police teams across the state are busting drug cartels, arresting traffickers and recovering contraband and cash, officials said.Though the drive against drugs has been part of the routine police operations, the campaign picked momentum last month after the new government under Himanta Biswa Sarma, who also holds the home portfolio, took charge as the chief minister.Between May 10, when the new government assumed office, and June 4, police across Assam registered 342 cases and arrested 596 people in connection to drugs. Over 10 kilograms of heroin, nearly 6,000 kilograms of marijuana, over 200,000 illegal tablets and around ₹20 lakh in cash have been recovered in this period.As per police records, there has been a big jump in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act cases in the past 10 years in the state. From 180 cases in 2010, the police registered 1,023 cases last year.“We will continue our operations against drugs continuously. Many families have been destroyed because of it, so we are taking this action as our responsibility. I am of the firm belief if our police act actively, Assam would be able to get rid of this menace,” Sarma said in Delhi last week.According to the police, Guwahati is the prime transit point in the region for drugs that enter India from Myanmar through the International Border (IB) along with Manipur and Mizoram. The drugs smuggled into the region include heroin, brown sugar, marijuana, cough syrups and methamphetamine tablets.“Drug addiction has increased immensely in Assam in recent years. Earlier, the drugs used to get transported via the state but now it is getting sold within Assam by a huge network of traffickers. Easy availability has led to more people getting addicted, especially young teenagers,” said Deepak Sahaney, project director Kripa Foundation, a drug rehabilitation centre in Guwahati.Started 16 years ago, Kripa Foundation is one of the oldest rehabilitation centres in Guwahati and has treated over 3,000 patients. At present, Assam’s biggest city has around 50 such centres.“The menace has spread from urban to rural areas now. Even small towns in Assam have drug rehabilitation centres. Mobile phones and social media platforms are aiding traffickers to get connected with users. We have had cases wherein children have assaulted parents for money to buy drugs or resorted to petty crimes like snatching,” said Sahaney.Significantly, there has been no study done by the government or private agencies on the spread of the drug menace in Assam and no data is available on the number of drug users, their profile, et cetera.“The number of users has progressively increased and most of the new users are teenagers. Addiction starts due to various reasons, including a family history of drug abuse, domestic troubles, financial problems, among others,” said Dr Tridip Choudhury, a Guwahati-based psychiatrist involved in drug rehabilitation.“The problem has to be dealt with in two ways-supply reduction, like action being taken by the police and demand reduction, which is done by professionals to bring down the number of users. Better infrastructure and more manpower are needed to ensure demand reduction as well in Assam,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-government-launches-war-on-drugs-to-free-state-from-menace-101622971829458.html

Many constructions and structures on Raigad were built by Shivaji Maharaj when he made it his capital in 1674 upon being crowned the king of the Maratha kingdom.Thackeray said the legendary warrior kinginstituted a welfare state and gave the topmost priority to his motherland."On the occasion of Shiv Rajyabhishek Day, Chief Minister Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray paid homage to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the founder of Swarajya, saying this is a golden moment engraved on the heart of Maharashtra," the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) said in a statement.

06-06-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal says Centre stalling doorstep delivery of ration in Delhi, aiding mafia||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow the state government to launch doorstep ration delivery, claiming crowded ration shops could potentially turn into Covid-19 “super-spreader” zones in the city.“If pizza, burgers, smartphones and garments can be delivered to doorsteps of people, then why not ration?” said Kejriwal in a live-streamed video press briefing.His comments came a day after his office claimed that the Centre had again “blocked” the Delhi government’s ambitious doorstep delivery of ration scheme days ahead of its launch with lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal rejecting it. Baijal’s office, however, said he did not “reject” the scheme and only “advised for the constitutional scheme of things to be followed in letter and spirit”.Kejriwal, on Sunday, also highlighted instances of Centre’s ongoing conflicts with states such as West Bengal, Jharkhand and Maharashtra and even farmer groups over the three contentious farm laws to drive home his point.“In Delhi, the doorstep delivery of ration scheme was ready to be launched next week. All necessary tenders were completed, and arrangements were in place. It would have relieved millions of people in Delhi from crowd[ing] and long queues outside ration shops. For the last 75 years, the ration distribution system across the country has been looted by the ration mafia, leading to leakages in the system depriving poor people of the food grains they are entitled to. Doorstep delivery would have been a revolutionary initiative,” said Kejriwal, citing his own days as a social activist when he was allegedly attacked by people--he chose not to identify them--for his fight against the “ration mafia”.Delhi currently has around 1.78 million ration card holder households, which according to government records, translate to 7.2 million beneficiaries. Ration is currently distributed to them through a network of 2,000-odd fair price shops.“The proposal has been turned down citing no approval from the Central government. It is untrue. We have written to the Central government five times, seeking their approval in this regard. Going by the law, we do not need any approval from the Central government in this regard. State governments are capable of implementing such schemes. In March, you asked us to remove Mukhyamantri (chief minister) from the name of the scheme, we obliged. We followed all your conditions,” said Kejriwal.This is the second time this year that the scheme has been stalled due to differences between the Delhi government and the Centre. The scheme was to be launched on March 25, but the Union food and consumer affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 raising two objections— the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and that any change in the delivery mechanism requires an amendment in NSFA that can be done only by Parliament.The Delhi government, on March 24, passed a Cabinet decision to remove the name “Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna” for the scheme and to implement doorstep delivery of ration as part of the existing NFS Act, 2013.The conflict, however, is older than that. The scheme was first approved in March 2018 but could not be implemented because of numerous administrative issues, largely revolving around methodologies allowed under the National Food Security Act. It also led to a tussle between the elected government and the lieutenant governor, leading to a demonstration outside the L-G’s office by the top leaders in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government. The matter did not progress despite the Supreme Court’s July 2018 judgment that said the L-G is bound by the “aid and advice” of the elected government in Delhi, other than matters involving land, police and public order which comes under the Centre’s domain. Before the 2020 assembly polls, the AAP government gave the project a fresh push.Kejriwal at Sunday’s press briefing said that the government has now cited a case filed by ration shop owners that is being heard in the Delhi high court for the delay in approval. “When even the high court did not impose a stay on the scheme, why did you (Central government) impose a stay on it? If you choose to stand with the ration mafia, who will stand with poor people? Interestingly, the Central government is also a party in this case. However, the Central government’s counsel did not raise a single objection against the scheme in the (high) court,” said Kejriwal.He further said, “These are difficult times. People fear getting infected because of crowds outside ration shops. There are chances of a third wave of Covid-19 which is likely to affect more children. What if people get infected in queues outside ration shops? These ration shops are potential super-spreaders. The doorstep delivery scheme can stop that from happening.”Broadening his attack on the Centre, Kejriwal added, “The Central government is fighting Mamata didi in West Bengal, the government of Jharkhand, Lakshadweep, and now the people of Delhi. They are also fighting against farmers. Why is the central government fighting everyone? We are all Indians. We are not supposed to fight with one another. We are supposed to join hands and fight against Covid-19. People want to see Prime Minister Narendra Modi joining hands with Kejriwal in enabling delivery of ration to the doorstep of 7.2 million ration beneficiaries.”Under the National Food Security Act, 2013, which governs the public distribution system (PDS), the approximately 1.78 million lakh ration card households in Delhi are divided into three categories -- priority households (PR), priority state households (PRS), and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) families. The beneficiaries under the PR and PRS categories are entitled to 5 kgs of food grains per month while AAY households receive 25 kgs wheat, 10 kgs rice and 1 kg sugar.Rebutting the Delhi government’s claim, the L-G’s office said on Saturday that “it [the Delhi government] has been advised again, like earlier on March 20, 2018, that since the proposal seeks to change the method of distribution, it would mandatorily require the prior approval of the Government of India as per Section 12 (2) (h) of the National Food Security Act 2013. Additionally, it was brought to the notice that a Writ Petition WP (C) 2037/2021 in the said matter has been filed by the Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh. The said petition is scheduled to be heard on August 20, 2021”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-claims-centre-stalling-doorstep-delivery-of-ration-in-delhi-aiding-mafia-101622962889165.html
06-06-2021||Delhi||'If pizza can be delivered why not ration?': Delhi CM Kejriwal asks why doorstep delivery scheme was stalled||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday asked the Centre why it stalled its ambitious doorstep delivery of ration scheme in the national capital, which he said would have benefitted lakhs of poor people. "Just two days before 'Doorstep Delivery of Ration' scheme's implementation in Delhi, the central government stopped it. If pizza delivery can be allowed amid the Covid-19 pandemic, then why not ration?” CM Kejriwal asked."We are doing this to help those who are underprivileged," Kejriwal also said; adding that it will help people hesitant to go to the stores to buy ration due to the ongoing pandemic." "The scheme would have benefitted 72 lakh ration cardholders in the national capital," he also said.He also noted that these shops have the potential to become Covid hotspot. “I request with my folded hands to Centre, please allow us to deliver ration to the Delhi residents,” the chief minister also said.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader also refuted allegations that the Delhi government didn't seek permission from the Centre for the scheme. "We took approval not just once, but five times. Legally, we don't need Centre's approval but we did so out of courtesy,” he said. He also alleged that the Centre has taken this decision under the influence of "ration mafia."On Saturday, the Delhi government claimed it was prepared to launch the doorstep delivery of the ration within days and that Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal returned the file on June 2 stating the scheme cannot be implemented. However, the Centre said that the file was returned for "reconsideration" and described the allegation as "baseless," news agency PTI reported citing an official.Under the proposed scheme, the Delhi government has promised to deliver 4kg of flour and 1kg of rice cleaned and packed at the doorstep of every beneficiary. Earlier, the name of the scheme was 'Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojana', but was dropped by the Delhi government on the objection raised by the Centre."We are not doing this for credit," CM Kejriwal further said. "Have just one aim and that is to provide ration to the poor... There should be no politics over matters meant for the country's benefit," he added."Let me implement the scheme, I will give full credit to you (PM Modi). Ration does not belong to the state of the country, it is of people," CM Kejriwal also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/if-pizza-can-be-delivered-why-not-ration-delhi-cm-kejriwal-asks-why-doorstep-delivery-scheme-was-stalled-101622957812104.html

06-06-2021||Mumbai||‘Lust for power amid a pandemic will lead to...’: Thackeray’s veiled dig at BJP||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in an oblique reference to former alliance partners Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said on Saturday that hunger for power amid an ongoing pandemic has the potential to lead to anarchy.Thackeray said that he is responsible for protecting the people of the state and people who voted for him from the Covid-19 pandemic or else him being in power is futile. “If people who voted for me do not survive the Covid- 19 pandemic, what is the use of power? Acting with lust for power amid Covid-19 will lead to anarchy,” Thackeray, who did not name the opposition party, was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. Thackeray led the charge as Maharashtra saw a large number of daily deaths and cases during the second wave of the pandemic.Thackeray made these statements during an online interaction organised by Marathi daily Loksatta. Thackeray said people will not forgive him if he did not provide clarity to the people on why he should be in power.Thackeray also said that his entry into politics was due to his father and he was never politically inclined. He also said that the dream of Shiv Sena founder late Balasaheb Thackeray, which was to see a 'Sena worker' elected as the chief minister of the state is "yet to be fulfilled".“I was never politically inclined. I came into politics to help my father. A pandemic after 100 years happened during my tenure as chief minister. I have never shied away from responsibility. I am doing what I can to the best of my ability,” Thackeray said. Speaking of chances of a revival of an alliance with the BJP, the chief minister said that following the demise of BJP leaders Pramod Mahajan and Gopinath Munde a trust deficit arose between both parties. Thackeray also said that his current alliance partners Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) treat him with respect and also highlighted that there were differences between these alliance partners in the beginning.“The BJP is now Delhi-centric. In an alliance, there has to be openness to air differences and resolve them. My new allies (the NCP and Congress) treat me with respect. The MVA is an alliance where we had differences, so we are more open now,” Thackeray further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/lust-for-power-amid-a-pandemic-will-lead-to-thackeray-s-veiled-dig-at-bjp-101622942037433.html
06-06-2021||Delhi||Positivity under 1% for 6 days as infections continue to fall||The national capital on Saturday added 414 Covid-19 cases, the lowest daily spike in over 80 days, as Delhi continued to recover from the fourth wave of infections between April and May, a downturn that has prompted the state government to further relax the lockdown Monday onwards.Delhi’s total caseload has also dropped to levels the city last saw towards the end of March. As of Saturday, 6,731 people in the city are still batting the infection, around half of the active case count a week ago, when the city had 13,035 active Covid-19 infections.At the peak of the fourth wave of infections, on April 28, Delhi had 99,752 active cases.Saturday’s case count, the lowest since March 15, came after the state conducted over 77,694 tests. The test positivity rate, as a result, continued to wind down, and fell to 0.53% on Saturday, the lowest in 88 days.The seven-day average of daily infections, known as case trajectory, continued to drop, settling at an average of 602 cases per day on Saturday.The test positivity rate has now been below 1% for six days, and less than 5% for 16 days now.After the third wave of Covid-19 infections began to peter out in December, the test positivity rate stayed below 1% for 82 days, and began to inch up once the fourth wave started to expand its footprint in mid-March.As a rule of thumb, tracking a region’s positivity rate serves as a good barometer for whether cases are going to increase or decrease in the coming days.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control.Sixty more people died of the infection, the health bulletin issued by the state government on Saturday showed, up from 50 fatalities recorded on Friday.Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College (Vellore), said he was unsure if there will be a third wave.“The Delta variant certainly cannot cause another surge. However, it is very good that the government is preparing for it. What we need to do is increase permanent structures and bed strength rather than the makeshift ones because if there isn’t a third wave, all will be forgotten,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/positivity-under-1-for-6-days-as-infections-continue-to-fall-101622930461445.html

Fair price shops are open on all seven days to provide free ration to NFS [National Food Security Act] beneficiaries from 9am to 1pm and from 3pm to 7pm without any weekly off,” the government said in a statement.On May 4, Kejriwal announced that rations for the 7.2 million PDS beneficiaries will be distributed for free in May and June. On May 18, he announced that free rations would also be given to people without ration cards.Schools identified for distribution of non-PDS ration have been provided with a login ID and password to record the stock received, and to aid registrations and distribution.On Saturday, long queues were seen outside ration distribution centres in Chirag Delhi, Dilshad Garden, Seemapuri, Kalyanpuri, Badarpur, and Hauz Rani.Civil defence volunteers at these spots were tasked with maintaining Covid-appropriate behaviour among beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/free-food-grains-to-non-ration-card-holders-begins-in-capital-101622929847623.html
06-06-2021||Delhi||US tip-off saves city man streaming suicide bid||Almost an hour past midnight, deputy commissioner of police Anyesh Roy was holding a routine meeting with the Delhi Police’s cyber fraud team when his phone rang. An international number flashed on his mobile screen, prompting him to take it up quickly.The caller, an official from the US headquarters of Facebook, told DCP Roy -- who is the force’s nodal officer for all social media-related cases in the city -- that a man, possibly a Delhi resident, was attempting suicide and streaming it live on the social media website on Friday.Roy said the meeting was brought to an abrupt end, and Facebook officials quickly sent registration details about the man’s account by e-mail.The Facebook live-stream by the user, a 40-year-old resident of Palam Vihar in the city, had ended by then, but the police team managed to find the man’s address by tracing his mobile number that was made available by Facebook.By 1:45am, a police team from Palam Vihar rushed to the spot and found the man unconscious with multiple cuts to his wrist. Emergency services were on alert and the man was shifted to the AIIMS Trauma Centre, where he is recovering, a police statement on Saturday said.“We were lucky, and so was he. The (man’s) address was precise (in SIM card registration) and had all details. We shared it with the police control room (in Palam Vihar),” said Roy.Facebook did not immediately respond to request for confirmation.Sub-inspector Amit Kumar at the Palam Vihar police station was among the team that rushed to the man’s house after being informed of the suicide attempt. “I did not know anything about the Facebook live. It took us fifteenminutes to find his (the man’s) house. When we entered his house, his two kids were crying. The man had stepped out of his room and fell unconscious,” Kumar said.“Fortunately, because of the lockdown norms and also because it was past midnight, we did not find any traffic (to the hospital). We managed to reach the AIIMS Trauma Centre within 15-20 minutes, where he was treated,” Kumar added.By Friday evening, doctors at the hospital told the police the man’s condition was stable. He told the doctors that he was suffering from depression after his wife’s death in 2016 and that he cut himself with a blade after a fight with his neighbours. The reason for the fight are unclear.He is now at the hospital getting treatment for depression, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/us-tip-off-saves-city-man-streaming-suicide-bid-101622929407615.html
06-06-2021||Delhi||‘Plan to deliver ration at homes stalled again’||The Centre has once again “blocked” the Delhi government’s ambitious doorstep delivery of ration scheme days ahead of its launch with Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal rejecting the scheme, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said in a statement on Saturday. The L-G’s office, however, said Baijal did not “reject” the scheme and only “advised for the constitutional scheme of things to be followed in letter and spirit”.“The Delhi government’s revolutionary doorstep delivery of ration scheme has been stalled by the central government just days before it was to be launched across the national capital. The scheme, which would have benefitted more than 7.2 million beneficiaries has hit a roadblock again. After accepting all suggestions of the central government, Delhi government had sent the file to the L-G for his final approval on May 24, after which its immediate rollout was scheduled. But the L-G has returned the file saying the scheme cannot be implemented in Delhi,” the chief minister’s office said in a statement.Kejriwal will address a press conference on the issue on Sunday.This is the second time this year that the scheme has been stalled due to differences between the Delhi government and the Centre.The scheme was to be launched on March 25, but the Union food and consumer affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 raising two objections to the scheme — the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and that any change in the delivery mechanism requires an amendment in NSFA that can be done only by Parliament.The Delhi government, on March 24, passed a Cabinet decision to remove the name “Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna” for the scheme and to implement doorstep delivery of ration as part of the existing NFS Act, 2013. “But the Centre has blocked our scheme again,” said Delhi food minister Imran Hussain.The L-G cited two “invalid reasons” to reject the scheme which shows that his decision is “politically motivated”, claimed Hussain.“The L-G has rejected the scheme on two grounds – that it is not approved by the central government, and that there’s an ongoing court case on the scheme. No approval to launch such a scheme is required as per existing law. We also changed the name of the scheme according to their letter dated May 19. What further approval is required? It makes even less sense to stop the roll out of this scheme due to an ongoing court case. There have already been two hearings and no stay has been ordered by the court,” the Delhi minister said.Rebutting the Delhi government’s claim, the L-G ‘s office said in a statement that the file pertaining to the “notification on home delivery of processed and packaged ration under TDPS” was “returned for reconsideration to the CM by the LG. It has been advised again, like earlier on March 20, 2018, that since the proposal seeks to change the method of distribution, it would mandatorily require the prior approval of Government of India as per Section 12 (2) (h) of the National Food Security Act 2013. Additionally, it was brought to the notice that a Writ Petition WP (C) 2037/2021 in the said matter has been filed by the Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers Sangh...The said petition is scheduled to be heard on August 20, 2021”.DJ Narain, Union food ministry spokesperson, said the Delhi government can distribute ration under any other scheme.“Why insist on disrupting an existing pan-Indian scheme which is under the NFSA?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/plan-to-deliver-ration-at-homes-stalled-again-101622925219669.html
06-06-2021||Delhi||Capital will be ready for 37k cases a day during next Covid surge: CM||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said Delhi is preparing for a peak of around 37,000 Covid-19 cases a day during any next potential wave of the infection and detailed the Aam Aadmi Party government’s action plan, which includes creating robust medical oxygen infrastructure, storing buffer stocks of essential medicines and setting up two genome sequencing laboratories to better understand the role of variants in the spread of the infection. The government is planning to set up a total of 36,900 Covid-19 beds in hospitals and Covid health centres (CHCs), in addition to those in Covid care centres (CCCs), documents seen by HT showed.“Experts are saying that a third wave is bound to emerge, but nobody knows when such a wave will arrive and how dangerous it will be. We have to be prepared for the worst-case scenario. The Delhi government is planning for this wave in full swing. On Friday, I chaired two meetings for almost six hours with experts and officers who have been working throughout this pandemic. We have constituted two committees and carried out detailed discussions with them,” he said in a digital press briefing on Saturday.During the previous waves, Delhi government hospitals provided care to around 20% of all Covid-19 patients, state government data showed. Overall hospital bed capacity within the next two to three months will be ramped up to at least 36,900, the documents said.To ensure hospitals and health care facilities are adequately staffed, the Delhi government is extending the contracts of all its nurses and doctors by another six months till December 31. “To improve the availability of doctors in all hospitals, the Delhi government will introduce a one-year internship for graduating postgraduate students in city hospitals, so that they can start working as senior residents immediately and also gain useful functional experience,” said a senior health official.As the April-May surge of the infection ravaged the city, the state government progressively increased the number of Covid beds in its hospitals from 5,221 in April to 7,978 in June. Similarly, the state ramped up ICU bed capacity in these facilities from 1,830 in April to 3,100 this month.Further, with an eye on tracking variants of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, the Delhi government also said it will set up two genome sequencing labs — in the state-run Lok Nayak hospital, and the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) — within three months.In his press briefing on Saturday, Kejriwal also said the teams concerned are assessing the number of oxygen beds, ICU beds, medicines, and oxygen masks children may require.Kejriwal also said there was a “huge shortage” of oxygen during the April-May surge, which consequently meant the city could not set up enough oxygen beds.“We don’t want to face such a situation again, should another wave arrive. Therefore, preparations have been made – a storage capacity of 420MT of oxygen is being readied. We’ve had talks with Indraprastha Gas Limited and they have been asked to prepare a 150MT oxygen production plant, for which they have said that it will take 18 months,” he said. Kejriwal added that a paediatric task force has also been constituted.“In case a third wave does happen, children will be the most vulnerable because others would have either had the infection or received a vaccine...We would need fresh treatment protocols and SOPs,” said Dr Lalit Kant former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/capital-will-be-ready-for-37k-cases-a-day-during-next-covid-surge-cm-101622922191998.html
06-06-2021||Delhi||Lockdown pollution higher in 2021 than last year: Study||The lockdown imposed this year on account of the second wave of Covid-19 was not as effective in bringing down the pollution levels in the national capital as it was last year, showed an air quality analysis conducted by the Delhi-based think tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).“Lockdowns were effective in bringing down PM2.5 levels this year as well. But given the shorter duration and lesser stringent lockdown this year, the levels are not as low as summer 2020,” read the analysis by CSE.The think tank said that the imposition of a partial lockdown (from April 6 to April 19) lowered PM2.5 levels by 20% in Delhi, while the complete lockdown (from April 20 onwards) brought the average pollution levels further down by 12%.“Meteorology would be partly responsible for this elevated level but this could also be a reflection of weakening of pollution control measures and efforts in the city and region during the pandemic phase. Traffic intensity was also comparatively higher,” the analysis added.The report said the monthly average level of PM2.5 in April and May this year, which was the phase when hard lockdown was imposed in the Capital, was higher compared to April-May 2020 -- a period which was marked by a strict nationwide lockdown.It said the evening peak of the hourly cycle of NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) was 29% higher during this year’s lockdown as compared to the lockdown last year. However, it was still 57% lower than the regular evening peak noted in May of 2019.“The key highlight is that during spring time, January to March, when pollution level begins to subside after winter, PM2.5 this year has recorded the highest seasonal levels compared to the corresponding period in preceding years, including 2019 which was a normal year,” said Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager in CSE’s urban lab team of the sustainable cities programme.“...despite the partial restrictions, pollution levels have increased. While the reason needs investigation, it is important to understand that there would be a rebound effect with the full opening of the economy,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE.The CSE analysis also showed that there were 27 ”very poor” days in terms of air quality this February-March compared to 17 last year and 12 in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lockdown-pollution-higher-in-2021-than-last-year-study-101622922636917.html

A sudden thunderstorm and rain accompanied by winds as strong as 60 kilometers per hour lashed the city on Friday, following which some tiles from minaret came off. The heavy tiles also damaged the courtyard. No one was injured in the incident. The mosque has been shut due to lockdown restrictions. According to mosque staff, a slab of red sandstone from the minaret came crashing down following rain in the evening around 5:45 pm. “Repairs at Jama Masjid are carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) out on the special orders of the Prime Minister. We will talk to the ASI on Monday,” said Ansar-Ul-Haq, assistant PRO at Jama Masjid. Built by Mughal emperor Shahjahan, the mosque is not an ASI-protected monument. The responsibility of the mosque’s maintenance rests with the Delhi Waqf Board. Mehfooz Mohammad, section officer, Delhi Waqf Board, said that a managing committee headed by the imam look after maintenance issues. “The committee headed by the present imam looks after maintenance issues. They usually reach out to conservation experts from the ASI. If our intervention is needed, we will step in with support,” he said. Since last year, repair and conservation work at key monuments of the city has suffered on account of the pandemic. Some repair work of the mosque’s dome was undertaken last year before the imposition of lockdown. Last year, following heavy rain in July, the central dome of the 200-year-old Masjid Mubarak Begum in Old Delhi’s Hauz Qazi Chowk had collapsed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jama-masjid-minaret-damaged-due-to-heavy-rain-strong-wind-101622922506676.html

Kashmir produces four highly sought-after varieties of cherry — double, makhmali, mishri and Italy — most of which are sold outside the Valley, for premium prices. With harvest underway, cherry growers are trying to send the fruit to other states at the earliest. Some are availing flights to ensure that no time is lost in selling the highly perishable fruit.The cherry harvesting season begins from mid-May and lasts up to the first week of July. As per estimates of J&K’s horticulture department cherry is being cultivates on around 2,800 hectares, which yields an annual turnover of around 130 to 150 crore. Though cherry is grown ubiquitously in the Valley, the major produce comes from central and northern Kashmir.Prolonged cold hit productionThe UT’s annual production of the stone fruit is around 12,000 metric tons. However, growers say this year production has been low due to prolonged cold weather conditions.Horticulture director Ajaz Ahmad Bhat said the production of the crops, whether strawberry or cherry, “was not so bad. The government has made arrangements so that the growers do not face any trouble exporting the fruit outside Kashmir amid the pandemic.”“Now, harvest of apricot and other stone fruits will follow. The government has already announced subsidies on air freight for cherry,” Bhat said, adding that the horticulture department had already signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the airline carrier, GoAir, for transportation of perishable horticulture and agricultural produce to destinations across the country, especially Mumbai.A grower, Mohammad Yusuf Pattan, said despite the hailstorms and fluctuating weather patterns the cherry production had not suffered much. “As compared to last year, the production has undoubtedly been less. We are selling the fruit in local markets and also mandis from where it is dispatched outside the state. Last year, we had to face losses because of the extended lockdown.”‘Rates compensate for lower production’Fruit Growers And Dealers Association president Bashir Ahmad Bhat says, “The lower production has jacked up the rates. We are dispatching cherries via road, air and train to other mandis.”J&K had witnessed a bumper crop in 2018. Officials in the horticulture department said the production had reached around 11,289 and 11,789 metric tons in 2017 and 2018, respectively. In 2019 and 2020, the cherry production had also been around 12,000 metric tons, as per the official estimates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unlock-could-be-the-cherry-on-top-for-growers-in-kashmir-101622922506252.html

The chief minister said that pension amount of ₹2,500 would be given per year for the maintenance of trees, which are 75 years old under Pran Vayu Devta Pension Yojana. He said that ‘Pranvayu Devta Pension’ scheme will be unique and the first of its kind in India. As a matter of honour, the state government has taken an initiative to honour all those trees which are of the age of 75 years and above and have served humanity throughout their life by producing oxygen, reducing pollution, providing shade and so on. Such trees will be identified throughout the state and these will be looked after by involving local people in this scheme. Even, agro forestry will also be promoted on vacant land so that panchayat income in rural areas can also increase. The government to give ₹10,000 as an incentive to the farmer adopting Agro Forestry for three years, he added.

Farmers led by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leaders Rakesh Tikait and Gurnam Singh Charuni asked the police either to ensure court arrest of all farmers or release the three activists.In the evening, Babli met farm leaders at the Balliala rest house in Tohana. He apologised to the protesters and withdrew the cases registered against them. Two FIRs had been registered against protesters after a spat with Babli on June 1 and the third FIR was registered after the farmers gheraoed his house one June 2.In a video message , Babli said he had pardoned those who had pelted stones on his cavalcade and as a public representative from Tohana he was sorry for using “some derogatory words” against the protesters. “ I have apologised to the farmers for using abusive language,” he said.“The MLA has apologised but the administration has not released our protesters from Hisar jail,” Tikait said.The spat between farmers and Babli started when the farmers gheraoed his SUV while he was on the way to Tohana Civil hospital to take part in a vaccination programme. The farmers have given a call to gherao police stations across the state on June 7, if police fail to lodge an attempt to murder case against Babli.Earlier in the day, thousands of farmers had attended a panchayat, which was addressed by Tikait, Charuni, Yogendra Yadav and others in Tohana to protest against police raids and the arrest of their three colleagues. Farmers demanded an FIR against Babli, his PA Radhe Bishnoi and the government doctor, who treated Bishnoi after he sustained injuries and on whose recommendation the FIR was lodged. “The doctor had made some injury marks on the PA’s body,” Charuni alleged. Charuni said, “Instead of raiding our houses, the police should come armed with warrants and arrest us. If the three arrested farm leaders are guilty, then so are we. We will go to the police station and demand to be arrested.” Farmers burn copies of three farm lawsObserving Sampoorna Kranti Divas, farmers burnt copies of the three farm laws across the state. They staged protests near the houses of MP Sunita Duggal, deputy CM Dushyant Chautala and power minister Ranjit Singh Chautala in Sirsa.

06-06-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: A plover bonanza||The abnormal water deficit at the Siswan and Mirzapur check dams in the Shivalik foothills this summer has churned up an unexpected spin-off. Two avian species rarely found in our region and which were in passage migration to northern latitudes for summer breeding, were photographed by delighted troupes of tricity photographers.On May 29, the greater sand plover was photographed for the first time in the Inter-State Capital Region (ISCR), an area encompassing a radius of 50km from Chandigarh for the purpose of an avian species checklist.As luck would have it, the lesser sand plover offered a double, golden opportunity as it was keeping the close company of the greater plover. Both species were at Siswan Dam and prefer the slushy, quicksand-like shores exposed by freshly receding waterlines.The recent photographic record of the lesser sand plover is the second one for the ISCR, the first having come at the Sukhna Lake on May 13, 2018, by this writer.Both plover species migrate in good numbers to Indian coasts in winter, but few specimens are recorded as deep inland as the Chandigarh region while returning in summer to Ladakh and regions beyond and north of the Himalayas. The novel twist to this bird tale is that the two plover species were photographed by an unusual entrant to the competitive field of avian photography. It is none other than a top cop: ADGP, Welfare, Punjab Police, V (Voruvuru) Neeraja! Her photographs of May 29 triggered a flash wave of photographers, who rushed to the dams to record these rare species before they vanished into the northern horizon. “I took to bird photography and videos to educate my daughter, nephews and nieces about names of species. Children have to be sensitised to the beauty and diversity of nature so that they grow up to protect the environment and habitats of wild flora and fauna. I also sensitise wildlife officers on safeguarding habitats based on my observations in the field while birding,” Neeraja told this writer. Bravo!Greed triumphs needA ramble around the drying water holes in the Shivaliks is distinguished by an odd odour. The standard stink of decaying buffalo dung is replaced by the stench of putrefying sambars. Mostly fawns, these deer have been killed by packs of free-ranging stray, village or domestic dogs when the creatures come to quench their thirst. These dog packs include vicious pit bulls, bull terriers, hybridised pointers, which are deployed to guard fields and are used by some villagers for poaching.Dogs kill many more fawns than they can eat, as evidenced by a number of uneaten or partially devoured carcasses. The wanton killing is unlike that of natural predators such as leopards or tigers, who kill only as much as they can eat. Killer dogs, as companions of humans, thus subscribe to the despicable creed of greed reigning supreme over need. The purpose of wanton killing of wild mammals or birds by dogs is to establish domination over water holes. However, canny dog packs are less active at night around water holes due to leopard threat. When water is plentiful and sambars are difficult to slaughter, as in monsoon and beyond, dogs are not seen around water holes. They retreat to villages, where they are heavily subsidised by humans in terms of food, garbage, shelter and water. Exploding dog numbers is in itself an unnatural phenomenon.Ironically, domestic dogs are among the rarest of rare predators protected by a plethora of Indian “animal welfare” laws and an army of law and social media-savvy urbane activists. The related impotence of wildlife protection laws elevates killer dogs to VVIP immunity! It is pithily said that a man-eating tiger is easier put down by authorities than a dog on a human biting or Sambar-killing spree.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-a-plover-bonanza-101622921907442.html
06-06-2021||Delhi||Capital to ease more curbs from Monday||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday announced that restrictions, including those on markets and transport, were being eased in the Capital after a seven-week lockdown that was necessitated by a devastating fourth wave of Covid-19 cases that overran the city’s health care system and led to shortages in critical medical supplies.Delhi Metro trains will be allowed to operate at 50% seating capacity, and shops in markets and malls can reopen on an odd-even basis from Monday, with the chief minister asserting that the national capital’s economy needed to be revived in view of the improving Covid-19 situation. The test-positivity rate fell to 0.53%, according to the government’s daily health bulletin.Delhi on Saturday added 414 cases as the city’s fourth and the worst wave of Covid-19 infections continued to taper, prompting the government authorities to focus on a phased withdrawal of lockdown restrictions while also preparing in advance for another potential outbreak.On Saturday, the government eased restrictions on stand-alone shops, markets and shopping malls, and permitted private and government offices to open with half their strength. The new rules will be effective from 5am on Monday.“The Covid-19 situation in Delhi appears to be improving, and keeping that in mind, we began theunlock procedure last week. It is necessary to bring the economy back on track now. Last week, we opened up the construction and factory sectors… The situation appears to be under control and by god’s grace should continue to remain under control,” Kejriwal said.At its peak in the April-May surge, Delhi added 28,395 cases of the infection in a single day on April 20 — the most the city has seen since the pandemic broke out in March last year. The high numbers of daily cases and the positivity rate compelled the Delhi government to extend the lockdown every week since April 19. It was extended six times.Kejriwal said markets and shopping malls will open from Monday, but on an odd-even basis from 10am to 8pm every day. “This means half the shops will be operational on one day and the other half the following day. It will be based on the shop numbers. At any given day, only 50% of the shops in a mall, shopping complex or market shall be opened,” he said.However, restaurants, bars and food courts across the city will remain shut and only takeaway or delivery will be allowed, senior government officials clarified.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) issued an order about the new rules in which it permitted stand-alone and neighbourhood shops to operate on all days from 10am to 8pm. This means such shops do not have to operate on an odd-even basis.In malls and markets, however, shops selling essential items including books, stationery, fans, air-conditioners and coolers will be allowed to open on all days. Liquor shops in Delhi will open from Monday, but on an odd-even basis. Weekly markets, gyms, spas, salons, auditoriums and swimming pools remain prohibited this week as well.After DDMA’s order, the Delhi Metro said it will resume services with trains running at a frequency of 5-15 minutes, depending on the route/line. Entry at stations will be regulated through identified gates. Passengers will not be allowed to stand inside the coaches.Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), said that on Monday, only half of the available trains will be inducted into service. He said DMRC was also writing to appropriate authorities to maintain law and order outside Metro stations to handle the rush.“The number of trains will be inducted in full strength in a graded manner by Wednesday and thereafter, services will be available as per normal frequency which was available before the lockdown. In order to ensure social distancing and compliance to 50% seating inside trains, public is also advised to take extra time for their daily commute and exhibit Covid-appropriate behaviour outside the stations and also while waiting for their turn to enter the station,” Dayal said.Passengers with an e-pass or employer’s ID will be allowed to travel in the state-run DTC or cluster buses. There has also been no change in the two-passenger-per-vehicle rule for travelling in cabs, auto-rickshaws and e-rickshaws.DDMA allowed both government and private offices to operate, but with 50% staff. “All private offices can be opened up at 50% manpower between 9am and 5pm. But efforts should be made to ensure that more people work from home. Private offices should make attempts to stagger their work hours to ensure not everyone comes out at the same time,” said Kejriwal.People engaged in e-commerce deliveries will continue to be allowed. Besides, revenue services such as property registry will re-open in all district magistrate (DM) and sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) offices.The unlock rules invited mixed reactions on Saturday. Atul Goyal, president of United Residents Joint Action (URJA), an umbrella body of 2,500 RWAs in the city, said the relaxations were needed to resume economic activities for people, most of whom are suffering major losses in some form or the other.“We welcome the Delhi government’s order. But it appears to somewhat compromise on the alertness needed by a state to prevent a more severe third wave (fifth for Delhi). The markets could have been allowed for a shorter duration. Allowing everyone to open for 10 hours is a bit dangerous, even though it would be on odd-even basis,” said Goyal.Sanjay Bhargava, president of the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said the rule of an e-pass or ID for shopkeepers and its workers in the DDMA order was challenging. “The CM said apart from these relaxations the curfew shall remain as it is. The order also implies the same. Is it not unfair that shopkeepers and their workers have been asked to get e-passes and IDs, while nothing is required for customers?” he said.A senior government official said customers will not require an e-pass for visiting markets.Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore, said that although the cases have gone down, there is a need to ensure 100% masking and social distancing. “That is the best way to prevent transmission, better than vaccine even. But for that to happen, we need participation of the people and a change in behaviour,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/capital-to-ease-more-curbs-from-monday-101622919761714.html

06-06-2021||Chandigarh||Random forays: Let’s weave a web of motivation||With the mood of the world rather low, with despondency on the rise and with people in requirement of mental planks of support, motivational interventions are much in demand, and direly needed. In fact, there are too few of us who are (almost) whole time motivators, or at least try to be so!Society has never before needed, to such an extent, an embalming effect, healing prayers and kind words. People young and old are in their shells, almost as if the enemy is unleashing a barrage of mortar shells, which in a way, this unseen enemy has actually done.Those who have lost dear ones during the pandemic, or have suffered themselves, are even more in need of a soothing, calming, presence in their lives. With all this negative air floating around, there is a crying need for freshness, enthusiasm and inspiration.Thus, the need to create a strong and wide network of motivators who will make it their passion, if not their vocation, to spread vibrations of cheerfulness, hope and positive energy all around.Motivators need not stick to any strict regimen, or even be trained in motivational speaking skills, they just need to know that one of their goals in life is to inspire people they come in contact with. A youngster who spends time chatting up and listening to an elderly couple, is performing his or her motivational role very well.“Be an encourager. The world has plenty of critics already.” Author David Willis came up with this and similar quotes to show that our attitude is what really matters. Everyone can be an encourager, an ambassador of motivation, a walking-talking transmitter of peppiness. All one needs is to carry a ‘portable paradise’ within the heart, as the saint advised us to do.Easier said than done? Indeed so. Times are testing and tumultuous. Waves of fear and its terrible cousins — worry, anxiety, and depression — are incessantly beating against the shores of our minds. The all-conquering forces of social media are invading our beings and are changing our mindsets almost irrevocably.Yet if an armada of young students and old pros join hands and pledge to ameliorate the mental suffering of humanity at large, much can be achieved by way of improving the general state of mental health of the world’s population. Children in particular, if urged to come up with innovative ideas to motivate those who are down in the dumps, can work wonders. Through story-telling, through arts-based therapy sessions, through small group discussions, through music, games and sports, through video messages of the humorous and bouncy kinds, the young brigade can conquer the armies of gloom that have threatened our collective state of mind in recent times.My younger daughter, Kavya, has been remarkably successful in making youngsters of her age feel much elevated in spirit by holding online arts-based therapy sessions with them and using fine art, music and writing therapy to improve their motivation levels. The youth are aware of unending innovative ways in which to reach out to the lonely and morose. By transforming their efforts in a focused manner through a sustained campaign, they can work wonders and help society at large.Our Think Tank, SUVICHAR, has embarked upon a programme to ‘motivate the motivators’ so that large numbers of people can be encouraged to join hands and make a mark throughout the land. An online series of webinars is being organised with speakers from all walks of life who are speaking from the heart and making a real impact by inspiring viewers to shun fearfulness and embrace mental toughness as well as resilience to combat the current crisis.I, too, have been doing my bit to address audiences online from every nook ‘n’ corner, whether in English, Hindi or even in my ‘toothi-phooti’ Punjabi, so that I can motivate viewers to adopt calmness, balance, creativity, cheerfulness, compassion, and such like qualities. I also tend to beseech youngsters in particular to try and win the battle of the mind by eschewing all thoughts of failure and sickness.The problems that mankind faces are real, of course. But an inspired ethos will enable us to defeat them all, and more.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-let-s-weave-a-web-of-motivation-101622921427437.html
06-06-2021||Chandigarh||HCS officers face heat in attempted land acquisition fraud in Palwal||An attempt by officials to swindle the state exchequer by manipulating the land acquisition process in the national capital region district of Palwal has been thwarted following a probe. After grave irregularities were detected in the process of land acquisition for the upcoming Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) of the Railways in Palwal, the Haryana government has decided to initiate disciplinary action against a Haryana Civil Services (HCS) officer and seek explanation from two HCS officers. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has given a go-ahead for initiation of action against the errant officials, top officials said.Also, it has been decided to initiate criminal action against patwaris and officials who purchased a portion of the acquired project land for swindling the public exchequer, officials said. Top officials said that HCS officer Kanwar Singh, who was posted as sub divisional magistrate (SDM), Palwal, will be placed under suspension and chargesheeted for major penalty. Explanation of Singh’s predecessors and fellow HCS officers Jitender Kumar and Dr Naresh has been sought by the state government regarding infirmities committed in the land acquisition matter during their tenures as SDM, Palwal. Disciplinary action is also being initiated against registration clerks, reader and data entry operators. Inquiry nailed the fraudulent attemptA probe, conducted by a committee of Palwal additional deputy commissioner (ADC), chief executive officer of the Zila Parishad and district revenue officer, found that Palwal SDM Kanwar Singh was responsible for making excess calculation of ₹26.41 crore as rehabilitation and resettlement benefits to land losers. The amount, however, was not paid, and the matter was pending with Gurugram divisional commissioner after DFC authorities filed a case. The inquiry report was endorsed by Palwal deputy commissioner and Faridabad divisional commissioner.“It is amply clear that for acquisition of 120 kanals and 8 marlas, the number of families entitled to rehabilitation and resettlement benefits (payment of annuity and one-time resettlement allowance) are 493. Palwal SDM Kanwar Singh is completely responsible for this huge excess calculation of rehabilitation and resettlement benefits..,’’ said the inquiry report. The inquiry also found that HCS officers Jitender Kumar and Dr Naresh, during their tenure as Palwal SDM, were responsible for a six-month delay in conveying to Palwal tehsildar the issuance of a land acquisition notification under Railways Act, thus providing an opportunity for registration of land patches to many. “Jitender Kumar should have taken up the matter with the district collector for issuing directions to registration officers to not register sale transaction as provided in Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act. Thus, he can be held responsible to this extent as well,’’ the inquiry report said. Higher rates for paying compensation fixed by SinghThe report also found that rates for paying the land compensation were fixed higher than the collector rates and Palwal SDM Kanwar Singh was responsible for this. Also, the patwaris for land acquisition were engaged in a non-transparent manner and they did not possess minimum qualifications. Most of them were also found purchasing small portions of land in the name of their close relatives. It was also found that 10 sale deeds for the under-acquisition land were issued after notification under Railways Act for acquiring it. “Deeds registered after issuance of notification should not have found place in the rehabilitation and resettlement benefits to claimants,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hcs-officers-face-heat-in-attempted-land-acquisition-fraud-in-palwal-101622921426387.html

06-06-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Meandering memory lanes of Malerkotla||One has to begin somewhere and when it comes to the lore of Malerkotla, a city established in 1454 AD by Sheikh Saradruddin-i-Jahan of Afghanistan and ruled by his Sherwani descendants, I choose to begin with the narrative of a community theatre artiste late ‘Mast the Bhaand’ — a popular performer in a left-wing theatre group in Barnala who had many admirers through the 60s. What follows was recounted to me by a dear friend Manmohan Sharma — a theatre technique the reminiscent of the Mirasi-bhand tradition of feudal Punjab, used with great finesse! “I was out in the fields to bring home some fodder when Gaindarh Singh came running. “Hey you buffoon!,” he shouted at me, “You are making merry in the fields here, and out there, in Sirhind, the two younger sons of our 10th Guru are being bricked alive!” Hearing this, my heart sank and we made our way to Sirhind. Hundreds of people had assembled there, in the city that was being swept clean, and spent the night awake. “Next morning, the durbar assembled and the two Sahibzadas were brought there. What do I tell you, the older one was just like our Pappu, the landlord’s son, who studies in the English school, and the younger one so like that tubby little Gholu in the village. The Sirhind-wala Nawab asked them to change their faith and they would live. Even before the older one could speak, the younger one cried out, “We will not change our faith.”Puffing with rage, the Nawab ordered that the two children be bricked alive. At this the Malerkotla-wala Nawab got up and raised his voice: “This is unjust!” I too raised my arm and cried out: “It is absolutely unjust!”Island of peace It is this protest of the Nawab of Malerkotla that was to forever endear the Sherwani dynasty of the town to the Sikhs, which is why the Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims have lived here without a single act of violence during the holocaust of the Partition and the days of militancy. Thus, enjoying special status as the volatile states ‘island of peace’!In my long years in journalism as a roving correspondent of sorts there were many Punjab towns that I camped in doing stories but somehow, I never encountered the mystique of Malerkotla firsthand. In fact, the narrative of two writer friends of Samrala about Malerkotla made me feel that this was the city I must visit. During my many visits there, I learned from Punjabi fiction writer Mohammad Goria, who shared his birthplace with the great Saadat Hasan Manto in Papraudi village, now a part of Samrala town. He told me how his father, a simple unread oilman for a farmer was saved simply by moving to Malerkotla where Muslims were safe even in the blood-soaked times of Partition riots. Samrala poet Lal Singh Dil’s was a more colourful journey of unfulfilled dreams when he went to Malerkotla after covering to Islam to get a burqa made as he hoped that a Muslim girl would marry him.The city of dreams So, I was in the city of dreams many years ago when a publisher assigned me a book of essays on Punjab and I decided to open the book with the Malerkotla story. The journey began from Chandigarh to Fatehgarh Sahib with its picturesque gurdwara marking the place where the two Sahibzadas met their brutal end. Then a change of bus on a narrow road lined on the sides with shisham and kikar trees to Malerkotla. In Punjab, the modern exists side by side with the medieval. But that is not so strange for a country like India where Lord Rama of mythical fame can be resurrected so powerfully from myth.All I had was the contact of a young Akali leader, Azad Siddiqui, born and bred in Malerkotla. He was jubilant that the Akalis were back in power, and he told me his rags-to-riches story. His father was a poor man who repaired bags, but he educated his son till Class 10 and now Azad owns a couple of shops, a school and heads several NGOs.The next day, everything was laid out for me from Gurdwara Haa Da Naara where the Malerkotla Nawab protested against the inhuman deaths meted out to the young sons of Guru Gobind Singh, to a meeting with the elderly widow of the late Nawab of our times. I was provided literature aplenty on the Sherwani dynasty. And of course, the Dargah Hyder Shaikh in Malerkotla, which does not have as many devotees among the Muslim population as among the Hindus and Sikhs who visit it for wish fulfilment. But the bazaars of the city fascinate me with their exquisite zardozi embroidery as they make badges on contract for the police and the army. Then a story unfolds of the celebrities the town has known from Dharmendra who worked as a tubewell operator and played badminton in colourful shirts. His pictures for the Bollywood Talent Contest were clicked at the local John’s Studio and boy didn’t he make it. And trailblazing in music is another Malerkotla boy, Irshad Kamil — a famous poet and lyricist who did his birthplace proud.But one wish remains unfulfilled for when I ask Azad the Akali guide that I would like to have a glass of frothing malai milk in the bazaar, a speciality of the town, he rules it out. “We cannot take you there. It is not proper. This is a Muslim town and women stay in purdah.” So now I resolve that once the lockdowns end, I am going to Malerkotla sans a guide to have a frothing glass of malai milk in celebration of it now becoming as district and perhaps complete the book that is still not written!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-meandering-memory-lanes-of-malerkotla-101622921128326.html

But so far, none has,” said a senior UT official. Notably, CHB has already finalised the architectural plans for the project.In September 2019, CHB had sought opinion from both the governments for buying these flats for their officials in IT Park. Additionally, PGIMER had also expressed willingness to buy the flats.The housing board is expected to construct 10 seven-storey towers with 28 flats each, having a base price of ₹2 crore each. All three agencies are expected to pay ₹66 crore each for their share of the flats. The project is to come up on 6.73 acres.Housing project for general public also in limboAnother CHB housing scheme coming up in IT Park for the general public, which was planned to be floated in April, is stuck with the plan approval committee of the UT administration.The committee has sought clarifications over the plans on several issues, one of them being construction of EWS flats, which are mandatory in a housing scheme. The CHB has decided to shift the EWS flats from the project to a separate location in Sector 54.Garg said, “We are awaiting the approval of the committee. We have submitted the responses to the clarifications they had sought. Simultaneously, we have also initiated the process of getting environmental clearances for the project. Only after both approvals are in place, we will float the scheme.”In all, 728 flats have been planned in three categories. A four-bedroom flat is likely to cost nearly ₹2.75 crore, three-bedroom flat ₹1.9 crore and two bedroom flat ₹1.3 crore. As per the proposed plan, the project includes 28 4BHK flats, 448 3BHKs and 252 2BHKs.The towers will have two basements with parking provision for two cars per flat in addition to surface parking for visitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-haryana-yet-to-pay-their-share-for-chb-s-high-end-housing-scheme-101622920946136.html
06-06-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers hold protests across Punjab, burn copies of agri laws||On a call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of 40 farmers’ unions, protests were held across Punjab on Saturday to observe “Sampoorna Kranti Diwas” marking the day when three farm legislations were promulgated as ordinances last year. Carrying black flags, farmers raised slogans against the BJP-led central government and burnt copies of the contentious laws, which they said will destroy the farming community.Cops were deployed and barricades put up near the protest sites to maintain law and order.In Phagwara, farmers burnt copies of farm laws near the residence of Union minister Som Parkash at Urban Estate. The protesters assembled near the GT Road and marched towards his residence. The Union minister was not at home at the time of the protest. The agitating farmers also held a protest near Parkash’s residence in Mohali.Protests were also held in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Mohali, Abohar, Hoshiarpur, Barnala, Nawanshahr and Patiala. In south Malwa, activists of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) held dharnas outside the residences of BJP leaders Surjeet Kumar Jyani in Fazilka and Dyal Sodhi Tungwali in Bathinda.No untoward incident was reported, though protesters violated Covid guidelines at several places.Copies of farm laws were also burnt in Sangrur, Bhawanigarh, Lehra and Barnala. In a joint statement, farmer leaders said the central government used Covid-19 to pass the “black laws” last year and brought three ordinances to hand over the agriculture sector to the corporates.The protesters also condemned the attack on the Golden Temple in 1984 and observed two-minute silence to pay homage to those killed in the military operation.In Hoshiarpur, farmers took out a protest march from a gurdwara to the local BJP office at Shastri market and then burnt the copies of the legislation.Scores of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year demanding that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for their crops. However, the government has maintained the laws are pro-farmer.Several rounds of talks between the farmers and the government have failed to break the deadlock over these contentious laws.Ex-BJP minister Joshi criticises Centre AMRITSAR: Senior BJP leader and former Punjab local bodies minister Anil Joshi on Saturday criticised the Union government for not addressing farmers’ concern over agri laws.A two-time MLA from Amritsar north, Joshi said: “I have also grown up in a village and used to cultivate the crops. I know the pain of a farmer. Now, I am a trader and our trade depends on farmers. If they are oppressed, we feel pain as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-hold-protests-across-punjab-burn-copies-of-agri-laws-101622920766112.html

According to a party release, Sukhbir will lead the two-hour dharna, to be attended by senior leadership of the party including MLAs, former legislators and district presidents.Party spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said though the Congress government admitted that it had wrongfully sold 80,000 vaccine doses received from the Centre to private hospitals at a premium, it had not taken any action against those responsible for the corrupt and inhuman act. “No action has been initiated against health minister Balbir Sidhu who is directly responsible for diverting vaccine doses to private facilities, which charged ₹1,560 to ₹2,000 per dose from the people. It is clear that chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh is shielding a corrupt minister,” said Cheema. Youth Akali Dal (YAD) president Parambans Singh Romana said they will file a criminal complaint against Balbir Sidhu for selling 80,000 vaccine doses to private facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/profiteering-during-pandemic-sukhbir-to-stage-dharna-outside-balbir-sidhu-s-house-101622920587433.html

06-06-2021||Bangalore||Congress leader DK Shivakumar says petrol price hike, slow Covid-19 vaccination are govt's failures||Taking pot-shots at BJP, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) President DK Shivakumar on Saturday asserted that 43 hikes in petrol prices since January this year and vaccination at snail pace evidently show the incompetence of the government on economical and administrative fronts."Today price of petrol has breached ₹100 per litre in many parts of the country. The price of edible oil has also surpassed ₹220 per litre. Only 3.17 per cent of the Indians have got vaccinated in five months. These are glaring examples of the failure of this government on the economical and administrative front," Shivakumar said at Kutagal Hobli village of Ramanagra district.The KPCC chief was on a day's visit to Ramanagara to distribute food kits and reach out to people affected by the pandemic."Congress is giving free vaccination to people going beyond castes and religions. I kicked off a campaign to vaccinate 3 Lakh people yesterday," Shivakumar said asserting his party is firm with its ₹100 crore plan to vaccinate the entire state if BJP government permits them to procure and carryout vaccination drive.He pointed out that BJP hiked petrol prices 10 times in January, 16 times in February, 16 times in May and once in the first week of June.Claiming that the government is determined to make petrol unaffordable for the common man, he said: "Let us all visit petrol pumps and pay floral tributes to pump machines to mark our protest."Lauding Congress workers, the KPCC President said that party workers and office-bearers are working overtime to help people at the time of the pandemic.Former Minister Shamanur Shivashankarappa kicked off a Covid vaccination drive in his constituency at Davangere on Friday. The Congress party has planned to expand the vaccination drive in other parts of the state in the month of June.The KPCC chief accused the BJP of doing a great disservice to the country by exporting over 6.6 crore vaccines. He alleged the government compromised the health and lives of its own people and thereby increased the mortality rate in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/congress-leader-dk-shivakumar-says-petrol-price-hike-slow-covid-19-vaccination-are-govt-s-failures-101622919476832.html

06-06-2021||Chandigarh||Uncontrolled diabetes, improper steroid use key in emergence of black fungus: PGIMER study||Many, who have survived the Covid-19 virus, are now battling a fungal infection, mucormycosis, commonly called black fungus, which is “deadlier” than the virus itself.A study conducted by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) shows how uncontrolled diabetes and improper steroid use are important factors for the emergence of this infection. In Chandigarh hospitals alone, over 200 patients have died of the fungal infection.The study, MucoCovi (Muco from mucormycosis, Covi from Covid-19), was led by PGIMER along with 16 other centres. The institutes studied black fungus cases reported from September 1 to December 31, 2020, and the results were published in the Emerging Infectious Disease Journal, USA, on June 4.The researchers found that the prevalence of Covid associated mucormycosis (CAM) was more among patients managed in the ICUs (1.6%) than in the wards (.27%). Also, because of the pandemic, there was a 2.1-fold rise in cases during 2020, when compared to the previous year.The head of the department of medical microbiology, PGIMER, Dr Arunaloke Chakrabarti, shared that the clinicians should be vigilant for black fungus in patients recovering from Covid, especially those with new or previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus, and those reporting clinical manifestations of facial or orbital pain or black or blood-stained nasal discharge or loosening of teeth.“It was seen that on an average CAM diagnosis was made 18 days after Covid-19 infection. The most common sites of infection were found to be the nose with eye involvement (in 58% cases) followed by nose with eye and brain involvement (27% cases) and then lung infection (9% cases),” he said.Besides facial pain, nasal blockage and discharge, toothache and loosening of teeth were seen in a high number of cases for the first time.The doctor said that uncontrolled diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying disease. “This study has suggested that there is a direct role of Covid in causing or worsening diabetes, which may predispose these patients to mucormycosis.”Covid patients with diabetes developed CAM as early as less than eight days of getting Covid. On the other hand, those patients who developed CAM later had mostly received inappropriate steroid treatment (63%).The overall death rate due to mucormycosis was 38.3% at six weeks and 45.7% after 12 weeks of illness. “Patients over 54 years of age, those with brain or lung involvement and those who had to undergo ICU admission had a higher risk for death,” he said. He claimed this study to be the first evidence-based multicentre study on mucormycosis from India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/uncontrolled-diabetes-improper-steroid-use-key-in-emergence-of-black-fungus-pgimer-study-101622919866327.html

Maratha outfits have been protesting to push for the reservation. Maratha Kranti Morcha staged an agitation in Beed on Saturday under the leadership of Vinayak Mete, the chief of Shiv Sangram party, which is a BJP ally. Mete said that the community will come out on the streets in large numbers as the state government is indifferent towards its sentiments. Maratha leader and Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Member of Parliament (MP) Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, a descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, will attend a function at Raigad fort on the occasion of coronation day anniversary of the Maratha warrior king on Sunday. He is likely to announce the next move from the fort on Sunday. He, however, has appealed to the community members not to head to the fort and crowd there amid the pandemic. The MP had given an ultimatum to the government after putting forward three demands, including review and curative petitions in the Supreme Court against it order to scrap the quota, as well as a petition to the Centre for the reservation. He also had demanded other benefits such as hostel facilities and scholarships for the community’s students and revival of Sarthi – a Pune based institute – to ensure educational and social well-being of the Maratha youth. Meanwhile, Virendra Pawar of Maratha Kranti Morcha, said, “The government has not done anything despite assurances on the benefits and welfare schemes. There is unrest among the community leaders and members. We have been demanding a speedy decision on the issuance of the appointment letters to the community youth who have completed the recruitment procedures for government jobs. The government has been delaying it beyond limits. We are eagerly waiting to see the stand taken by Raje tomorrow,” The top court on May 5 quashed the 12% and 13% reservation given in education and jobs to Maratha community under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act 2018. The state government then appointed a committee of retired high court judge Dilip Bhosale to study the ruling and suggest a way forward. In its report submitted on Friday, the committee has recommended the government to move a review petition in the SC challenging its verdict. BJP’s state unit chief Chandakant Patil alleged that the government has failed to take a quick action on legal steps for reservation. “The state-appointed Dilip Bhosale committee’s recommendations are on the lines of what we have been suggesting to the government. The Centre immediately filed the review petition on SC ruling, but the Maharashtra government has not been able to do it before the deadline, which ended on Friday. The state government’s stand is doubtful,” he said. The state government, however, said that it has been taking every possible step for the reservation. “The review petition will be filed next week. Similarly, we are also tapping on the other measures suggested by the committee. We have already made the financial allocation for Sarthi and Annasaheb Patil Financial Development Corporation. A letter has been sent to Maharashtra Public Service Commission directing it to expedite the process of accommodating the Maratha youth who had completed the recruitment process in government jobs under EWS (Economically Weaker Section) quota. We will convince Sambhajiraje to not resort to streets and cooperate with us, as almost all his demands are acted upon,” said a Congress leader. Congress’s Maharashtra general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant has said that the Opposition BJP is politicising the issue. “Patil has been blaming state government for the quashing of the quota. But it was his government in the state which kept the lacunae in the reservation law. The reservation was struck down because of the 102nd Constitutional amendment by the Modi government at Centre,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/agitation-for-maratha-reservation-likely-to-intensify-in-maharashtra-from-today-101622919266391.html

The total case count in Maharashtra stands at 5,819,224.The lowest daily figures prior to this were registered on March 10, when the state recorded the same number of cases. After that, the figures kept increasing, indicating the severity of the second Covid-19 wave.Meanwhile, Mumbai recorded 863 new Covid-19 cases and 29 deaths taking the tally to 709,857 and toll to 14,951. Pune recorded the second-highest (13,209) deaths. Dr Subhash Salunke, an advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19 management, attributed the decline to a host of measures such as imposing the lockdown as well as ramping up the entire medical infrastructure. “The lockdown played a vital role in bringing down the transmission rates and now we are seeing the results. We took care to ramp up testing facilities and provide timely medication to Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Salunke.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, however, warned that all these gains will be nullified if the government and citizens fail to take corrective steps. “The government should not dismantle the Covid-19 centres like last year when the first wave subsided. In addition to it, the government needs to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour and must not allow any leniency in this matter,” said Dr Shaikh. “Citizens need to wear masks, observe social distancing and must not participate in mass gatherings or rallies. The third wave can be more severe if we remain causal and don’t adhere to these regulations,” warned Dr Shaikh.A total of 240,088 tests were conducted across the state on Saturday. The death toll has reached 99,512 as 300 patients succumbed to the virus. On Saturday, 21,776 recoveries were recorded. There were 188,027 active cases in Maharashtra on Saturday, with Pune leading the list with 22,280 active cases, followed by Kolhapur (18,130) and Mumbai (18,118).Around 260 villages in Nashik district reported zero cases. However, despite the weekend lockdown, markets at Nashik remained open that resulted in crowding and violation of social distancing norms. Due to the surge in cases in Ratnagiri, a strict lockdown will be followed till June 9, and the situation is being monitored with the help of drones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/at-13-6k-covid-19-cases-maharashtra-sees-lowest-spike-in-87-days-101622919206802.html

Of these, 11,99,427 are women and 16,91,829 men — a difference of 4,92,402.This shows that for every 1,000 men who received the shot in the UT, only 709 women have been vaccinated.As per Census 2011, the UT has a sex ratio of 889 per thousand males. Lactating mothers adding to deficit When asked about the significant deficit in the inoculation of the two genders, Rehman attributed it to the lakhs of lactating mothers who were yet to take the jabs in the UT.He said, “J&K sees around 2.50 lakh births per year. This accounts for nearly as many lactating mothers, taking the approximate number of women yet to be vaccinated to over 4.50 lakh.”Ruling out stigma and vaccine hesitancy, the official, said, “There is neither any stigma nor reluctance among women to get inoculated,” urging pregnant and lactating mothers to take the vaccine shots. “It has now been proven beyond any doubt that the vaccine does not affect a lactating mother’s milk,” he assured.Rehman said he could not think of any other possible reason for the deficit.Research has come a long way Rehman said that medical research on Covid-19 has evolved in the due course of time with there being a much better understanding of the disease.“Initially, the guidelines didn’t endorse vaccine for lactating mothers. But in the past one and a half years, we have come to know that it does not affect their feed. I am sure they will come on board soon,” he said.Speaking about administration’s measures to tackle vaccine hesitancy among other groups, Rehman said, “We came up with a foolproof implementation plan. We roped in religious leaders, influencers, medicos, women senior officials and applied every method there is in the book,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gender-gap-in-vaccination-j-k-doing-well-say-officials-but-data-disagrees-101622919206338.html

The percentage of home deaths, however, went up from 5.09% in the first wave to 8.95% in the second wave. Besides, in at least 4.10% cases patients were declared brought dead at the hospital during the second wave. National Health Mission (NHM) director Nipun Jindal said, “There was little difference in the percentage of hospital deaths of both waves even though the caseload was higher during the second wave (1,35,521 against 58,403 in first wave). This indicates that the state government was well-prepared with its resources such as beds, oxygen, Remedesivir, steroids and other drugs.”The rise in home deaths, on the other hand, was attributed to delayed presentation of Covid patients to health facilities. The state clinical team, on the basis of death audit, concluded that the delay was due to the fear of quarantine, social stigma and patients taking the symptoms lightly. A further analysis of the data revealed that of the total deaths that occurred till May 23, 49.8% died due to delay in seeking medical help. At least 7.7 % (213) patients died at home while a total of 4.1 % (114) patients were declared brought dead at hospitals, indicating deaths in transit or at home. Also, 38% patients died within 24 hours of hospitalisation and 11.3% (310) patients lost their lives within 48 hours of hospitalisation. Jindal said that the state saw at least 69.7% of its total Covid deaths during the second wave. As per the NHM director majority of the people who lost their lives in the second wave had co morbidities (around 70%) whereas in the first wave, only 41.6% of such cases were seen. Age-wise analysis The mean age of deaths in the second wave was 61 years as compared to 64.2 years during the first wave. The case fatality ratio registered in the first wave was 1.68% as compared to 1.67% in the second wave. The age distribution of deaths reveals that the percentage of deaths occurring in the age group of 30-44 almost doubled during the second wave (see box). However, the percentage of deaths in the 0 to 15, 15-29, and 60 and above group, decreased during the second wave. Situation improving As per Jindal, the positivity rate in the state is on the decline and has stayed around 6% over the last five days or so. “However, we need to be cautious as after the partial easing of restrictions, the virus may rebound, and the cases could go up again. We need to continue following all the Covid-appropriate behaviour which includes proper use of mask, maintaining hand hygiene and social distancing, besides taking the Covid vaccine,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/himachals-home-deaths-rose-during-second-covid-wave-101622919089818.html

Thirty-six years on, it is still pending. On the court’s order, both sides — Union government and SGPC — are ready to resolve the dispute out of court since 2019. However, no meeting has been held between the two sides so far.“The matter, which came to a standstill due to the pandemic, was discussed in our last executive committee meeting held on June 2,” said Bhagwant Singh Sialka, an advocate and general secretary of the SGPC. “It was decided that a letter will be written on the issue to Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon after the anniversary of military action.” The Prime Minister will be approached first because he is the competent authority being the executive head of the state, said Sialka. “Let’s see to whom he further assigns the task of negotiations,” he said.SGPC honorary chief secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami said the apex Sikh body has already paid ₹10 crore as court fees in the case. “So, we want the case to be settled, and will start the proceedings in this regard after June 6. We are bound by the court’s order to sit together and settle the dispute. The SGPC executive committee will sit again to decide on what terms the talks are to be initiated,” he said. The SGPC will also take help of experts and scholars in the process, said people privy to the development.‘Compensation is symbolic’“The loss borne by the Sikh community can never be compensated with money. The purpose of filing the suit was to make the government admit that it had been totally unfair with Sikhs. Compensation is a symbolic thing. If we get it, the operation will prove to be unjustified,” said Sialka, adding that the suit also helped bring on record the events that led to the military action and everything that occurred afterwards.Meanwhile, a sub-committee constituted by the SGPC is working on a list of precious items that were taken away by the Indian Army from Sikh Reference Library and other places on the Golden Temple complex.The military action that was carried out in the first week of June in 1984 to flush the Sikh militants out from the Golden Temple complex had damaged the buildings of the Akal Takht, Golden Temple and Teja Singh Samundri Hall, which is the SGPC headquarters. Except at Akal Takht, many bullet marks on other buildings are preserved as evidence in this case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/op-bluestar-suit-sgpc-to-hold-talks-with-centre-for-out-of-court-settlement-101622918245787.html

Addressing media persons in Prayagraj on Saturday, Tiwari, a member of Congress Working Committee, said that it was not proper to discriminate among people on the basis of age and state. “If the vaccine is free for people aged above 60 years, why arbitrary costs are being taken from those aged between 18-44 years?” he asked. The Congress veteran had taken his first Covid jab at the MLN Medical College vaccination centre on Friday. “Today even Supreme Court is asking why the Covid-19 vaccines were priced differently in different states. The Congress wants to know as to why the government is being so uncaring for the youth and the kids of the country,” he asked. He also said that Congress leadership including party general secretary and UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been demanding universal Covid-19 vaccination for all. “The BJP has been accusing the Congress of playing politics on this demand but now the Supreme Court too has expressed similar views on universal vaccination and sought a road map of vaccination from the centre. The apex court has also directed all citizens to benefit from vaccination,” he said. He took a dig at the centre for sending Covid-19 vaccines to 72 countries of the world despite the fact that less than 3 crore people have been vaccinated across India so far, a mere 3% of the population. “The roadmap to vaccinate the remaining 120 crore people is lacking,” he said. He claimed large number of deaths and rising number of Covid infections were mainly due to the wrong policies of the Modi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/end-arbitrary-pricing-discrimination-in-covid-vaccination-pramod-tiwari-101622918005316.html
06-06-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 curbs set to ease by levels for Mumbai||An all-too-familiar limp back to normalcy is on the cards for Mumbai and other cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan (MMR) region. From Monday, all shops in the city can open; restaurants can serve customers till 4pm on weekdays; private offices can be reopened with 50% staff, but only till 4pm; and people can go for jogging and to gymnasiums, albeit with certain conditions.While suburban trains won’t be allowed for the general public, commuters can travel by BEST buses provided there are no standing passengers, a difficult ask during peak hours in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai. Manufacturing units can function with 50% of the workforce’s capacity and with travel arrangements for the staff. E-commerce firms will function regularly. Wedding ceremonies can be attended by up to 50 people. Although the state has allowed all women commuters to use local trains, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday restricted the services to medical staff and a few essential sectors.Following the devastating second Covid-19 wave that forced a lockdown in Maharashtra from April, the government’s five-level plan to ease curbs, based on weekly positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds in districts, comes into effect from Monday. The state has classified 35 districts and 11 municipal corporations with more than 1 million population into five categories – level one to five. The degree of relaxation of restrictions has been decided as per the level of severity of Covid-19 in those districts. Level one has the least restrictions, while level five will have the most. Mumbai comes under level three (see box). “The order and classification of areas are more pragmatic. This fixes responsibility on local administrations — district collectors or municipal corporations — to reduce the spread of the virus and augment infrastructure,” said a state official on the unlock order, issued late on Friday. The new order was issued by relief and rehabilitation secretary Aseem Kumar Gupta, after the state disaster management authority decided so on Thursday.Mumbai and most of the MMR cities fall in level three. None of the state’s districts falls in level five. Eleven municipal corporations with more than 1 million population — Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nashik, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Aurangabad, Vasai-Virar, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur, Solapur and Kalyan-Dombivli — have been treated as separate units. Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi and Mira-Bhayandar fall under level three, while Navi Mumbai and Kalyan-Dombivli fall under level two. Areas under Panvel Municipal Corporation (PMC) fall under level 4.“We have made it clear that district and city authorities will the powers to impose stricter curbs if they feel it is necessary. The Mumbai corporation has taken the decision to not allow trains for women as it leads to lot of crowding, affecting the entire MMR. Similar decisions will be taken at the local level,” said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department.The official said most districts are happy with the exercise. “There was bit of confusion over the opening up of activities, but they have been clarified in a meeting chaired by the CM. We have tried to make it simple to understand at an administrative level and at the same time, the powers and responsibilities have been left to the local level,” he said.Level-three areas, however, will continue to have a curfew after 5pm every day. Salons, spas and beauty parlours have been allowed to operate at 50% of their capacity. Social, cultural, entertainment events and political/election meetings have been allowed with 50% capacity of the venue in level-three areas. The number of allowed attendees has been increased to 50 for wedding events in these areas, the notification stated. Religious places remain shut.However, the notification warns of blanket restrictions across the state if the oxygen-bed occupancy goes up. “The state’s daily production of medical oxygen is 1,200 metric tonnes, which can cater to a maximum of 60,000 patients needing O2. If the number of patients ranged between 35,000 and 45,000, no part of the state shall be below level three and no part be below level four, if it’s more than 45,000 patients. Currently, the oxygen bed occupancy is less than 35,000 patients and thus the oxygen trigger mentioned above does not get operated. In such a scenario, local level authorities are empowered to decide the level of restrictions they fall under,” the notification says.The state government is also considering introducing another parameter linked to the vaccination. “The relaxation will be linked with the vaccination percentage at a later stage, once vaccines are amply available. The district administrations witnessing a drop in positivity rare and oxygen-bed occupancy will have to report the constant drops to claim changing of the unlock gradation. Upscaling to an upper level will be based on the score of two weeks and it needs to show a consistent downwards trend on both parameters. We have no room left for local authorities manipulate data. For the upscaling in levels, they will have to approach the chief secretary, but to impose more curbs of downgrading, they can do it at their level,” another official from Mantralaya said.Maharashtra has reported fewer than 20,000 daily cases over the past week, after reporting a daily caseload of more than 50,000 cases at the beginning of May. The state had 196,894 active cases, as of Friday evening.Meanwhile, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) issued an unlock notification based on the level two guidelines of the state. All the shops in Navi Mumbai will be allowed to operate at regular timings, the malls, restaurants, cinema halls will be allowed at 50% capacity, weddings, funerals and social functions will be allowed with 50 guests. All private and government offices have been allowed to be opened with 100% attendance. Municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar, said, “Though the positivity rate in Navi Mumbai is down to 2% as required under level 1, the oxygen beds occupancy is over 25% and hence the unlocking has been ordered under level 2. The order will come into effect from 7 am on June 7 and will be in force till 7am on June 14. We will take further action next week based on the review of the situation then.” He said that while NMMC have allowed relaxations in the city, minimal attendance in closed and public places and minimal group movements will be the guiding principles.

CIMAP officials said the idea was to generate employment for local youths. They said overall, the initiative was part of the aroma mission, aimed at propagating farming and use of aromatic and medicinal plants across the country. CIMAP also provide training regarding farming for aromatic plants to people across the country. Experts at CIMAP had developed herbal sanitiser last year and subsequently shared the technology with a private firm with whom it also inked a pact last week for mass production of herbal sanitisers. Now, the private firm, along with the institute, is planning to set up at least two dozen manufacturing units across the state by the year end and hopes to employ nearly 300 educated rural youths. “The plan is to provide technological help to youngsters living in village areas so that they could convert it into an employment opportunity. We will also share the expertise about the process so that they could expand their business in coming days,” Manoj Semwal of CIMAP. “The progressive farmers from across the state who are in touch with the institute will be given a preference in the project,” added Semwal. CIMAP will share technological expertise the firm will help in setting up machinery and sourcing raw material for the manufacturing plants. “The villagers who will get employment at these units can also sell the herbal plants grown in their fields to manufacturing units,” said Semwal. In the first phase the firm has identified villages close to Lucknow, Kanpur, Ghaziabad, Agra and Aligarh to set up the manufacturing units. Eight manufacturing units will be set up in the first phase and plan is to set up these units by August, CIMAP officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/cimap-inks-pact-with-pvt-firm-for-herbal-sanitiser-units-in-rural-up-101622917885173.html

06-06-2021||World||Biden also considering military response to counter cyberattacks: US officials||U.S. officials on Sunday ratcheted up pressure on companies and foreign adversaries to fight cybercriminals, and said President Joe Biden is considering all options, including a military response, to counter the growing threat.The Biden administration is looking at "all of the options," to defend the country against ransomware criminals, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in an interview on Sunday, when asked if military action was being considered.Raimondo did not detail what those options could look like, but said the topic will be on the agenda when the president meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin this month. The rising threat of cyberattacks has pushed the Biden administration into a more aggressive stance against Russia, which is thought to be harboring some of the perpetrators."We're not taking anything off the table as we think about possible repercussions, consequences or retaliation," Raimondo said.Last weekend, the world's largest meatpacker was targeted by cybercriminals and in May, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States was attacked, stoking fears over supply disruptions of food and fuel.U.S. adversaries have the ability to shut down the country's entire power grid, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said separately in an interview with CNN, noting "thousands of attacks on all aspects of the energy sector".The recent high-profile attacks have prompted Biden to put the issue of Russia harboring hackers on the agenda for his meeting with Putin.The White House plans to use the June 16 summit to deliver a clear message to the Russian leader, officials say. A next step could be destabilization of the computer servers used to carry out such hacks, some cyber experts say.U.S. officials are asking private companies to be more vigilant and transparent about attacks. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Sunday said the May attack on Colonial Pipeline, which created temporary gasoline shortages, showed the national implications of a hack on a private company."Part of our vulnerability on cybersecurity is you're only as strong as your weakest link," he said in an interview with CBS.Companies need to alert the federal government when they are targeted, Granholm said, and stop paying attackers. "You shouldn't be paying ransomware attacks, because it only encourages the bad guys," she said.While she opposes ransomware payments, she said she is uncertain whether Biden or Congress is prepared to outlaw them.Companies should be required to report ransomware attacks, Democratic Senator Mark Warner from Virginia said on Sunday, though he stopped short of saying he supported making such payments illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-also-considering-military-response-to-counter-cyberattack-us-officials-101622998292130.html
06-06-2021||World||Trump rallies Republicans for 2022 midterm polls||Former US president Donald Trump returned on Saturday to public limelight with a speech in North Carolina in which he exhorted Republicans to gear up for the 2022 midterm elections, repeated lies about his election loss, attacked Dr Anthony Fauci, the top epidemiologist, and called for China to pay $10 trillion in “reparations” for the Covid-19 pandemic.Trump spoke at a convention of North Carolina Republicans in Greenville, which his advisers have said will be the first of more. And, it came amid possibility of an indictment from the Manhattan district attorney, and growing fissures in the Republican Party over his continued role and influence.“The survival of America depends on our ability to elect Republicans at every level starting with the midterms next year,” Trump said in a characteristically rambling speech that lasted nearly 90 minutes.KEEPS SUPPORTERS GUESSING ON 2024 PREZ RUNRepublicans are hoping to win the House of Representatives in the 2022 midterm elections, closing and overtaking their eight-seat deficit in the 435-member chamber (they trail 211 to 219 Democrats, with five vacancies), and the 100-member Senate, which they split evenly with Democrats. Midterms have tended to favour the party not holding the White House.Trump has managed to keep a tight grip on the Republican Party despite the initial outrage felt among many over his incitement of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. “We are going to have a tremendous 2022 like we did frankly in 2020, more votes than any sitting president in the history of the US. We had a great election. Bad things happened, but we had a great election,” Trump said repeating claims of election fraud that were dismissed by more than 60 times by courts and the legislatures of Republican-ruled states that he lost.Trump has since leaving office kept a relatively lower profile. Deprived of social media accounts - Twitter has banned him permanently and Facebook and Instagram have suspended him until January 2023 - communicating largely through short statements, some interviews and advisers.He has teased a run for the White House in 2024 but has not committed himself to it yet. “We’re gonna take back the Senate, take back the House, we’re gonna take back the White House and sooner than you think,” he said in a short fund-raising video released ahead of the North Carolina speech.TARGETS BIDEN ADMINISTRATIONThe former president went on to rip apart the Biden administration in his speech. “As we gather tonight, our country is being destroyed before our very own eyes. Crime is exploding, police departments are being ripped apart and defunded,” he said. He called the surge of immigrants at the border the start of the “Biden disasters”, criticised the president for rejoining the Paris Accord and his proposal to raise corporate tax.“Drugs are pouring in, gas prices are soaring, our industries are being pillaged by foreign cyberattacks,” he went on to say. “That’s a lack of respect for our country and our leaders.” Trump was referring to recent cyber-hacking of US companies. But the most sweeping and egregious of them - the SolarWinds attack - took place on his watch.FAUCI AND CHINA IN THE LINE OF ATTACKThe former president also attacked Dr Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, saying he is “not a great doctor, but a hell of a promoter”. Trump had clashed with Dr Fauci even while in office, which had turned the epidemiologist into a target for then president’s supporters. “Fauci said at the beginning, ‘no masks’. Remember that? Then, he became a radical masker. Get three, four. Get a pair of goggles, ideally. Wear them for another five or six years,” Trump said to laughter.The former president, who had deflected his own shoddy handling of the pandemic by blaming China, doubled down on it. “The time has come for America and the world to demand reparations and accountability from the Communist Party of China. We should all declare with one unified voice that China must pay - they must pay,” he said, going on to suggest it be around $10 trillion.LEGAL TROUBLESTurning to his own legal troubles, he dismissed them as an extension of the “five-year witch-hunt” he said he had faced from the time he announced his candidature for the White House. He called the Manhattan district attorney’s case “the ultimate fishing expedition”. “It’s been a five-year witch hunt, hoax after hoax,” he added. “They’ll never stop until November of 2024.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-rallies-republicans-for-2022-midterm-polls-101622999490738.html

He said the party at a strip mall lounge was ending when one or more vehicles “pulled up and began to fire into the crowd.”The identities of those killed and wounded were not immediately released Sunday. The shooting happened about 2 a.m. in the suburb of Kendall.Two of those who died were in one of the cars police believe was involved in the shooting. The vehicle sped off and crashed into a nearby wall. Authorities found at least one gun in the car, but its exact connection to the shooting was unclear.Sunday's shooting follows a bloody Memorial Day weekend in the Miami area that saw three people killed and 20 wounded in a still-unsolved mass shooting at a banquet hall.Another shooting on May 28 in the Wynwood area killed one person and injured six others.“Every weekend, it's the same thing. We have to band together,” Ramirez said. “There's a lot of work to do. We have to come together as a community and make this stop.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-dead-others-hurt-in-florida-graduation-party-shooting-police-say-101622998307191.html

The baby is the eighth in line to the British throne.No photos of the newborn or the Sussexes accompanied the announcement.The birth comes after Harry and Meghan’s explosive TV interview with Oprah Winfrey in March.

06-06-2021||World||Kamala Harris’ two assignments that could make or break her presidential bid||US vice-president Kamala Harris has been assigned a high-risk task by his boss, President Joe Biden, to lead the administration’s effort to protect voting rights. She has also been tasked with addressing the main cause behind immigration from Central America as the United States is witnessing a surge in refugees looking for asylum in the country. While both tasks are fraught with the high risk of failure, success could be highly rewarding for Harris, who is being dubbed as presidential-nominee-in-waiting.After Biden asked Harris to lead the administration’s effort to protect the voting rights for all Americans, the vice-president said in a statement that she will work with voting rights organisations, community organisations, and the private sector to help strengthen and uplift efforts. Harris further stated that she will also work with members of Congress to help advance the bills. "Every American has a right to have their voice heard at the ballot box, and no American should be kept from voting early, voting by mail, or voting at all," she said.Although the Democrats control the Senate with 50 seats and a tie-breaker vote of Harris, most legislation requires 60 votes to end the debate and go for a full vote on the Senate floor. This procedure allows senators to filibuster and debate the bill endlessly to stall the vote. In order to eliminate the filibuster, all 50 Democratic senators have to be on board with the plan.Also Read | Kamala Harris calls PM Modi; US to share Covid vaccines with India by JuneBiden had called for the Senate to pass For the People Act but the legislation is facing opposition from moderate Democrats. Senator Joe Manchin on Sunday said that he will neither vote for the legislation, nor he will support ending the filibuster rule. In an op-ed for the Charleston Gazette-Mail, the Democrat wrote, “I believe that partisan voting legislation will destroy the already weakening binds of our democracy, and for that reason, I will vote against the For the People Act.”“Furthermore, I will not vote to weaken or eliminate the filibuster,” he added.Without Manchin’s support, the voting rights legislation will most likely fail in the evenly-divided Senate. Harris’s new portfolio has now put her squarely in the middle of a partisan battle. Taking a jibe at the challenging assignment, Alyssa Farah, former spokesperson for Mike Pence, said that Biden was carrying on the “long-standing American tradition of passing off the terrible/impossible tasks to your VP.” However, Farah didn’t elaborate on the “impossible” task assigned to Pence under the Trump administration.Harris is set to depart Washington later on Sunday on her first foreign trip as vice-president. She will visit Guatemala and Mexico to deepen diplomatic ties and lead the administration’s efforts to stem the spike in migration at the US border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-two-assignments-that-could-make-or-break-her-presidential-bid-101622994464110.html
06-06-2021||World||Trump's groundless election grievances cloud Republican agenda heading into 2022||Republicans are fighting to seize control of Congress. Just don't ask what they'd do if they win.Look no further for evidence of the GOP's muddled governing agenda than battleground North Carolina, where party leaders packed into a convention hall Saturday night to cheer former President Donald Trump. Even with a high-stakes U.S. Senate election looming, the Republicans there were united not by any consistent set of conservative policies or principles, but by Trump's groundless grievances about the 2020 election and his attacks against critics in both parties.The lack of a forward-looking agenda stands in stark contrast to successful midterm elections of past years, particularly 1994 and 2010, when Republicans swept into power after staking clear positions on health care, federal spending and crime, among other issues. Without such a strategy heading into 2022, Republicans on the ballot risk allowing themselves to be wholly defined by Trump, who lost his last election by 7 million votes nationally and has seen his popularity slide further, even among some Republicans, since leaving office in January.“I’m unaware of a GOP agenda. I would love to see one,” said Texas-based conservative activist and former tea party leader Mark Meckler.“Nobody knows what they’re about,” he said of today's Republicans. “They do this at their own peril.”The GOP’s embrace of Trump’s self-serving priorities has almost completely consumed the party’s long-standing commitment to fiscal discipline, free markets and even the rule of law. That leaves Republican candidates from North Carolina to North Dakota unwilling or unable to tell voters how they would address the nation’s biggest challenges if given the chance.Party leaders acknowledge it could be another year or more before Republicans develop a clear governing agenda. In the meantime, Trump, who is focused on the past far more than the future, plans to become a regular campaign fixture again. Building on Saturday's North Carolina appearance, his advisers are eying potential rallies in states with top Senate races in 2020, including Ohio, Florida, Alabama and Georgia.In an interview, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who leads the Senate Republican political arm, offered a lukewarm response when asked about Trump's role in the upcoming campaign.“We both want to take back the majority in 2022. I tell him what I’m doing, and I’d love to get his support,” Scott said of Trump.He balked when asked whether Trump should serve as the face of the Republican Party for the midterms, when control of the House, Senate and dozens of governorships are at stake.“The face of the party is each individual race,” Scott said, noting that there will be hundreds of Republican candidates on midterm ballots. “The party is those people, it’s not one person, it’s not one person’s agenda."For now, when Republicans are not aligning themselves with Trump, they're focusing much of their energy on culture wars and railing against President Joe Biden's agenda. Biden, backed by narrow Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, has already adopted a $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package that was widely popular among voters. Now, he's pushing a massive infrastructure package that polls suggest could be equally popular.Gov. Larry Hogan, R-Md., worries that Republicans could squander built-in advantages in their quest to win back control of Congress and expand their advantage with governorships. In recent history, the party out of the White House has almost always made significant gains in the first midterm election of a new presidency.Democrats will lose control of Congress if Republicans flip just five seats in the House and only one in the Senate.“The only way we can screw it up is with Donald Trump,” Hogan told The Associated Press, lamenting that Republicans in Washington are consumed by infighting and “swearing fealty to one individual.”The two-term governor and frequent Trump critic continued: “I’m really kind of frustrated with the fact that the Republican Party doesn’t seem to be focused on an agenda. It doesn't seem to be focused on putting up coherent arguments for what people care about."Some Republican leaders close to Trump are encouraging him to look to the future.The former president is set to meet this week with the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, to begin discussing the party's policy prescriptions should the GOP retake the House majority next year.Trump has met privately with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in recent weeks to discuss the creation of policy document in line with Gingrich's famous “Contract With America,” which outlined a clear and concise Republican agenda before the GOP's 1994 midterm success.Trump adviser Jason Miller said it's “a bit of an overreach” to suggest Trump is actively working with Gingrich to create the document.In the meantime, Republican candidates in key Senate contests, North Carolina among them, are struggling to offer voters a clear vision for what they would do if elected as they fight for Trump's endorsement.At least three Republicans are competing to succeed retiring North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, who was censured by state party leaders for supporting Trump's impeachment in February. The Republican nomination fight features former Gov. Pat McCrory, current Rep. Ted Budd and former Rep. Mark Walker.After Trump's daughter-in-law Lara Trump bowed out of the race over the weekend, Trump formally endorsed Budd, the only candidate in the Republican primary who voted against certifying Trump's 2020 election loss.Walker had called himself the most “pro-Trump congressman from North Carolina" but that apparently was not enough to win Trump's backing.Beyond courting Trump, Budd has also played up the GOP’s culture wars. In his kickoff video, the gun store owner addressed growing immigration at the border with Mexico and the decision by Dr. Seuss' publisher to stop printing some of the popular children's book author's books because of racist imagery. Budd said he read the books to his children “and they turned out just fine.”Trump slapped at McCrory in Saturday's address by reminding voters, without using his name, that the former Republican governor had previously lost two elections.McCrory, who hails from the GOP's business wing, has embraced elements of Trump’s agenda, but has been critical of Trump's false claims about election fraud.“I’m not going to be diverted by talking about the past because I care about the future,” he told the AP in April.With 17 months before the 2022 general election and few voters paying close attention to the midterm jockeying, Republicans have time to develop an agenda that moves beyond Trump's grievances and conservative culture wars.But it's unclear whether there is sufficient political will.Scott, the Florida senator, said his party must ultimately communicate what it’s for — instead of simply what it’s against. But he noted that the "Contract With America” was released only two months before the 1994 election.“I don’t know if there will be a real contract for America, or everybody will just be more consistent with what they’re talking about,” Scott said of the Republican agenda in months ahead.On Trump, Scott added, “I think he's going to be helpful.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-groundless-election-grievances-cloud-republican-agenda-heading-into-2022-101622987930083.html

In a video posted on the Facebook page of Anonymous, the hackers said that the “carefully curated” image of Elon Musk is getting exposed, and people are “beginning to see [him] as nothing more than another narcissistic rich dude who is desperate for attention.”WATCH | Elon Musk threatened on video by 'Anonymous' over Tesla, Bitcoin, Mars plan“There are plenty of other companies working on space exploration and electric vehicles, you are just the only CEO who has gained a cult following through sh*tposting and trolling the world on social media,” the hacktivist group said.According to a Forbes report, much of Tesla’s seven-quarter profit streak came from the billions of dollars it hauled in from selling carbon tax credits to makers of gasoline-powered autos that need them to meet pollution rules of the US and the European Union. The report further suggested that the electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto, California, reported cumulative credit sales worth $4.4 billion, with $2.69 billion of that coming just since 2019.Also Read | Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses $15.2 billion in a day after issuing warning regarding Bitcoin surgeAnonymous said that people have started learning that the vast majority of Tesla’s income doesn't actually come from selling cars but from government subsidies and selling carbon tax credits for the innovation with clean energy. “This, technically, isn't your innovation though, because you aren't actually the founder of Tesla. You simply purchased the company from two people much more intelligent than you are, Mark Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning,” they added.The group claimed that Tesla has made more money by holding Bitcoin for a few months than they have by selling cars for years. They also suggested that it is more than likely the Bitcoins were purchased with money from government subsidies. “It is now widely believed that you have been forced to denounce your company's involvement with Bitcoin in order to keep that green government money flowing into Tesla's coffers,” Anonymous said.Last month, Elon Musk, citing climate change concerns, said in a tweet that Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. The announcement was followed by a meltdown in the crypto market, wiping out more than billions of dollars in value from the coin’s peak market value. Anonymous said that the use of energy argument about Bitcoin mining “is a very nuanced conversation that requires a fairly complex understanding of how power grids work, and how excess energy is wasted by power companies and sought out by crypto miners.”“This is a conversation that you have been having for over a year and were intimately aware of, but as soon as your main source of income was threatened you pretended to be clueless in an attempt to play both sides of the fence,” the hacktivist group alleged.Also Read | Bitcoin slips after Musk tweets a broken heart emoji with Linkin Park songAnonymous said that Elon Musk’s move to create a Bitcoin miner council was rightly seen as an attempt to centralise the industry and take it under Tesla CEO’s control. They noted that millions of retail investors were counting on their crypto gains to improve their lives, and even though they took the risk upon themselves when they invested, Musk’s tweets showed a clear disregard for the average working person.“You may think you are the smartest person in the room, but now you have met your match. We are Anonymous! We are Legion! Expect us,” the group warned.Anonymous also lambasted Elon Musk for “prematurely” calling himself 'Emperor of Mars', saying the Red Planet is a place where the SpaceX founder will be sending people to die.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anonymous-threatens-narcissistic-tesla-ceo-elon-musk-for-playing-games-with-bitcoin-101622984465178.html

The world is looking to us to rise to the greatest challenge of the post-war era: defeating Covid and leading a global recovery driven by our shared values,” Johnson said in a statement on Saturday.“Vaccinating the world by the end of next year would be the single greatest feat in medical history. I’m calling on my fellow G7 leaders to join us to end to this terrible pandemic and pledge will we never allow the devastation wreaked by coronavirus to happen again,” he said.The UK government is keen to highlight its efforts to ensure the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people have access to vaccines.At the outset of the pandemic, Downing Street said the UK funded the development and production of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and guaranteed it would be made available at cost around the globe.As a result, almost one in three vaccines administered around the world have been the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine – 450 million out of 1.5 billion doses – with the Serum Institute of India among those licenced to manufacture the doses as Covishield in India.“The UK also worked to establish the COVAX scheme to distribute the vaccine to developing countries, providing a significant financial contribution of 548 million pounds early on and encouraging other countries to commit to the scheme. COVAX would not have been able to deliver the 80 million doses it already without Oxford-AstraZeneca, which made up 96 per cent million of those doses,” Downing Street said.As part of his G7 message, Johnson is expected to call for stepping up the manufacture of vaccines, lowering barriers to the international distribution of those vaccines – as the UK has done with Oxford/AstraZeneca – and ultimately sharing surplus doses with developing countries bilaterally and through COVAX.The UK says it has already pledged to share a significant majority of its surplus doses with the scheme and will announce more details of the UK’s plans to support developing countries by sharing doses not needed by the country at the summit.G7 leaders – from the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan as well the European Union – will arrive at Carbis Bay in the coastal region of Cornwall on Friday for three days of meetings on a huge range of global issues, with a particular focus on how the group can lead the global recovery from coronavirus.Next Saturday, the G7 countries will be joined by the leaders of Australia, South Africa, South Korea and India for discussions on health and climate change – a mix of in person and virtual, as in the case of India.As well as asking leaders to join the UK in efforts to vaccinate the world, Johnson will call on them to support the Global Pandemic Radar – a new global surveillance system which will protect immunisation programmes against new vaccine resistant variants by detecting them before they have the chance to spread.Alongside efforts to defeat the pandemic itself, Downing Street he will stress the need to build back better, with a recovery that puts opportunity, sustainability and democratic values at its heart.This is the first G7 where all members will have committed to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Johnson will ask leaders to channel this ambition and make strong commitments on cutting emissions, shifting to renewable energy and providing climate finance for developing countries ahead of the UK-hosted COP26 Summit later this year.It is expected that the Cornwall Summit will advance the work the UK and other G7 countries have done to make sure all girls have access to 12 years of quality education. Next month the UK will also co-host the Global Partnership for Education Summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-to-set-end-2022-target-to-vaccinate-world-against-covid-19-at-g7-summit-101622983682002.html

Hesamuddin Shams, adding that rescuers were still searching for bodies in the valley.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but the provincial government accuses the Taliban of placing the bomb to target security forces. There was no immediate response from the Taliban.Large swathes of war-ravaged Afghanistan are littered with bombs and land mines. Many were planted by insurgents to target government military convoys, but they often kill civilians instead.The United Nations has repeatedly demanded both government forces and the Taliban take more precautions to protect civilians. In the first three months of this year, the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said that 1,783 civilians had been killed or wounded in Afghanistan, an increase of 29% over the same period last year.The violence comes as U.S. peace envoy to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad and a delegation from the National Security Council and Department of Defense traveled to the region to start a new series of talks between the Taliban and the government. They were to meet in Kabul and Doha in Qatar to urge the sides to reach a political settlement.Negotiations between the Taliban and Afghan representatives began last September in Doha and continued earlier this year. But the Taliban announced on April 13 that it would not take part in any conference intended to decide the future of Afghanistan until all foreign troops were gone.President Joe Biden had announced a day earlier that all U.S. troops would leave Afghanistan by Sept. 11.In northern Faryab province, provincial officials said Sunday the district of Qaisar had fallen to Taliban fighters after a weeks-long fight between the two sides.Provincial council chief Mohammad Tahir Rahmani told The Associated Press that provincial police chief Saifulrahman was killed in the fighting along with seven other police officers. Like many Afghans, Saifulrahman went by one name.According to Rahmani, the district had already fallen but police officers at police headquarters were resisting. He said the Taliban took 37 police hostage.A provincial police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media, said that besides police headquarters, the main market and municipality office fell to the Taliban.The Taliban immediately did not comment on taking control of Qaisar district but both the Taliban and Afghan government defense and security forces have increased their operations against each other.Also on Sunday, Kabul police spokesman Ferdaws Faramarz said a roadside bomb explosion in eastern Kabul targeted a civilian car wounding three people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/11-killed-in-roadside-bombing-in-northwest-afghanistan-says-official-101622975516951.html

Taiwan was chosen as one of the first to receive vaccines as it continues to battle a sudden surge in cases, NHK reported.A group of three Senators arrived at Songshan Airport in Taipei on a US Air Force cargo plane. The short visit was part of a larger tour of the Indo-Pacific region."It was critical that Taiwan be included in the first group to receive vaccines because the United States recognizes Taiwan's urgent need and values this partnership," said Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat who serves on the Senate Committee on Armed Services.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said that the United States' pledge to donate Covid-19 vaccines to Taiwan has sent a strong and clear message of its support for the country.Earlier this week, the White House had said that of the first 25 million, 19 million will be distributed through the COVAX initiative.As part of Washington's vaccine outreach, 7 million doses will be given to Asia which includes the following countries and entities: India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Maldives, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, and the Pacific Islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-to-receive-750-000-covid-19-vaccine-doses-from-us-101622974053084.html

Here's what reports suggest||With the planned date of the final easing of social restrictions in Britain approaching, UK health secretary Matt Hancock has said that he is absolutely open to not reopening on June 21 “if that's what needs to happen.” Hancock told Sky News on Sunday that it is too early to make a final decision on easing of restrictions, highlighting the growing concern over the coronavirus variant first identified in India.The final step of the United Kingdom’s planned four-step roadmap out of lockdown has seemingly been thrown in doubt with the rise of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 first identified in India. Repeating the findings of the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), Hancock said that the Delta variant, B.1.617.2, is 40 per cent more transmissible than the original strain.“It’s more difficult to manage this virus with the new variant. But after two doses of vaccine we are confident that you get the same protection as you did with the old variant,” the UK health secretary said. “The vaccine works just as effectively, and everyone must get their second jab though, as the first on its own isn’t quite as effective,” he added.Also Read | Covid variant found in India dominant in UK, had 'significant impact': MinisterThe Independent SAGE on Friday warned against progressing with the last stage of the roadmap, saying there is “increasing evidence that vaccine efficacy is compromised against this variant.” The independent group of scientists said that there is some evidence that protection from two doses of vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) wanes after a number of months, particularly in the elderly.“As things stand, it is very difficult to justify progressing with the last stage of the roadmap, scheduled for 21st June, a point that should be made now to modify current false hopes,” the group said.Earlier this week, Public Health England (PHE) stated that the Delta variant has become the dominant variant of concern in Britain, overtaking the Alpha variant, B.1.1.7, first identified in Kent, UK. PHE’s latest weekly data on circulating variants showed that there were 5472 new cases of the Delta variant in the UK in the week to May 26, bringing the total number of cases of the variant detected to 12,431.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/has-delta-variant-threatened-uk-lockdown-ending-here-s-what-reports-suggest-101622972397572.html

We've said that we'll give people enough time ahead of the June 21 date."We are not saying 'No' to June 21 at this point," he added.Hancock said it was important that people receive both doses of Covid-19 vaccines as the data showed this could protect effectively against the delta variant.Britain's swift vaccine rollout had weakened, but not broken, the link between the virus, hospitalisation and death, Hancock said.Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he could see nothing in the data that would derail the plan to end lockdown restrictions, although caution was needed.Britain's overall death toll from the pandemic stands at 127,836 and is the sixth-highest in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-variant-found-in-india-dominant-in-uk-had-significant-impact-minister-101622969178732.html

"When we meet, I will again underscore the commitment of the United States, Europe and like-minded democracies to stand up for human rights and dignity."Since taking office in January, Biden has ramped up pressure on the Kremlin, and his comments likening Putin to a "killer" were met with fierce criticism in Moscow.But both leaders have expressed hopes that relations can improve, with the Russian president saying Friday he expected a "positive" result from the talks.Biden in his weekend op-ed also stressed that Washington "does not seek conflict" -- pointing to his recent extension of the New START arms reduction treaty as proof of his desire to reduce tensions."We want a stable and predictable relationship where we can work with Russia on issues like strategic stability and arms control," he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-will-stand-with-european-allies-ahead-of-putin-summit-101622966353558.html

06-06-2021||World||Providence-Biological E Covid-19 vaccine to undergo phase two trials this month||A Canadian vaccine developer that announced a partnership with an Indian firm last week is hoping to start phase two trials for its Covid-19 vaccine this month. Providence Therapeutics, headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, is confident that it will be able to send a shipment of the vaccine candidate PTX-COVID19-B to its Indian partner, Hyderabad-based Biological E, in July so that trials can start in India, too, prior to application for emergency-use authorisation from health authorities.Brad Sorenson, CEO of Providence, told HT the company expects to soon submit some additional data requested by Health Canada. “As soon as we have that, which it may be as early as next week, but I expect it’ll be within two weeks, we will submit that to Health Canada and we will proceed into our phase two trials,” Sorenson said. Sorenson was hopeful that the first consignment of the vaccines, if approved, will start flowing to India from Providence’s manufacturing unit in the province of Manitoba by the end of this year. “If everything goes well, we should have approval before the end of the year and we should have doses to begin distributing right away once approval comes in,” he said.Providence will manufacture a batch of 30 million doses, with Biological E making between 600 million and a billion doses thereafter. Half that capacity made in India will be retained by Biological E and the other half given to Providence for overseas sale.Sorenson said Providence was exploring partnerships for manufacturing the vaccine so that high demand for a coronavirus vaccine could be met. “The nature of this deal is to make messenger RNA vaccines at very low cost,” he said.Providence is also in discussions with the World Health Organization (WHO) for participation in the UN body’s “solidarity trials”, which it describes as “one of the largest international randomised trials for Covid-19 treatments, enrolling almost 12,000 patients in 500 hospital sites in over 30 countries”. While acceptance is not guaranteed, Sorenson said he was confident Providence has “a world-class vaccine” and that the WHO is “very excited to have an mRNA vaccine of this calibre participating in the solidarity trial”. Authorisation by the WHO will also open up the vaccine’s usage globally, and Sorenson was hopeful it would become part of the Covax global vaccine distribution facility.Interestingly, Providence is working on another version of the vaccine, PTX-COVID19-LT, which is in its investigation phase. Sorenson said the “immunity that would be generated would be longer lasting” so a booster dose wouldn’t necessarily be required every year. “You might be able to get this shot and it might be good for five or ten years, and so it would be very effective for the entire world; and particularly for low and middle-income countries where rolling out vaccines on an annual basis is very prohibitive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/providencebiological-e-covid-19-vaccine-to-undergo-phase-two-trials-this-month-101622960609272.html

Until now, the immunisation drive was limited to people aged 18 and above.In an official statement to state media, the company's chairman Yin Weidong announced the decision on Friday. The government is yet to announce an exact date when it will start administrating the jab to kids. "When Sinovac's vaccine will be offered to younger groups depends on health authorities formulating China's inoculation strategies," local media reported Yin as saying.The preliminary results from Phase I and II clinical trials show that the vaccine can trigger an immune response in kids. The adverse effects have been mild so far, news agency Reuters reported.The participants were injected with a third booster dose after they completed their two regular shots. This resulted in 10-fold increase in antibody levels in a week, and 20-fold in half a month, Yin said while making the announcement.It will continue to test a three-dose regimen and to observe antibody duration before the company actually makes the recommendation to authorities about when a third dose should be given, he added.After Sinovac, state-backed drugmaker Sinopharm has also submitted a request for emergency approval for kids to the government. A vaccine from CanSino Biologics' is also in Phase II of the clinical trial involving those aged between six and 17.Meanwhile, the vaccination drive in China accelerated in the country as authorities administered 100 million shots injust five days. Chinese public health officials said that they are aiming to inoculate 80% of the population of 1.4 billion by the end of the year.(Agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-approves-covid-19-vaccine-for-kids-as-young-as-3-101622950941591.html

The total number of coronavirus cases in the country now stands at 4,511,669. With 13 new deaths on Saturday, the UK's total toll went up to 127,836.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWhile a Downing Street spokesperson said "no decision" has been made on whether to ease the Covid-19 restrictions, another government official told Sky News that other options were being drawn but "we are still expecting to be in a place to go ahead on June 21," PTI reported. "As the prime minister has set out, we can see nothing in the data at the moment to suggest that we need to deviate from the roadmap," according to the Downing Street spokesperson. The government would continue to review the latest data, she added.The government, which said there is "nothing in the data" to suggest ending lockdown should be delayed, is expected to mandate wearing of masks in certain settings and encourage people to continue working from home.Also Read: UK unlikely to relax foreign travel curbs amid Covid-19 surgeThe number of Covid-19 cases in the country is at its highest since March 25, when 6,397 were recorded. The rise in cases is being largely attributed to the 'Delta variant' or the highly transmissible B1.617.2 variant of concern (VOC) first detected in India."We always expected cases to rise as the country was opened up, the critical thing is the impact on the number of people who end up in hospital for any given number of cases," said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock."That link has been broken by the vaccine, but it hasn't been completely severed yet. That's one of the things that we're watching very carefully, and it's too early to say what the decision will be ahead of June 21, but we'll make sure people know in good time," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-looking-at-options-for-planned-end-of-covid-19-lockdown-101622947205157.html
06-06-2021||World||G7 leaders strike deal to tax Google, Amazon and other tech giants||The United States, Britain and other large, rich nations reached a landmark deal on Saturday to squeeze more money out of multinational companies such as Amazon and Google and reduce their incentive to shift profits to low-tax offshore havens.Hundreds of billions of dollars could flow into the coffers of governments left cash-strapped by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic after the G7 advanced economies agreed to back a minimum global corporate tax rate of at least 15%.The decision was taken at the meeting of G7 finance ministers in London.British Treasury chief Rishi Sunak posted a Twitter thread where he explained what the deal means. "Under the principles of the landmark reforms, the largest global firms with profit margins of at least 10% will be in scope – with 20% of any profit above the 10% margin reallocated and then subjected to tax in the countries where they make sales," he said in one of the tweets.He also said that the move will create a more level-playing field for UK firms and cracking down on tax avoidance.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the agreement “provides tremendous momentum” for reaching a global deal that “would end the race-to-the-bottom in corporate taxation and ensure fairness for the middle class and working people in the U.S. and around the world.”The meeting of finance ministers came ahead of an annual summit of G7 leaders scheduled for June 11-13 in Cornwall, England."Signaling that there is consensus around some of the key features of what’s being discussed globally was really, really important so they have the momentum to go to the next phase of this with the G-20," said Manal Corwin, a tax principal at professional services firm KPMG and a former Treasury Department official.Part of the agreement Saturday is that other countries would repeal their unilateral digital taxes in favour of a global agreement.The Group of 7 is an informal forum among Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. European Union representatives also attend. Its decisions are not legally binding, but leaders can use the forum to exert political influence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-leaders-strike-deal-to-tax-google-amazon-and-other-tech-giants-101622945395412.html

Now, a new study has revealed that a woman with advanced HIV carried the virus for 216 days.The case report, still to be reviewed by peers, also says that the virus accumulated more than 30 mutations. The report was published on Thursday.The 36-year-old woman has not been named. She is living in South Africa.The mutations involved 13 to the spike proteins, which helps the virus escape the immune response, and 19 others, which could change its behaviour, according to the study."While most people effectively clear Sars-CoV-2, there are several reports of prolonged infection in immunosuppressed individuals. We present a case of prolonged infection of greater than 6 months with shedding of high titter SARS-CoV-2 in an individual with advanced HIV and antiretroviral treatment failure. Through whole genome sequencing at multiple time-points, we demonstrate the early emergence of the E484K substitution associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies, followed by other escape mutations and the N501Y substitution found in most variants of concern," an excerpt of the study said."This provides support to the hypothesis of intra-host evolution as one mechanism for the emergence of Sars-CoV-2 variants with immune evasion properties," it further said.There is, however, no clarity if the mutations present in the woman's body were passed on to others.A person carrying HIV is 2.75 times more likely to die when infected with the coronavirus than someone with no co-morbidities, because of the immunity issue. But the woman in the case study was immunosuppressed.Still, the impact HIV had on mortality was less than expected and well below that of other co-morbidities such as diabetes, although it was higher than tuberculosis, an analysis of the South African data done by Western Cape Department of Health last year showed.About 7.8 million people in South Africa are infected with HIV, which causes AIDS, while about 300,000 have TB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hiv-woman-had-coronavirus-for-216-days-mutated-30-times-in-6-months-study-101622944129781.html
06-06-2021||World||'Country being destroyed': Trump slams 'radical left-wing Biden administration'||Former President Donald Trump on Saturday pushed Republicans to support those candidates who share his values in next year's midterm elections as he launched a new more active phase of his post presidency.The former Republican president teased the prospect of another presidential bid of his own in 2024, but vowed first to be an active presence on the campaign trail for his allies in next year's fight for control of Congress.“The survival of America depends on our ability to elect Republicans at every level starting with the midterms next year,” Trump charged.Trump delivered his latest comments in a speech to hundreds of Republican officials and activists gathered for the North Carolina GOP convention, the opening appearance in what is expected to be a new phase of rallies and public events. Out of office for more than four months and banned from his preferred social media accounts, the former president hopes to use such events to elevate his diminished voice ahead of another potential presidential run.His advisers are already eyeing subsequent appearances in Ohio, Florida, Alabama and Georgia to help bolster midterm candidates and energize voters.In contrast to the mega rallies that filled sports arenas when Trump was president, he faced a crowd of several hundred North Carolina Republicans seated at dinner tables inside the Greenville convention center Saturday night. Tens of thousands more followed along on internet streams.Invited to the stage briefly during his remarks, Trump daughter-in-law and North Carolina native Lara Trump announced she would not run for the Senate because of family obligations.“I am saying no for now, not no forever,” Lara Trump said.Minutes later, Trump announced his endorsement of loyalist Rep. Ted Budd in the crowded Republican primary, adding a slap at former Gov. Pat McCrory, who has been critical of Trump's falsehoods about the 2020 election.“You can’t pick people who have already lost two races and do not stand for our values,” Trump said.Trump devoted much of his remarks to railing against President Joe Biden, which he called "the most radical left-wing administration in history.”“As we gather tonight our country is being destroyed before our very eyes,” he said.Democratic National Committee spokesman Ammar Moussa took a shot at Trump in a statement released ahead of his speech.“More than 400,000 dead Americans, millions of jobs lost, and recklessly dangerous rhetoric is apparently not enough for Republicans to break with a loser president who cost them the White House, Senate, and House,” Moussa said.While Trump has had to work harder to make his voice heard since leaving office, he remains a commanding force in the Republican Party. A recent Quinnipiac University national poll found that 66% of Republicans would like to see him run for reelection, though the same number of Americans overall said they would prefer he didn’t.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/survival-of-us-depends-on-our-ability-to-elect-republicans-trump-at-north-carolina-101622941074381.html
06-06-2021||World||Israel's domestic security warns of 'possible violence' as PM Netanyahu faces unseating||The head of Israel's domestic security service issued a rare warning on Saturday of possible violence during one of the most politically charged periods in decades, with the country on the verge of unseating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, its longest serving leader.Netanyahu is facing the prospect of an end to his 12-year run as premier after Israel's centrist opposition leader Yair Lapid announced on Wednesday that he had succeeded in forming a governing coalition following a March 23 election.The new government, yet to be sworn in, is an unlikely patchwork of left-wing, liberal, rightist, nationalist and religious parties, as well as - for the first time in Israel's history - an Arab Islamist party.Netanyahu in online posts has warned the partnership was "a dangerous leftist government."Some right-wing groups are angry at Naftali Bennett, head of a small ultra-nationalist party who is slated to replace Netanyahu in a power-sharing pact with Lapid, garnering many postings attacking him on social media.Before the election, Bennett had promised he would not join the centrist Lapid, or any Arab party in a coalition."We have recently identified a rise in increasingly extreme violent and inciteful discourse particularly on social networks," Nadav Argaman, head of the Shin Bet security force, said in a statement without mentioning any names."This discourse may be interpreted among certain groups or individuals, as one that permits violent and illegal activity that may even cause physical harm," he said.Since Bennett announced he was joining forces with Lapid, security services have ramped up his protection with right-wing demonstrations held near the homes of his party members, hoping to keep them from joining the government.Argaman called on political and religious leaders to show responsibility and tone down potential incitements. His warning was reminiscent to some in Israel of the days leading up to the 1995 assassination of then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was shot by a Jewish ultra-nationalist for pursuing a land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians.Israel's left has for years pointed the finger at Netanyahu, then head of the opposition, for playing a part in incitement that preceded the assassination. Netanyahu has vehemently rejected the accusation and has repeatedly condemned Rabin's killing.Lapid and Bennett have said they hope their "unity government" will heal deep political divides among Israelis and end hate. A poll by Israel's N12 Television's Meet the Press on Saturday showed that 46% of Israelis support the Bennett-Lapid government, 38% would prefer another election - the fifth in about two years - and 15% did not state a preference.Tensions could flare further this week, when a Jewish right-wing march is expected to pass through Jerusalem's Old City's Damascus gate. Eleven days of intense fighting broke out last month between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, sparked by Israeli-Palestinian confrontations in Jerusalem, in and around the Old City. A similar march, its route diverted at the last minute, was held the day the fighting broke out.In the nearby flashpoint East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where the potential eviction of Palestinians by Jewish settlers played a major role in the buildup to the latest Israel-Hamas conflict, scuffles broke out on Saturday.Media network Al Jazeera said one of its reporters, Givara Budeiri, had been assaulted and arrested by Israeli police while covering a protest there.A police spokesperson said that Budeiri had assaulted officers and had refused to identify herself. Footage posted online showed Budeiri, wearing a press vest, being pulled and pushed while led away by three or four officers. Al Jazeera also said the reporter's camera was smashed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-domestic-security-warns-of-possible-violence-as-pm-netanyahu-faces-unseating-101622925569391.html
06-06-2021||World||Donald Trump returning to the stage as he flirts with 2024 run||Banished from social networks but no less influential among the Republican faithful, Donald Trump was set to return to the stage Saturday for his first speech in months as he flirts ever more openly with a new presidential run in 2024."I understand the place will be packed, all records broken!" the former president, his flair for showmanship undiminished, said in announcing the planned speech in Greenville, North Carolina to a convention of that southeastern state's Republican Party.Organizers said all 1,250 tickets to the evening event had sold out.That number is far smaller than the thousands Trump regularly drew to his campaign rallies around the country, but his followers' expectations are high for his first major public speech since February.While Trump has made no official announcement, the 74-year-old billionaire has openly floated the idea of a new run in November 2024, and his every word is being scrutinized.Still highly popular among Republican voters, Trump has been cut off from social networks, but he has hardly been silenced.Relishing the role of king-maker, Trump has issued near-daily statements to support chosen Republican candidates -- or to launch his vitriolic attacks on perceived enemies.Only a handful of Republicans have dared break with him, despite the January 6 assault on the US Capitol by supporters mobilized by his baseless allegations of fraud in last November's presidential election.Many Republicans still see him as a valuable asset ahead of midterm elections in November 2022, when the party hopes to wrest back control of Congress from the Democrats. His enduring influence is extraordinary, considering that he was defeated after a single term -- and was twice impeached.Yet in coming months, Trump is expected to again hold the big election rallies that he thrives on.The 'next time' For many Republicans, the party's focus in the midterm campaigns should be a sharp critique of the policies of Trump's successor, President Joe Biden.But Trump seems unable to let go of his theory -- debunked by scores of judges and state officials -- that the 2020 election was stolen from him. He seems certain to return to the subject Saturday evening.Trump is also expected to criticize White House pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci, accused by some Republicans of misleading the American public about Covid-19, according to the New York Times.The Biden administration, of course, is sure to take a beating as well.Still no concessionNearly five months after leaving the presidency, and now comfortably installed at his Bedminster golf resort near New York, Trump has yet to explicitly acknowledge his defeat -- and even talks more and more openly of a return to the White House.Ever the provocateur, the former president said Friday that the "next time" he is in the presidential mansion, he will not be inviting CEO Mark Zuckerberg to dinner, after Facebook announced a two-year extension of its Trump ban.Facebook said Trump could return only after it determines that any "risk to public safety" has disappeared. The popular platform had temporarily banned him on January 7, for having encouraged the deadly attack on the Capitol.The former president, also banned by Twitter, called Facebook's unprecedented decision an "insult" to the 75 million people who voted for him in November.Biden received more than 80 million votes.Accused in the House of Representatives' letters of impeachment of "inciting violence against the government" in the Capitol assault, Trump was acquitted in February by the Senate as only seven Republicans voted to convict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-returning-to-the-stage-as-he-flirts-with-2024-run-101622921056060.html
06-06-2021||World||US treasury's Janet Yellen tells G7 to keep spending, says inflation will pass||US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged other rich nations on Saturday to keep up spending to support their economies even as the Covid-19 pandemic wanes, and said US inflation this year would be elevated but transitory.Yellen told a news conference after G7 finance ministers met in London that they needed to invest in a fight against climate change and inequality, even after putting their economies "back on track" from the enormous hit of the pandemic.Her comments placed a different emphasis on fiscal support than the joint statement by the G7 finance ministers, which also stressed the need to ensure long-term sustainability of public finances once the recovery takes hold."Most countries have fiscal space, and have the ability to put in place, fiscal policies that will continue promoting recovery and deal with some of the long run challenges that all of us face when it comes to climate change and inclusive and sustainable growth, and we urge countries to do that," she said.Last week, US President Joe Biden's administration put forward a $6 trillion budget plan that opponents said will fuel higher inflation - something that Yellen on Saturday said was unlikely to be permanent.She hailed an agreement to pursue a global minimum tax of at least 15% on corporations as a return to multilateralism that would help to stabilize tax systems, while preserving national authority to set tax rates and policies."I really consider this a historic achievement, and it shows that multilateral collaboration can be successful," Yellen told reporters.The United States was still pursuing a 21% minimum for the overseas earnings of US companies even though the G7 agreed on at least 15%, she said."We haven't demanded or expressed the view that it's necessary for us to have the same level globally, but we do hope that countries will be ambitious and that the agreement is at least 15%. So we've yet to set the final rate," Yellen said.Treasury officials have said they believe a higher US tax rate will create incentives for other countries to push higher, otherwise they would miss out on potential revenue from American companies in their territory.Not all countries would need to sign on to the global corporate tax deal for it to work, Yellen said, as it would allow countries to additionally tax overseas income of companies operating via tax havens, negating that advantage."It doesn't require absolute agreement across the board. It has a way of bringing hold-outs into it," she said, adding that she hoped to secure the backing of G20 countries that represent a "very large share" of global GDP at a meeting in July.Keeping an eye on inflationYellen said inflation will remain elevated at 3% on a year-over-year basis until about the end of 2021."I personally believe that this represents transitory factors," she said. Production bottlenecks had caused elevated prices in some industries, such as motor vehicles, while other prices, such as airline fares, were rebounding back to more normal levels, she added."We'll watch this very carefully, keep an eye on it and try to address issues that arise if it turns out to be necessary," Yellen said.There is still slack in the labor market, she said, because of people who had lost jobs permanently, and it will take a while to reabsorb those workers into the economy."So we shouldn't expect this process to be complete in a month or two," Yellen said. "And while we're seeing some inflation, I don't believe it's permanent."Yellen said the G7 finance ministers agreed to ambitious commitments to de-carbonize their economies and mobilize public and private finance for action to combat climate change."To facilitate the mobilization of private climate finance, the G7 also agreed to take action to improve the availability of consistent, comparable, and decision-useful climate-related financial information to market participants," Yellen said in prepared remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-treasury-s-janet-yellen-tells-g7-to-keep-spending-says-inflation-will-pass-101622917277694.html

While the daily cases were the lowest since April 4, or in 62 days, the number of reported daily deaths in the country touched a low of a month-and-a-half (or since April 22).The second wave of the pandemic has now seen a steady drop for four consecutive weeks across the country. The seven-day average of new infections in the country – which denotes a region’s Covid-19 curve – had touched a peak of 391,819 case a day on May 9, but has now dropped to 123,232 cases a day in the past week, a drop of over 68% from the peak, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.“The second wave is stabilising or we can see is localised at the moment as from at least 500 districts reporting nearly 100 or more daily new cases in May, the number has come down to around 250 districts as on date. Most districts have shown substantial decrease in numbers since the peak was observed May 7, and hopefully the numbers will go down further in days to come,” a senior health ministry official aware of the developments said on condition of anonymity.In a recent press briefing on Covid-19, the Union health ministry informed that only five states constituted two-thirds of all new infections in the country now.“Among our new reported cases, 66% are effectively being reported from just five states and the remaining cases are being reported from 31 states, which is a sign to suggest we have managed to contain the disease transmission in a localised area,” said Lav Agarwal in the briefing. The health ministry, in a statement on Sunday, also said that the country has recorded fewer than 200,000 daily new cases for 11 continuous days now. “This is a result of collaborative and sustained efforts by the Centre and states, Union territories following the “whole of Government” approach. India has been witnessing a continuous fall in the active cases. The country’s active caseload has dipped below 15 lakh mark… The caseload is below 20 lakhs for seven successive days,” the ministry statement said.The daily test positivity rate has also dropped significantly, a factor that experts attributed to a significant increase in daily Covid-19 testing. The average weekly test positivity rate – proportion of samples tested that return positive for Covid-19 – in the country has now dropped 18 percentage points from the peak and is continuing to go down rapidly, offering what is perhaps the clearest sign of the country’s brutal second wave coming under control.For the week ending May 9, more than a fifth of all samples (22.8%) tested in the country returned positive, compared to just 4.8% in the past week. This turnaround is even more evident in the single day positivity rate, which has dropped to 3.2% on Saturday (the lowest in 81 days), compared to 25.3% on April 25 – the highest ever recorded.Much of this turnaround in positivity rate appears to be the direct result of a massive increase in testing. On average, more than 3 million samples have been tested in India every day in the past week – the highest this number has ever touched in the 15 months of the outbreak in the country. In fact, the daily rate of testing (seven-day average) has increased in over a million a day in just the past two weeks.Experts also say the numbers are indicative of a downward trend. “The numbers are stabilising but one recommendation cannot suit all states. This has to be local,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health. “Each state has to make decisions on unlocking based on the objective indicators locally. The lower test positivity will have to sustain at least for two weeks while the load on hospitals is considerably eased, especially the availability of beds with critical care. Based on some of the indicators, gradual unlocking should be done,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-logs-lowest-daily-cases-in-2-mths-data-101623004110955.html

06-06-2021||India||Nearly 30,000 children affected by pandemic, says NCPCR’s latest affidavit in Supreme Court||Children in more than 30,000 families were abandoned, became orphans or lost one of their parents between April 2020 and last week. The latest data submitted to the Supreme Court by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) is by far the most comprehensive estimate provided by states on the status of children affected during the Covid-19 pandemic.The figures were uploaded by the respective States and Union Territories on the NCPCR website “Bal Swaraj”. The Commission in an affidavit filed before the top court added a disclaimer stating that the reason for death of parent(s) could be any and not just Covid-19.The affidavit of the NCPCR filed through advocate Swarupama Chaturvedi on Sunday said, “The Commission is presenting the number of children who have lost either their mother or father or both parents from April 1, 2020 to June 5, 2021, based upon the information uploaded on “Bal Swaraj” portal up to 5th June 2021.” The reason of death was not uploaded by the States/UTs giving rise to a possibility of the death of parent(s) being for reasons other than Covid-19.The latest data shows that among 30,071 children affected during the pandemic, 3,621 lost both parents, a significantly high number of 26,176 lost either parent while 274 were left abandoned. Of the affected children, there are 15,620 boys, 14,447 girls and four transgenders. The Commission even categorized the data into age-wise brackets. This showed that more than 11,800 children are in the age group of 8 to 13 years and between 14-18 years, about 10,247.This is the second affidavit filed by the Commission in response to a query put by the top court on the number of children affected due to the pandemic. The possibility of significantly high number of orphans during the pandemic and an urgent need to cater to their care and protection was raised by amicus curiae advocate Gaurav Agrawal, assisting the Court in a suo moto petition on steps to contain spread of Covid-19 in child care homes. The earlier affidavit filed by NCPCR on May 31 did not contain complete figures of children affected during Covid-19 as many states faced technical challenges to upload data on the “Bal Swaraj” portal.The matter is fixed for hearing on Monday before a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose. Along with the affidavit of NCPCR, a note was prepared by Agrawal focusing on 10 states with regard to identification mechanism of children affected by Covid-19 and steps taken to provide them care under various Central and state schemes. These 10 states are Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand.Agrawal has also made suggestions on protecting the property rights of orphans/children. His note stated, “A large number of children have lost their fathers, who were the earning member of the families. In some cases, there is absolutely no income, no insurance benefits and no property with the widow.” Agrawal suggested that when orphans or children in need of care and protection (CNCP) are produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), it could assess the financial capacity of family or guardian and award an amount of ₹5000 per child as financial assistance. Some states have already announced special financial schemes for such children, Agrawal added.As per data of NCPCR, most among the affected 30,000 odd children are either at their homes with the single parent, guardian or family member with only 819 in Children’s Home (including observation homes and shelter homes), 41 in orphanages, and 62 with special adoption agencies.Among the states, Maharashtra recorded the highest number with 217 children orphaned and over 6800 children losing either parent. Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan recorded very high number of orphans at 706 and 671 respectively. The NCPCR affidavit has requested the Court to direct states and UTs not to share names or information about children in public domain or provide it to any person/ entity/ organization making these children susceptible to trafficking, abuse, illegal adoption etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-30-000-children-affected-by-pandemic-says-ncpcr-s-latest-affidavit-in-supreme-court-101623001350963.html
06-06-2021||India||In Delhi, only 2nd dose of Covaxin will be available for 18+ category now||Only the second dose of Covaxin will be available now in Delhi for the 18+ population as the Capital has run out of Covaxin stock for this age group and people who have got their first dose have to travel to Meerut, Chandigarh in search of the second dose. The Delhi government on Sunday directed all private hospitals and nursing homes to administer Covaxin only to those eligible for the second dose in respect of the 18-44 age group. This will go on until further orders. "DDMA hereby directs that all private hospitals and nursing homes functioning as COVID Vaccination Centres for Covaxin shall ensure that Covaxin shall be used for vaccination to only those people (of age group 18-44 years) who are eligible for receiving second dose of vaccination during the month of June, 2021 or till further orders," the order reads.The Delhi high court this week rapped the Delhi government and asked why it started vaccination centres with pomp and splendour when it is not being able to provide the second dose of Covaxin. The 2nd dose of Covaxin is to be taken within four weeks. Petitioners, residents of Delhi, moved the high court saying that people have to travel to nearby cities to get their second doses as the Capital has exhausted its stock of vaccines.The Delhi government told the court that Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of the vaccine, had promised five lakh doses of Covaxin in May, but only supplied 1.5 lakh doses. The matter will be heard on June 7.AAP leader and Delhi MLA Atishi on Sunday said it has been two weeks since Delhi ran out of its stock of both Covishield and Covaxin for the 18 to 44 age group. Fresh supply from the Centre will come on June 10."It is becoming a serious issue as a lot of people in the 18-44 group are nearing their date for the second dose. We are also hearing reports that people are travelling 100-200 km to Meerut, Bulandshahr to get their shots because there are no vaccines in Delhi," Atishi said.Delhi received a fresh stock of vaccines on Friday, which is for the 45 plus age group and it has now 21,850 Covaxin doses and 5,62,520 doses of Covishield for the 45+ category.

All you need to know||According to a New York Times report, colleges and universities in the United States want their students to be vaccinated against Covid-19 before the fall semester starts, but the authorities mentioning specific vaccines, approved by the World Health Organization. Sputnik V and Covaxin are yet to receive WHO approval.Here is what we know so far1. Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana have announced priority vaccination for students who are headed abroad. In Maharashtra, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Pune Municipal Corporation conducted such special drives for students and those who have foreign travel scheduled for work.2. Kerala raised two issues with the vaccination of foreign-bound travellers. One, whether they should be given Covaxin as it is not on WHO's emergency list yet; two, what to do if one has the travel date before 12 weeks. As Co-Win will not allow booking for the second slot before 12 weeks, the Kerala health department has asked districts to clear such cases.Maharashtra: Reduce gap between Covishield shots, urge students going abroad3. According to the New York Times report, Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs has said to an Indian student that she will be revaccinated once she reaches the campus.4. Though no country has made vaccination mandatory for entry, there are university-specific rules, reports said. These rules were designed primarily for domestic students but will affect students from India and Russia. The idea of a vaccine passport for travelling from one country to another is still at an incipient stage and India has recently expressed its objection to such a "discriminatory" idea.5. Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of Covaxin, is expecting to get WHO approval by September. The government is pursuing the application, it has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-indian-students-in-us-be-asked-to-get-covid-vaccines-again-all-you-need-to-know-101622998083195.html

However, they were on the run as their families were opposed to their union and even threatened to kill them.Dealing with their appeals, Vacation Bench of Justices Navin Sinha and Ajay Rastogi noted that the matter concerned life and liberty of citizens. One couple wrote to the Senior Superintendent of Police, District Tarn Taran in Punjab for protection in April this year. Around the same time, the couple in the second petition requested the SSP, Jind in Haryana seeking similar protection.The bench read the representations made to the police in the two petitions and allowed the two couples to supplement their representations to the Superintendent of Police. It held, “Since it concerns life and liberty, the Superintendent of Police is required to act expeditiously in accordance with law, including the grant of any protection to the petitioners in view of the apprehensions/threats, uninfluenced by the observations of the High Court.”Dealing with the Punjab couple, the Punjab and Haryana HC on May 11 had said, “The Petitioners in the garb of filing the present petition are seeking seal of approval on their live-in-relationship, which is morally and socially not acceptable and no protection order in the Petition can be passed.”A day later, another bench of the HC while dealing with the petition of the Jind couple said, “In the considered view of this bench, if such protection as claimed is granted, the entire social fabric of the society would get disturbed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/liveincouples-denied-protection-by-high-court-get-sc-cover-101622996550742.html
06-06-2021||India||Bengal governor Dhankhar has employed 3 relatives, kin of EDCs, says TMC’s Mahua Moitra||Unleashing the most scathing attack against West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha member Mahua Moitra on Sunday alleged that the former has employed three of his own relatives and two relatives of a former aides-de-camp (EDC) and one relative of his present EDC as officers on special duty (OSD) at Raj Bhawan, Kolkata. She tweeted a list of six OSDs. Bringing charges of favouritism unheard of in recent history, Moitra, while reacting to Dhankhar’s tweets on alleged post-assembly poll violence in the state, said in back-to-back tweets that the situation in Bengal will improve if the governor leaves with his “extended family”. In Moitra’s tweet, the list claimed that Abbhudoy Singh Sekhawat, the governor’s OSD, is Dhankhar’s “brother-in-law’s son,” Akhil Chowdhury, the OSD coordination, has “close family relation with governor,” OSD administration Ruchi Dubey is “the wife of Major Gorang Diksit, ex-ADC to governor” and the Major’s “brother” Prasant Diksit is the OSD protocol. OSD IT (information technology) Koustav S Valikar is the “brother-in-law” of Dhankhar’s present ADC Srikant Janardan Rao, IPS, the tweet claimed. Kishan Dhankhar, the newly appointed OSD, is “a close relative of governor”, the list indicated. Dhankhar assumed charge on July 30, 2019. The acrimonious relationship between the governor and the TMC government has been in the news since September that year. Although TMC leaders have time and again accused Dhankhar of being “an agent” of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and charged him with partisan behaviour, nobody made such serious allegations as Moitra did on Sunday. Moitra tweeted the list shortly after Dhankhar accused the administration of inaction in the post-poll scenario and asked the chief secretary to meet him on Monday to discuss political violence. “Extremely alarming law & order scenario @MamataOfficial. Security environment is seriously compromised. In such a grim situation called upon Chief Secretary to brief me on the law and order situation on Monday 7th June and indicate all steps taken to contain post poll violence,” Dhankhar wrote in one of his tweets. Addressing the governor as “Uncle Ji,” Moitra wrote, “Only way West Bengal’s grim situation will improve is if you move your sorry self back to Delhi and find another job. Some suggestions: 1. Advisor to Ajay Bisht Yogi CM on how best to ThokDo opposition. 2. Advisor to Home Minister on how best to hide during a pandemic.” Posting the list, Moitra wrote, “And Uncle Ji while you are at it take the extended family you have settled in at WB Raj Bhawan with you.” Raj Bhawan did not react to Moitra’s tweets till 8 pm. Talking to a news channel, Moitra said, “Don’t people have the democratic right to ask him these questions? He has brought his entire village and clan to Raj Bhawan. Government money is being spent to sustain them. I think it would be best if he leaves Bengal.” Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said, “This is hitting someone below the belt.” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, who defended Raj Bhawan on earlier occasions, said, “TMC is saying these because it has run out of issues. I do not know about these (appointments). We cannot say anything.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-dhankhar-has-employed-3-relatives-kin-of-edcs-says-tmc-s-mahua-moitra-101622995710529.html

The fruit has been priced between ₹500 and ₹1,000 per piece. Bookings have already been done for these mangoes," Shivraj Singh Jadhav, a mango cultivator from Katthiwada, told PTI.He said people who have booked 'Noorjahan' mangoes in advance include fruit lovers from Madhya Pradesh as well as neighbouring Gujarat."This time the weight of a Noorjahan mango is going to be between 2 kg to 3.5 kg," Jadhav added.Ishaq Mansoori, an expert in cultivating 'Noorjahan' mangoes in Katthiwada, said, "This time the crop of this variety has been good but the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted the business".He said 'Noorjahan' trees could not flower properly due to unfavourable climatic conditions in 2020."In 2019, one mango of this variety weighed around 2.75 kg at an average and buyers paid as high as ₹1,200 apiece for it," he added.The 'Noorjahan' variety produces fruits towards the beginning of June. These trees start flowering in January- February.A 'Noorjahan' mango can grow up to a foot long and its kernels weigh between 150 to 200 grams, local cultivators claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/noorjahan-mangoes-fetching-rate-up-to-rs-1-000-apiece-101622993496464.html

The Indian Council of Medical Research in its latest guideline for Covid-19 testing suggested that the provision of mandatory RT-PCR test for inter-state domestic travel can be completely removed. While the suggestion was to reduce the load on RT-PCR labs, which became overburdened with tests during April-May, which prolonged the waiting period, the minister told the news agency that it is under consideration of the ministry.But the decision will not be taken by the ministry alone. The opinion of health experts will be sought before taking any decision in this regard."A joint team from several ministries and stakeholders, including the health department, are in discussion to take a final decision on allowing travelling by air without an RT-PCR test for those who have received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine," the minister said.India has recently overtaken the US in terms of the number of people who have received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine. About 43 per cent of the 60 plus population has been covered with at least one dose and about 37 per cent of 45 plus population has recived one dose.However, even if a negative RT-PCR report does not remain mandatory for flying, destination states may still want this as a mandatory provision. "Health is a state subject, and to ask passengers for a negative RT-PCR report before they enter a state is solely the right of that particular state," Puri added.Domestic flight services saw several changes in the last few months as the second wave of the pandemic gripped the country. From June 1, the airlines have been asked to operate only 50 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights instead of 80 per cent. After being completely shit for two months in 2020, domestic flights resumed operations with about 33 per cent of their usual services. With the Covid-19 situation gradually improving, the cap was increased to 80 per cent by December 2020.From June 1, the fares of domestic flights have also gone up as the ministry raised the lower limit on fares by 13 to 16 per cent.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/negative-rt-pcr-report-may-not-remain-mandatory-for-domestic-flying-says-minister-hardeep-singh-puri-101622991702929.html

For instance, its normal date to reach Agartala, Aizawl, Shillong and Imphal is June 1 and Gangtok in Sikkim is June 10.However, the progress is going to slow over the next two days, June 7 and 8, the IMD said.The activity is expected to pick up after that due to a cyclonic circulation that is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal. This will also help the monsoon cover Odisha, Jharkhand, parts of West Bengal and Bihar by June 15, it said.Monsoon is expected to be normal this season as well as in June, a month critical for sowing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-covers-the-entire-northeast-imd-101622992004029.html

They said recent developments in Lakshadweep were quite “disturbing” and in the name of tourism development on the lines of Maldives, local sentiments can’t be overlooked. The recent draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (2021) and new rules introduced by the administrator have whipped up protests in the island and different parts of the mainland. Last week, the Kerala assembly had passed an unanimous resolution seeking the recall of the administrator. The signatories of the letter, 93 retired bureaucrats, said they were not affiliated with any political party but believe in neutrality and commitment to the Constitution and urged the PM to take native people into confidence before taking decisions. They said the draft regulation not only ignored the unique geography and community life of the islands it also give “arbitrary and draconian powers” to the administrator to acquire, alter, transfer and remove or relocate islanders from their property. They also pointed out that the Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (Goonda Act) is quite unwarranted and uncalled for. “According to the National Crime Records Bureau the crime rate in the island is very low compared to the rest of India, it has generated fear that that the real purpose of the regulation is to smother dissent or protests against the policies and actions of the administrator,” the letter said. Local people should be consulted before any change is imposed and in the name of development popular feelings can’t be overlooked, it said. The Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation, if passed into law, will ban the killing of bovine animals and prohibit the consumption, storage, transport or sale of the cattle, meant in island environment where there are inherent limit to livestock development, the letter said adding that there is no such ban in Kerala or north-eastern states. “These drafts have been introduced without local consultation and are presently with the Ministry of Home Affairs for necessary approval,” said the letter written by former bureaucrats under the aegis of the Constitutional Conduct Group (CCG). “Each of these measures smack of not of development but of alien and arbitrary policy making, in violation of the established practice that respect environment and society of Lakshadweep,” it said. Signatories of the letter include former National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon, ex Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh, former Principal Secretary to the PM T K A Nair, former Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah and former head of Prasar Bharati Jawahar Sircar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-disturbing-developments-in-lakshadweep-former-bureaucrats-write-to-pm-modi-101622992470700.html

According to a press release issued by the ministry of science and technology, the clinical trial is a multi-centric, randomised, open-label clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the drug for treating hospitalised Covid-19 patients.The ministry pointed out that Niclosamide has been extensively used in the past for treating tapeworm in children and adults. The drug’s safety profile has been tested over time and has found to be safe for human consumption at different dose levels. News agency PTI reported on Thursday that Niclosamide was also used for treating patients during the SARS outbreak of 2003-04 and is currently a part of the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) list of essential medicines.Also Read| India’s first indigenous home-based rapid Covid test launched commerciallyDr Shekhar C Mande, the Director general (DG) of the CSIR expressed happiness over the subject expert committee’s (SEC’s) recommendations to conduct phase-II clinical trials using Niclosamide, which is generic, affordable and easily available in India, the release said.“In a screen to identify drugs that can inhibit syncytia formation, Niclosamide was identified as a promising repurposed drug by a research group from King’s College, London, who collaborated in this project. The syncytia or fused cells observed in the lungs of patients with Covid-19 probably results from the fusogenic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Niclosamide can inhibit syncytia formation,” Dr Ram Vishwakarma, advisor to the CSIR DG said.Dr Vishwakarma cited a collaborative research work between CSIR-IIIM andJammu and the National Center For Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru which showed that Niclosamide was a potential SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor blocking the viral entry through pH-dependent endocytic pathway.Dr Ram Upadhayaya, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Laxai, meanwhile, said considering the potential of Niclosamide, efforts had started in 2020 to undertake clinical trials of the anti-helminthic drug. The science ministry’s release also stated the clinical trial has been initiated at different sites and is expected to be completed within 8-12 weeks.Also Read| DRDO issues directions for use of 2-DG, its drug for Covid-19 patientsHowever, Niclosamide is not the only drug which the Centre is evaluating for treating the coronavirus disease.On May 17, India rolled out 2-DG, developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in collaboration with Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL).

06-06-2021||India||Prioritise pregnant women for Covid-19 vaccination: Report||Amid rising deaths of pregnant women due to Covid-19, a report has made a strong case for their vaccination on a priority basis.For Covid not to further aggravate the already heavy burden of maternal and under five mortality, there is a strong case for inclusion of pregnant women as a high priority group for vaccination, a report prepared by a group of doctors led by Yamini Sarwal of Delhi-based Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital said. "We recommend including Covid-19 vaccination in the routine protocol for antenatal care in all countries, particularly India and Indonesia, in view of their high dual burden," it said.Currently, either pregnant women are not included for vaccination, or the policies are ambiguous with the decision being often left to the woman, the report said.Evidence is emerging of the safety and efficacy of Covid vaccination, which along with benefits of passing on the protection to the newborn, call for including pregnant women in the high priority group for vaccination, it said.Observing that pregnant women are known to be at significantly higher risk for severe coronavirus-related complications compared with non-pregnant women, it said, the issue of protecting such women is critical. Vaccination has emerged as a reliable protective measure against severe Covid-19 infection, the report noted.Of the top 20 Covid affected countries, nine allow vaccination of pregnant women, of which two preferentially vaccinate them. In contrast, four of the 20 high under-five mortality countries allow vaccination of pregnant women, while none include them in the preferential group. India and Indonesia, with one fifth of world's population, fall in both the groups but do not include pregnant women for vaccination.Many organisations have represented the government for inclusion of pregnant women for inoculation.Last month, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has moved the Supreme Court against the January 14 advisory of the Union government excluding pregnant and lactating women from vaccination.Arguing for prioritisation, the report said pregnant women experience more severe Covid-19 disease than non-pregnant women. They are more likely to require hospitalization, admission to ICU, receive invasive ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation when compared with non-pregnant women, it said, adding, there is a 70 per cent increased risk of death among symptomatic pregnant women as compared to non-pregnant ones.  Women who get coronavirus infection while pregnant, experience a higher maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, it added. Observing that Covid vaccination in pregnancy has dual benefit, it said, both the mother and newborn get antibodies which have been demonstrated in cord blood and breast milk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prioritise-pregnant-women-for-covid-19-vaccination-report-101622981691857.html

"We should know what is the road ahead and how to restore the quota for the community in education and jobs," the member of Parliament said.The Uddhav Thackeray-led state government should do whatever in its capacity to ensure that the Maratha community gets justice, he also said.Earlier in the day, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the Maharashtra government is making "all possible efforts" to grant reservation to Marathas, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in May, without disturbing the existing quotas of other communities.Also read | Maratha reservation issue: King Shivaji’s descendant leaning towards Congress?"On this occasion, I would like to assure the people, especially those from the Maratha community, that the MVA government is making efforts to ensure that Marathas get reservation without disturbing quotas of other communities," Pawar told reporters in Pune on the sidelines of "Shiv Swarajya Din”.He said a delegation led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray met Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on the Maratha quota issue.Also read | Marathas now EWS; 6K youths to get govt jobsAjit Pawar's comments came two days after a committee, headed by retired high court judge justice Dilip Bhosale, recommended in its report that the Maharashtra government should file a review petition against the top court's decision.The Supreme Court on May 5 struck down the Maharashtra law granting quota to the Maratha community in education and government jobs, saying it was "unconstitutional”.

Akhil Chowdhury, who is the OSD coordination, has some close family relationship with the Governor. OSD administration Ruchi Dubey is the wife of Major Gorang Diksit, ex-ADC (aides-de-camp) to the Governor, while the Major's brother Prasant Diksit is the OSD (protocol). OSD IT Koustav S Valikar is the brother-in-law of Dhankhar's present ADC Srikant Janardan Rao, IPS. Kishan Dhankhar, a newly appointed OSD of the Governor, is also his close relative, the document said."We all have the democratic right to ask him questions. He keeps asking questions to the state government. I would rather request him to look into the mirror.

The overall SDG score of India is 61.9 out of 100.Elaborating state-wise preparedness, the report said Jharkhand and Bihar are the least prepared to meet the SDGs by 2030, which is the target year. While Jharkhand lags in five of the SDGs, Bihar lags in seven.It said the states/UTs with the best overall score which are on the path to achieving the SDGs are Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh.The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, was adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, which provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.There are 17 SDGs which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership.The 17 SDGs adopted by UN member states are SDG1- no poverty, SDG 2-zero hunger, SDG3-good health and well-being, SDG4- quality education, SDG 5- gender equality, SDG 6- clean water and sanitation, SDG 7- affordable and clean energy, SDG 8 – decent work and economic growth, SDG 9- industry, innovation and infrastructure.SDG 10 – reduced inequalities, SDG 11- sustainable cities and communities, SDG 12- responsible consumption and production, SDG 13- climate action, SDG 14- life below water, SDG 15- life on land, SDG 16- peace, justice and strong institutions and lastly SDG 17- strengthening global partnerships for the goals.The report also said that India ranked 168 out of 180 countries in terms of Environmental Performance Index (EPI) which is calculated on various indicators, including environmental health, climate, air pollution, sanitation and drinking water, ecosystem services, biodiversity, etc.India's rank was 172 in the environmental health category, which is an indicator of how well countries are protecting their populations from environmental health risks.According to the EPI 2020 report by Yale University, India ranked 148, 21 positions behind Pakistan which was at 127th position in the category of biodiversity and habitat which assesses countries' actions toward retaining natural ecosystems and protecting the full range of biodiversity within their borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-slips-two-spots-to-rank-117-on-17-sdgs-adopted-as-2030-agenda-report-101622969134638.html

The association asserted that 5G would prove to be a "game changer" and lead to "exponential increase in benefits" for the economy and society.The association - which represents large telcos like Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea - argued that India already has strict norms in place and prescribed standards for electromagnetic radiation limit in telecom sector is far more stringent than global-accepted standards."Radiation permitted in India is one-tenth of what is accepted globally so already our systems have taken this into account...Any notion or concern about radiation and impact are misplaced. These are fallacious fears and this always happens whenever a new technology is introduced," S P Kochhar, director general, COAI told PTI.The Delhi high court on Friday dismissed actor Juhi Chawla's lawsuit challenging the setting up of 5G wireless networks in the country and slapped a fine of ₹20 lakh on her and co-petitioners by describing the plea as "defective", "abuse of process of law" and filed for "gaining publicity".Justice J R Midha said the plaintiffs -- Chawla and two others -- have abused and misused the process of law and wasted the court's time. The judge said the plaint in which questions have been raised about health hazards due to the 5G technology was "not maintainable" and was "stuffed with unnecessary Scandalous, frivolous and vexatious averments" which are liable to be struck down.COAI's Kochhar welcomed the court's decision and said "it puts to rest motivated rumour-mongering that was doing the rounds" and would set the pace for others to "desist from such misadventures".It may be recalled that last month, the industry association had slammed false information and rumours linking 5G technology with the spread of COVID-19 and had dismissed the unsubstantiated and unverified claims in this regard.The COAI had said it came across multiple messages on social media platforms mentioning 5G spectrum trials as the probable cause of rising cases of COVID-19. Kochhar said that since the public outreach by the industry and Department of Telecom, such messages "have gone down drastically".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5g-tech-is-safe-says-industry-body-after-juhi-chawla-s-lawsuit-101622977803881.html

06-06-2021||India||Rajasthan’s folk artists face ‘starvation-like’ crisis due to Covid restrictions||Kutla Khan, a folk musician from Rajasthan’s Barmer district, says he is nearly starving with his family due to loss of all avenues of income after cultural events and marriages dried up owing to restrictions to contain the coronavirus pandemic. While other unfortunate circumstances too contributed to his prolonged misery, circumstances precipitated by the coronavirus are primarily responsible for pushing him and other folk artists in the region to the brink, he adds.Till about two years ago, Kutla had no reasons to complain as he was busy performing in musical events across the country and even abroad, however, a fire in July 2019 not only destroyed his house but also left him with severe burn injuries, he recalls with pain.While his burnt face meant he received very limited invitations to musical events, the coronavirus pandemic snatched even the last straw keeping him and his family afloat as his remaining source of income in local weddings and festivals became minimalistic affairs. For the past one year, Khan says he has generated no income to support his wife and four kids.“My wife and kids are managing the family’s needs by doing menial jobs at people’s house or by begging. I have approached the authorities for assistance but my plea was ignored,” Kutla Khan says.Mehboob Khan, another folk musician, says some folk musicians were earlier helping struggling musicians like Kutla Khan but are no longer in a position to do so since they too were struggling to make the ends meet due to the freeze on musical events. He says he has approached the Barmer district collector seeking help, including ration kits, to sustain the families of the local folk artists.“The government should take some initiative for folk artist as they belong to the weaker section of the society, otherwise not only the artists but their art will also die,” Mehboob Khan says pensively.Folk artists from the Thar desert are globally known for their music and regularly represent India in cultural festivals abroad but have traditionally depended on patrons for their upkeep.Fakira Khan, an international folk artist, says, “We used to manage our needs from the income from cultural events, weddings and festivals. For generations we have entertained our patrons musically in return for cattle or cash. Earlier functions like marriages were not possible without our presence. But in Covid-era nobody is inviting us, leading to starvation-like conditions.”Barmer’s additional district collector Om Prakash Bishnoi told HT that the administration was offering all possible help.“With the help of some NGOs, we have distributed ration kits to the families of folk artists. Besides this, we are exploring other options to help them as per their requirements,” he said.Narendra Tansukhani, secretary of Marudhar Lok Kala Mandal-- an NGO working for the welfare of folk artists-- says local folk artists are like the soul of western Rajasthan and the government has a duty towards them.“Government must understand that the folk artists are the cultural heritage of western Rajasthan. Hence, the government should take some initiative to protect them otherwise we will not only lose them but will also lose our cultural identity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthans-folk-artists-face-starvation-like-situation-due-to-covid-restrictions-101622975910193.html

The developments are disturbing as they "constitute an onslaught on the very fabric of Lakshadweep society, economy and landscape as if the islands were just a piece of real estate for tourists and tourism investors from the outside world," the letter said. Understanding the discontent in Lakshadweep: An explainerFormer National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon, former Prasar Bharati CEO Jawhar Sircar, ex-Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh, former Adviser to prime minister T K A Nair and former Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah are among the 93 signatories, news agency PTI reported."These drafts have been introduced without local consultation and are presently with the Ministry of Home Affairs, government of India for necessary approvals," said the letter, written by former civil servants under the aegis of Constitutional Conduct Group (CCG). A copy of the letter has been shared with home minister Amit Shah and environment, forest and climate change minister Prakash Javadekar.The Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation reflects a model of land and tourism development which includes resorts, hotels and beachfront on the "Maldives model" unmindful of the differences between the two island groups in size, population, number of islands and their spread, the letter said.The Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation, if passed into law, will ban the killing of bovine animals and prohibit the consumption, storage, transport or sale of cattle meat in an island environment where there are inherent limits to livestock development, the letter said, highlighting that no such ban is there in the North-East and in Kerala. The changes being proposed by the Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, 2021 for elections to gram panchayats that will disqualify candidates with more than two children from contesting seats for the gram panchayat too have been proposed without any local consultation or taking into account local sensitivities, it said.“Each of these measures smacks not of development but of alien and arbitrary policy making, in violation of established practices that respect the environment and society of Lakshadweep,” the letter said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maldives-model-can-t-work-in-lakshadweep-ex-bureaucrats-write-to-pm-modi-on-disturbing-developments-101622973307219.html
06-06-2021||India||Jama Masjid’s Shahi Imam Bukhari writes to PM Modi over repair work||Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the Shahi Imam of Delhi’s Jama Masjid, on Sunday, urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to direct the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to inspect the monument and carry out necessary repairs. He wrote to the PM two days after a minaret of the 17th-century mosque was damaged on Friday following strong winds and rain that struck the city during evening hours.“The structure of the internationally renowned Jama Masjid Delhi is in dire need of repairs….Many stones of the building are in a state of dilapidation and often keep falling off. Yesterday also, some stones fell down from the minaret but a major mishap was averted as the mosque is closed to the general worshippers due to the lockdown these days,” Bukhari said in his letter to PM Modi.Built by Mughal emperor Shahjahan, the mosque was constructed in 1656 and is not an ASI-protected monument.The responsibility of the mosque’s maintenance rests with the Delhi Waqf Board. A sudden thunderstorm and rain showers accompanied by strong winds travelling at 60 kms per hour lashed the city on Friday, following which, a slab of red sandstone from the minaret came crashing down and pierced the floor beneath, also damaging the mosque’s courtyard. Due to restrictions to contain the pandemic, the mosque is closed to visitors and no one was injured.As a special case, repairs at Jama Masjid have been carried out, from time to time, by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) since 1956. “Due to the falling of these stones, the support of...other stones...has gone and they have become weakened and thus warrant immediate repairs to avoid any grave mishap. I shall be grateful if you instruct the Archaeological Survey of India to inspect the monument and commence the necessary repairs, and particularly to inspect the two minarets in order to ascertain their condition,” said Bukhari.Speaking to HT, Bukhari said conservation work of the minarets has not been undertaken in nearly 50 years. He said it was crucial for experts to inspect the mosque for repairs. “The other minaret was struck by lightning years ago. After that, repairs have not been undertaken. In order to avoid any accident, we want engineers to inspect the two minarets,” said Bukhari.While repair work is undertaken occasionally, on a needs basis, it was crucial for experts to inspect the complete mosque for defects, said Bukhari. “When the mosque was constructed, iron was used to join the different stone slabs. Iron weakens over time and the stones also get affected. While the stones appear fine on the outside, they have sustained damage on the inside. Experts from ASI should inspect the mosque,” he said.Author and historian Swapna Liddle said it was crucial to undertake a more nuanced and wider conservation approach over piecemeal efforts before the condition of the mosque deteriorates too much “Architecturally, the building is very important. The mosque is definitely a monument of national importance. Conservation architects should examine every inch of the mosque thoroughly to check for structural stability and other concerns. They should embark on a comprehensive restoration project before things deteriorate,” said Liddle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jama-masjid-s-shahi-imam-bukhari-writes-to-pm-modi-over-repair-work-101622975249929.html

"The day they will say they don't want me, I will resign and work day and night for the development of the state," Yediyurappa said in response to a question on attempts to replace him, according to news agency PTI. "I'm in no confusion. They (high command) have given me an opportunity, I'm trying beyond my strength to utilise the opportunity for good. Rest is left for the high command,” he said while speaking to reporters.The clamour for a leadership change in Karnataka unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party has grown louder with increasing instances of conflict within the BJP and the Yediyurappa-led government. The defeat in the Maski bypolls and wafer thin margin of victory in Belagavi Lok Sabha by-elections has also gone against the 78-year-old chief minister.Also read | Replacing BSY may change political discourse: ExpertsYediyurappa’s relationship with BJP’s central leadership has soured over the last few months. The chief minister has been forced to secure his chair, assuage dissent within his own government and party as well as lead the calamity-prone state out of the raging Covid-19 pandemic at the same time. Many have also said his handling of the pandemic in the state hasn’t been very good.At least two BJP leaders, including one minister, went to Delhi in May, purportedly to meet the top brass in connection with a possible change in leadership in the state. In response to their Delhi visit, Yediyurappa said his only priority was to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. “I only have Covid in front of me. To control it and people’s welfare is my only priority. If someone went to someplace, they have been sent back with an answer,” Yediyurappa said.Also read | Those who went to Delhi sent back with an answer, says K’taka CM YediyurappaOn Sunday, the Karnataka chief minister also responded to a question on "alternate leadership”. “I will not criticise anyone. I won't agree that there is no alternate person. There will always be alternate persons in the state and the country, so I won't agree that there are no alternate persons in Karnataka, but until the high command has confidence in me I will continue as the chief minister,” he said.However, many state BJP leaders have rallied behind Yediyurappa, and said there is no plan to replace the chief minster.Also read | Political tensions stare at Karnataka govt as Covid subsidesYediyurappa’s deputy CN Ashwathnarayan said on Sunday that here is no question of him stepping down. “No such discussions are happening.

"We do not have any such ideas to bring down Yediyurappa from the chief minster's post and we have unanimously selected him as the Chief Minister.

A day later, the order was withdrawn, stating that it was issued without any instructions or knowledge of the hospital administration or Delhi government.A member of the Delhi Action Committee of Malayali nurses said that the circular poses a threat to the linguistic freedom of the medical staff."It was really shocking for us. We feel that it is a threat to our linguistic freedom. We need an apology from the concerned person as they have humiliated the whole state," Fameer CK told news agency ANI.If the notice was issued without the knowledge of the hospital administration, then it should be treated as misconduct, Fameer said, adding that serious action should be taken against those responsible.Delhi government should take strict action against the nursing superintendent who had signed the circular, Fameer told ANI. The union will continue its agitation till an apology letter from the concerned department is issued, he said.The circular, now withdrawn, sparked a political furore over linguistic freedom as Opposition leaders condemned the move as 'unacceptable and crude'.Congress leader and MP from Wayanad, Kerala Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter to post about stopping language discrimination. "Malayalam is as Indian as any other Indian language. Stop language discrimination!" he said in a tweet.Shashi Tharoor, Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, also tweeted stating, "It boggles the mind that in democratic India a government institution can tell its nurses not to speak in their mother tongue to others who understand them. This is unacceptable, crude, offensive and a violation of the basic human rights of Indian citizens. A reprimand is overdue!"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-humiliated-nurses-seek-apology-on-don-t-speak-in-malayalam-order-for-delhi-hospital-101622970270890.html
06-06-2021||India||91 universities adopt 'extra-curricular' NCC as elective course||The National Cadet Corps (NCC) won't remain an extra-curricular activity as at least 91 universities across the country have adopted it as General Elective Credit Course (GECC) under the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS). The move is a result of a letter from the University Grants Commission (UGC) to Vice-Chancellors of all universities on April 15.The highest number of universities offering NCC as GECC (42) are in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Andaman and Nicobar combined, followed by Jammu and Kashmir (23). These include central university of Jammu, Islamia College of Science and Commerce in Srinagar and St Joseph College in Trichy. Apart from these, Maharaja Sayajirao Gayakwad University in Gujarats Vadodara, Amity University in Madhya Pradesh's Gwalior and Kalahandi University in Odisha are also among the institutions offering the NCC as GECC.The UGC's communication was in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which has proposed to remove the hard separation between extra-curricular, co-curricular and curricular activities in schools.According to the government, the provision of NEP 2020 will allow harnessing of the full potential of NCC's capacity in youth development and enlarging the student base taking up the training.The UGC and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had first issued a circular in 2013 for introduction of NCC as an elective subject on a voluntary basis. But out of 10,397 schools and 5,098 colleges, which had NCC then, a handful of institutions responded. Due to the limited response, the UGC again sent a circular in 2016, but it found few takers.The proposal was mooted by the Directorate General of NCC in New Delhi. The DG, NCC conducted a survey before suggesting effective implementation of the proposal to increase its scope. After the survey and consultation process with universities, the DG suggested encouraging educational institutes to take ownership of NCC training, permitting private universities and colleges to offer NCC and a paradigm shift in its positioning from extra-curricular to mainstream activity.The NCC syllabus for B and C certificates is designed as per the CBCS of NEP 2020 which grants twenty four credit points covering six semesters out of which a student can accrue four credits in the first two semesters and ten credits in the third and fourth semester and similarly ten credits in the fifth and sixth semester. In the first phase of implementation, NCC as an elective course/subject will be offered only in those colleges which already have NCC senior platoon or company, and to only those students who enroll as NCC cadets.NCC, the world’s largest voluntary uniformed youth organisation, was raised by Parliamentary Act No XXXI in 1948 with 20,000 cadets. It has grown in stature and size over the years and currently has a sanctioned strength of 15 lakh cadets who undergo basic military like training for two years in the junior wing and three years in the senior divisions.On August 15, 2020, Prime Minster Narendra Modi announced expansion of NCC to border and coastal areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/91-universities-adopt-extra-curricular-ncc-as-elective-course-101622966490033.html

He was rushed to the Udala sub-divisional hospital, where he was declared brought dead by doctor,” said officer-in-charge of Kaptipada police station, Sanjay Pradhan. The three accused were later arrested and charged with murder.The police officer said the three accused were well-built and quickly overpowered Pradhan and rained blows on him. “The constant thrashing led to internal bleeding in his head, chest and other internal organs as per the post-mortem report,” the police officer said.Pradhan’s father-in-law Prafulla Patra said the incident took place some metres away from his house. “Three youths on two motorcycles asked him to give way to cross. Though he (Ranjit) gave them space to pass through, they hurled abuses at him. Later, they dragged him out of his car and attacked him,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-bjp-leader-thrashed-to-death-in-a-road-rage-case-101622965589474.html

The entire project comprises a mosque, hospital, museum, research centre and community kitchen for the poor and will be dedicated to Faizabadi, who died in the 1857 revolt, the organisation said.Faizabadi was also known as the 'lighthouse of Independence' for keeping Awadh free of British dominance for over two years after the revolt laid the foundation for future fights for independence.IICF said that they dedicated the entire project to Faizabadi as "even 160 years after the first war of Independence, he is yet to get his due in the annals of Indian history".During the 1857 mutiny, Faizabadi fought along with royalties like Nana Sahib and Khan Bahadur Khan. A year after the mutiny, he was killed by the king of Powayan Raja Jagannath Singh.In a book, 'History of Indian Mutiny' , British officers George Bruce Malleson and Thomas Seaton repeatedly made mention of Faizabadi and spoke about his bravery and valour.The Ayodhya mosque and the hospital project is being built on the five-acre land given to the Muslims after the 2019 Supreme Court verdict in the Ayodhya Babri Masjid dispute case. The IICF trust constituted by Sunni Waqf Board had taken a decision not to name the mosque after Mughal emperor Babur.Earlier this year, the trust submitted the building plan of the mosque to the Ayodhya Development Authority for approval.

India has made it clear that disengagement and de-escalation between two armies in East Ladakh is a prerequisite for normalisation of bilateral relations, which were hit by PLA aggression in Pangong Tso and Gogra-Hot Springs area in May 2020. While there has been disengagement from Pangong Tso area from both north and south banks of the saltwater lake, the PLA has been dragging feet over disengagement in river Chang Chemmo-KongKa La area which lies between Galwan and Pangong Tso.“While the dates for the WMCC and 12th round are being awaited, the PLA is communicating that LAC disengagement in Pangong Tso has been completed as per objective of the leadership of two countries. They want the Gogra-Hot Springs disengagement to be resolved at a level of local commanders and not convene a special meeting,” said an official in know of the matter. This clearly indicates that the Chinese want to drag the disengagement around Kongka La into tedious conversations of local commanders rather than look at the big picture of bilateral relationship.Tagged on to the issue of PLA restoring status quo ante of April 2020 in Gogra-Hot Springs area is also about Indian Army’s patrolling rights in Depsang Bulge area, south of Daulet Beg Oldi, near Karakoram Pass. However, this issue will be taken up separately at the Brigadier level talks.Even though Chinese President Xi Jinping wants his Chinese Communist Party (CCP) colleagues to portray a picture of “open and confident, but also modest and humble” China, the PLA is in no mood to compromise on its strategic objectives vis-à-vis India on the LAC issue. Despite the Pangong Tso disengagement, both the armies are deployed in a division strength along the 1597 km LAC in East Ladakh with fighters and heavy armour ready in the hinterland. Deception continues to be a legitimate tool in Chinese strategic armoury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-wants-gogra-disengagement-sorted-at-local-level-not-through-military-talks-101622964014050.html

Though the meeting came amid speculation around cabinet reshuffle in Yogi Adityanath government, Singh described it as "courtesy call"."I think the chief minister will take a call on the issue," he added.Before visiting the Raj Bhavan, Singh met the state BJP chief Swatantra Dev and Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh, once again triggering buzz over discussion on strategy ahead of the assembly elections next year. Singh and the BJP's national general secretary (organization) BL Santhosh had met state leaders for three days last month after which both the leaders backed Adityanath, describing him as the most hardworking and efficient chief minister.Speaking about his meeting with the governor, Singh told reporters, "I have known the UP governor since long and had not met her as something or other kept delaying my meeting. Finally, today I was able to meet her as courtesy demanded so especially since she is the governor of the same state of which I am the in-charge."When asked if discussions were held around cabinet reshuffle, as is being widely speculated, Singh said there are some fertile minds "who keep doing their own farming". He once again backed the chief minister, saying his government is very popular.Radha Mohan is now scheduled to meet UP assembly speaker Hriday Narain Dikshit.Meanwhile, Swatantra Dev said that seven vacancies in Yogi Adityanath government will be filled.This is another round of meetings that Singh is holding with the state leadership in the wake of the assembly elections. In May, he along with Santhosh held feedback sessions with state leaders to review the functioning of the government aming opposition allegations of mishandling of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.The party has decided to prepare a strategy for the elections based on feedback received from leaders in Uttar Pradesh and ministers in the Yogi Adityanath government.In the last meeting too, both the leaders had given thumbs up to the chief minister, saying his handling of the Covid-19 situation is "unparalleled".The Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections are scheduled to take place in 2022. BJP had stormed back to power in the state in the 2017 Assembly polls. In the 403 member Uttar Pradesh Assembly, among the major parties, BJP has 309 legislators, SP 49, BSP 18, and Congress 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-radha-mohan-singh-meets-governor-amid-cabinet-expansion-speculation-101622963197166.html

Among other things, the release talked about the funds for the project and the environmental issues surrounding it.The Opposition criticised the Union government for spending ₹20,000 crore on the project during the Covid-19 crisis, to which the ministry said that the redevelopment plan was planned in 2019, which was before the pandemic struck. Moreover, ₹20,000 crore is a rough estimate of all the planned development or redevelopment works, the ministry added."Till date, only 2 projects of New Parliament Building with tendered cost ₹862 crore and Redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue with tendered cost ₹477 crore have been awarded and works are underway.

Speaking to news agency ANI, Tikait said that the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) legislator Devendra S Babli has withdrawn his case against the arrested farmers, then "why they are not releasing them.""We have asked them (police) to either release those arrested or arrest us too," ANI quoted Tikait as saying. "Today we will talk again (with police). We will hold this dharna till our fellow farmers are released. Our demand is that if the police cannot release our comrades, then arrest us too," Tikait also said.Ravi Azad and Vikas Sisar were arrested on June 1 following their demonstration against the JJP leader Devendra S Babli. During the protest, the farmers gheraoed Babli and shouted slogans against him and showed him black flags. Later, the member of the legislative assembly (MLA) filed a first information report (FIR) alleging that some of the protesters resorted to unruly behaviour and vandalised his car.Following this, farmers also demanded an FIR against Babli for allegedly using abusive language against the farmers and threatening them during the spat.On Saturday, the JJP leader released a video and apologised for his comments. “I forgive those involved in the June 1 incident and apologise for my comments at the time,” he said. Babli also said that he would withdraw the cases filed against Azad and Sisar.Till late on Saturday, discussions between farmer leaders and police officers were ongoing when all the farmers' leaders camped outside the Tohana Sadar police station. Following this, additional security has to be deployed as a controlling measure.Meanwhile, farmers from Punjab started gathering at Shambhu border and will move for Singhu border in their vehicles as the protests against three agricultural laws continue for over six months now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-demand-release-of-arrested-fellow-protesters-camp-outside-police-station-in-haryana-101622960407119.html

Maharashtra is close to the mark||Maharashtra, the state worst-affected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic in India, is close to crossing a grim milestone. The number of fatalities related to the disease are very close to the 1 lakh-mark in the state. Only seven countries, including India, have more than a lakh casualties.Though the daily number of Covid-19 cases have come down in Maharashtra and across India, it still has the highest caseload and deaths in the country. The country closest to Maharashtra's fatality count is France, where the coronavirus disease has killed 1.09 lakh people, according to Worldometers.Also Watch: Maharashtra's 5-step unlock planThe other countries in the list are Russia (123,436 deaths), Italy (126,472 deaths), the UK (127,836 deaths), India (346,784 fatalities), Brazil (472,629 fatalities) and the worst-hit United States (612,203 deaths).The Maharashtra government has announced five-phased unlock plan for the state. On Monday, the third level of the plan will come into force in which restaurants, shops selling non-essential items and public places are set to reopen.As per the state government's notification, municipal corporations and districts in Maharashtra with a positivity rate between 5 per cent and 10 per cent and occupancy of oxygen beds over 40 per cent are categorised under level 3. However, the local trains will remain available only for specific categories as per the state government order.The lockdown-like restrictions in Maharashtra were imposed in April this year when the second wave of the pandemic intensified.Maharashtra recorded 13,659 new Covid-19 cases, 300 deaths and 21,776 discharges on Saturday, according to the state's public health department bulletin. The cumulative caseload of the state mounted to 58,19,224 while the recoveries touched 55,28,834. A total of 99,512 persons have succumbed to Covid-19.The recovery rate in the state reached 95.01 per cent while the case fatality rate dropped to 1.71 per cent.India on Sunday reported 1,14,460 new fresh Covid-19 cases, the lowest in 60 days, according to the Union health ministry data.

06-06-2021||India||Centre busts myths around Central Vista, says 'claims mischievously exaggerated'||The Centre on Saturday released a document to bust the myths around the Central Vista project, which has been used by the opposition Congress party to attack the government.In a release, the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs talked about the funds for the project, environmental issues surrounding it and other things. Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri had recently attacked the Congress, terming the opposition’s objections “bizarre.”On opposition's charge that ₹20,000 crore is being spent on the project this year during the Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry said that the redevelopment plan was envisaged in 2019, many months before the outbreak of the pandemic, and it is a generational infrastructure investment project, involving multiple projects spread over six years. It also said that ₹20,000 crore is gross rough estimate of all the planned development/redevelopment works."Till date, only 2 projects of New Parliament Building with tendered cost ₹862 crore and Redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue with tendered cost ₹477 crore have been awarded and works are underway. Expenditure incurred on these 2 projects till March 2021 is ₹195 crore and budget provision for 2021-22 is ₹790 crore," the ministry said.It also rubbished the reports that ₹13,450 crore is being incurred on new house for Prime Minister. The estimate includes multiple projects, including 10 buildings, the ministry said, adding that the construction work for the Prime Minister's residence has not yet been tendered and no sanction has been accorded by the government. "The cost for the PM’s residential complex has been mischievously exaggerated in media," the ministry said.Further, the ministry rejected the charge of diverting funds from public healthcare and Covid-19 response to the Central Vista Project. The ministry said that in Union Budget 2020-21, there was a 137% increase from previous year’s budget estimate in allocation for public healthcare and well-being expenditure. " ₹35,000 crore of the annual allocation has been allocated as a one-time grant towards Covid-19 vaccination, significantly more than the cost of the Central Vista redevelopment project. Thus, the one-time amount for vaccination for FY 2021-22 is 175% more than the total budget for the Central Vista project, which is expected to be completed by 2026," the ministry said.Justifying the ongoing work at the project site, the central ministry said that stopping the work at this stage will entail creating liabilities for the government under the existing contracts and the workers’ interest. It also cited inflation as a key issue if the project is delayed.The Delhi high court on May 31 dismissed a plea against the ongoing construction activities of the Central Vista Redevelopment project and terming the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) as "illegal motive" to halt the construction work.Talking about the need for a new Parliament house, the housing ministry said that the present Parliament House, completed in 1927, was never designed to accommodate a bicameral legislature for a full-fledged democracy and it already highly stressed. "If the strength of the Parliament is increased after the freeze on its expansion lifts in 2026, it will be necessary to ensure that Parliament House has the facilities for a larger Parliament to function," the ministry's release said.The government further said that environmental sustainability is at the core of the Central Vista project, debunking the myth that it is contributing to environmental damage. "The projects will result in overall increase in green cover. Trees will be transplanted in Eco-Park being developed by NTPC at Badarpur after due permissions from competent authorities. Steps are being taken to minimise on-site air emissions, noise, wastewater discharge, soil erosion as well as construction waste," the ministry said.The ministry also promised that none of the heritage buildings - India Gate, Parliament, North & South Blocks, National Archives or any other - will be demolished. "While these heritage buildings retain their architectural majesty, they are under severe stress and in need of comprehensive upgradation. Therefore, the heritage buildings that fall under the scope of the Central Vista development/redevelopment project will be appropriately retrofitted, as per Heritage Conservation standards, and refurbished for their future use," it added, rejecting yet another charge.Rejecting the allegation that procedures were circumvented during the approval process of the Central Vista project, the ministry of housing said gave a detailed account of the key steps undertaken. It also said that all the processes have been followed in getting statutory approvals for the project. The ministry further said that the Central Vista project will create additional public and green spaces.The charges of lack of public disclosure, the project being a drain on resources and government continuing it during second wave of Covid-19 pandemic by invoking Essential Services Act were also rejected by the ministry.The redevelopment project of the Central Vista - being handled by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs - envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common Central Secretariat and the revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath from the Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-busts-myths-around-central-vista-says-claims-mischievously-exaggerated-101622955003309.html

06-06-2021||India||'Shivrajyabhisek' 2021: What it is, the significance and history||The Maharashtrian community in India is celebrating 'Shivrajyabhisek' on Sunday, a day when Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was crowned as king of Maratha Swaraj in 1974. The event proved to be the watershed moment in Maratha history as it also marked the beginning of Hindavi Swarajya in India.It is also significant to know that on this day, Shivaji was given the title of 'Shakakarta' which means 'founder of an era' in English and 'Chhatrapati' (paramount sovereign). He also took the title of Haindava Dharmodhhaarak (protector of the Hindu faith) during his coronation ceremony in Raigad, a district currently in the Konkan division.The day is celebrated widely in Maharashtra, especially in Raigad where locals organise a coronation ceremony for Shivaji at Raigad Fort. Many devotees of Shivaji from outside the district also come to Raigad to witness the grand celebrations. They wish each other a happy coronation day, and offer wreaths to the statue of Shivaji.However, as the state is battling the Covid-19 pandemic this year, celebrations are expected to be curtailed due to the social distancing norms.Sambhaji Chhatrapati, the 13th direct descendant of Shivaji and a Member of Parliament, on Saturday released a very rare photo of Shivaji-era coin 'Hoan' on social media commemorating to the day. "This year's Shivrajyabhishek Ceremony will be graced by the presence of a rare coin ‘Hoan’, that is part of the antiques of Shivaji Maharaj’s era," he wrote in a Facebook post."‘Hoan’ itself exemplified the sovereignty and prosperity of Swarajya established by Shivaji Maharaj. It is not merely a currency, but a symbol of our collective pride, a true national treasure. This antiquity found in the pious soil of Raigad will witness this historic occasion," he also said.Over the course of his life, Shivaji made history with some of the most significant battles of the Maratha empire. He is mostly known for expanding the Maratha empire and establishing a progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He is also revered as the hero of Hindus as he revived ancient Hindu political traditions and court conventions during his rule as King.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivrajyabhisek-2021-what-it-is-the-significance-and-history-101622947510785.html
06-06-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee activating TMC’s next generation with eye on future: Veterans||Activating a younger and versatile leadership and eradicating centralism in the ranks of the 23-year-old Trinamool Congress (TMC) party was Mamata Banerjee’s intention behind the reshuffles and an array of do’s and don’ts she announced on Saturday, party veterans and experts have said. They also feel that the Bengal chief minister wants to play a larger role in national politics prior to the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.Asking her leaders to get their act together, Banerjee announced that after one month nobody will hold more than one post and said nepotism and corruption would no longer be tolerated, a move that seemed to address the allegations of corruption raised by the opposition in recent years. She even imposed a ban on use of beacons in cars used by ministers.The reshuffles she announced stunned many.Most of the young leaders, as well as older ones, Banerjee put in charge of important wings of her party are educated, have good oratory skills and last but not the least, speak Bengali, English and Hindi. The last attribute, experts and TMC veterans feel, is found lacking in most frontline leaders of other parties in Bengal.TMC leaders said election strategist Prashant Kishor, who was roped in by the chief minister’s 33-year-old nephew and Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee after the party’s debacle in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, advised the party to groom and project young and educated people. This was one of the reasons for the alienation of many old leaders who joined the BJP.“Our party has plans to extend its activities to some other states. What this will lead to remains to be seen,” TMC’s senior Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy told HT on Saturday night.It was a significant statement in view of the assembly polls to be held next year in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat and Congress-ruled Punjab and also the 2024 general elections. Roy, however, refused to divulge more.For the record, TMC attempted to project Banerjee as the next prime minister prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls but the alliance she tried to forge with regional forces was no match for the BJP.Explaining the rationale behind the one-man-one-post policy, Roy said, “Many parties follow this. It has been done so that one can devote full time to whatever he is doing.”The chief minister made her nephew the TMC’s national general secretary, a move some senior leaders in the TMC had anticipated. The post was earlier held by Subrata Bakshi, one of the chief minister’s oldest aides.Though it became somehow apparent after the TMC’s resounding victory in the assembly polls that Abhishek Banerjee might be rewarded, many feel that placing him next to his aunt in the hierarchy is part of a strategic move.The chief minister and Abhishek Banerjee became the prime targets in the campaign speeches of all BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and union home minister Amit Shah. They were referred to as pishi (aunt) and bhaipo (nephew) in almost all speeches and the chief minister was accused of establishing dynastic rule.“Abhishek worked for the party with dedication. He scored full marks. He deserves the new position,” said panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee who was senior to Mamata Banerjee in the Congress and later joined the TMC.“Abhishek drastically transformed himself in the last two years. He lost weight, honed his oratory skills and took the lead in campaigns and party programmes. Probably he was advised by Kishor but one cannot deny that he has earned his place,” said columnist and political analyst Suvashis Maitra.“Although I am surprised that no Muslim leader has been promoted despite the community’s contribution to the TMC’s electoral success, the organizational changes are significant. By projecting the next line of leadership, Banerjee has tried to counter the public perception that TMC is run by one person only. Also, she is looking at the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. She may emerge as a key player in either the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) headed by Congress or a new alliance of regional forces against the BJP,” Maitra added.What people did not foresee was that the important post of president of the TMC’s youth wing, which Abhishek Banerjee vacated on Saturday, would be given to 28-year-old actress Saayoni Ghosh, who joined politics on the eve of the recent state polls, which she contested and lost. Known for her oratory skills, Ghosh became the TMC youth front’s first woman president ever since the party was formed by Banerjee in 1998 after she left the Congress where she, too, was president of the youth front.“I am grateful to the chief minister and to Abhishek Banerjee. This is a huge responsibility. I will not let them down,” said Ghosh who was trolled by the BJP supporters during the polls for an old social media post relating to a Hindu deity.“Ghosh’s appointment should enthuse not only the youth but women as well. She is very articulate and popular. There is a difference between grooming someone who is already into politics and introducing someone who comes from a different world. Ghosh, however, will need constant guidance as many old-timers will try to pull her down,” said political science professor and election analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay.Former Communist Party of India (Marxist) Rajya Sabha member Ritabrata Banerjee, 41, who was expelled by the party on disciplinary grounds in 2017 and joined the TMC in 2018, was made the state president of the TMC’s trade union wing. In the CPI(M), Banerjee, who was known to be close to former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, was also the national general secretary of the Student’s Federation of India. In the TMC, he played a key role in strengthening the organization in some north Bengal districts where the BJP made deep inroads in 2019.Another newcomer to politics, popular Bengali film director Raj Chakraborty, 46, was made the head of the TMC’s cultural front. He won the Barrackpore assembly seat in North 24 Parganas district in the recent polls although the BJP did well in the district in the last general election.Projecting young leaders has been a salient part of the TMC’s internal strategy since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which BJP bagged 18 of the state’s 42 seats and TMC’s tally went down from 34 to 22. The chief minister said on several occasions that she was putting in place the next generation of leaders. In the assembly polls, younger candidates were fielded from at least 100 of the 292 seats the TMC contested. Bengal has 294 assembly seats but the TMC left out two for its allies in the Darjeeling hills. The BJP bagged only 77 seats against its target to wrest more than 200.The chief minister, however, did not leave out all the seniors on Saturday.Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, 61, a doctor and three-time Lok Sabha member, was made president of the women’s front and Rajya Sabha member Dola Sen, 54, who was once a far-Left student union leader, was made national head of the trade union front. During the recent farmers’ movement in Punjab and Delhi, Sen welcomed peasant leader Rakesh Tikait when he visited Bengal.A third veteran leader, Purnendu Bose, 68, who served as minister of labour, agriculture and technical education between 2011 and 2021, has been given charge of the peasants’ front. Bose was not fielded in the recent polls but Banerjee said he would play a new role.During the polls, BJP alleged that Abhishek Banerjee is involved in the coal smuggling case that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing. It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth hundreds of crores of rupees, have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs mines.The CBI questioned Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Banerjee and her sister Maneka Gambhir. The latter’s husband, Ankush Arora, and his father Pawan Arora were also grilled. The TMC leaders alleged that the BJP is using the agency to keep the chief minister under pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-activating-tmc-s-next-generation-with-an-eye-on-future-say-veterans-101622947408925.html
06-06-2021||India||Flag row: Patel says Kejriwal corrected mistake, but never accepted he made one||Union minister Prahlad Singh Patel on Saturday said that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal may have corrected the violation of the flag code but did not accept that he committed a mistake in the first place.“If a person commits an error by mistake, he accepts his mistake and then rectifies it. If Arvind Kejriwal ji had admitted his mistake and apologised, he would have shown his large heartedness. But his silence gives rise to doubts. You have not accepted your mistake but at least corrected it. Thank you,” Patel said in a tweet where he tagged the Prime Minister’s Office and BJP president JP Nadda.Patel on May 28 had accused Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of using the national flag as a ‘decorative’ item during his press conferences. He said the colours and how it was divided into three proportions was not in tune with provisions of the Indian Flag Code specified by the home ministry.“It appears that the national flag has been used for decoration. The white portion in the centre appears to have been reduced and the green portion added to it, which is not in tune with provisions of the Indian Flag Code specified by the Ministry of Home Affairs,” Prahlad Patel had claimed.“Being a resident of India and holding the post of the proud chief minister of a state, everyone expects you to maintain the honour and the dignity of the Tricolour, a symbol of national pride,” he further added. The letter was also sent to Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal.Patel pointed out that such use of the national flags were disrespectful and asked the Delhi CM to look into section 2(ix) of The Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 (which says that a flag cannot be used as decorative item on the stage of a speaker) and section 2.2(1) which states that the status of the flag should not be disrespectful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flag-row-patel-says-kejriwal-corrected-mistake-but-never-accepted-he-made-one-101622940484886.html

06-06-2021||India||Ethanol-petrol-blending 20% target date advanced to 2025: All you need to know||As India looks to cut carbon emissions and reduce oil imports, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday announced that the deadline for achieving 20% ethanol-blending with petrol was pushed to 2025 in the country. The government set a target of reaching 10% ethanol-blending in petrol by 2022 last year, and aimed to mix 20% of ethanol mixed with 90 per cent of diesel by 2030. Earlier this year, the latter target was brought forward to 2025. Currently, about 8.5% ethanol is mixed with petrol as against 1-1.5 per cent in 2014, PM Modi said, adding that higher ethanol blending over the years has led to ethanol procurement jumping from 38 crore litres to 320 crore litres. "It will go up further when 20% blending is achieved," he added while speaking on the occasion of World Environment Day on June 5.Also Read | India brings forward target of 20% ethanol blending in petrol: The impactEthanol is a bio-fuel obtained primarily from sugarcane, damaged food grains such as wheat and broken rice. It has a higher octane number than gasoline and hence, it improves the petrol octane number. Mixing it with petrol eases the pressure on India, which is the world's third-biggest oil importer, and also helps farmers as it provides them with an alternate source of income. It is also environment-friendly as agriculture waste is less polluting.However, petroleum dealers have to adhere to quality checks. If the mix of ethanol and petrol is as stipulated, it does not do any harm and does not separate from the petrol in tanks.Also Read: On World Environment Day, PM Modi says India is emerging as leader of climate justiceMeanwhile, India has been giving soft loans (loans made on terms favourable to the borrower) to sugar mills to increase ethanol production capacity by adding distillation infrastructure to the existing plants. To facilitate a smooth transition process further, the government earlier this week changed rules for companies to set up standalone ethanol production units."Ethanol manufacturing units were previously limited to only 4-5 sugarcane producing states but now food grain-based distilleries are being established to expand this to the whole country," PM Modi said, adding that India is a strong proponent of climate justice and is moving ahead with ideas like the founding of the International Solar Alliance for realising the vision of One Sun, One World, One Grid and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ethanolpetrolblending-20-target-date-advanced-to-2025-all-you-need-to-know-101622939404107.html
06-06-2021||India||Ethanol blend deadline advanced to 2025: Modi||India will advance by five years to 2025, its deadline for blending 20% ethanol in petrol (E20) , Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated on Saturday on the occasion of World Environment Day, even as he listed other measures such as the promotion of renewable energy the country has taken to fight the climate crisis. He also launched a pilot project in Pune for the production and distribution of ethanol across India.The promotion of E20 fuel is part of the country’s plans to cut its oil imports and reduce pollution (emissions). It is also a move that will benefit sugarcane growers. Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said in January that India would bring the deadline forward to 2025.Modi said India is a strong proponent of climate justice and is moving ahead with efforts such as the founding of the International Solar Alliance for realising the vision of One Sun, One World, One Grid, and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure . He added that India has been included in the world’s top 10 countries in the Climate Change Performance Index.Modi said the country has taken both hard and soft approaches to fighting the climate crisis. On the hard approach, he noted India’s capacity for renewable energy has increased by more than 250% in the last six to seven years. “India is today among the top five countries of the world in terms of installed renewable energy capacity. Especially the capacity of solar energy has increased by about 15 times in the last six years.”He referred to the soft approach and listed India’s drive to phase out single-use plastics, clean beaches and its Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission), which he launched to improve sanitation facilities in 2014.India plans to get rid of single-use plastics by 2022. It is estimated to be using about 14 million tonnes of plastic annually.Modi said until 2014, when he came to power, on average, only 1.5% of ethanol could be blended in India, which has now reached about 8.5%. The government aims to achieve 10% blending by 2022. In 2013-14, about 380 million litres of ethanol were purchased in the country. This has now grown to more than 3.2 billion litres.Modi said there has been an eightfold increase in ethanol procurement, which has benefitted the country’s sugarcane farmers. He added that most of the ethanol manufacturing units are concentrated in four to five states, where sugarcane cultivation is high but that food grain-based distilleries are now being established to expand the network to the whole country.The bulk of the additional ethanol production is expected to come from the processing of sugar cane. The switch to E20 fuel requires changes in the engine specifications of vehicles.The ethanol-blending programme is one of the seven key drivers identified by PM Modi for the country’s energy map -- gas-based economy; cleaner use of fossil fuels; greater reliance on biofuels; achieving renewables’ target of 450 GW by 2030; increasing contribution of electricity to decarbonise mobility; moving into emerging fuels such as hydrogen; and digital innovation across all energy systems.The drive is also important as India imports more than 80% of crude oil it processes and pays in dollars. India is the third largest oil consumer in the world after the US and China and its crude oil import bill was over $100 billion in 2018-19 and 2019-20. The import bill, however, fell to $62.7 billion in 2020-21, because the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic and consequent 68-day lockdown (since March 25, 2020) that devastated its economy, leading to a contraction in consumption of petroleum products. India consumed 194.63 million tonnes of petroleum products in FY-21 as compared with 214.12 million tonnes the previous year.In January, the Union government notified a modified scheme to incentivise ethanol production in the country, which allows sugar mills cheaper loans to make new investments in ethanol-blending factories.At the time, the government had said upcoming ethanol projects would be viable because oil-marketing companies would be assured buyers of ethanol for next 10 years under the scheme.To increase the production of fuel-grade ethanol, the government is planning to encourage distilleries to produce ethanol from maize and rice stocks available in state-held granaries run by the Food Corporation of India, an official said. Under the scheme, millers can divert excess sugar stocks for ethanol production.“Aside from achieving blending targets of ethanol with petrol and reduce import dependency on crude oil, a pick-up in blending will lead to higher incomes for millers. This can help clear arrears to cane farmers, which currently stands at about ₹15,000 crore,” said Anil Rana, a sugar industry consultant“The increased target for ethanol blending incentivises the use of water-intensive crops such as sugarcane and rice. A tiered incentive mechanism with preference for crops with lower water-intensity, such as millets, would help to address the increased demand for ethanol while limiting the impact on agricultural for production. Further, India produces over 275 million tonnes of municipal solid waste per year, which could be considered for ethanol production with co-benefits for air quality.” Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ethanol-blend-deadline-advanced-to-2025-modi-101622937441969.html
06-06-2021||India||Operation Bluestar's 37th anniversary today, tight security in Amritsar||Many Sikh organisations have planned programmes to celebrate 37th anniversary of Operation Bluestar on Sunday. the military operation was conducted by the army in 1984 to flush out militants hiding in the Golden Temple complex, on June 6.The Punjab government has tightened the security across the state, especially Amritsar, where Golden Temple is situated. The Amritsar commissionerate police have said they will deploy more than 6,000 cops to keep a vigil across the city.A flag march was conducted by the police from Hall Gate to Heritage Street that leads to the Golden Temple on Thursday.The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the apex Sikh religious body, said last week that it will display the bullet-ridden holy saroop of the Guru Granth sahib on Operation Bluestar's anniversary this year.The saroop, which was installed in the sanctum sanctorum at that time, was hit by a bullet during the army action in 1984.The decision was taken following a special meeting of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) executive committee.Addressing a press conference, SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said the Sikh community can never forget the events of 1984.Operation Bluestar was a military action ordered by then PM Indira Gandhi to flush out Sikh militants holed up in Harmandir Sahib Complex (Golden Temple) in Amritsar. The operation that was carried out between June 1 and June 8, 1984 claimed several lives and left the shrine damaged.Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards after Operation Bluestar, triggering a further wave of retaliation in which nearly 3,000 Sikhs were killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/operation-bluestar-s-37th-anniversary-today-tight-security-in-amritsar-101622936709706.html
06-06-2021||India||Twitter given ‘last notice’ to follow IT rules||Twitter will have to face “unintended consequences” including losing the legal protection from criminal liability that it currently enjoys if it does not comply with the new rules for digital content, according to a “last notice” issued as a “gesture of goodwill” by the central government to the social media firm.The warning from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) escalates an already worsening standoff between the government and the social media company, which has previously urged the Centre to give it more time to comply with the new IT rules and raised concerns over the “core elements” of the IT norms.Twitter’s “lack of commitment towards providing a safe experience to the people of India” and the refusal to comply with the new norms that came into effect on May 25 will lead to “unintended consequences” that include “losing exemption from liability” as a social media intermediary under Section 79 of the IT Act, 2000, MeitY said in the letter.The notice did not specify a deadline for compliance, but said it should be done “immediately”.It was issued on a day that another controversy erupted over the removal of verified badges, better known as the “blue ticks”, of vice-president Venkaiah Naidu and several Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders. Twitter said the verified status for Naidu was removed as the account was lying dormant for months, and that it was restored soon after. Badges for RSS leaders were also restored.Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, grants social media companies protection from criminal action for third-party content posted on the websites.The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, were notified in February and enforced fully on May 25. These guidelines require digital companies such as Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook to regulate content, appoint nodal officers for compliance and grievance redressal, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.Under criticism over the past few months, the government has maintained that the new IT rules make companies more accountable for the online content posted on their websites and protects users from abuse. The companies, several experts and opposition parties believe that the norms may have a bearing on the right to free speech and privacy.The people of India “deserve and demand” a fair mechanism to address their grievances and resolve their disputes, the ministry said, adding: “Leave alone proactively creating such a mechanism, Twitter Inc is in the inglorious bracket of refusing to do so even when mandated by law.”Twitter India declined to respond to requests for a comment on Saturday.MeitY also said on Saturday it wrote to Twitter on May 26 and May 28 for an update on compliance, but it was “dismayed” that the company’s responses “neither address the clarifications sought by this ministry nor indicate full compliance with the Rules”.Among other things, the company was yet to inform the ministry about its chief compliance officer, and its grievance officer and nodal contact person were not Twitter India employees as required by the rules, MeitY said. “The office address of Twitter Inc. as mentioned by you is of a law firm in India, which is also not as per the rules,” the notice addressed to Twitter’s deputy general counsel Jim Baker pointed out.Non-compliance will lead to “consequences” but as a “gesture of goodwill, Twitter Inc is hereby given one last notice”, the ministry added. According to government officials, Facebook, Whatsapp and Google have shared details of the officers appointed by them, but Twitter is yet to do so. Last week, Twitter urged the government to give it three months to comply with the new rules.The Delhi high court, which was hearing a plea, too asked Twitter on May 31 to follow the guidelines.The US-based company, which has over 17 million users in India, has had multiple run-ins with the Union government since February this year, when it did not fall in line on the Centre’s request to take down content against newly enacted agriculture laws and farm protests.Last month, Twitter also said in a statement it was worried about the safety of its staff in the country after a Delhi Police team visited its company offices for an investigation linked to the labelling of posts by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders against the Opposition Congress as “manipulated media”.The firm said it was concerned about “the potential threat to free speech” and the “core elements” of the new IT guidelines. The statement prompted a backlash from the Centre, which called the remarks an “attempt to dictate terms to the world’s largest democracy”.Shortly after the norms were enforced on May 25, Facebook-owned Whatsapp also challenged the rules in the Delhi high court and said that the mandate will force the messaging app to break end-to-end encryption. This mandatory requirement violates the fundamental right to free speech and is a “dangerous invasion of users privacy”, it argued in the suit||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-given-last-notice-to-follow-it-rules-101622929045953.html

Though its composite score improved from 58 to 61, it remained among the bottom five states along with Nagaland and Chhattisgarh. Performances of the states were assessed from 16 SDGs - zero poverty, no hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality and peace, justice and strong institutions.“The state of Odisha figures in the list of bottom five states of the SDG report of NITI Aayog. It is shameful and very unfortunate for us,” said Bhubaneswar MP and BJP leader Aparajita Sarangi. “I wonder that the state of Andhra Pradesh has 9.2 per cent people who are living under national below poverty line. Many families in Bhubaneswar parliamentary constituency are yet to get pucca houses under government scheme. At least 14.2% or 1 crore people are still living in kutcha houses in Odisha while in West Bengal the figure is only 6% and in Andhra Pradesh, it is 3.2%. “The central government has sanctioned lakhs of pucca houses to Odisha. Where are these?” she asked.The BJP leader said Odisha ranked sixth from the bottom in the list of 28 states in the category of Zero Hunger of the sustainable development goal. At least 29 per cent of children below 5 years are malnourished in the state, which was mentioned in the report, she said. Besides, 47.6 pc of pregnant women and 29.5 pc adolescents are anaemic.“The state’s rank in the Gender Equality is 11 from bottom. Criminal cases against 103.5 % women in the state have come to fore. As per the report, 103 women in 1 lakh are exploited in the state. The harassment cases against women continue to surge since 2015. The BJD government has failed to ensure safety and security of women,” she alleged.In the category of Economic Growth, Odisha ranked second from the bottom among 28 states. The state secured zero in ease of doing business despite undertaking various programmes like ‘make In Odisha’.Sarangi said in the ‘No Poverty’ category, Odisha’s population below poverty line (32.59 pc), households covered by health insurance (47.7 pc) and those living in kutcha houses (14.2 pc) showed no improvement. “Odisha is among the worst performers in the goal of providing decent work and economic growth. It also was adjudged a laggard in Decent Work and Economic Growth with only 11.92 bank branches and 15.72 ATMs per one lakh population.“Even employment provided against demand under MGNREGA saw a marginal drop,” she said.State Congress president Niranjan Patnaik said BJD may not face any immediate repercussions of their misgovernance, but the fact is the people of Odisha will continue to suffer. “Congratulations to the BJD govt. Odisha has now slumped to 21st position from 16th, in NITI Aayog’s SDG India Index,” he tweeted.The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.However, BJD leader and Rajya Sabha MP Amar Patnaik alleged that there could be some discrepancies during preparation of the SDG ranking. “SDG report is not a political report. It should not be used to play dirty politics, but use it for fostering more development. It is unfortunate that the BJP is doing politics even not going through the report thoroughly. The data provided by the state has not been taken into account in the SDG report,” said the BJD MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-parties-slam-naveen-patnaik-govt-over-odisha-s-poor-ranking-in-niti-aayog-report-101622920526075.html

Talking at the core committee meeting on Covid-19, the CM said about 50 lakh people would have to take the vaccine from this age group, and the state shall be getting 38 lakh doses in June-end. Everyone will be covered by the middle of July. “Efforts are on a war footing to contain the possible third wave in the state. We have started a detailed study on different mutations. We have to be more vigilant as there are reports that children may get infected during the third wave,” he said. All departments should work together to meet the threat of a possible third wave, he said. Meanwhile, the state reported 17,328 cases on Saturday when 205,000 samples got tested with a test positivity rate of 14.89 per cent.

06-06-2021||India||How a 1969 movie helped Kerala win rights over ‘KSRTC’ use||In a legal battle over the name, the Kerala government used an old Malayalam movie as one of the proofs. A long 7-year-old legal battle between Kerala and Karnataka over who gets to use the acronym KSRTC concluded, claimed the Kerala government. Kerala on Wednesday announced that the Trademarks Registry’s final verdict gave it the right to use the abbreviation KSRTC and Karnataka (which also calls its transport service KSRTC), which can no longer use it. While appreciating his officials, Kerala Transport Minister Antony Raju said that Kerala public transport system has left its mark on our cultural life, including in cinema and literature. “The history of KSRTC in Kerala is intertwined with the lives of the people. It’s not just a vehicle service. Glad the Trademark‌ Registry was able to figure it out and place an order. And congratulations to the officers who worked for this. said yesterday that this was an achievement for KSRTC,” he said. One of the reasons for him to use cinema in his message was that while making a case was to prove that the Transport Corporation existed in Kerala even before the Karnataka Road Transport Corporation, the state presented a 1969 movie ‘Kannur Deluxe’ starring Prem Nazir as evidence, said a Kerala transport department official. Kannur Deluxe, released in 1969 and starring Prem Nazir and Sheela, was mainly shot at the Ernakulam stand. Prem Nazir plays the role of the CID who came to investigate the murder on the KSRT bus. The film was shot on a Kannur deluxe bus from Kannur to Thiruvananthapuram as the story revolves around a bus. Even though Kerala claimed victory, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation Managing Director Shivayogi Kalasad, said that Kerala’s claims are factually incorrect, and Karnataka has not received any notice of the same. He added that since there is no notice, there is no legal prohibition as such against the use of the trademark ‘KSRTC’. “These reports are factually incorrect, as we have not received any such notice or order from the Central Trade Mark Registry as claimed until today. No final orders have also been passed in the said appeals,” he said in the statement. The legal battle began in 2013 when Karnataka raised a claim over the rights to use the acronym. Once Karnataka had got the certificate to use the KSRTC trademark from the Controller General of Patent and Trademark the same year, it issued a notice to Kerala, asking its government to stop using the acronym. Kerala challenged this decision in 2015, which resulted in the latest legal victory for Kerala. In Kerala, the erstwhile Travancore State Transport Department was re-established as Kerala State Road Transport Corporation on April 1, 1965. And in Karnataka, the Mysore Government Road Transport Department (MGRTD), started in 1948, became Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation in 1973. However, according to Karnataka, Kerala’s claim is invalid since it obtained victory through the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB, which has been abolished. “IPAB was abolished by an Ordinance of the Central Government dated 4.04.2021 and all such pending applications will be transferred to the High Court for adjudication,” the Karnataka SRTC department said in a statement. “So as on date, KSRTC’s registration of the marks continue to be legally in force and the claim of Kerala SRTC in news reports that Karnataka state cannot use the trademarks is factually incorrect and legally untenable. As such, there is no legal prohibition against the use of the trademark ‘KSRTC’ by Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation,” said Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, who holds charge of transportation. Further referring to the potential notice from its Kerala counterpart, he said. “If and when such a notice is issued, a suitable reply would be issued. We are currently consulting our lawyers to take effective legal steps to protect our rights.” He also added that the state will explore all legal options available before giving up on the matter. Meanwhile, two days after threatening to issue a notice to Karnataka RTC “asking them not to use KSRTC anymore”, Kerala SRTC Managing Director Biju Prabhakar said there were not many issues between the two RTCs over the trademark. He said he had already spoken to Kalasad over the trademark. “Some other issues like domain names would be settled amicably through talks,” said Prabhakar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-a-1969-movie-helped-kerala-win-rights-over-ksrtc-use-101622919925528.html

During the two recent cyclones — Tauktae and Yaas — coastal areas bore the maximum brunt in the state. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has recently written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to declare coastal erosion as a natural disaster in order to help provide compensation to those affected from the national and state disaster response funds. Speaking at a webinar organised by premier marine body Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) on Saturday as part of the World Environment Day, experts called for restoration of coastal vegetation giving more emphasis on mangrove forests which, they said, would act as a bio-shield protecting lives of residents. The webinar highlighted that the entire Kerala coast recently witnessed ‘storm surge’ during two cyclones. Experts said such storm surges are likely to occur in the coast increasingly in coming years with rapid warming of waters in the Indian Ocean. Alarming winds triggered by cyclones help form storm surge in waters that results in high waves, sea erosion and flooding in the coastal hamlet, experts said, adding this was evidently seen recently especially in coastal areas like Chellanam in Kochi. Kerala’s coastal region could be protected from the wrath to a great extent through restoration of mangroves and other biodiversity in the region, said CMFRI director Dr A Gopalakrishnan. “Conservation of coastal biodiversity, which is in deterioration owing to many reasons including constructions, is the best long-term natural option for protecting the lives of coastal people from sea turbulence,” he said, adding that mangroves act as a model bio-shield. The webinar, which was attended by leading experts who work on mangroves, recommended that restoration of coastal vegetation along the Kerala coast should be planned in a social forestry concept with public participation. Feasibility studies are required for identifying potential areas for mangrove forestation, experts said. Dr N Vasudevan, managing director of Forest Development Corporation, Maharashtra; PP Pramod, chief conservator, Forest Eastern Circle and Custodian, Vested Forest, Kerala; Dr R Ramasubramanian, director of Coastal Systems Research Programme at MS Swaminathan Research Foundation, Chennai; Dr P Kaladharan, principal scientist of CMFRI; Dr Grinson George, senior programme specialist at SAARC; Dr K Vinod, princiapal scientist of CMFRI and Dr Ratheesh Kumar R, scientist of CMFRI also spoke at the webinar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mangroves-best-remedy-to-check-growing-sea-erosion-in-kerala-experts-101622919866807.html
06-06-2021||India||Independent candidate alleges BJP paid ₹2.5 lakh to pull out of Kerala polls, party rejects charge||Thiruvananthapuram: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Kerala has landed in yet another controversy, with one of the independent candidates in Mancheswaram alleging that the party paid him ₹2.5 lakh and a smart phone for withdrawing his nomination from the 2021 assembly elections. K Sundara, an independent candidate from north Kerala, alleged this was done to favour BJP state president K Surendran, who was contesting from the seat. Speaking to reporters in Kasaragod on Saturday, Sundara said he was under tremendous pressure and sought ₹15 lakh from the BJP to withdraw his papers. He alleged that he was paid ₹2.5 lakh and received a smart phone, adding that he was also offered a wine parlour and a house in Karnataka once K Surendran emerged victorious. In Kerala, independent candidates bearing similarities with the main contender’s name are often promoted by opponents in a bid to confuse voters and dent the vote share. In 2016 assembly elections, Sundara got 467 votes while Surendran lost the seat by a slender margin of 89 votes. He said this time the BJP was cautious and many party leaders from Karnataka pressurised him to withdraw from the election. He added that after withdrawing his nomination, he campaigned openly for Surendran. However, the BJP state president lost the seat last month by a bigger margin of 745 votes to Muslim League’s AKM Ashraf in a triangular contest. “After the loss nobody contacted me. I did not get the promised amount,” said Sundara. While BJP Kasaragod district president K Sreekanth denied the allegations, Surendran was not available for his comments. “These are wild allegations. K Sundara withdrew his papers on his own,” said Sreekanth. Ashraf said he will take up the issue with the election commission. The latest allegation has surfaced at a time when the BJP is struggling with highway heist and subsequent police investigation. The highway incident unfolded on Thrisur-Ernakulam highway in Kodakara on April 3 when a man named S Shamseer, who was transporting cash, was waylaid by a group of people, who robbed the money after assaulting him. Four days later (on April 7), Shamseer filed a police complaint claiming ₹25 lakh, which was meant for a property transaction, was stolen from his vehicle. Police filed a case on April 7 following the compliant. There were many loose ends in the statement of Shamseer and police later found that seized money would run into crores (according to latest information it was about ₹3.5 crore). On sustained interrogation by the police, Shamseer reportedly took name of one Dharmajan, a local RSS leader, and alleging that the money collected from many sources was meant for election activities. After investigation, police have arrested 20 persons involved in the snatching incident, all history-sheeters. Police have recovered ₹1.25 crore so far. There are many criminal gangs that target hawala money and gold carriers, a police official said. There are allegations that the seized money came from Karnataka and was meant to influence voters. Many district leaders of the BJP were questioned in Thrissur and there is a strong speculation that K Surendran and party MP Suresh Gopi could be summoned by police. “The BJP had spent crores in Kerala, but people gave a befitting reply by closing its lone account in the state. It is time for the party to understand that Kerala is not a fertile land for it,” CPI(M) leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said, adding that more such incidents will surface soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/independent-candidate-alleges-bjp-paid-2-5-lakh-to-pull-out-of-kerala-polls-party-rejects-charge-101622919805373.html

On Saturday, a two-day meeting between BJP national president JP Nadda, general secretaries and office bearers began, where a report on the work undertaken by the party was shared. Heads of various morchas also shared a report with the party president, a party functionary said.According to people aware of the developments, Nadda and general secretary organisation BL Santhosh also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi later in the day to apprise him about the meeting.

06-06-2021||India||A year after being passed, farm laws continue to face protests||The three new agricultural laws to push reforms in the farm sector completed a year of being promulgated on Saturday, first as ordinances, but achieving little so far as millions of farmers continue to oppose them.The feisty protests by farmers, especially from food-bowl states, such as Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have brought cultivators and farm policies back to the centre stage, which could impact political outcomes too, analysts said.The country has not seen such mobilisation among peasants since 1988, when Mahendra Singh Tikait, a farm union leader from western Uttar Pradesh, stormed Delhi and laid siege to Boat Club, a landmark near the nation’s Parliament, forcing the government of the day to agree to make concessions.On June 5, 2020, the Union government promulgated three ordinances, which were signed into laws by Parliament in September: The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance, Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.The laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of commodities for future sales and set new rules for contract farming.The government has said the laws would bring competition and widen farmers’ market access. Besides, allowing firms to stock large quantities of food commodities will incentivise them to invest in supply and storage, which is scarce.Farmers say the laws will threaten their livelihoods by forcing them to sell to corporate giants with greater bargaining power at poor prices instead of government-run markets, which offer assured prices for cereals.Unregulated markets will ultimately lead to a collapse of crucial minimum support rices, farmers argue, although Prime Minister Narendra Modi has denied this will ever happen.“The crux of the matter is that the laws are centred around large corporations, which have great bargaining power and which are against the interests of farmers and consumers. Why can’t markets be farmer-led?” asks Kavitha Kuruganthi, one of the farmers’ appointed negotiators with the government.The government has so far held 11 rounds of talks, which hit a dead end on January 22. The Supreme Court has put the laws on hold since.Economists point to growth-fuelling reforms in industry, currency markets and manufacturing, but such measures have bypassed the farm sector.“It is easier to do a stock market reform or financial reform because its scope is limited to a certain elite section of the population. But when it comes to hard reforms affecting masses, such as labour or agricultural reforms, these are areas where we will see big challenges,” said KK Kailash, who teaches political science in the University of Hyderabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-year-after-being-passed-farm-laws-continue-to-face-protests-101622919325278.html

They have empowered ordinary Indians, but our approach is very straight forward; namely, you (companies) will have to follow the constitution and laws of India.Q There are concerns that these guidelines will lead to censorship of voices that are critical of the government and about maintaining end-to-end encryption.A These guidelines do not deal with the use of social media. We permit criticism against the government and the Prime Minister, but the issue is the abuse and misuse of social media platforms. What should I say when a woman complains that her morphed image is being circulated on social media? Or a mother complains that her daughter’s ex-boyfriend is pushing out all intimate pictures. Should they be asked to go to America to file a complaint? Nowadays judges are trolled and defamed; fake news has become an everyday occurrence.These guidelines basically enjoin three things. Number one, appoint an India-based grievance redressal officer whose address and phone number are known to us and those grievances must be addressed in 15 days time. You have to give a monthly report that grievances have been addressed. Secondly, have a compliance officer to deal with the rules and regulations and third, for nodal contact with the government there must be a person. Are we asking for the moon? There are more than hundred crore users of social media in India it did not happen suddenly there was demand from civil society there were two Supreme Court judgments in 2018 and the Facebook case of 2019 where the Supreme Court spoke about how some messages can incite violence or be a threat to the sovereignty of the country; pedophiles use it in a big way.In such circumstances it is imperative that there is a properly framed regime to find out the person and institutional bodies who are the originators of such content.Q …But there is a concern that traceability would compromise privacy.A Let me a sure all the users of WhatsApp; ordinary users have nothing to fear. They will do as they are doing now. What we are seeking now is information about only those messages whose contents are already in the public domain --which incite a riot, mob lynching, impinge on the sovereignty and security of the country, show a woman in bad light or show child sexual abuse-- and are being circulated and re-circulated. They have to disclose who began the mischief and if it has come from across the border, who lapped it up in India. Can we deny that last year during the riot in Delhi many explosive messages came from across the border?This will be done only and only when other less intrusive methods have not worked. There is a reasonable classification that it is for the public good for the safety and security of India, and dignity of women and against child sexual abuse.Q Has the government addressed the concern of not having a digital fingerprint on all messages?A The problem of technology is answered by technology. Cambridge analytical obtained data from Facebook of five lakh Indians. In their recent privacy policy, they say we shall share data on WhatsApp with other business associates including Facebook, so where is privacy.Let us disabuse ourselves of this notion of privacy. We appreciate the judgement of Supreme Court on privacy. But in the same judgment, the court observed that a terrorist or a corrupt or a criminal do not have the right of privacy otherwise there will be no investigation.Second, what a person eats is a personal choice, but if you go to a restaurant the bill will be digital. They know what you ate. Where you travel is a personal choice but if you go by a plane, tickets will be digital, they will know you travelled on a particular date.Privacy in my considered view is something that relates to individual identity--your matrimonial information, your sexual preferences, your medical records and your health records and the privacy right of a minor and maybe if you’re not a public servant then your income. These are the privacy rights, and they must be safe guarded.Q There is a perception that if the intermediary tag is removed, it may even mean more censorship. Also, going by the requests for take-downs, the government appears less accommodating of criticism.A It is absolutely false. First in these guidelines the government is out, you (companies) have to appoint a grievance officer. The victim of abuse will relate to the social media company not the government. If a woman’s dignity is being robbed, she will ask WhatsApp who started it and if you (companies) do not (help) then the security establishment will help her. The larger narrative however is when you blocked the Twitter accounts of many who invaded the Capitol Hill violence in Washington including that of a former president that’s your call. How is it that when at the Red Fort, in the wake of the farmers’ agitation, content related to terrorist supporters and sword wielding people was pushed out… this is double standard. You show a part of Ladakh as a part of China and we have to labour for a fortnight to get it removed, why? When Singapore protested why is it called the Singaporean variant they removed it immediately, but here in India we have to labour for a week to remove the tags India variant and Modi variant. Earn good money, do good business, but you will have to learn to respect the laws of India. India will not compromise its digital sovereignty.Individual complaints come and go…Q Vice president’s Twitter account lost the verification badge as did many RSS leaders. Has the government taken this up?A: I understand they have already restored it but I will not go into that issue except to make this observation-- Twitter is welcome to do business in India but learn to respect to the constitutional authority.Q The G7 finance ministers have made an agreement to commit to a global minimum tax of at least 15% corporation tax and measures to make tech giants pay their fair share on a country-by-country basis. What is India’s view on this?A: That is a larger issue, what is the outcome of that debate we will have to reflect on that. Our data protection laws also yet to be passed by parliament.Q Will an independent regulator such as the oversight board set up in the US by Facebook work in India?A: Many of these issues have been addressed in the data protection law. Here the larger regulator issue should not be confused with the rights of the users who are the victims of abuse. My question is very straight, if a person is being victimised on a fake or false narrative should that person go to America? Therefore, we have said have a robust machinery in India.Q If the safe harbour provision for the intermediary (that protects them from liability for the acts of third parties who use this infrastructure for their own purposes) is withdrawn what is the liable action that can be taken?A: I don’t want to make any value judgement… the guideline is clear if you don’t obey the guidelines then you lose safe harbour exemption under section 79 of the IT Act. If the intermediary fails to observe rules, they are liable for punishment under the prevailing law including the provisions of the Indian penal code.Q Twitter recently said it was concerned by recent events regarding its employees in the country and a potential threat to “freedom of expression” for citizens.A: India is too big a democracy governed by the Constitution (we have) our robust, independent institutions such as the Supreme Court, media et cetera and civilisational heritage of democracy and accommodation. Twitter, an America based private company earning profit should not lecture us on democracy or free speech. If they are so concerned, first establish your concern by giving a forum to your users in India against abuse. The police have already clarified that under the penal law it is a legal obligation of everyone individual or institution to help the police in an investigation. They had asked some of them to appear, they said go to America, they did not take the summons, so the police had gone to serve the summons that’s all. I wish to categorically say that be it Twitter or any social media employees need not have any fear.Q What is the status of the data protection bill?A: We are very keen to pursue the data protection law. The select committee headed by Meenakshi Lekhi has already submitted an interim report. In the next session of Parliament, Covid permitting, we will pursue it in right earnest. I am very keen that data protection law must be a fine blend of recognising the element of consent of the owner of the individual data and also India becoming a big centre of data cleaning, data processing. I am very happy a large number of data centres are opening in India including in the private sector. India generates billions of data because of our size and population.Q How is the government working to address the concerns about a digital divide that comes in the way of vaccination in rural areas or for the urban poor?A: Just see how many rural people are taking the vaccines. If there’s anything that needs to be done surely, we will support the health ministry. In making digital healthcare possible our ministry gives all the support.Q Was the government blindsided. Did it miss the red flags about the second wave?A: I will differ with you for the simple reason that the second wave was not only in India. It was in Japan, Australia, Germany and England and many Southeast Asian countries and parts of America. You should go to see the stress on health care in these places. We have to all work together. WTO data said between March 2020 and March 2021 about 1.25 crore Indians were infected, but in the last 49 days 1.30 crore were infected, see the enormity of the challenge and yet the way we have handled the crisis whether it was oxygen, or the hospital beds all issues are under control.The opposition first criticised the vaccine policy, at every stage they asked questions. The polio vaccine was being administered only to children, yet it took at least 15 years to make India polio-free. Here you have to vaccinate the whole population practically therefore, if we have a target of doing it by the year end, I think we are moving with great speed. The Prime Minister had warned all chief ministers to pull up their socks.Q There is a lot of confrontation between the centre and the states particularly West Bengal. The opposition complains their suggestions are met with barbs.A: Constructive suggestions are very welcome. West Bengal elections were held as per the constitutional requirement. It is a different place altogether, why is it (bickering with the centre) not happening with Kerala. Now you see how vaccines are being wasted in Rajasthan and there is a problem in Punjab. I’m saying let us make it a national issue and the state and Centre both have to work together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-won-t-compromise-its-digital-sovereignty-ravi-shankar-prasad-101622919207459.html

In Odisha, Covaxin is being given to only people in BMC area.Till Saturday morning, Bhubaneswar had 2440 doses of Covaxin meant for people in the 18-45 age group while 4.58 lakh doses were left for people in the 45+ group. With the BMC prioritising people who are due for second dose, it is vaccinating only a handful people who booked their jabs for their first shot.“We can divert the stock. We had earlier asked the Centre to give permission. However, as the Centre has not said no to our proposal, we plan to use the stock for the 18-45 age group. The doses can be adjusted once the state allocation is streamlined,” said the health secretary.Last month, the Maharashtra government had diverted over 3 lakh doses meant for 18-45 age group to 45+ age group for their second dose.The decision to divert the Covaxin shots meant for 45+ age group to 18-45 age group came after it was found that the number of people turning up for vaccination in the second group was higher than the first one. Though vaccination opened for 45+ age group from April 1, so far 3.4 lakh people in that group from BMC area have taken their first dose. In comparison, over 1.6 lakh people out of 5.17 lakh eligible in the age group of 18-45 have taken their first dose.Bharat Biotech has committed to supply 26,000 doses of Covaxin for the 18-44 age group by June 7, but it would be grossly inadequate to meet the requirement.The BMC has announced that students in the 18-45 age group who want to go abroad would be vaccinated. They can register themselves by dialling 1929 and a special vaccination drive will be launched for them.So far, Odisha has received around 9.71 lakh doses of both Covaxin and Covishield for a targeted population of 17.22 lakh of 18 years plus in 11 cities. This includes 2.27 lakhs doses of Covishield vaccine that it received on Saturday evening. The state plans to cover 5.88 lakh people in the 18-45 age group in 11 towns - Angul, Balangir, Balasore, Bhadrak, Boudh, Deogarh, Dhenkanal, Gajapati, Chhatrapur (Ganjam), Jagatsinghpur and Jajpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-divert-covaxin-doses-meant-for-45-to-18-44-age-group-in-bhubaneswar-101622919025941.html

The new e-filing portal will be located at www.incometax.gov.in and it will provide “a modern, seamless experience” to taxpayers, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement on Saturday.“New taxpayer friendly portal is integrated with immediate processing of Income Tax Returns (ITRs) to issue quick refunds to taxpayers,” it said.All interactions and uploads or pending actions will be displayed on a single dashboard for follow-up action by taxpayer, it added. CBDT said the portal will provide a “free of cost ITR preparation software” with interactive questions to help taxpayers to file for various ITRs, both online and offline. The facility will be gradually provided for the entire range of ITRs.“Taxpayers will be able to proactively update their profile to provide certain details of income including salary, house property, business/profession which will be used in pre-filling their ITR,” it said.Detailed enablement of pre-filling with salary income, interest, dividend and capital gains will be available after tax deducted at source (TDS) and Statement of Financial Transaction (SFT) details are uploaded, which is due on June 30, 2021.The new portal will also enable a new call centre for taxpayers’ assistance and promptly respond to taxpayer queries. It will also have detailed frequently asked questions (FAQs), user manuals, videos and chatbot.The portal will have functionalities for filing income-tax forms, add tax professionals, submit responses to notices in faceless scrutiny or appeals. “It is clarified that the new tax payment system will be launched on June 18th, 2021 after the advance tax instalment date to avoid any taxpayer inconvenience,” it said.Besides the portal, a mobile app will also be released subsequent to the initial launch of the portal, to enable taxpayers to get familiar with the various features.“Familiarization with the new system may take some time, so, the Department requests the patience of all taxpayers/stakeholders for the initial period after the launch of the new portal and while other functionalities get released since this is a major transition,” CBDT said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbdt-to-launch-revamped-and-easy-income-tax-payment-system-on-monday-101622918066030.html
06-06-2021||India||Private hospitals across country got 12mn doses in May: Centre||The Union health ministry on Saturday said that private hospitals across the country received 12 million doses of vaccines against Covid-19 in May, clarifying that this included hospitals in tier II and tier III cities, in a response to a news report that said 50% of the total doses allocated to the private sector went to nine private hospital chains.“A large number of private hospitals that have contract with Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech have been supplied with Covishield and Covaxin doses. These private hospitals are not limited to the bigger metros, but also from Tier II & III cities across states,” the release from the health ministry said, rejecting charges of vaccine inequity in India’s inoculation drive.The states with fewer private hospitals have been asked to list out the ones that have been performing better under the government’s Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme and other state insurance schemes keeping geographical spread in mind. The government is encouraging these hospitals to get into contract with the vaccine manufacturers. “This mechanism facilitates better access and reduces the operational stress on Government Vaccination facilities..,” the release said.The government has reserved 25% of the doses manufactured for the private hospitals under the new liberalised vaccination policy adopted May 1 onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-hospitals-across-country-got-12mn-doses-in-may-centre-101622917885781.html
06-06-2021||India||‘5 states, UTs to get tap water by 2022, ahead of deadline’||The Union government has decided to fully implement its programme of providing tap water to every household in five northern states and union territories by end of the current financial year, instead of the earlier deadline of 2024 and has allocated of ₹8216.25 crore for 2021-22, according to an official statement.These states and federally-administered territories estimated to have complete coverage under the Centre’s Jal Jeevan Mission by end of FY22 are Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.The amount allocated for quickening the project in these five states is four times the allocation in the previous year. When completed, an estimated 50 million people will have access to a functional tap water connection in these five states.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Jal Jeevan programme on Independence Day, 2019. In this period, Goa, Telangana, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Puducherry have fully implemented the scheme. In all, households in 62 districts, 746 blocks and 91000 villages now have a functional tap water connection.India has 190 million rural households, according to Census 2011.At the start of the mission, slightly more than 30 million households had piped drinking water. Since the mission’s launch in August 2019, nearly 40 million new households have been addedIn Haryana, 91.32% rural homes now have tap water supply in 5,150 villages spread across eight districts. In Punjab, 77% rural households have access to tap water supply under the Jal Jeevan Mission.Lack of clean drinking water is a leading cause of child morbidity and estimated to cost 2% of potential gross domestic product (GDP), according to World Bank estimates.Many Indian regions are severely water-stressed, according to the state-run think-tank Niti Aayog’s Composite Water Management Index 2019.Nearly 820 million people in 12 major river basins of the country face “high to extreme” water stress. This has prompted the Centre to ramp up targets under the Mission, covering the entering country by 2024.“What is equally important is whether enough thought is going into making these facilities sustainable on a long-term basis,” said Anand Goswami, who formerly taught at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-states-uts-to-get-tap-water-by-2022-ahead-of-deadline-101622917825206.html
06-06-2021||India||New vaccine platform to monitor immunisation impact: Panel chief||The first analysis that will show the impact of immunisation against Covid-19 is expected in a few weeks, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) chief Dr NK Arora said on Saturday as efforts to harmonise the data are ramped up by the group to study the efficacy of all vaccines being administered across the country and chances of reinfection, including the fatality rate post-vaccination.The new vaccine platform that will collate three different data sets — Covid-19 test results, breakthrough infections as well as their severity, and vaccination numbers across the population — will be able to determine trends regarding chances of reinfection post-immunisation (after both the first and the second dose) and even the efficacy of different vaccines. This platform will be coordinated and managed by ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research). The analysis done on the platform will also help determine the efficacy of a single shot of the vaccine.“The platform will monitor the impact of immunisation on the Covid pandemic,” Arora said. “It will help us assess what is the risk of getting a Covid infection post the first dose and the second dose and the severity of the infection. It will help assess not only the risk of being hospitalised, but also the fatality rate in such cases.”According to Arora, the need to assess and harmonise the three sets of data started taking concrete shape in early April. The platform, which is being developed along with the health ministry and ministry of electronics and information technology, will be accessible to the public.“The attempt is to put out regular bulletins on the platform. This will help everyone understand the impact of the pandemic in a transparent manner,” he said.The data will be sourced from ICMR and will include Covid reports, the CoWIN platform, vaccination numbers, and Aarogya Setu, which will provide location and other demographics such as age and gender. Data for over 300 million RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests will be collated with that of over 190 million users of Aarogya Setu and further contrasted with the 220 million vaccination doses administered across the country.“An analysis will be done for all vaccines being administered in the country,” Arora said. “This is huge data set and in time, will be able to provide meaningful interpretations and can also be implemented for other immunisation programmes.”The platform will further categorise the chances of reinfection after the first dose and second dose of the vaccine, that is, those who have been partially and fully immunised.“We are also looking at other determinants to help us understand the other demographic features, such as age, gender and type of vaccine given. We will be doing an analysis for all vaccines being administered in the country and assessing the risk of being hospitalised, severity of the disease and risk of death,” Arora said.The platform, said Arora, will set the stage for technological interventions in the field of medicine.“It will be like a dream come true,” he said. “Every health programme, maternity programmes, tuberculosis assessment and other immunisation programmes will be able to benefit from this. This will have a long-term impact on the use of technology and the benefits we can accrue from its use for our health system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-vaccine-platform-to-monitor-immunisation-impact-panel-chief-101622917705135.html
06-06-2021||India||GST revenue dips, still over ₹1L cr||Goods and Services Tax revenue in May remained above the ₹1 lakh crore mark despite many parts of the country being hit by a devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to lockdowns in key business centres including Maharashtra and Delhi from April.The GST revenue in May -- which reflects the actual business activities of the previous month -- fell by over 27% to ₹1,02,709 crore compared to the record collections of ₹ 1,41,384 crore in April (reflecting actual business transactions of March 2021). The GST collections remained above the benchmark of ₹1 lakh crore for the eighth consecutive month.“The revenues for the month of May 2021 are 65% higher than the GST revenues in the same month last year [ ₹62,151 crore],” the Union finance ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The Indian economy was hit hard in the first quarter of the previous year because of a 68-day national lockdown since March 25, 2020. The severity of the lockdowns since April this year was lower, with most states allowing manufacturing activities to continue.The GST collection data for a month is normally released on the first day of the following month. As various deadlines were extended to provide relief to taxpayers from the second wave, they could file returns up to June 4, a finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity.“The May figure actually reflects business activities from April 1 to April 30. In usual circumstances, business entities have to file returns [GSTR 3B] of these transactions by May 20. Due to the second wave, businesses had been granted more time to file returns,” the official explained. GSTR-3B is a monthly summary statement of business transactions filed by a registered entity.Out of the ₹1,02,709 crore gross GST revenue collected in May this year, central GST (CGST) was ₹17,592 crore, state GST (SGST) was ₹22,653, integrated GST (IGST) was ₹53,199 crore, including ₹26,002 crore collected on the import of goods. The cess collection was ₹9,265 crore, including ₹868 crore collected on the import of goods, the finance ministry statement said.“During the month, revenues from import of goods was 56% higher and the revenues from domestic transaction (including import of services) are 69% higher than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year,” it added.Businesses performed poorly last year because of a hard nationwide lockdown for over two months that led to a 24.4% contraction of the economy in the first quarter of 2020-21. The economy shrank by 7.3% in the second quarter, before expanding by 0.5% in the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 1.6% in the March quarter. Overall, the Indian economy contracted by 7.3% in 2020-21, according to the GDP statistics released by the National Statistical Office on May 31.MS Mani, senior director at consultancy firm Deloitte India, said: “Collections of 1 lakh crore pertaining to the transactions of April 21 could possibly indicate that the level of disruptions in the primary sales due to the lockdown was much lower than what was anticipated.”Most analysts have said the same while revising their growth forecasts for the year only marginally. A Bloomberg poll of 11 economists last week came up with a median growth estimate of 10% in the year, only marginally lower than the 10.5% the same economists projected before the second wave.Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consultancy and audit firm EY said, “Also, the dip in comparison to the collections in the previous months was expected as these GST collections are for the supplies made in April, when part of the country was in lockdown. It’s noteworthy that the ₹1.02 lakh crores GST collections for the month of May will further be increased as businesses having less than ₹5 crore turnover have until 1 week of July to file returns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-revenue-dips-still-over-1l-cr-despite-2nd-covid-wave-101622917525196.html
06-06-2021||India||India, China talks complete a year, issues not fully resolved||The Indian and Chinese armies began negotiations to resolve the border row in eastern Ladakh exactly a year ago, but the two sides have only had limited success in hammering out an agreement for disengagement of rival soldiers deployed at friction points on the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), people tracking the military talks said on Saturday.The Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have held 11 rounds of talks between corps commander-ranked officers since June 6, 2020 to reduce tensions along the disputed border.The only significant outcome of the military dialogue has been the disengagement of front-line troops and weaponry in the Pangong Tso sector in mid-February after the ninth round of talks, one of the officials cited above said on condition of anonymity.“Disengagement is stuck at the other friction points. Talks have not made any headway in resolving the problems at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang. Negotiations are on but there is no end in sight to the standoff. We will continue to engage the Chinese side to find a solution,” said a second official, asking not to be named.Both armies have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre and the deployments haven’t thinned after the disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector.On May 28, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said his soldiers were on high alert as the PLA continued to base its troops and mechanised elements including tanks in its “immediate depth” across the LAC from where they could be deployed to forward areas at short notice. (Immediate depth in the context of the Ladakh sector refers to a distance of 150 km to 200 km from the LAC.)Naravane said results should not be expected after every round of talks, citing the case of Pangong Tso, where disengagement took place after nine rounds.The corps commanders’ meetings have had mixed results as those talks were successful in negotiating the disengagement in the Pangong Tso area but there has been no further progress, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). “It is important to understand that success in negotiations between military commanders has to be preceded by groundwork that is laid by political and diplomatic engagements. We saw this happening prior to the ninth round of military talks where both sides worked out the modalities for disengagement from Pangong Tso. A similar combined effort is required,” Hooda said.He added that the military commanders by themselves cannot take any decisions unless the principles of an agreement have been worked out at the political or diplomatic level.The Indian Army’s focus is on resolving outstanding problems with the PLA at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang, but the disengagement process has hit a wall as a result of the PLA’s reluctance to pull back its forward deployed troops and restore the status quo ante of April 2020, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has been affected in Hot Springs and Gogra, where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year, but the gains could not be consolidated.The PLA’s deployments in Depsang have also hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13. To be sure, the problems at Depsang predate the current border standoff.“Disengagement is just the first phase of a broader, more comprehensive plan of establishing the status quo ante of April 2020. It will be followed by de-escalation and finally de-induction of forces. We continue to remain vigilant,” Naravane said on May 28.The two armies held the first round of military talks on June 6, 2020. However, the Galwan Valley skirmish on June 15, 2020 created severe complications and dashed hopes of any significant breakthrough. The brutal clash that left 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead created a huge trust deficit between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-talks-complete-a-year-issues-not-fully-resolved-101622917405138.html
06-06-2021||India||Verified badges from Bhagwat, V-P Twitter accounts removed, later restored||New Delhi: Twitter removed the blue verified badge from the accounts of top Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders, including its chief Mohan Bhagwat, and vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu only to restore it later on Saturday evoking a sharp reaction from Sangh and BJP leaders.RSS’s joint general secretaries Krishna Gopal and Arun Kumar, former general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi, , Suresh Soni (former joint general secretary), and Sampark Pramukh Aniruddha Deshpande were among other leaders whose Twitter accounts temporarily lost their verification badges. It was not immediately clear why the badges of the RSS leaders that certify that an account of public interest is authentic were removed.Twitter restored Naidu’s badge after an uproar and the company said it was removed as his account was inactive. “Account [of Naidu] inactive since July 2020. As per our verification policy, Twitter may remove the blue verified badge and verified status if the account becomes inactive. The badge has been restored,” a Twitter spokesperson said. Naidu’s account with 1.3 million followers was created in August 2013. He last tweeted on July 23, 2020. Several social media users pointed out several inactive accounts continue to have the blue tick. The official handle of the vice president of India continued to have the badge.An RSS functionary said the badges of the organisation’s leaders were removed sometime in March, but no explanation was offered. “If they claim it was done because the accounts were inactive, then they should have informed us. There has been no communication from their side,” said the functionary, who did not want to be named.RSS leaders do not use their Twitter handles, but they have handles that have been verified so as to avoid fake accounts. The Sangh’s handle continues to have the badge. Twitter has been at loggerheads with the government since February when the company was asked to block content related to criticism of farm laws and about the protests they triggered. New rules were introduced later that month to make social media companies accountable for requests for the removal of posts. They also mandate them to take measures such as appointments of grievance officers to deal with complaints. Twitter last week urged the government to give it three more months to comply with the rules. On Saturday, the government wrote to Twitter, giving it a last chance to comply. Facebook-owned WhatsApp last week moved court against the rules saying the government was exceeding its legal powers. It maintained the rules will force it to break its end-to-end message encryption.Twitter also last week said it was worried about the safety of its staff in India.
