24-06-2021||Lucknow||District panchayat chief’s polls: BJP leaves two seats for ally Apna Dal (S) in Uttar Pradesh||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday left two zila panchayat chairpersons’ seats for the Apna Dal (Sonelal), a party mostly comprising Kurmis, an other backward classes (OBC) community with pockets of influence in eastern UP. The ally had demanded five seats.This appeared to be the first hint ahead of the July 3 zila panchayat chairpersons’ elections in Uttar Pradesh (UP) as to where smaller caste-based parties fit into the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) or for that matter Opposition’s scheme of things in the 2022 UP assembly polls. “The BJP has left out two seats – in Jaunpur and Sonbhadra – for Apna Dal (S),” party spokesman Rajesh Patel confirmed. The Dal has representation in the UP government with a minister of state, two leaders accommodated in commissions with minister of state status, and an MLC. Since 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to contest Lok Sabha polls from Varanasi, the BJP has continued its alliance with Apna Dal (S), giving representation to Dal leader Anupriya Patel in Modi’s first government, though she did not find a place in his second ministry. The BJP’s move came barely a day after its other ally, the Nishad party, played hardball. Nishad party leader Sanjay Nishad, while aiming for a berth in Yogi Adityanath government, is also hoping that the BJP would leave some zila panchayat chairpersons’ seats for his party. The Nishad party commands loyalty of riverine community of boatmen and fishermen and has influence in a few east UP regions.In 2018, the SP had fielded Sanjay Nishad’s son Praveen as its candidate from Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat and stunned the BJP in 2018 by-polls after Yogi Adityanath, a five-term MP from the seat vacated it on becoming an MLC in keeping with the constitutional obligation after being named the chief minister. Subsequently, the BJP won the Nishad party over to its side in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, fielding Praveen on its symbol from Sant Kabir Nagar. He won and is currently a BJP MP. “During my meeting with CM Yogi Adityanathji, I also spoke of how our community has always served the gods,” Sanjay Nishad said. Nishad’s reference was to a passage that finds mention in the Ramayana about how Lord Ram, after being sentenced to 14 years in exile, had taken the help of Kewat, a member of the boatmen community, to cross the Ganga.“The chief minister has assured us that we would soon hear good news and we believe him. We told him our community has helped the gods too, but is still neglected,” Nishad said. Yogi Adityanath on Thursday also attended a programme in memory of Raja Suheldev, who is held in high esteem by Rajbhars, the other key OBC community in the state. With Rajbhar voters in mind, the BJP had stitched up an alliance with the Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) in 2017 UP polls. Its chief Om Prakash Rajbhar was even made a minister in the government. Having fallen out with the BJP since, Rajbhar is now busy setting up an anti-BJP front though BJP leaders said they have kept talks with him alive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/district-panchayat-chief-s-polls-bjp-leaves-two-seats-for-ally-apna-dal-s-in-uttar-pradesh-101624559331746.html
24-06-2021||Noida||Noida journalist robbed, case filed||Noida: Taking suo motu cognisance of the matter, the Noida police filed a case on Wednesday at the Bisrakh police station against five unknown suspects for allegedly robbing a TV journalist at gunpoint. The incident took place in the early hours of Monday near the Hindon Bridge when Atul Agrawal, editor-in-chief of Hindi Khabar news channel, was returning from office. He had shared the incident on social media but hadn’t filed a police complaint, police said.The complaint was filed by sub-inspector Kartar Singh. In the complaint, he stated that Agrawal was travelling in a car through the Faridabad-Noida-Ghaziabad (FNG) Expressway to Supertech Eco 1 village in Greater Noida west.“Near the Hindon river bridge around 1am, he stopped the car and plugged in a pen drive to play music when five suspects reached the spot on two motorcycles and held him at gunpoint. They robbed him of some money ( ₹5,000-6,000) and fled the spot,” it said.In his post on social media platform Facebook, Agrawal had narrated that the five suspects held him at gunpoint and one of them took over his car’s driving seat.“One of them was using abusive language while another one was saying to shoot me. I pleaded that I have a young child and to please let me go,” he wrote. The five suspects finally released him and fled with only the cash. His mobile phone and car were not snatched. The sub-inspector said that the police team reached the spot for investigation after they received information through social media. The police called Agrawal to come to the spot the same night to assist them with the probe but he refused. Next day, however, Agrawal reached the Bisrakh police station and narrated the sequence of events but did not file a complaint, officers said.Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida central, said the case was filed against unknown suspects under Section 392 (robbery) of the Indian Penal Code. “We are scanning CCTV cameras of nearby areas to identify and arrest the suspects. We have increased patrolling. We have also put up lights at different places for the safety of commuters,” he said.When asked, Agrawal said, “The law will take its course. May God guide those boys to the right path.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-journalist-robbed-case-filed-101624559093156.html
24-06-2021||Noida||Greater Noida: Land freed for dedicated freight corridor project||GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida authority has freed up 8,000 square metres of land worth ₹24 crore in Gulistanpur village required for the dedicated freight corridor (DFC) project, officials said on Thursday.Some people had encroached upon this land on khasra (land record) numbers 176, 177 and 178, the officials said.“Around 50 staff of the authority, accompanied by a police team, on Wednesday evening removed the structures illegally built by the locals on this government land in Gulistanpur village. We used seven earthmoving machines and as many dumpers to raze the structures. Now, the work on the freight corridor project will be expedited,” said KR Verma, deputy general manager of the Greater Noida authority.The Indian Railways is laying a 140km rail track from Greater Noida’s Bodaki to Rewari in Haryana. The stretch is part of the 1,400km rail route being laid from Greater Noida to Mumbai port for the DFC project.“As the land has been freed up, the work on this project will get a boost,” said a railway official, not authorised to speak to media.In 2006, the Indian Railways had formed a special purpose vehicle -- the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India (DFCCI) -- to build, maintain and operate the DFC project to boost the economy. Once the project gets complete, goods can be transported from Greater Noida to Mumbai in 20 hours through the new route. At present, it takes almost five days for a container to travel the same distance, the railway official said. The DFCCI will build residential facilities and corporate offices for the corridor project on about 23 hectares in Greater Noida. The Greater Noida authority has allotted 36 hectares for the corridor project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-land-freed-for-dedicated-freight-corridor-project-101624558730472.html
24-06-2021||Noida||Okhla Bird Sanctuary: Birders complain of poor infrastructure, demand repairs||Noida: Nearly a week after the Okhla Bird Sanctuary (OBS) reopened for visitors, a number of birders have complained of poor state of infrastructure that poses a threat to their safety which “should have been fixed long back”.Birders alleged that the damaged bamboo bridge, rickety watch tower, reet (tall grass) and bushes blocking the pathways, among other issues, have blocked the sanctuary at various points, and urged the forest department to repair them at the earliest. Over 20 years old, the bridge connects a major part of the sanctuary near the lake and the watchtowers with the rest of the sanctuary. The facility was reopened on June 16. The bird sanctuary and Surajpur reserve forest and wetland were closed for visitors and birders on April 17 — second time due to the Covid-19 since March last year. The OBS and Surajpur forests were earlier closed from March 2020 to September 15, 2020 after the city experienced first Covid-19 wave and a nationwide lockdown was imposed. “The condition of the bamboo bridge is very bad and it is risky to cross it. The watchtower that offers a great view of the lake is already inaccessible, with a sign board cautioning people from climbing it. The path for the second watch tower is almost blocked due to very dense reet. I recently visited the sanctuary and went towards the watchtower as well but I think many would avoid going there. The forest department must fix these issues,” Noida-based birder Narendra Singh said.Experts pointed out that while the forest department is building Infrastructure to promote night camping at the sanctuary, their prime concern should be fixing the infrastructure already installed that helps with birding. “Over time, the bird sanctuary is becoming more a place for entertainment of people rather than birding. The forest department must place its concerns towards preserving the habitat and welfare of the birding community before installing leisure facilities like camping. The least they could do is to provide clear pathways, proper watch towers and safe bridges,” said city-based birder Anand Arya.Birders said it must have been a long while before the towers and bridges were last fixed.“The watchtower was in a poor state even before the lockdown. The bamboo bridge is already in shambles. I would urge the forest department to fix these issues on priority to make birding safe,” said Delhi-based birder Zeba Khair.Officials, meanwhile, said the contract to build a new bridge and tower has been done but that the work was stalled due to Covid-19.“We understand the inconvenience being caused to the birding community. These issues will be resolved very soon. We are building a new wooden bridge and getting new towers. The work will be initiated very soon,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/okhla-bird-sanctuary-birders-complain-of-poor-infrastructure-demand-repairs-101624558671132.html
24-06-2021||Noida||With 3rd Covid wave on the horizon, officials worry about ‘public negligence’||Noida With most restrictions during the partial coronavirus-imposed curfew being withdrawn across the district, Noida police officials are concerned about public negligence and complacency even as the third wave of Covid-19 is on the horizon. Following the ‘unlock’, there has been a 34% spike in violations during the weekends.During the second wave of Covid-19, Gautam Budh Nagar saw a partial curfew starting May 6. Majority curbs were relaxed from June 7, when markets were allowed to open. However, night curfew and weekend lockdown remained in place. The guidelines were further eased from June 21, and malls were allowed to open, and the night curfew was also reduced by two hours.According to police data from May 24 to June 20 (two weeks before and after the ‘unlock’ on June 7), more than 45,000 people have been challaned for Covid-related violations, and nearly ₹50 lakh collected in fines. On an average, 1,663 challans have been issued per day before the imposition of partial curfew, and 1,596 per day following the ‘unlock’. Last week, as many as 10,955 people were challaned for violating Covid-19 protocols, and nearly ₹11.1 was collected in fines.While the average is still nearly the same, a major spike was seen in the weekend following the easing of curbs, according to the officials. The average number of violations on the weekends before June 7 were 1,531, which increased to 2,335 (nearly 34%) afterwards.At present, officials are, however, concerned that as the unlock progresses, the people might become more negligent and stop following Covid-19 norms and precautions. “Our biggest challenge has been the implementation of social distancing in public places. While people wear masks and follow curfew timings, they usually don’t maintain social distancing norms. The ‘unlock’ process, in no manner, means that the pandemic is over. This is especially scary with the third wave of Covid-19 on the horizon,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (zone 1).“When week-long lockdowns are imposed, people tend to follow curbs even on weekends. However, with relaxations during weekdays, people usually don’t follow Covid-19 protocols on Saturdays and Sundays, too. As there’s a possibility of a third wave of Covid-19, the situation will get scary if this trend continues. People need to understand that Covid-19 norms are in place not for challans, but for their safety. They should adhere to the guidelines,” said Love Kumar, joint commissioner of police, law and order.Officials have urged the people to take the situation seriously, to avoid the distress that the second wave of Covid-19 followed. Police said they will take strict action against the violators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/with-3rd-covid-wave-on-the-horizon-officials-worry-about-public-negligence-101624558670479.html
24-06-2021||Noida||Gym owners, trainers in GB Nagar resort to online training, selling equipment||Noida: With gyms and fitness centres across Gautam Budh Nagar remaining shut for nearly two months, several gym owners and trainers said they are struggling to survive as their savings have dried up. They are now resorting to online training and selling their equipment to earn money.Rahul Negi shut his gym in Greater Noida West and put up the equipment for sale online. “Last year, my landlord had waived rent for the first two months of the lockdown and I somehow made it through the year on my savings. But this year, things were different. So, I have decided to shut the gym and sell the equipment which will help me meet my family expenses and pay off a few debts,” said Negi.Negi has now turned to online fitness training. “While there are not many takers for online training, I’m grabbing any such opportunity coming my way,” he said.The gyms and wellness centres have been closed since April 30 when the partial Covid curfew was imposed in the district in view of the second wave of Covid-19. Though the curfew restrictions were eased on June 7, gyms were asked to remain closed until further orders.Yogesh Parweha, who runs a gym in Noida’s Sector 51, has started taking up personal training assignments. “I have taken two to three personal training sessions since the curfew restrictions were eased. I have received the first dose of the vaccine and I follow all Covid protocols during training sessions,” he said.After reopening in the last week of August 2020, after the lockdown imposed in view of the first Covid wave, gym owners said business only picked up in January and just when it was getting better by March, the second wave put paid to their earnings.Chirag Sethi, vice-president of Delhi-NCR Gyms Association, said, “Every day, we are getting at least three requests from Noida regarding resale of gym equipment. That means a number of small-scale gyms are shutting in the district.”Owners of big gyms are also finding it difficult to pay staff salaries, rents, and other fixed charges, Sethi said. “A large-scale gym in Gautam Budh Nagar, with an investment of over ₹2 crore, has to pay at least ₹3 lakh a month in rent. Besides, we have to shell out at least ₹30,000 on fixed charges and 18% GST as well. In the past 14 months, gyms have been allowed to open only for six months and gym owners are getting buried under debts,” he said.While several small-scale gyms have shut down, corporate gym owners say their staff are looking at other career options. Ankur Arora, owner of La-Fitnesse in Sector 18, said the fitness industry has been badly hit. “The staff at our gym are looking an uncertain future -- we are not sure when they can return to work after we reopen. They are now looking for jobs in sales and marketing,” said Arora.He also said keeping gyms closed is unfair. “Liquor shops, restaurants and shopping malls have opened, then why not gyms? Exercise and workout is the best way to maintain immunity and fitness,” he saidNikhil Kakkar, chief operating officer at Gold’s Gym India, said gym owners are also facing uncertainty due to fear of a third wave of Covid-19. “Though there is a possibility of a third wave, people are positive about visiting the gym in cities where they are open -- like Gurugram, Faridabad and Mumbai,” he said.Pinning hopes on July 1 Gaurav Sharma, who runs the branches of Anytime Fitness in Noida’s sectors 30 and 108, said they have vaccinated all of their staff so that clients feel safe when gyms reopen. “Not just our staff, we will also encourage clients to get themselves vaccinated,” he said.Umesh Kansal, who runs the sector 30 and 104 branches of Gold’s Gym, said their staff have also been vaccinated. “We hope that from July 1, gyms will be allowed to reopen. From the security guards to cleaners to personal trainers, all have been vaccinated and we hope that people will trust our gym enough to consider it a safe space,” he said.Meanwhile, the UP Fitness Center and Gyms Association has written to the chief minister regarding the opening of gyms in the upcoming unlock phase.“We request the CM to please consider our request and please allow the gyms in the upcoming unlock phase,” said Chirag Sethi who is also a member of the association.Caution is key, say experts Medical experts said while gyms do promote a healthy lifestyle, they can also be breeding ground for infection. Dr NK Sharma, president of Indian Medical Association (Noida chapter), said, “The government has been gradually opening up establishments as it is necessary to exercise caution, especially since the possibility of a third wave is there. Gyms are considered hot spots of Covid-19 infection as a large number of people use the same machines. No matter how many times the gym administration sanitises the place, the chances of an infection are higher in closed spaces.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gym-owners-trainers-in-gb-nagar-resort-to-online-training-selling-equipment-101624558550460.html
24-06-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad, GB Nagar achieve single-day highest vaccination coverage||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar districts on Thursday recorded their single-day highest vaccination coverage and also stood at second and third spot, respectively, for the highest number of doses administered across all 75 districts in the state. Officials, however, said they are facing hiccups in procuring doses which could bring down the per-day vaccination coverage for the next two days.According to the Cowin portal, Uttar Pradesh administered 818,727 doses till 9.30pm on Thursday and the top three spots were occupied by Gorakhpur (31,944 doses) Ghaziabad (29,690 doses) and GB Nagar (27,251 doses). “The 29,690 administered Thursday is one day highest number of jabs administered in the district. What is more encouraging is that about 95% of these doses were given at government centres. Our vaccination coverage has picked up ever since we started the ‘near to home’ project at six centres under the cluster vaccination scheme,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad. Under the cluster vaccination scheme, several residential wards or villages have been identified in the form of a cluster and teams will take up vaccination of beneficiaries at a central location accessible to residents. One of the major paid, private vaccination-centres at Cambridge School, set up by Max Hospital, in Ghaziabad’s Vaishali, has closed down due to low footfall after the on-spot registration was allowed at ‘near to home’ vaccination centres. “We closed down as the footfall dipped to about 200-300 per day and it was not feasible for us to maintain the huge operating expenses. However, our other centre at the hospital site is still in operation,” said an official from the hospital, on condition of anonymity.Short supplyOfficials familiar with the matter said that Ghaziabad also faces the issue of short supply for the next two days as they have about 21,000 doses for Friday and about 11,000 for Saturday. This, they added, will bring down their daily vaccination coverage. “We are trying to ensure that sufficient vaccine stock is made available to us on a regular basis to keep up the momentum,” Dr Gupta added. The six centres under the cluster scheme contributed 11,612 doses out of the total 29,690 administered in the district on Thursday. In GB Nagar there are about 17,000 doses available for Friday.“However, we will ensure that more stock arrives in due course. The figure of vaccination achieved on Thursday is the single day highest achieved by the district so far. About 25% of the coverage was seen through by the 25% private sector, while the rest was by government vaccination-centres. Starting July 1, we have planned to scale up our daily vaccinations to about 30,000 doses,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar.The UP chief minister has directed that more than 10 lakh doses per day be administered in the state from July 1. The state, on the day, will launch its cluster vaccination program in all areas of all the 75 districts in order to achieve full vaccination coverage for the state’s population by the end of this year.“Our vaccination program is running at a fast pace and our cluster vaccination model is yielding encouraging results. For June, we had set a target of ten million doses. But we achieved the target on Thursday and still we have six more days left in the month, during which we will achieve more coverage,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health). He added that from June 21, when the cluster model was initiated, the state saw 700,000 to 800,000 doses being administered daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-gb-nagar-achieve-single-day-highest-vaccination-coverage-101624558490477.html

Students will be required to answer 50 MCQs in 90 minutes,” an official said.They can take the examination from their home, a cyber cafe, on their smartphones, laptops and desktops, says the order intimated to principals and directors of polytechnic colleges through a letter written by Sunil Kumar Sonkar, secretary, Technical Education Council, on June 22.According to the order, the MCQ-based paper will include sections of all subjects. While final semester students will have a single paper, other semester students will have two question papers of 50 marks each.The council has advised all polytechnic institutions to hold a demo test to make students comfortable with the software.The dates for the demo (mock) test will be declared shortly. The council has warned if students fail to take the demo test and then face problems during the exam, only they will be responsible for it. An official said as students had been traditionally appearing in pen-and-paper examinations, a need was felt to facilitate all students to appear in a mock test so that they are better placed for the exams.“The exams will be held in two parts. The examination for final year polytechnic students will be held first. The examination for first and second year students will be held thereafter,” an official said.For long, polytechnic students have demanded the technical education council to hold mock tests ahead of the annual examinations as they have no previous experience of taking online examinations.Now, biggest worry for students is connectivity as many of them live in remote areas of the state. There are 141 government and 1217 private polytechnic colleges in the state in which 2.5 lakh students are enrolled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/polytechnic-colleges-to-hold-mcq-based-online-exams-in-july-101624557350406.html

A payment was made via two online transactions in March.“They both knew each other and had business relations. They both run laptop shops. The accused told the complainant that he has contacts in Mumbai who could help them get one laptop for ₹15,000 and those could be sold in Pune for ₹20,000.

24-06-2021||Gurugram||Buyers in affordable housing project want work expedited||As many as 50 buyers of Mahira Homes in Sector 103 held a demonstration near the Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) office in Sector 14 on Wednesday, alleging slow progress of work despite paying 60% of the project cost.Officials said the homebuyers were at the DTCP office to meet the developer and senior town planner Sanjiv Mann.The housing project, which falls in the affordable housing category, is scheduled to be completed and delivered in 2024.Manjit Pandey, a homebuyer, said that work on the ground is only at 10%, though they have paid 62% of the cost to the developer. “The pace of the project work is slow, although a majority of the buyers have already paid around ₹15 lakh each. They have also asked for the next payment. We want the DTCP to check the extent of construction work. The bank from where I took a loan is reluctant to release the next tranche of amount, given the slow pace of project work,” Pandey said.On Sunday, 70 to 80 homebuyers gathered at the project site to protest against the slow pace of work. According to the homebuyers, they were asked to complete 75% of the payment, while there was no concurrent work at the project site. They also said that a few months ago, the DTCP had said that the payment of affordable projects be made as per the construction work being done, and this should be implemented at the earliest.The developer of Mahira Homes, however, said that as per the rules, they have been given four years to develop the project. “We assure the buyers that the project will be completed by 2024, without any delay. Buyers, who don’t want to invest in this project anymore, can tell us, and we will return their money. Many homebuyers didn’t make payments in the past, and the project is in arrear of around ₹14 crore,” said Alakh Niranjan, a senior official of Mahira Developers.“We had to reschedule the construction work due to the Covid-imposed lockdown, but we will meet the project timelines,” he said.Senior town planner Sanjiv Mann asked the district town planner (DTP) to visit the site and check the project status. “We have asked the developer to speed up the pace of construction. The issue of buyers defaulting on payment was also discussed. We will ensure that the project is delivered on time,” Mann said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/buyers-in-affordable-housing-project-want-work-expedited-101624554412317.html
24-06-2021||Gurugram||30-member team to check illegal encroachment of Aravallis||The forest department constituted a 30-member team to check illegal encroachments in the Aravallis, officials said on Thursday. The team, tasked with monitoring Aravalli forests round-the-clock, comprises forest guards, villagers and members of an existing task force that was formed to protect the Aravallis. Rajeev Tejyan, the divisional forest officer for Gurugram, said, “Forest staff monitors the Aravallis regularly, but in the past few weeks, complaints of illegal encroachments increased. Recently, we had learnt about an illegal road constructed in Sohna. To reduce such cases, a 30-member team has been formed that will be patrolling the forests round-the-clock and ensure that fresh encroachments don’t come up.” The forest department has a four-member task force for visiting spots of Aravalli forests based on tip-offs received from locals and citizens. “Along with regular patrolling by forest guards in their respective beats, village locals also help us by giving information from time to time. We send our team to these areas and start the process of stopping the encroachment. It is easier to demolish fresh encroachments before a legal procedure starts, and intensive patrolling will help us with that,” Tejyan said. In the past two months of lockdown, cases of encroachments in the Aravallis of Gurugram and Faridabad have increased. Last week, the forest department closed an illegal route constructed through the forest near Damdama in the Sohna forest range. Before that, encroachments were reported from near Aravalli Biodiversity Park in Nathupur village of Gurugram earlier this month. In May, a wall was built across one acre of Aravalli land in Faridabad, in a new encroachment attempt. In March, a little over 25 acres of forest land in Ankhir village of Faridabad forest division was also found encroached. Officials said that it was difficult to stop illegal encroachments at times due to a shortage of staff, but now, the focus will be on areas near the Raisina Aravallis in the Sohna range, from where maximum complaints are being received. Meanwhile, the Sohna Municipal Council is also taking action against farmhouses constructed illegally. Last week, the authority had sent notices to 15 such farmhouse owners and nine of the structures were demolished on Wednesday. Sandeep Malik, an executive officer of the Sohna Municipal Council, said, “We had been receiving complaints of fresh encroachments, like the construction of walls, during the lockdown period. After sending notices and studying all the documents of the property owners, nine such structures were demolished. We will be further studying the details of a few more properties and decide a date for demolishing more structures next week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/30member-team-to-check-illegal-encroachment-of-aravallis-101624554411784.html

We have demanded that full salaries should be paid even for the lockdown period,” said a bus conductor at the Sector 53 bus depot, who did not wish to be named. Officials of the GMCBL said that as per the lockdown guidelines issued by the government, the movement of buses was restricted in April and May, and employees were paid based on duty hours. “Following the government guidelines, drivers and conductors were called for work on alternative days based on a roster system as only 50% of buses were running in the past two months. The payments, which are made through a private firm, were based on the number of days they worked. We will be giving full salaries from now on as more buses are plying on all the routes,” said Arun Sharma, manager of bus depots at sectors 10 and 53. The GMCBL has over 160 buses plying on 26 different routes in Gurugram and Faridabad.The conductors submitted a list of demands to the authorities, seeking payment of full salaries for April and May, and payment of salaries by the tenth of every month. Rajneesh, a bus conductor at the Sector 10 bus depot, said, “The full salary for the month is ₹17,000, but not even half the amount has been paid this month. If the demands are not met within 15 days, as assured to us, we will go on strike again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bus-conductors-strike-seek-full-salaries-for-lockdown-months-101624554410221.html
24-06-2021||Gurugram||Sector 14 residents oppose conversion of park into waste-to-wonder museum||Residents of sectors 14 and 17 reiterated that they are opposed to the conversion of the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Park into a waste-to-wonder museum, an initiative being undertaken by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), ahead of a hearing in the Punjab and Haryana high court on June 29.They said that concretisation work might destroy greenery and besides, thousands of residents who use this park in the morning and evening for exercise and recreation would have no other place to turn to as this is the only large park in the vicinity.Residents said that the park remained closed till June 4 this year due to the coronavirus pandemic and around 50% of the greenery was affected, with several trees cut. Residents approached the Punjab and Haryana high court for relief in the last week of May, after a complaint submitted by the residents’ welfare association (RWA) of Sector 14 at the CM Window, two months ago, failed to elicit a response from the authorities. The petition was accepted by the high court on June 4 and arguments are set to be heard on June 29.HS Nanda, a resident of Sector 14, who has served as the RWA presidents in the past, said that the park was developed by Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) and has been used by residents for the last three decades, as it is the only green area near their homes. “This park was transferred to MCG in August 2020 for maintenance and due to lockdown, the entry to park was stopped. Residents, however, were shocked when suddenly work on the waste-to-wonder museum started without even asking for suggestions from people living in the area. Large-scale construction is taking place, with metal and concrete structures that will change the character of this green space,” said Nanda. The three-decade-old park is located in the heart of the city and is one of the city’s most popular green spaces. It has areas for walking, jogging, physical exercises, yoga, karate, gymnastics, a play area for children, sandpits for athletes and badminton space, said residents.Residents said that the park was developed by HSVP from the external development charges collected from around 3,000 families living in sectors 14 and 17. “There is a large industrial area just across the road. This park saved us from the heat and pollution of the industrial units and the heavily used roads around these sectors over the years,” said Pradip Sinha, a resident of Sector 14.. Residents also took aim at the MCG for not consulting them about the project and said that officials have failed to provide a satisfactory response to their queries.When asked about the matter, Mukesh Ahuja, the newly appointed commissioner of MCG said that he would look into the grievances of the residents. “I will certainly look into it,” he said. Nanda said that the museum was being developed on the lines of a similar project in New Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan, but it was important to know that the land used in Delhi was an arid landfill while the land in Gurugram is a fully-developed park. Dinesh Agarwal, a resident of Sector 14, however, said that there should be no compromise on the greenery of the park and the project should be developed in a manner that the visitor experience does not get affected. “This could be a landmark development, provided the trees are not cut and people can use the park as before,” he said. Nanda said that residents are hopeful of getting relief from the high court on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/sector-14-residents-oppose-conversion-of-park-into-waste-to-wonder-museum-101624554350799.html

All of them were present at the terminal to board a Jammu-bound flight. A police official said the arrested person has been identified as Raju Ganjhu.“The accused Raju Ganjhu and the rescued boys are from Latehar district. A case was lodged against Raju with the anti-trafficking police station. All of the rescued children are minors in the age group 14-16. They were handed over to the child warfare committee, which would coordinate with the concerned authorities and take further action,” said Anand Prakash Singh, in-charge, Ranchi Airport police station. Police officials said the incident came to light as the group of all minors present at the airport and their body language made their travel suspicious. “The kind of dress they were wearing and their body language raised suspicion. When the police asked the children about their age and other relevant information, they claimed to be adults. However, they appeared to be minors. The person taking them along also could not give the correct information,” said Singh. Police said they were verifying Raju Ganjhu’s background to check if he was ever involved in such a crime, besides tracing his contacts..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/19-minors-rescued-from-ranchi-airport-man-held-for-involvement-in-child-trafficking-101624551889974.html

Gaurav Dipanker, state president of B.Ed. Qualified Candidates Struggle Committee, said, “We have geared up to start a legal procedure for seeking justice. More than 150 petitioners will file writ soon if the state government failed to sort out the matter on their level.” Guddu Kumar, a candidate, said, “I don’t want assurance, I want a job. We have been struggling for three years for getting a job. The state education department is doing injustice with us by excluding us from the merit list.” Yuva Halla Bol (YBH), a nationwide youth movement against unemployment, also questioned the state government over transparency in the merit list. YBH’s president Anupam raised seven questions, including why the state government has not released subject-wise merit list and cut off marks, who are the new candidates included in the merit list and on what basis and how the candidates with higher score have been excluded while candidates with low score have been included in the merit list. All India Students Federation (AISF), Bihar, also came in support of teacher aspirants. Meanwhile, state education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary clarified that all candidates who have qualified STET 2019 are eligible for the 7th phase of teachers’ recruitment irrespective of their name included or excluded in the merit list.Talking about confusion in the merit list, he said, “The changes in the list have been made following the National Council for Teacher Education’s recent decision of extending the validity of TET for the lifetime. Thus, candidates who qualified STET 2011 have also become eligible for the recruitment process in the current phase. The department is working to sort out all confusions. All STET 2019 qualified candidates are eligible for recruitment in the current phase and coming phases of recruitment.”According to the state education department, altogether 30,676 candidates qualified STET 2019 exam in all 15 subjects, results of which were declared on March 12 and June 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/stet-merit-list-row-candidates-protest-for-second-consecutive-day-101624551589962.html

According to the court’s order, applications from fresh candidates from the differently-abled category, including the visually impaired, will be accepted till June 25 to give them another chance to apply and utilise the 4% quota guaranteed under the law.The appointment of primary, secondary and higher secondary school teachers had remained stuck in Bihar for nearly two years despite preparation of the merit list due to legal challenges over anomalies in the process, including allegations that appointments were being done on the basis of forged documents.As per the new schedule, in case fresh applications are not received from differently-abled candidates, the counselling will be done as per the old merit list.Advisory committees comprising Mukhiya of the gram panchayat as its chairman, Up-Mukhiya as the vice-chairman, members as member and secretary as secretary will complete the exercise, including publication of merit list, removal of objections and counselling. The appointment letters will only be issued after verification of documents, the government has specified.During counselling itself, the candidates will be required to submit all their documents for verification, unlike earlier when it remained incomplete even 15 years after appointment despite reprimands from the Patna high court.The provisional merit lists will be ready by July 2 and objections will be accepted till July 3 and dealt with by July 12. On July 15, the final merit list will be made available to start counselling. The education minister, officials said, desires that the pending appointments are made before August 15 so that the seventh phase of teachers’ appointments could be started.In the seventh phase, the number of candidates is likely to be higher due to the provision of lifetime eligibility for candidates clearing Teachers Eligibility Test (TET).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/biharrecruitment-pending-for-1-25l-teaching-posts-in-schools-to-end-by-aug-15-101624551530012.html

24-06-2021||Patna||VIP gearing up fight UP polls: Sahni||The Vikashsheel Insaan Party (VIP), a constituent in the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar, is planning to contest the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls next year and is in the process of identifying 150 seats where it could put up candidates, party chief Mukesh Sahni has said. He said his party might enter into an alliance with like-minded parties. “We have identified around 150 seats where the party could field candidates. The Nishads and other subcastes in the community in UP for 14% of the state’s population,” Sahni said, referring to the caste he belongs to. Nishads traditionally have been a fishermen and boatmen community.Sahni, who holds the portfolio of animal husbandry and fish resources department in Bihar government, said the party would be observing the death anniversary of slain former MP Phoolan Devi on July 25 across all districts in UP as a part of its focus to mobilise Nishads and other subcastes in the community that are part of other backward classes (OBC). Phoolan Devi, a bandit-turned-politician, was killed on July 25, 2001, in New Delhi. UP has a total of 403 assembly seats. Over the years, Nishads have emerged as an important electoral constituency. “Our first preference will be to fight an alliance with the BJP as I am part of the NDA. But we are keeping our options open,” said Sahni (39), a former Bollywood set designer who formed VIP in 2018. In 2019, the party fought parliamentary polls from three seats in Bihar in alliance with RJD and Congress, but drew a blank.Sahni is said to be upset over being ignored in selection of nominees for 12 MLCs from Governor’s quota in March this year and NDA leaders are of the view that he may be using the UP card to gain more clout and also seal his re-election as MLC next year.“But how far will BJP would accommodate his wishes is not clear because VIP has negligible presence organizationally in UP,” said a senior NDA leader, wishing not to be quoted. The BJP-led government in UP under Yogi Adityanath is facing challenge from Samajwadi Party, BSP and Congress. Just ahead of Bihar assembly polls last year, VIP when had walked out of the RJD-led opposition alliance over not getting adequate seats and tied up with NDA. BJP gave VIP 11 seats to contest, of which it won four seats. Sahni himself lost from Simri Bakhtiarpur and got elected as MLC in January this year. “We will be observing Shahadat diwas of Phoolan Devi on July 25 across UP.

24-06-2021||Patna||Bihar: Transport official in Vigilance net for graft||Sleuths from Bihar’s Vigilance Investigation Bureau (VIB) on Thursday searched the private and official residences of Muzaffarpur’s district transport officer (DTO) who has allegedly amassed assets disproportionate to his known sources of income.Sleuths swooped on Rajnish Lal’s three flats at Kankerbagh in Patna and his official residence in Muzaffarpur and recovered over ₹50 lakh in cash, besides gold and silver ornaments, VIB officials said, adding that the officer had been detained and was being questioned.They said assets worth ₹1.24 crore had already been seized and the amount could go higher since the searches and verification of various documents of his movable and immovable property were still underway.Lal, a 1999-batch officer of Bihar Administrative Services (BAS), has been Muzaffarpur DTO since February 3, 2020. On March 9 this year, he was given additional charge of Chapra DTO. In January this year, the Muzaffarpur police led by deputy superintendent of police Ram Naresh Paswan had his office after allegations that he was helping miscreants in forging fake registration papers for stolen vehicles by changing engine and chassis numbers. During his tenure in Chapra, DTO employees allegedly collected bribes from transporters and drivers of trucks carrying illegally mined sand. “No truck could cross Saran district without paying money to Lal. If anyone tried to escape, his men would chase down the driver and beat him to extort money with the help of local police,” said a truck driver, Satyendra Kumar, who frequently plies on the route.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-transport-official-in-vigilance-net-for-graft-101624551409930.html

Five children were given the first dose of the vaccine at Prakhar Hospital here. The youngest among the volunteers was a three-year-old girl. Two kids were from Kanpur and three from Kanpur Dehat. One child was of a doctor, one of a bank manager and three of businessmen. After immunisation, the safety profile of all these children will be checked and analysed.The second dose would be given after 28 days, said doctors. “As many as 15 more children would be included in this trial being conducted only in Kanpur in UP,” said Dr JS Kushwaha, chairman of Prakhar Hospital in Arya Nagar, where last week children in age groups 6-12 years and 12-18 years were given doses as part of this trial. Last year, the hospital had received the go-ahead from the Data and Safety Monitoring Board and Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation to commence the trials. The hospital had conducted one of the biggest trials for the adults’ vaccine in UP. According to Kushwaha, the six children were screened twice – first on Saturday and then on Monday. Their vital parameters were checked thrice before they underwent RT-PCR and antibodies test. A team of doctors conducted all the tests in the presence of their parents. Their reports were shared with the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and Bharat Biotech, he said. Following the approval by the council, the children were called with their parents to the hospital for the doses, said chief investigator of the trials Dr VN Tripathi, who is former director-general (medical education). “Our team of specialists will keep monitoring the kids for seven days. Their reports will be sent to the ICMR twice a day,” he said. The bank manager, who made his kid a volunteer for this trial, said it was his trust on the doctors and his desire to keep his child safe, which made him take the step. “It is not easy for anyone to let his or her child be a part of something like this. One has to take some action under such circumstances to keep kids safe in the possible third wave. Hope the vaccine will work and would be given emergency approval,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/first-in-up-3-yr-old-girl-youngest-to-take-covaxin-jab-101624547869516.html

Chakraborty informed that the vials being used at the camp have been sent to the lab for testing and results are expected in the next 4-5 days.“Samples have been sent to the lab and we will know what was in the vaccines in the next 4-5 days. I’ve talked to officials and from what I gathered it can be said that there was nothing harmful in the vials but we all know they weren’t vaccines. We can say this conclusively once the lab results come back,” Chakraborty said in a video uploaded on her Instagram account.Chakraborty was invited to the vaccination camp on Wednesday by a man who claimed it was meant for inoculating transgender individuals and the disabled. She got herself vaccinated with Covishield in a bid to encourage others to do the same but grew suspicious when she did not receive a vaccination certificate."He said that he was running a special drive for transgenders and specially-abled persons and requested for my presence. I took the Covishield vaccine at the camp to motivate people for taking jabs.

Immediately after vaccination you will also be given a certificate,” Chakraborty cautioned.While urging everyone to wear masks and follow Covid-appropriate hygiene she stated that “The responsibility to ensure such incidents do not happen again falls on our shoulders too.

24-06-2021||Chandigarh||Spirited fight for hockey vs popularity of cricket||Not so long ago, we were the world champions in the game of hockey. Indeed, we retained the gold medal in the Olympics for 32 years, a time much longer than our reign as world champions of cricket. Yet, our country’s golden era in hockey seems buried deep in a dark alley of sporting history, which is, more often than not, overlooked. This contradiction was brought into focus in April when a hockey player of the bygone era, Balbir Singh Junior, passed away. The news was tucked away on one of the inside pages of almost all leading newspapers. Also read: WTC Final - Team India Report Card: A disaster at SouthamptonI have had the privilege of growing up in an era where hockey occupied a pride of place among sports lovers of our country. This was the time when the likes of Ajit Pal Singh, Surjit Singh and Leslie Claudius were the toast of a grateful nation and many a conversation in local buses and trains were centred on the dribbling skills of Mohammad Shahid or on the lightning reflexes of Pakistan’s centre forward, Hasan Sardar. The faith on the defensive skills of Surjit Singh, rock solid goal keeping of Michael Kindo would prevail over the power play of the emerging European teams, such as those from Germany or the Netherlands. This was the era of radio commentaries of the hockey matches being intently listened to by one and all. Often, the celebrated commentators such as the late Jasdev Singh would find it hard to keep pace with the rapid short passes between a Balbir Singh (Senior) and a Balbir Singh (Junior) culminating in a spectacular “gooooooal” matched by the excited high-pitched voice of the commentator, much to the excitement of everyone in the family. I distinctly remember my father taking me to watch a hockey match played between India and arch rivals Pakistan at a stadium in Jalandhar. The atmosphere was no less than a fair with a constant stream of people going towards the stadium. I had the good fortune of watching the brilliant midfield play of Mervyn Fernandes, with his trademark head band, and that of Zafar Iqbal, making a much-feared combination with the wily Mohammad Shahid. We had a roller-coaster ride watching the free-flowing hockey match with attacks and counter attacks, dazzling dribbles and diving stops. The excitement lasted a crisp 70 minutes and the match was over in a blink! Hockey continued to offer a spirited fight to the ever-increasing popularity of cricket fuelled by India’s famous victory at the Lord’s Cricket Ground in 1983 against the mighty West Indies. This was the time when we had the mercurial Dhanraj Pillay as the captain of our hockey team, who was known for his lightning speed. The versatile Pargat Singh was the toast of the nation, with his unexpected runs from the backline to the D in no time! Unfortunately, the game of hockey has slipped into oblivion. Cricket has emerged as the winner. This despite the fact that a hockey match finishes in 70 minutes as compared to a game of cricket that takes at least three hours to get over. Hockey definitely deserves a relook and a fresh lease of life. gulbaharsidhu@rediffmail.com The writer is a Jalandhar-based psychiatrist.

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Aslam and his fellow artists would make thousands of Kanwars and sell them for up to 500 per piece. The second Covid-19 wave has cast a shadow on the pilgrimage and hit people such as Aslam badly for the second year in a row.The bulk of the devotees fetch the holy waters from Haridwar, and the pilgrimage is a major source of business in the city. The Kanwar pilgrimage, which is scheduled to commence by July 22, was called off in 2020 because of the pandemic and there is no clarity yet whether it will be allowed this year.Also Read | Haridwar testing probe: 8-member team calling 98,000 phone numbersThe Char Dham pilgrimage to the four revered Hindu temples in Uttarakhand has been restricted to the pilgrims from the state.Officials said the state administration is unlikely to take any chances after the Mahakumbh experience. Haridwar district magistrate C Ravi Shankar and senior police superintendent D Senthil Aboodai Krishan Raj said the state government has to make a decision.Kumbh Mela was held in Haridwar in April even as experts warned that social distancing and adequate testing will be impossible at a time when the infections were climbing across the country. Eventually, 9.1 million pilgrims took the holy dip in the Ganga from January 14 to April 27. The bulk of this — at least six million people — congregated in April, coinciding with the worst surge in the second wave.State Traders Union president Sanjeev Chaudhary said in accordance with the Covid-19 scenario, the government should take a call on the Kanwar Yatra. “With certain guidelines and Covid protocol, if possible, then it should be given a go-ahead.”Swami Harichetnanand Maharaj, the Mahamandaleshwar of Shri Bada Udasin Akhada, said Char Dham, Mahakumbh Mela, and Kanwar Mela are interlinked with faith, tradition, and the livelihoods of the people in the region. “The state government should see in what way it can ensure religious events like Kanwar Yatra amid adherence to Covid-19 guidelines.”Legislator Madan Kaushik said the second Covid-19 wave has severely affected not only religious events but normal life as well.Millions of people participate in the Kanwar Yatra annually to fetch Ganga waters.

24-06-2021||Chandigarh||Poaching picks up during pandemic in Himachal||There has been a rise in the incidence of poaching and smuggling in Himachal Pradesh during the Covid-19 pandemic. The recent recoveries of four leopard skins, Himalayan monal bird plumes and pangolin scales in Shimla, Solan, Chamba and Hamirpur districts reveal this disturbing trend. Also read: State boards can come up with own Class 12 assessment schemes: Supreme CourtIn June alone, the state police recovered four leopard skins in Shimla and Solan districts. Acting on a tip-off, wildlife officials raided a tailor’s shop in New Shimla and found three leopard skins, two nails and five teeth of the animal. Besides arresting the tailor, they caught the owner of a paying guest accommodation who admitted that the hides, nails and teeth were brought by a resident of neighbouring Uttarakhand in a bus. Though the accused did not have a criminal background, they said they wanted to make a quick buck and got the idea of selling the hides for a profit from social media. The police recovered another leopard hide from a taxi in Solan district. Poisoning leopards to trade parts “During the pandemic, poachers moved around freely and killed animals to trade in hides, nails and plumes. They threw poison-laced meatloaves in the forest to kill leopards. A leopard skin fetches a high price in the international market. One without any injury marks fetches the highest price which is why they have begun to poison leopards,” says Rajeshwar Singh Negi, the national convener of Nature Watch India and a member of the Animal Welfare Board of India. “The animal hide trade is highly organised. A leopard skin changes many hands before it reaches the international market. In India, it can fetch between ₹5 lakh and ₹10 lakh, while it can fetch triple the amount in the international market,” he said. Leopards have been classified as vulnerable in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and are on the red list of threatened species. Wildlife mitigation cells to be set up To keep tabs on such crimes, the Himachal Pradesh government plans to set up wildlife mitigation cells at district and state levels. People will be able to report crimes against wildlife to these cells using a toll-free number. “There has been a rise in the smuggling of wild animal articles. We are seized of the matter,” state forest minister Rakesh Pathania said. Himalayan monal an easy target The police recovered four people at Dalhousie in Chamba district after recovering six plumes suspected to be that of the Himalayan monal. The monal, which belongs to the pheasant family, is poached for its colourful plumes. It is the national bird of Nepal, where it is known as danphe, and the state bird of Uttarakhand. It was also the state bird of Himachal Pradesh until 2007. Its colourful crest is used to decorate caps. Though hunting the monal was banned in Himachal in 1982, there has been a little check on its poaching and its plumes are smuggled in the market. Wearing a cap with a monal crest is a tradition in the upper reaches of Himachal. Such caps used to be gifted on auspicious occasions, particularly weddings. The state forest department has banned wearing such caps and the offence is punishable with seven-year imprisonment or ₹10,000 fine or both. On June 22, a taxi driver headed for Una was arrested with more than 4kg of pangolin scales at Jhiralri village in Bhoranj, Hamirpur on June 22. The demand for pangolin scales is mainly in China and Vietnam, where they are used in traditional medicine. The pangolin is also a protected animal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/poaching-picks-up-during-pandemic-in-himachal-101624533886946.html

24-06-2021||Pune||Taste of Life: A kitâb that opens to the era of Anglo-Indian khána||When Constance E Gordon wrote her cookbook “Anglo – Indian Cuisine (Khána Kitâb)”, she lived in Poona, somewhere near the Empress Garden. Her husband worked with the Revenue Department. The first edition of her book was published sometime around 1904 by Thacker, Spink & Co, Calcutta. When the second, revised edition appeared in 1913, she had started living in Bombay. The first edition of her cookbook was received with great enthusiasm, and that encouraged her to publish the second edition with many new recipes, she noted in the preface of the new edition. “Each recipe has been tried and found successful, either by myself or friends, by whom many have been contributed. So Khána Kitâb goes again on to the market with the desire of being useful and making new friends, while retaining the old one”, she added.The term “Anglo-Indian” in the title of the cookbook refers to the people of British descent born or residing in India. The cookbook has some wonderful recipes like Greengages in Cream, Fairy Pudding, Jam Omelet, Damson Tart with Cream, Cutlets à la Russe, Chicken à la Pendennis, Banana Charlotte, Partridge à la Raja. It also has recipes like Bhendi Toast, Boiled Surmai with Shrimp Sauce and Hilsa Sandwich. It is noteworthy that she uses native names for some ingredients and dishes. Boiled dahl, for example.Anglo-Indians came from different dietary occupational backgrounds, from the Armed forces, administration and commerce, and different classes with different dietary habits. The natives were from different castes and classes, with different dietary practices, and these influenced the food practices of Anglo-Indians. Thus, the colonial, or Anglo-Indian, cuisine was a hybrid cuisine with some elements of British foodways and components of foodways from the colonies. The cuisine that was adopted by the majority of the British in India was replete with peculiarities and idiosyncrasies that evolved over the decades and was influenced by various factors, such as the availability of European and local food, cooking facilities, inputs by domestic cooks, and traditions from the home country as well as India.Gordon’s cookbook reflects the beauty of the hybrid cuisine. She has included more than 250 recipes which have been divided into different sections. There’s Tiffin and recipes for breakfast. There’s a section for chutneys and curries. Then there are recipes for cold meat, soups, fresh and tinned fish, entrées, joints, toasts and savouries, puddings and sweets, dessert, confectionery and jam, eggs, salads, savoury sandwiches, savoury farinaceous, tinned food for camp cooking, sauces, pickles, and forcemeats. There is a separate section for vegetarian recipes and dishes for invalids. There are recipes for “Dinner in Camp”, “Tiffin in the Jungle” and “Breakfast at Home”.The cookbook has a section about Indian money. Another section educates its readers about the boiling points of fat and oil. There’s a glossary of Indian terms for provisions. There’s a “Bachelor’s store list for a month”, and there is a section about the “Indian Kitchen”. There is a chapter detailing the wages and work of the “principal servants”. “Owing to the difference in caste among the native servants of India, conditions are not the same on the Bombay and Poona side to those existing in the Bengal Presidency; as a rule more servants are required there”, Gordon notes. She then goes on to elaborate the role of “The Butler”, “The Hamal”, “Cook” and “Coolie”.“The butler should wait at the table; look after the household linen, silver, wine and servants. He is responsible for breakage, cleanliness of the servants’ quarters, and the proper working of the house. Wages for a servant, for a married couple, from Rs. 12 to 25; for a bachelor, from Rs. 10 to 20”, Gordon tells her readers. According to her, “The Hamal in Bombay and Poona is chambermaid and housemaid in one. He washes up the dishes and sees to lamps.” The cook cooks and “does the marketing”. He should be paid from Rs. 14 to 30. “The Coolie” carries the cook’s bazaar and should be paid Rs. 6 to 10 per month.Gordon tells us that a Khitmatgar, Masalchi, Bearer, Mehter were employed along with the butler, cook, and the hamal in the Bengal Presidency. “But these are not needed in Bombay and Poona”, she writes.Gordon’s cookbook is one of the thousands of cookbooks written in the nineteenth and twentieth century by European men and women to assist the colonisers living in the colonies. These publications were meant to be instruments for perpetuating the values and representations of the Empire. Publication of cookbooks and manuals gained momentum between the 1880s and 1920s and was aimed at the second generation of middle-class British women who resided in India after the uprising of 1857. The cookbooks tried to consolidate imperial domesticity and British confidence in imperial rule and its reproduction on a household scale. Raj-era cookbooks bristled with instructions on how to run a household, manage “servants” and prepare and serve food. These cookbooks prescribed codes of conduct that defined the boundaries between British rulers and natives. They also served as reference manuals on how to deal with native servants.The authors of these cookbooks took it upon themselves to educate colonial householders on the unsavoury character of the native “servants” and suggest appropriate behaviour to foil their dishonesty and unhygienic habits.They often carried lists of items with their prices in the local markets “with the hope that it will generally assist to combat the pernicious policy of the native cooks who not only overcharge in the prices of local commodities, but generally will not produce them or attempt to raise non-existent difficulties”, as author WE Kinsey noted in the preface of her cookbook “The Mem’s own cookery book”.Gordon’s cookbook too carries a list of commodities available in the markets of Bombay, Calcutta, and Poona. It tells us about the meats, vegetables, fruits, and other provisions available in the markets of Poona Camp. But the most fascinating aspect of the cookbook is that it also provides a list of commodities, along with the prices of course, available in the markets of Poona city.More about this next week.Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast.

Vikas Bahuguna, counsel of the petitioner, said Justice NS Dhanik, who heard the matter, has directed the owners of Lalchandani Labs to appear before an investigating officer on June 26 and cooperate in the ongoing probe.On Wednesday, the court had granted temporary protection from arbitrary arrest to the owners of Noida-based Max Corporate Services and Hisar-based Nalwa Labs, and directed them to appear before an investigating officer on Friday and cooperate in the probe. Also Read | U’khand fake testing: Firms get temporary reliefBahuguna said the interim relief has been granted in view of the Supreme Court judgement in the case of Arnesh Kumar vs State of Bihar. The 2014 Arnesh Kumar judgment required the police to conduct a preliminary probe before making arrests where offences were punishable with imprisonment for less than seven years. Under these guidelines, a police officer has to record reasons for an arrest in writing and it can be done only if it fulfils certain conditions.Owners of Lalchandani Labs, Nalwa Labs and private agency Max Corporate Services were booked under sections of the Indian Penal Code, Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act last week. Days later, all three firms approached the high court separately to quash the FIR. At present, there are three separate probes into the issue: one by the police, one by the district administration and one by the mela administration. On June 21, a criminal writ petition was filed by Lalchandani Labs Ltd through Anchal Gupta, one of the directors of the private lab, four days after a case was filed against it by Haridwar police. Bahuguna said, “Lalchandani Labs signed a MoU with Max Corporate Services on March 10 in which it was agreed that the lab would conduct RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests at Haridwar Kumbh Mela. It conducted only 12,000 rapid antigen tests and no RT-PCR test between April 1 and 26. The labs conducted tests at a nominal ₹206 per test and the total bill for these tests was around ₹24.74 lakh and not crores of rupees as reported by media. The Kumbh mela was curtailed this year but devotees thronged Haridwar for months despite experts saying the crowds and rampant violation of Covid protocol could spark a surge in infections. Roughly 9.1 million pilgrims took the holy dip in the Ganga from January 14 to April 27. The bulk of this -- at least six million people -- congregated in April, coinciding with the worst surge in the second wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/ukhand-fake-testing-hc-grants-diagnostic-lab-owners-interim-relief-from-arrest-101624531546673.html
24-06-2021||Lucknow||Ahead of 2022 assembly polls, parties begin electoral activity from eastern UP||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has held over 40 meetings in Varanasi and other eastern Uttar Pradesh districts in the last 50 days even as the party has asked its workers to apprise the people about the Centre and state government’s welfare schemes. Samajwadi Party (SP), which is hoping to return to power in Uttar Pradesh, has organised around 20 meetings in Varanasi and adjoining areas alone as political parties have kicked off their electoral activities from the state’s eastern region ahead of the assembly elections early next year.The BJP won 34 seats, Apna Dal (S) four, Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) three, SP 12 seats, and Bahujan Samaj Party seven of the 61 assembly seats in eastern Uttar Pradesh in 2017. With 312 seats in the 403-member House, the BJP swept to power in the state over four years back. The Congress managed to win just seven seats, BSP 19, SP 47 in the 2017 polls.Also Read | Priyanka Gandhi urges UP govt to extend date to purchase maximum wheatSP leader Ashutosh Sinha said he has held meetings with party workers in Varanasi, Jaunpur, Sonbhadra, Ghazipur, and Chandauli to mobilise them for the 2022 election. He added he has also met Zilla Parishad heads in these districts. “Several meetings have also been held in Ballia, Azamgarh, Bhadohi, and Mirzapur.”Leaders of BJP, Apna Dal, SBSP, and others smaller parties too said they have been holding meetings in the region, where Other Backward Class (OBC) and Scheduled Caste (SC) voters play a decisive role in over 50 of the seats across 10 districts. Political experts say OBCs and Dalits account for around 60% of the population in the region and every political party is trying to win their support.Satish Kumar, a political analyst, said political parties are trying to expand their base and focussing on OBCs and SCs. He added the social coalition that the BJP was able to form before the 2017 assembly election has not remained intact. Kumar said the SP, which enjoys strong support in the region, will certainly take advantage of this. He added anti-incumbency and differences between parties such as SBSP and the BJP will also benefit SP.Banaras Hindu University faculty of social sciences dean Kaushal Kishore Mishra said eastern Uttar Pradesh has always been politically crucial, but its significance has increased since Varanasi has been Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency since 2014. He added smaller parties are focussing on eastern Uttar Pradesh to increase their bargaining power even though the elections are over seven months away. Mishra said some of these smaller parties have influence in five to 10 seats due to the support from their castes. “Others have influence in 10 to 20 seats. Though these political parties cannot win elections on their own, they could spoil the chances of candidates of major political parties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ahead-of-2022-assembly-polls-parties-begin-electoral-activity-from-eastern-up-101624530046788.html
24-06-2021||Patna||Bihar candidate’s admit card with Telugu female actor’s photo goes viral||The Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) is being ridiculed on social media for issuing a male candidate a score sheet with the picture of a south Indian female actor while also battling allegations of irregularities in the Secondary Teachers’ Eligibility Test (STET) merit list.A Jehanabad based candidate Rishikesh Kumar was declared qualified in the teachers’ recruitment examination but excluded from the merit list like hundreds of other candidates, who have questioned the board’s criteria for compiling the merit list, leaving out successful candidates. The apparent irregularity in the merit list is not Kumar’s only problem, he was also issued a result sheet attached with a photograph of Telugu and Malayalam actress Anupama Parameswaran, making the social media go crazy over the state education department’s carelessness.BSEB released STET 2019 results for recruitment of 12 subjects’ teachers on March 12 and pending results for three subjects’ teachers of Urdu, Sanskrit and Social Science on June 21.Kumar said he had registered a complaint with the board last year for inserting the female actor’s photograph in his admit card and also sought photo correction in January last year, however, it was clear that it didn’t work. When approached by HT, he refused to talk on the issue.A senior BSEB official said, “We are looking into the matter. It seems the error was committed by the computer operator.”When asked how the student made through verification and frisking at the exam centre with a wrong photograph on the admit card, the official said, “The board instructs all candidates to carry their photo-attached identity proof like Aadhar card, driving licence, bank passbook, passport etc at exam centres. In case of any mistake or mismatch, we allow students to take the exam after verifying their details.”Despite several attempts, BSEB’s chairman Anand Kishor could not be reached for comment on this issue.247,000 students took the STET 2019 exam across 317 exam centres on January 28 last year after a gap of nearly eight years for recruitment to 37,000 secondary and senior secondary teachers’ posts across the state. However, the exam was declared void in May following paper leak and re-examination was conducted in September through online mode.Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Thursday took a jibe at Nitish Kumar government on twitter. “After Sunny Leone topped in the junior engineering exam, now Anupama Parameswaran has passed the state STET exam. With scam in every exam and recruitment process, Nitish ji is destroying the future of millions of youth. He takes one decade to complete one recruitment process that is too riddled with scam” he tweeted, referring to the 2019 incident when Bollywood actor Sunny Leone was incorrectly named the topper in the draft merit list for the post of junior engineers, released by Bihar Public Health Engineering Department (PHED).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-candidate-s-admit-card-with-telugu-female-actor-s-photo-goes-viral-101624529086518.html

If buying wheat from all the farmers was not rhetoric, then the BJP government should ensure maximum purchase by extending the date of procurement. Or else, during the rainy season the wheat procured from farmers will be wasted."Her remarks came two days after she wrote to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath urging a guaranteed wheat procurement from farmers in the state.She has sought the opening of all purchase centres in the state by July 15 and ensuring maximum purchase from farmers.The Congress leader claims that in states like Punjab and Haryana, the government procurement of wheat accounts for 80-85 per cent of the total production, while in Uttar Pradesh, only 14 per cent of the 378 lakh metric tonnes of wheat produced has been procured by the government centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/priyanka-gandhi-urges-up-govt-to-extend-date-to-purchase-maximum-wheat-101624521474223.html

24-06-2021||Bhopal||5 cases of Covid-19 'Delta Plus' variant in Madhya Pradesh; one dead||Five persons have so far been found infected with the 'Delta Plus' variant of coronavirus in Madhya Pradesh and one of them has died, state Medical Education Minister Vishwas Sarang said on Thursday. The other four persons, who were vaccinated against Covid-19, are fine, he told PTI. "One person from Ujjain, who died, was not inoculated,” he said. 'Delta Plus' has been declared a variant of concern by the Centre. So far, three persons from Bhopal and two from Ujjain have been found infected with the 'Delta Plus' variant in MP, the minister said. A genome sequencing machine will soon be installed in Bhopal and the state would then not have to send samples to Delhi, he added. Ujjain Collector Ashish Singh confirmed that a 59-year-old woman, who died of Covid-19 on May 23, was infected with the 'Delta Plus' variant. She tested positive for coronavirus on May 17. Later, her sample was sent for genome sequencing. On Tuesday, it was found that she was infected by the 'Delta Plus' variant, the official said. Earlier, the sample of a 65-year-old woman from Bhopal was sent to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on May 23 and it came out positive for the 'Delta Plus' variant on June 16, officials said. The woman, who had received both doses of the anti-Covid-19 vaccine, recovered in home isolation, they said. The new 'Delta Plus' variant has been formed due to a mutation in the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant, first identified in India and one of the drivers of the deadly second wave. Though there is no indication yet of the severity of the disease due to the new variant, 'Delta Plus' is resistant to the monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment for Covid-19 recently authorised in India.On Wednesday, Madhya Pradesh recorded 84 new cases of coronavirus and 21 fatalities, raising the tally of infections in the state to 7,89,499 and the death toll to 8,827, as per official data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/5-cases-of-covid-19-delta-plus-variant-in-madhya-pradesh-one-dead-101624520896042.html

24-06-2021||Patna||Bihar govt vows to solve anomalies in secondary teachers’ merit list in 2 days||Bihar education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary has promised to resolve suspected anomalies in the result of qualifying examination to recruit secondary teachers in the state, conducted in 2020, following Wednesday protests in Patna by several candidates alleging irregularities in the merit list.“We are looking into the matter to sort out all confusions. Candidates need not worry. The department will take [a] decision in view of candidates’ welfare”, Chaudhary promised on Wednesday late evening. The Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) conducted Secondary Teachers’ Eligibility Test (STET) 2019 through online mode in September last year and results for 12 subjects were published on March 12, followed by results of three other subjects on June 21. As per the education department, 24,599 candidates qualified for 30,337 vacant seats in 12 subjects while 6,077 candidates qualified for 7,110 vacant seats for Urdu, Sanskrit and Science.However, candidates claim that around 35-45% examinees who were declared to have passed were not included in the published merit list.For instance, a candidate who obtained 86.81/150 marks in social science is left out from the merit list, but another candidate of same gender, category and subject was awarded 566th rank in the merit list despite having scored 83.26 marks.Deepankar Gaurav, state president of B.Ed. Qualified Candidates Struggle Committee, said, “The education department results show 24,598 candidates were selected for recruitment. However, hundreds of these have been thrown [out] of the merit list. We want to know who all have replaced the genuinely qualified candidates.”“As per our sample survey, around 35% to 45% qualified students have been thrown out of the merit list,” Gaurav added.He demanded that the criteria for compiling the merit list and the cut-off marks were disclosed for full transparency and said his group will likely move Patna high court against BSEB. Roopa Kumari, a protestor, said, “The state govt is playing with our future. BSEB conducted the STET exam after a gap of eight years and we waited for results for two years. Now, we have been denied jobs without any valid reason.” Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary of the education department, said, “A four-member committee has been constituted to look into the matter. The committee will submit a report after completion of the probe. We hope to sort out the matter in two days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-vows-to-solve-anomalies-in-secondary-teachers-merit-list-in-2-days-101624510485732.html

Twelve of the 13 independent MLAs in the Rajasthan government said at a press conference after their meeting that the decision to make changes in the Cabinet and political appointments were the prerogative of the CM. Pressurising him was not in the interest of the people of the Rajasthan, they said.After holding an all independent MLAs meet at Circuit House on Wednesday, independent MLA from Sirohi, Sanyam Lodha said, “We urge the state government to fill vacant posts of patwari and gram sewak; and regularise contractual employees. We request all non-BJP parties to unite and protest against the GoI over inflation, increasing petrol-diesel prices and demand the PM fill 1.5 million vacant posts.” Also Read | 15 Raj Congress leaders flag turncoats’ influence in state unit to Sonia Gandhi“We express full faith in CM Ashok Gehlot. When the Cabinet expansion happens, who all are to be included is the prerogative of the CM - pressurising him is not in the interest of the people of the state,” said Lodha.“In and outside the assembly, we have strengthened the government. It is our primary duty to give stable government to the state, which we all Independent legislators are doing it,” he said. Asked whether he thought efforts were being made to topple the government, Lodha said, “It is an imaginary question but if this happens then we will give a befitting reply. This is not Karnataka and it is not Madhya Pradesh.” He added that all are aware how the governments were toppled in MP, Goa, and Karnataka, but it was all because of Gehlot’s leadership that the effort failed in Rajasthan. The independent MLAs’ meeting was held days after the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLAs who merged with the Congress in 2019 objected to any move by the Congress high command to pacify the Pilot camp, saying it was because of them the government was in a deep crisis last year. In Rajasthan, Congress leader Sachin Pilot and chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s factions have been sparring against each other for a fortnight over Cabinet expansion and political appointments. Meanwhile, 15 Congress leaders, who lost the assembly elections in 2018, have written to party president Sonia Gandhi about the undue influence of BSP-turned-Congress MLAs and independents in the state government, as the political turmoil in the Rajasthan Congress continues to intensify.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/cabinet-expansion-rajasthan-cm-s-prerogative-independent-mlas-support-gehlot-101624508505540.html

There’s a need for good roads to provide tourists a smooth and safe journey to the tourist destinations. For this, we need financial support,” Bihar road construction minister Nitin Navin said about his Wednesday meeting with minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Singh Thakur in Delhi.Bihar is home to a number of monuments and sites related to Lord Buddha, frequented by foreign and domestic tourists and the government aims to connect all major Buddhist sites in the state-- Stupa at Vaishali, ancient university remains at Nalanda, the Rajgir sites, Mahabodhi temple at Bodh Gaya, Kesaria Stupa and Ashokan pillars at Lauriya Nandangarh and Rampurva in Champaran--and Kapilvastu in Uttar Pradesh.The road construction minister said that department will soon be preparing a preliminary project report (PPR). “The number of sites which can be covered in this corridor and the feasibility of their road connectivity will be reviewed in the PPR. Once it will be okayed, we will get the detailed project report (DPR) prepared,” he said. The estimated cost of the project will depend on the length of the network of roads, he added. Navin said it will be better if the project gets financial aid from some foreign funding agency. “We have suggested a few names such as JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) in this regard,” he said and added that Thakur assured him of all possible help. “He also asked us to submit the detailed project report (DPR) of the proposal”.The Bihar minister said the state will soon also start working on development of roads at non-Buddhist heritage sites and shrines. ‘We have many sites related to Lord Buddha and Goddess Sita, covered under the Ramayan circuit and the Jain sites. We will work over these in the next phase,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-asks-centre-to-help-generate-funds-for-heritage-corridor-101624507545588.html

Bubu Konwar, 43, was responsible for many car thefts, drug dealing, extortion, kidnapping for ransom etc., and had 50 cases registered against him in several districts of the state. “One veteran criminal, Bubu Konwar, has been grievously injured in exchange of fire with police at Geleky in Sibsagar when he targeted the police team. He has been taken to hospital. One pistol has been recovered from his possession,” special DGP GP Singh tweeted on Wednesday night. “Bubu Konwar succumbed to his injuries and was declared dead at Geleky civil hospital,” he added later. Also Read | Assam NGO files FIR against former NRC coordinator Prateek HajelaAccording to police, the incident took place when Konwar, who was on a scooter with an associate, tried to flee a police check and fired at the personnel. His associate managed to escape. Konwar was arrested in March this year at Jorhat and 35 grams of suspected brown sugar was recovered from him but he managed to get out on bail. He was earlier arrested in November, 2016 in connection with a car theft. That’s when he admitted in front of TV cameras that he was a contract killer and had killed 42 people in exchange for money. Konwar, who began with petty thefts and robberies when he was 16, took to stealing cars, murders, kidnappings and extortion. He was arrested on several occasions but managed to get bail.

24-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A migrant in the city||Young people get restless in villages as soon as they realise life is elsewhere. They leave their homes, move to big cities full of rumoured possibilities, and build a new life.This is the way of the world.Shivnath Verma, too, moved to Delhi three years ago from his village in Pratapgarh, UP. But his hair is grey, his forehead is creased with lines, his figure frail. This afternoon he’s selling channas from a small plastic tub, here in a central Delhi lane.What might his age be?Mr Verma moves to the side of the lane crowded with pedestrians. He takes out a purple cloth pouch tucked in a hidden pocket of his track pants, and shows a laminated card. That’s his government-issued identity, his Aadhaar card, which says he was born in 1956.“You can calculate my age from this card,” he says solemnly.Usually, 65-year-old men prefer to stay at or near their home, wherever that may be. Mr Verma not only left his village—for the first time—but he left on his own too. “I live alone near the dhobhi ghat, in Kalyan Puri.”He eats in the dhabas and sleeps on the footpath, he says.“I helped raise my two brothers. They live with their families in the village. I never married.”Mr Verma willingly explains his reasons for leaving the house at such an advanced age, but feels that the details are too private, and requests them not be shared with the world.At one point during this tête-à-tête, a passerby stops and purchases a sachet of channa for ₹10. Each packet carries a fistful of these snacks. Every morning Mr Verma buys dozens of sachets from a shopkeeper, which he hawks in the city lanes. Each new day he walks in a different locality. “I make about ₹200 daily.”Mr Verma hasn’t made any friend in the city. “I don’t know anybody well.” Tucking back into his pants the pouch he sewed himself, he mutters in a low voice that “Dilli doesn’t have a shortage of thieves.”He now walks away, his arms holding the tub as if he were carrying a tray of finger food in a banquet. It is actually hanging from his neck by an elastic string. Mr Verma starts his workday in the afternoon, and returns to his footpath by 7 in the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-migrant-in-the-city-101624488521512.html
24-06-2021||Delhi||Man gets bail, asked to maintain peace in area||A Delhi court on Wednesday granted bail to an accused in a murder case related to the north-east Delhi riots and, as a condition, directed him to maintain peace and harmony in the locality.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav allowed the bail plea of Irshad, accused of killing 24-year-old Salman during the communal riots last year.Salman suffered a gunshot injury on February 24 during the riots in Shiv Vihar. According to the police, Irshad was present at crime scene and was seen leading a riotous mob, a claim refuted by the accused.Granting relief to Irshad, the judge noted that the prosecution prima facie failed to establish that his role was not similar to that of co-accused Mohd Furkan who was granted bail on June 15, 2021.The judge granted bail on a personal bond of ₹10,000 and surety of like amount. The court also directed Irshad not to tamper with the evidence or influence any witness, maintain peace and harmony in the locality and appear before it to attend proceedings.Prior to this, two bail applications of Irshad were dismissed on November 19, 2020, and April 8, 2021.Irshad, who is also facing charges of conspiracy and rioting besides murder, was in judicial custody since April 2 last year.Special public prosecutor Manoj Chaudhary, representing police, told the court that Salman was attacked by a riotous mob solely on the premise that “he happened to be from a different community”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-gets-bail-asked-to-maintain-peace-in-area-101624488347310.html
24-06-2021||Delhi||Vehicle dealers to issue registration certificates||The Delhi government has empowered self-registered vehicle dealers in Delhi to issue temporary registration certificates to owners who buy a new car or two-wheelers from their outlets but live outside the national capital.Senior transport officials said the plan in the coming months is to completely decentralise the process of issuing registration certificates so that vehicle owners do not have to visit a regional transport office (RTO) to get them.In an order passed on Tuesday night, the state transport department said the temporary registration certificates to be issued by the dealers will be valid for a month. “Self-registration dealers in Delhi can now issue temporary registration certificate for vehicles sold from their outlet, along with a unique registration mark listed under Rule 34 of Delhi Motor Vehicles Rules (DMVR). The dealers will be allocated blocks of registration marks for issuing registration certificates,” said transport minister Kailash Gahlot.The order, seen by HT, stated that the temporary registration mark in red letters and figure on yellow background will be displayed on the vehicle in a prescribed manner. The designation and address of the dealer will be also cited on the registration plate, it said.Currently, those who buy a new vehicle need to simultaneously visit an RTO to get a temporary registration certificate issued by the motor licensing officer (MLO).The state transport department is running a pilot project in three RTOs — New Delhi, Sarai Kale Khan, and Mall Road — to decentralise issuing registration certificate. “The next step will be to issue permanent registration cards directly from the dealers. So, there will be no need to visit an RTO,” said Gahlot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vehicle-dealers-to-issue-registration-certificates-101624488142829.html
24-06-2021||Delhi||Cut short by fourth wave, Delhi’s latest sero study offers few clues||Over 56% of those sampled during Delhi’s truncated sixth serological survey, in April, were found to have antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 virus, a proportion nearly identical to the study conducted in January, said senior state government officials.The report, submitted to the government last Monday, hasn’t officially been released and holds little epidemiological value since less than half of the planned sampling actually took place, and the serological prevalence triggered by the fourth wave would only be detectable much later.The survey was conducted from April 12 and only 13,000 of the 28,000 planned samples were taken. The Capital entered its fourth wave of infections in late March, and the surge peaked around a month later. These people are likely to develop detectable IgG antibodies only weeks after their infection.The report, by researchers from Maulana Azad Medical College, also suggests that the next sero survey be conducted in end-June or early-July to capture the fourth wave exposure. At its peak, Delhi recorded 28,000 cases in the third week of April.During the April round, samples were collected from only 141 of Delhi’s 272 wards. “The survey had to be stopped midway because cases started rising and a lockdown was implemented. Now, the samples that were collected during the five or six days that the survey was carried out are being analysed,” a Delhi government official told HT earlier.The reports of the antibody testing are yet to be shared with the study participants.“The dates for the next round of sero survey haven’t been confirmed yet,” said an official from Delhi’s health department.“The seroprevalence remained the same because there were hardly any Covid-19 cases in January and February. The cases started going up in April, while the survey was being conducted. Even if those who had the infection then were samples, they would not have developed the antibodies,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine.When the first sero survey was conduced in June-end last year, 22.6% of the 21,000 people sampled had antibodies. This rose to 29.1% of the 15,000 people sampled in August, and then dropped to 25.1% among the 17,000 sampled in September (due to a change in methodology and dropping antibody levels in the population, the researchers said). In October, it went up to 25.5% in a sample size of 15,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cut-short-by-fourth-wave-delhi-s-latest-sero-study-offers-few-clues-101624486972183.html
24-06-2021||Delhi||Only 4% reserved beds occupied as active cases drop||Amid a sharp fall in the Covid-19 caseload, only 4% of hospital beds in the national capital reserved for the treatment of Covid-19 patients were occupied as on Wednesday evening, in stark contrast to the situation in early May, when facilities were packed, and medical equipment was in short supply as Delhi battled a fourth wave of infections.However, several of these hospitals, said they have started admitting patients facing post-Covid complications, as well as those whose non-Covid procedures were delayed.The state government’s Delhi Corona app at 8pm on Wednesday showed that nearly all isolation, oxygen, and intensive care unit (ICU) beds reserved in city hospitals are empty. Of the 27,246 total beds across hospitals and makeshift facilities, only 1,193 were in use on Wednesday evening, showed the portal.“There are several non-Covid patients whose surgeries were delayed when cases began surging in April. These are not emergency procedures, but they are urgent. Some planned surgeries have also started,” said an official from one of Delhi’s major private hospitals who asked not to be named. The official, however, said the allocated number of beds would be made available for Covid-19 patients if cases start rising again.“We just have seven Covid-19 patients at the moment and there are so many others who need attention. So, we are admitting other patients except for one ward,” said an official at another private hospital.An official at a third hospital said, “Once the Covid-19 cases subsided, there were several people who started coming in with complications arising from the disease, such as lung problems or secondary infections. These patients were also admitted on the Covid-19 beds. Barring some wards, the rest are being used to treat non-Covid patients now.”As cases in April began to gallop amid the city’s fourth wave of infections, the Delhi government reserved close to 80% beds across hospitals in city, with some government hospitals being converted entirely to Covid-19 treatment centres. There has been no de-escalation order since.At its peak, Delhi saw over 20,000 hospital admissions at a time, with the city completely running out of ICU beds towards the end of April, even as medical oxygen supplies fell short. More beds were added, while some were set up in temporary structures, after oxygen shortages eased in May.“There has been no order of de-escalation of facilities. Hospitals do have some beds to treat non-Covid patients and can take in some extra patients as well in cases of emergency. So if non-Covid patients are taking up 22% of the beds instead of the allocated 20%, then it’s alright. But, if they are deliberately taking in patients on reserved beds, that shouldn’t be done,” said a senior Delhi government official.Delhi government-run hospitals continue to keep beds reserved for Covid-19 patients as the government prepares for another potential wave of infections, and is getting facilities ready to handle 37,000 to 45,000 new cases a day.As for makeshift facilities, such as the one at the Ramlila Maidan attached to Lok Nayak hospital, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said, “We are de-escalating, but everything will be kept on standby in case the cases start increasing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/only-4-reserved-beds-occupied-as-active-cases-drop-101624485379680.html

Reason: Students who have not deposited the fee will not be allowed to appear in the exams, starting June 28.Though the university had set May 25 as the last date for depositing the fee, the deadline was extended till June 1, without late fee, for the benefit of such students.A majority of the students, who have not paid their fee until now, said that there are financial constraints at home due to the pandemic. There were also a few students who said that they were unaware that they had to pay the college examination fee as the same was not communicated them during online classes.At Satish Chander Dhawan Government College, over 200 students of different classes have not deposited the examination fee. College authorities stated that they had sent several reminders to the students to deposit the fee and then displayed the list of students who had not paid the examination fee on the notice board of the college. For the last one week, many students have been making rounds of the college to get the late fee charges waived. The college principal has stated that this can be done by the university and they have given enough time to students to deposit the examination fee.Over 20 students of Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Commerce, BSc first and second year visited the college and were guided to visit the university to get the late fee charges waived off. After depositing the examination fee and getting approval from the varsity, the students can appear in the online exam.Gurjant Singh, a BA second semester student, said, “My father drives a school bus and is out of work for the last year and a half. Besides, the college has been closed since then. I was not aware of the last date of fee deposit and my father was trying to arrange the fee amount. But with the late payment charges, I now have to pay ₹22,000. I will visit the university tomorrow to request them to waive the late payment charges.” Amandeep Singh, a BSc second semester student, said, “Due to financial issues at home, I was unable to deposit the fee and now I have been asked to pay the fee with late payment charges which will cost ₹24,000. Due to Covid-19 crisis, my parents were unable to deposit ₹1,500 earlier and now it is not possible to pay the fee with late payment charges. I will not be allowed to sit in the final exam.”College principal Gurpreet Kaur, said, “We had informed the students to deposit the examination fee. Repeated reminders were sent but despite that, many of them have not deposited the fee. We have sent a letter to the varsity and recommended the names of the students for fee waiver.” At Government College for Girls, over 55 to 60 students have not deposited the examination fee. As per the college authorities, messages were sent to students every week to deposit the examination fee. Sukhwinder Kaur, principal, said, “We have given enough time to students to deposit the fee and several reminders were also given. This shows the students’ non-serious attitude.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-days-before-exam-students-of-pu-affiliated-colleges-dash-to-deposit-fee-101624481324651.html

Now, they can engage a scribe with higher qualification if the examination conducting agency fails to provide one. Ajai Srivastava, expert member of HP State Advisory Board on disability and chairperson of Umang Foundation had raised this issue with the chief minister Jai Ram Thakur. He had urged him to ensure the compliance with a judgment of Delhi High Court and the directions of central ministry of social justice and empowerment, besides the UGC.He said that the department of social justice and empowerment had notified the old set of guidelines issued by the central government for the conduct of examinations for the visually impaired and other candidates who cannot write due to disability. In these guidelines it was made mandatory for the eligible examinees to bring a scribe “one step junior” in qualification. But the Delhi High Court had directed the union ministry for social justice and empowerment, and UGC that if the examination conducting agency fails to provide the scribe, the candidates may bring their own scribe and no criteria of educational qualification of such scribes shall be fixed. This direction was to be complied with across the country through union ministry of social justice and empowerment, UGC and other ministries in all academic and competitive examinations, including for jobs. The state government had issued the guidelines by ignoring the directions of the court and central government. When this matter was raised before the chief minister by Umang Foundation, the additional chief secretary (SJ&E) Sanjay Gupta immediately issued the new guidelines as per the directions of the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hp-allows-visually-impaired-students-to-rope-in-scribe-if-exam-agency-fails-to-provide-one-101624481024268.html

We will convey everything, including the provisions that had been granted to us in the Constitution of India, everything regarding Articles 35 A and 370, and how the historic state was divided in an act of injustice to the people of J&K. We want that back and the same will be conveyed to the PM.Do you think more parties of alliance should have been invited?It wasn’t our choice. We would have wanted all constituents of the PAGD in the meeting. Even other political groups like that of Hakeem Yaseen and others, which aren’t part of the PAGD, should have been invited. All those from the alliance who got an invitation will go and forcefully talk about issues. For us, it’s an opportunity to put our point of view at the highest level.Are you optimistic about the meeting with PM?I don’t know. We all have kept our fingers crossed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/its-an-opportunity-to-present-our-viewpoint-my-tarigami-101624480245194.html

24-06-2021||Chandigarh||Delimitation exercise: Poll panel holds meeting with deputy magistrates of J&K||Amid heightened political activity in Jammu and Kashmir ahead of PM’s all-party meet on Thursday, the election commission on Wednesday held deliberations with all 20 deputy magistrates of the UT via videoconferencing. “It asked basic statistics like population, number of constituencies, patwar and halqas, geographical boundaries and topography,” said one of the deputy magistrates. Political analysts feel that the exercise could be a precursor to the much-awaited resumption of political activities leading to the maiden assembly elections ever since the state of J&K was divested of its special status on August 5, 2019 and bifurcated into two UTs. Professor Rekha Choudhary, former head of political sciences department at Jammu University, said, “Holding the all-party meet is a very good decision. I see it as a precursor to revival of political activity leading to the maiden assembly elections. Secondly, the forum could also be used to discuss restoration of statehood, an emotional issue for both Jammu and Kashmir regions, to which BJP government has also given its commitment. Thirdly and most importantly, Kashmir-centric parties are still reluctant on delimitation exercise. Though of late there were ample feelers from them to be a part of the delimitation exercise, the consensus still eludes the panel. I think the issue may figure at the forum.” She, however, said that she didn’t see any remote possibility of all-party meet discussing Article 370 and 35-A because “they were the core ideological issues for the BJP.” In July last year, the delimitation panel had sought substantial information from J&K administration in various formats like maps, statistics, Census 2011 figures, new tehsils, patwars and halqas. Union law ministry has constituted a delimitation commission headed by former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai to redraw Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies of the UT of Jammu and Kashmir. Election commissioner Sushil Chandra and election commissioners of J&K besides four states are ex-officio members of the panel. All five Lok Sabha MPs from Jammu and Kashmir – Farooq Abdullah, Hasnain Masoodi and Muhammad Akbar Lone from the National Conference and Jitendra Singh and Jugal Kishore from the BJP – have been nominated as ‘associate members’ of the commission to assist it in redrawing parliamentary and assembly constituencies. According to Section 60 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, the number of seats in the legislative assembly of the UT of Jammu and Kashmir will be increased from 107 to 114. Out of these, 24 seats are in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The constituencies in the erstwhile state were last delimited in 1995 and the state assembly had then unanimously agreed upon putting freeze on any such exercise till 2026. As per Census 2011, Jammu and Kashmir had a population of 12,541,302. The erstwhile state of J&K that comprised Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh regions had six Lok Sabha seats — one in Ladakh, two in Jammu and three in Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/delimitation-exercise-poll-panel-holds-meeting-with-deputy-magistrates-of-jk-101624479884212.html

24-06-2021||Chandigarh||PSPCL buys power from grid as Talwandi Sabo plant unit shut down||A unit of the Talwandi Sabo thermal power plant in Bathinda district has gone out of operation, forcing the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to purchase electricity from the grid. Corporation chairman and managing director (CMD) A Venu Prasad said the power utility has purchased 879 megawatt (MW) electricity from the power grid at the rate of ₹3.85 per unit to meet the increased demand in the state due to hot summers and the ongoing paddy sowing season. The PSPCL has made arrangements to meet the demand up to 13,700 MW, it s learnt. The out-of-operation unit of the Talwandi Sabo plant has a capacity of generating 615 MW power. “Presently, the power generation from interstate stations is about 600-700 MW less when compared to the last year due to low hydro potential and non-supply of 400MW power from four thermal units of the Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd (CGPL), Mundra. This deficit is being arranged by procuring power on a day-to-day basis from the exchange,” Prasad said. The PSPCL catered to the current paddy season’s highest power demand of 12,805 MW and recorded consumption of 2,901 lakh units on June 22. Prasad said the demand is expected to rise further in the coming week.“Last year, the maximum demand and consumption were at 12,683 MW and 2,822 lakh units in June. However, the highest ever consumption of 3,018 lakh units was recorded in July 2020. The highest ever demand of 13,606 MW was recorded in July 2019,” he added. The PSPCL has operationalised all the four units of the Lehra Mohabbat plant, three units of the Ropar plant and all the units of private plant. Nearly 850 MW power is being contributed by hydel power stations of PSPCL.A power engineer said during most of the season PSPCL pay fixed costs to the Talwani Sabo plants but when power is needed, it develops snags. “Earlier also, the plant had remained out of operation due to technical problems. This needs to be checked,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pspcl-buys-power-from-grid-as-talwandi-sabo-plant-unit-shut-down-101624478504382.html

Rawat, while giving details of the panel’s discussions with the CM a day earlier, said that Congress president Sonia Gandhi would take a decision on the government and organizational set-ups in Punjab by July 8-10. The three-member panel headed by leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge with Rawat and former Delhi MP Jai Prakash Agarwal as members, had held a series of meetings with 150-odd leaders of the faction-ridden state unit and submitted a report to Sonia. Rawat said the panel discussed the progress on the poll manifesto with the chief minister and asked him to act on pending promises within the set timeframe. “Bargari is an emotional issue in Punjab. We respect the emotions of people. The CM has been asked to take action in accordance with the public sentiment and within the perimeters of law. On the drug issue, the government has taken action and will act in pending matters soon,” Rawat told the media after his meeting with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in Delhi. The AICC general secretary listed 200 units of free power for urban households, Scheduled Caste scholarships, and tightening the screws on sand and transport mafia among the 18 election promises on which the chief minister has been asked to take prompt action. “A lot of promises were made in our manifesto and many have been fulfilled. The committee has given clear deadlines on the remaining issues and sought time-bound implementation in consultation with the chief minister. Barring the Bargari sacrilege case, all other require executive decisions. You will see considerable action within next 15-20 days,” said the former Uttarakhand chief minister. He said the chief minister would brief the media on these in the next two-three days. On Sidhu’s statements targeting the chief minister, Rawat said he is studying all the comments made by Sidhu. “I will give him advice wherever needed. In case there is need for a direction, I will do the needful,” he said. On whether the party was considering any role for Sidhu in the government or oganisation, Rawat said he had not spoken to Sidhu regarding this and would call him for a meeting within next 2-3 days. While Amarinder returned to Chandigarh without an audience with the top leadership. Rahul continued his meetings with senior party leaders and met Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa and finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Wednesday. After meeting, Jakhar said they discussed the steps needed to strengthen the party and resolve differences of opinion between various leaders. “The seriousness with which Rahul is looking at everything gives him confidence that the revival of the Congress will start from Punjab,” he said. Asked about Sidhu’s blistering attacks, Jakhar said he (former minister) was one of the 80 party MLAs and both Rawat and Kharge had already stated that he should air his grievances before the committee. The state chief blamed the chief minister’s so-called advisers for decisions such as government jobs for two party MLAs’ sons which were putting the chief minister’s office in a spot. Bajwa said that he discussed the current political situation in the state and the ground reality where the party and the government stood. “I told him (Rahul) about my assessment and how genuine the grievances of some leaders are,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sonia-gandhi-to-take-call-on-punjab-cong-rejig-by-july-10-101624478446985.html

Dugiana Temple committee president Ramesh Sharma said the unique museum named ‘Punjab Da Gaurav’ is a blend of all colours of the undivided Punjab. “The museum depicts many historic events with which our young generation is not familiar. It tells tales of the 1947 Partition. It also has portraits and brief life sketches of the great Hindus who attained martyrdom while fighting the cruel Mughal rulers. Our young generation knows only a few freedom fighters who hailed from the undivided Punjab. This museum is an effort to make people aware of many little-known freedom fighters”, said Ramesh Sharma.Committee general secretary Arun Khanna said, “The museum also showcases the historic Hindu shrines situated in Pakistan. Scientists, film artists and sportsmen have also found a place in it. People should know about Punjabi Hindus who sacrificed everything for service of the country.” The gallery is in the vicinity of the Harbans Lal Khanna Samarak, the BJP’s district-level office. The memorial was built in the memory of Harbans Lal Khanna, the Amritsar BJP chief and former MLA, who was killed by suspected militants before Operation Bluestar in 1984.

Police who are investigating the case said that it is suspected that the murder was committed by the family of the girl, who didn’t agree to her relationship with a Dalit. The murder took place in Saladahalli village in Devara Hipparagi taluk on Tuesday afternoon. The police identified the victims as Basavaraj Madivalapaa Badiger, 19 and Davalbi Bandagisab Tambad, 18. Basavaraj, an autorickshaw driver at Saladahalli village, belonged to the Madar community, while Tambad was from the neighbouring Khanapur. Anupam Agarwal, superintendent of police Vijayapura said that as per the information available to the police, both victims were in a relationship. “We are investigating the allegation that the family was not in favour of the relationship and when they found them in a field, they killed them using a stone. We will get further information on the case once we secure the suspects. Prima facie, it looks like a case of honour killing.” said Agarwal. During the investigation, police have found that the couple knew each other for more than six months and there were instances in the past when the girl’s family had opposed her meeting Basavaraj. In October 2020, a 19-year-old woman was killed allegedly by her father and two other relatives, including a minor, who were opposed to her reported love affair with a man belonging to another community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/couple-found-murdered-in-k-taka-district-police-suspect-hate-crime-101624478023567.html

While 20 people were arrested in the operation, nearly half of them were of Indian-origin.The operation, called Project Brisa (Spanish for breeze), lasted almost six months, after investigations commenced in November last year. Over a 1,000kg of illegal drugs were seized, including 444kg of cocaine, 182kg of crystal meth, 427kg of marijuana, and 300 oxycodone pills. Police also seized 21 vehicles, including five tractor-trailers, 966,020 Canadian dollars in cash and a firearm.The tractor-trailers were being used to transport drugs between Mexico, the United States and Canada. Multiple law enforcement agencies participated in the operation, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Ontario Provincial Police, York Regional Police, Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), Windsor Police Service, Montreal Police, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, while Canadian police collaborated with the United States Department of Homeland Security and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.Of those arrested, nine are of Indian-origin: Gurbakhash Singh Grewal, 37, of Brampton, Amarbir Singh Sarkaria, 25, of Caledon, Harbaljit Singh Toor, 46, of Caledon, Harwinder Bhullar, 43, of Caledon, Sarjant Singh Dhaliwal, 37, of Kitchener, Gurveer Dhaliwal, 26, of Kitchener, Gurmanpreet Grewal, 26, of Kitchener, Sukhwant Brar, 37, of Brampton and Parminder Gill, 33, of Brampton.“The removal of this quantity of drugs destined for the streets of our respective communities has without question prevented countless overdoses, acts of drug-related violence like shootings, and other occurrences that diminish the quality of life for our citizens,” Toronto Police chief James Ramer said.“When such networks are operating across three countries, Canada, the US and Mexico, ongoing collaboration between agencies, including CBSA is vital,” York Regional Police chief Jim MacSween said.The name for the operation was derived from the first seizure, when Toronto police’s drug squad raided a tractor-trailer carrying a consignment of hair dryers.This follows another major bust announced in April this year. In an operation dubbed Project Cheetah, law enforcement led by the York Regional Police arrested and charged over two dozen people and seized about 2.3 million Canadian dollars ($1.86 million) worth of drugs which included 10kg of cocaine, 8kg of ketamine, 3kg of heroin and 2.5kg of opium. Investigators also seized 48 firearms and 730,000 in Canadian currency ($592,588).

Data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Bengaluru shows that the rainfall has been heavy over some areas and scarce over others, leaving an unequal distribution pattern. Farmers and union members said they are left with little hope with inconsistent monsoon conditions and the government not extending enough support, apart from exploitation by middlemen and agents who take away the lion’s share of the retail price. Ramkrishne Gowda, a small farmer in Pandavapura in Mandya district, is wary of what the future holds for him and his family as the region has received deficit rainfall and he has already lost one set of crops this year. “Just when beans and tomato were ripe for plucking, we got Covid-19. And no one came to our fields to work and almost the entire produce was lost. Even to clean the fields now, we need ₹1 lakh,” Gowda said. Though the farming community was allowed to operate during the lockdown, the closure of markets meant a sharp dip in prices, forcing many to sell their produce on the streets at throwaway prices. He said that the entire family of four was hospitalised after contracting Covid-19 and had expenses of around ₹2 lakh to procure life-saving medicines. His pending expenses include ₹50,000 to pay his sister’s engineering college fees, and ₹1 lakh to clean the 3-acre land parcel, getting more seeds, fertilizers. He hopes that there is some consistency in rainfall. “For the last two years we have only taken loans but are yet to see any profits. Last year we took loans of ₹1.5 lakh for sowing tomato and other crops. But we didn’t even get ₹5000 profit. We are now borrowing more money to pay off interests,” Gowda said. His family sold the three cows they had for ₹30,000 each. “We are still unable to make ends meet.”The Covid-19 induced lockdown also saw a reverse migration of sorts when those who left to cities for better employment and education opportunities, were seen heading back to their home-towns and villages due to the uncertainty, adding to the pressure on already small land holdings.Farmers’ unions in the state said that the payment for crops covered under minimum support price (MSP) has not been made. “We are yet to release all the funds for MSP. The chief minister released around ₹200 crore last week and we will be releasing more in the coming days,” said BC Patil, Karnataka’s minister for agriculture. Patil said that last year was hard due to the lockdown but this time around there was provision between 6-10 am for people to sell their produce, which farmers said did not help as the cost of diesel, transport, seeds, fertilisers and other input costs have gone up in recent days, making the trip almost unviable for producers. “In Punjab there is a rule that anyone buying or selling below MSP can be jailed. We in Karnataka also need similar laws to protect our farmers at least to help get minimum income. We are still not talking about profits,” said Kodihalli Chandrashekar, president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) or state farmers’ union. “There is rain now, but if it intensifies, it could destroy crops.” In May, chief minister BS Yediyurappa announced a ₹1250-crore financial package, aimed to provide relief to unorganised workers and the farming community. The financial package involves a one-time payment of ₹10,000 for about 20,000 flower growers and 69,000 farmers who produce fruits and vegetables, costing the exchequer around ₹81.73 crore. The package also included the extension of the period of loans availed by around 425,000 farmers and others by three months. Farmers’ unions said that they are yet to receive the money and even when they do, it would do little to alleviate their suffering. “On one hand prices for essential commodities are skyrocketing and on the other, farmers are not even getting the cost of production. This is a perfect example of market failure,” said Prakash Kammardi, farm expert and former chairman of the Karnataka Agricultural Price Commission. “An imperfect market structure where middlemen can exhibit their overplay is becoming very dominant,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uneven-rain-in-k-taka-adds-to-farmers-woes-101624477844872.html
24-06-2021||Other||Kotkapura firing: SIT summons Sukhbir for questioning on June 26||A day after questioning Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) patriarch and former chief minister (CM) Parkash Singh Badal, the Punjab Police newly formed special investigation team (SIT) has summoned former deputy CM and party president Sukhbir Singh Badal on June 26 in connection with the 2015 Kotkapura firing case.Sukhbir, who was the home minister when the Kotkapura firing took place, has been asked to appear with record, if any, before the SIT on June 26 at 11am at Punjab Police Officers’ Institute, Sector 32, Chandigarh, in connection with two first information reports (FIRs) registered at the Kotkapura city police station on October 14, 2015, and August 7, 2018. Summon was issued under Section 160 (police officer’s power to require attendance of witnesses) of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).Apart from Badal Senior, the SIT led by additional director general of police (ADGP) LK Yadav has recently questioned a number of senior police officials, including former director general of police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini and suspended inspector general of police (IGP) Paramraj Singh Umranangal. This is the second time during the Congress regime that Sukhbir will be quizzed in connection with Kotkapura firing incident. Earlier, the SIT led by former IG Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh had questioned the SAD chief in November 2018.A chargesheet filed in the court by Kunwar in May 2019 has said that incidents of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib were “a pre-planned handiwork of then deputy CM Sukhbir Badal, then DGP Saini and Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda”. The Kunwar-led SIT had claimed that the post-sacrilege firing incidents at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan were part of a conspiracy and directions came from the top.On April 9, questioning the impartiality of Kunwar Vijay, the Punjab and Haryana high court had quashed all the chargesheets filed by the SIT in Kotkapura firing case. The court also directed the state government to reconstitute a new SIT without him. Upset over the HC verdict, Kunwar took voluntary retirement in April.“Surprising thing is that even after making effort to find out and establish the allegation of conspiracy against Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhbir and despite mentioning their names in the chargesheet and recording therein that their conspiracy is established, Kunwar Vijay did not array them as accused by filing any chargesheet against them in these two FIRs so far. This is despite the fact that the chargesheet in which the alleged role of Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhbir has been mentioned by Kunwar Vijay, was prepared way back on May 23, 2019,” the HC stated in the quashing order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kotkapura-firing-sit-summons-sukhbir-for-questioning-on-june-26-101624477844265.html

The three could not be reached for a comment.The summonses are related to a money laundering case against Khaira and his family members. The agency had conducted searches against the accused in March.Khaira was a rebel Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA when the raids were carried out. He has recently re-joined the Congress. He won the election on an AAP ticket in 2017. However, he resigned from the primary membership of the Arvind Kejriwal-led party in January 2019 and floated his own outfit, the Punjab Ekta Party.The ED has alleged that Khaira is an “associate” of drug case convicts and fake passport racketeers.The 56-year-old politician has denied any wrongdoing and said he is being targeted by central agencies as he has been vocal against the Centre’s three new farm laws.The case against him pertains to the probe in a 2015 Fazilka drugs smuggling incident in which 1,800 gms of heroin, 24 gold biscuits, two weapons, 26 live cartridges and two Pakistani SIM cards were seized by security agencies from a gang of international drug smugglers.The sources said the ED has found that certain payments, including in cash, were allegedly made to the three designers and hence, the agency wants to know their version of the transactions and record their statements.The payments, purportedly made during 2018-19, run into a few lakhs of rupees and are linked to Khaira, they said.The ED had filed the case under criminal sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Khaira and others after studying a Punjab Police FIR.“The drugs were smuggled through the India-Pakistan border and one of the kingpins of the syndicate is in the UK.“Khaira was actively aiding and supporting the gang of international smugglers and enjoying the proceeds of crime,” the agency has alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ed-summons-three-top-fashion-designers-in-pmla-case-against-khaira-101624477364053.html

But locust has not been spotted in Iran and Pakistan till last week and this is good news for India, said the official.“A detailed analysis was done by the LWO on Tuesday after FAO’s sent its field and aerial studies being conducted in the locust hotbeds in African, Middle East region and Asian countries. Unlike last year, there is no potential threat of locust in India,” said Sathyanarayana, the national coordinator on mitigating locust attacks.He, however, said the breeding and movement pattern of swarms in other parts of the world suggest a stray swarm may hit the desert areas of Gujarat alone. But there is no need to panic and FAO or LWO is not issuing any forewarning, he said.“Locust may arrive only for breeding and we do not see any threat to vegetation. But chances are remote. The LWO is constantly coordinating with FAO for locust movement,” said the official.Experts say locusts move with the wind and follow a definite cycle from the Sahara desert in North Africa, into East Africa – Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea and parts of Chad. They then move to the Arabian Peninsula and Iran. When they finish the food there, they move to Pakistan and India.According to the FAO bulletin issued on June 21, swarms persist in Kenya and Ethiopia but other areas in Asia, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, are calm.“Intensive ground and aerial operations are underway in eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia to reduce swarm formation by detecting and treating hopper bands and new swarms,” it reads.It was after about three decades that India experienced a massive locust attack in 2019-20 when the insect moved from Rajasthan to various states, including Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and parts of Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/experts-rule-out-locust-threat-this-season-101624476944966.html

A murder case has been registered against the cop, who was arrested later on Wednesday.The victim, identified as Murugesan, is a farmer, the police said. Family members of the victim have filed a complaint against the cop, identified as R Periasamy, a special sub-inspector at Ethapur police station in Salem, the police added. The incident occurred on Tuesday after Murugesan and two of his friends went to Kallakuruchi district to consume alcohol, as liquor shops were closed due to the ongoing lockdown. While the trio was returning on a two-wheeler, the police intercepted them in Ethapur.“The police found them inebriated, so the cop asked them to leave the two-wheeler and walk,” said a senior police official of Salem, who did not want to be named. “Murugesan then began quarrelling.”When the verbal exchanges escalated, the cop allegedly started thrashing Murugesan on the road. A video of the incident, filmed by one of Murugesan’s friends, showed him collapsing on the road and his friends pleading to the cop to not to hit him.Murugesan’s friends then rushed him in an ambulance to a local hospital in Attur, from where he was sent to Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College on Wednesday. “He was declared brought dead,” a senior official said. “A post-mortem has been completed. Only after the report findings come can we ascertain the cause of death. His treatment, however, records that he was in an inebriated state and had some lacerations and aberrations, the official added.Chief minister MK Stalin announced a ₹10 lakh solatium for the family. The incident is another case of police brutality in the city after a man and his son died in police custody in Thoothukudi district June last year, triggering a countrywide outrage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cop-held-in-tamil-nadu-on-charges-of-beating-man-to-death-101624476943542.html

His exit had led to a spate of resignations from the Congress. Though the BJP drew a blank in the 2016 assembly elections, it was the Congress turncoats who aided the party in winning six out of the nine seats they contested this time.Besides Namassivayam, senior BJP leader Sai Saravanan Kumar, who was elected from Oussudu, a reserved constituency for scheduled castes, is also likely to be inducted in the Cabinet.Initially the process was delayed as chief minister N Rangaswamy was down with Covid-19, a day after he took oath on May 7. The newly elected MLAs were sworn in almost three weeks later, on May 26. Later, negotiations were hard between the AINRC and BJP over the number of Cabinet berths. BJP MLA ‘Embalam’ R Selvam was elected unopposed to the Speaker’s post on June 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/puducherry-cm-submits-list-of-ministers-to-lg-101624476523474.html

The protesting employees are objecting to the formulae used in calculation of the increase in pay.“Government employees, including superintendents and clerical staff, across the state will be on the pen-down strike till June 27,” said Sukhchain Khera, convener, Joint Action Committee of state government employees, adding that the pay commission recommendations were not acceptable to them. They also raised slogans against the government. Last week, the Punjab government had decided to implement a majority of the recommendations of its Sixth Pay Commission with effect from January 1, 2016, a move that will benefit over five lakh serving and retired employees. The disbursal of salaries and pensions under the new structure will begin from July 1. The implementation would entail 2.59-time increase in salaries and pensions over the previous pay commission recommendations, with an annual increment rate of 3 per cent. “We are demanding the pay should be hiked by a multiple of 2.74,” said Khera, adding the pay hike, otherwise, was negligible. The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) has demanded that the Punjab government must convene a special session of the Vidhan Sabha, immediately, to explain the fraud meted out to state government employees in the name of the Sixth Pay Commission. “Employee associations are pointing out anomalies and instances of injustice. All these must be resolved within a month,” the SAD added. SAD senior leader Bikram Singh Majithia said chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh should explain why allowances of some categories of employees had been stopped altogether. “Why has the state created different categories of employees by enforcing the Central Pay Commission on new recruits. The chief minister should also tell why thousands of contract employees, whom he had committed to regularise five years ago, still continue to be on contract,” Majithia added. He also sought immediate dismissal of finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal. “Employees across the State have expressed their no-confidence in the finance minister by holding a pen-down strike followed by a walkout from government offices. The CM should sack Manpreet immediately so that talks with employees can begin.”“It seems that not only employees, but even the government has been deceived, as the pay commission report which is being sold as a bonanza for employees, in fact is discriminatory towards them,” Majithia claimed, adding that Non Practicing Allowance (NPA) of doctors must also be fully restored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/employees-on-5-day-pen-down-strike-over-pay-commission-report-101624476408041.html

24-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC exploring option of multiple small waste plants||The municipal corporation is exploring the option of multiple small sized waste processing plants to process the city’s solid and dry garbage, rather than one big plant.Such plants, if set up, will use the plasma arch gasification technology, which employs a combination of electricity and high temperatures to turn municipal waste into usable by-products, without burning it.Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said, “Plasma arc gasification (PAG) is the latest technology for municipal solid waste processing. But, as per the presentations made to us by the firm which expressed interest in setting up a plant in Chandigarh, capacity of such a plant is only 25 MT per day.” Chandigarh produces around 450 MT of solid waste per day. Of this, more than 250 MT is solid dry waste. For this, the MC is exploring different technologies which can be used to upgrade the existing waste processing plant in Sector 25.“One such plant requires only around 400 square yards of area. So, instead of a big plant, we can have around 10 smaller sized ones. These can be located even in facilities like material recovery facility (MRF),” added Sharma.A team of councillor and MC officials have visited three waste processing plants – two in Delhi and one in Ambala so far. “We are yet to first-hand see the operation of the plasma technology. We are also exploring if greater capacity plants can be constructed with plasma technology,” the mayor added. Earlier, 13 companies had come forward to run and upgrade the city’s sole waste processing plant in Sector 25. One of them had offered the plasma technology for processing waste.A committee comprising experts from Punjab Engineering College, MC officials and councillors had examined proposals of the 11 companies, which made the presentations. After the committee’s report was tabled before the MC general House, it was decided that these companies will also make presentations before the councillors. After the presentations were made to councillors, it was decided that they will visit some of the plants using this technology.Existing plant working at 10%-30% capacityIn the meantime, the city has been struggling with processing solid waste. The existing plant in Sector 25 is working at 10% to 30% of its capacity of the 450 MT. Consequently, most of the city’s solid waste is being dumped in Dadumajra without being processed. As per MC officials, more than 1 lakh MT of waste has been dumped at the eight-acre landfill site in Dadumajra, threatening not only local population, but also posing serious environmental danger. The sites have repeatedly witnessed major and minor fires in the last one year.On the final choice of technology, Sharma said, “We don’t want to repeat the Congress’ mistake and setup a plant in a hurry. So, we are exploring all options, including the latest plasma technology.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-exploring-option-of-multiple-small-waste-plants-101624474904034.html

24-06-2021||Mumbai||CBI was bound to seek state’s consent before registering FIR: Anil Deshmukh to HC||Former home minister Anil Deshmukh, while arguing against the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) first information report (FIR), wherein he has been accused for corruption, submitted before the Bombay High Court that the CBI had gone beyond the mandate of the HC ordered preliminary enquiry (PE) on April 5 by registering the FIR. The hearing will continue on July 2.Deshmukh’s counsel referred to various past judgments and stressed that while the CBI was duty-bound to follow the HC mandate, it could not claim a right to investigate beyond it and was supposed to seek the state’s consent for registering the FIR after concluding the PE therefore the FIR be quashed and set aside. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar while hearing the petition filed by Deshmukh was informed by senior advocate Amit Desai and advocate Kamlesh Ghumre that while he was not averse to investigations by CBI against him, the investigating agency had gone beyond the mandate of the entire preliminary probe ordered by the HC on April 5. Desai further submitted that the subsequent FIR filed by the CBI on April 21 booking Deshmukh under the Prevention of Corruption Act and IPC on charges of bribery, corruption and criminal conspiracy were based on allegations made by Singh that could be heresay or whispers in the corridors of the commissioner’s office and hence the FIR on should be quashed.“The letter can at most be some suspicion or whisper that may be heard in the corridors of the commissioner office. Not a single person has come before the court to say the money was taken. There is no victim. No one has come forward to complain that money was taken from them,” submitted Desai. He added that Deshmukh has been shamed and declared a devil based on the FIR though the probe did not disclose any substantial evidence and added that CBI was getting into the issue of transfers and postings which are a matter of policy. He submitted that as a result of these allegations the entire police force has been demoralized. Deshmukh also submitted that though he was the central figure in the petitions filed before HC based on the March 20 letter of former Mumbai CP Param Bir Singh, he was not given an opportunity to defend himself before the PE order was passed, the bench however clarified that it would not review the April 5 order but would decide on the FIR. Desai also submitted that the court should also consider the fact that the concept of PE was brought in along with other safeguards to protect public servants as making accusations against them was very easy. With regards to seeking consent of the state before registering the FIR, Desai said that the CBI Director should have followed the process as laid down in the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act. “The investigating agency has a duty to conduct the probe, but cannot claim a right to do so,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-was-bound-to-seek-state-s-consent-before-registering-fir-anil-deshmukh-to-hc-101624474845934.html
24-06-2021||Mumbai||Cancellation of reservation in promotion as per law: State to HC||The Maharashtra government, through an affidavit, opposed the petitions challenging the May 7 government resolution (GR) which cancelled the 33% reservation in promotions for those employed through quotas in SC, ST, VJNT and SBC categories and sought dismissal of the petitions. The state informed the Bombay high court (HC) that the decision was as per the law prevailing in the state and was subject to further orders of the Supreme Court, which is hearing special leave petitions filed after the Bombay HC struck down the 2004 GR which introduced reservation in promotion. The state said that since the apex court was already seized of the matters challenging May 7 GR, the HC should not interfere in the petitions which are devoid of merit. On Tuesday, a division bench of justice KK Tated and justice RI Chagla which is hearing a clutch of petitions challenging the May 7 GR was informed by senior counsel Mihir Desai representing the government stated that an affidavit in reply to the petitions had been filed. The affidavit stated that the decision to scrap the nearly two-decade-old policy came two days after the Supreme Court quashed the Maratha reservation which was allowed by HC. Senior counsel Indira Jaising and other counsels who have challenged the May 7 GR on behalf of the numerous petitioners said that the decision would affect the rights of those belonging to reserved categories. Jaising submitted that while the reservations of 33 per cent existed since 1974, in a single stroke, the state de-reserved all the seats.The affidavit filed through Sumant Bhange, secretary, general administration department stated that the alleged claims and contentions of the petitioners were not true and correct and that the petitioners are not entitled to any relief as sought for in the petitions. The affidavit further adds that on March 22, this year, a committee under the chairmanship of the state chief secretary was formed to collect data of inadequacy of representation and effect on overall efficiency in administration due to reservation and was to submit the report within a month. The affidavit added that work of data collection was in progress as the report could not be submitted within stipulated time due to the second wave of Covid-19 and a proposal to extend the period for submission was being considered. The government further said that it does not want to face contempt proceedings by granting reservations in promotion on ad-hoc basis as the HC order which struck down the 2004 GR is still not stayed by the Apex Court and hence sought dismissal of the pleas. The HC is likely to hear the petition in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cancellation-of-reservation-in-promotion-as-per-law-state-to-hc-101624474843391.html
24-06-2021||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh case: Bombay HC reserves judgment on state’s petition||Permitting the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe into the two unnumbered paragraphs of its April 21 first information report (FIR) against former home minister Anil Deshmukh would demoralise the entire police force, the state claimed before the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday. The HC has reserved its judgment on the petition. On Wednesday, a bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar conducted final hearing of the petition filed by the state, seeking removal of the two unnumbered paragraphs from the FIR filed by CBI on April 21 after hearing the petition for more than five days. Solicitor general of India Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Anil Singh informed the bench that the state’s claim that as it was probing the Rashmi Shukla case, CBI should not interfere was not valid as the state was not probing the allegations made by Shukla to her superior of the undue political influence in postings and transfers, but only the alleged leaking of her report and phone tapping case. Mehta submitted that similarly the allegations pertaining to reinstatement of Vaze were also serious and if both the charges went uninvestigated, the CBI would be guilty of non-compliance of the mandate of the April 5 HC order. On April 5, the HC had directed the CBI to conduct a PE on charges of corruption made by Singh against Deshmukh after hearing the petition of advocate Dr Jaishri Patil. Patil had approached the court as the Malabar Hill police station had failed to take cognizance of her complaint against Deshmukh based on the contents of Singh’s letter to the chief minister. After concluding the PE, on April 21, the CBI had registered an FIR against Deshmukh and two others and sought documents pertaining to the reinstatement of Vaze and the complaint of Shukla from the state as both issues had been included in the FIR. Aggrieved by the demand by CBI, the state approached the HC seeking removal of the paragraphs which dealt with the two issues on the grounds that the April 5 HC order did not mandate it. The state government’s counsel, senior advocate Rafiq Dada, had reiterated that it was not against the central agency investigating into the allegations of corruption made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh in his March 20 letter to the chief minister but by conducting inquiry into the two issues CBI was attempting to mutilate pending investigations in Shukla and Vaze reinstatement matters.Dada had argued that if CBI was allowed to carry out ‘pillage’ of investigation into transfers and postings being ‘super machinery’ without mandate of the court, same will result in defeating morale of police administration having excellent record and same is irresponsible.The CBI while responding to the claims had argued that by not cooperating and refusing access to certain documents sought by the agency with regard to the FIR against Deshmukh the state government was in contempt of court and scared of the investigation into two issues that were intrinsically linked to allegations of corruption against Deshmukh.In response, Dada submitted that Vaze was reinstated by the committee headed by Singh and CBI was trying to help someone by saying that the home minister had knowledge about Vaze’s reinstatement. Dada gad said that Vaze’s reinstatement, Rashmi Shukla’s allegation on transfers and postings were not part of the same transaction as the allegation of extortion from restaurants and even the HC had taken the view.“We are not only fighting for federal structure, but the morale of police will be down if such pillage is allowed. We are also fighting for the sanctity of our (state) investigations. The CBI cannot by backdoor entry initiate a probe into these issues saying that they are intrinsically connected with FIR. If the CBI is talking about corruption, the state is also fighting it and dealing with Shukla and Vaze matters. Anyone cannot assume that the state does not have power to probe it,” said Dada. After all arguments were concluded, the CBI continued its earlier statement that it would not seek documents including Shukla’s letter and minutes of the police board meeting from the state. The court reserved its judgement which will be pronounced in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-case-bombay-hc-reserves-judgment-on-state-s-petition-101624474784096.html
24-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai youth nominated with Yo-Yo Ma, McCartney at LA Shorts International Film Festival||And the nominees are… Yo-Yo Ma, Paul McCartney, and a Mumbai boy named Saahil Bhargava. An animated music video by Bhargava, a 26-year-old singer-songwriter currently based in Los Angeles, for a song written and sung by him, has been selected at the LA Shorts International Film Festival, alongside projects by music greats Ma and McCartney. The video, for the song Kohima, will compete in the Best Animation and the Best Music Video categories at the festival. He and his Mumbai-based co-director Harmeet Rahal, 25, also the film’s animator, are over the moon. Their passion project was inspired by the massive battle of Kohima in present-day Nagaland, which occurred in 1944, towards the end of World War 2. “It was a turning point in the war, but it’s a forgotten battle that rarely gets talked about,” Bhargava says. Rather than focus on the victory of the Allied forces (Indian soldiers were fighting Japan in this arena, on behalf of colonial Britain), the song is written from the perspective of the embattled soldier fighting physical and emotional trauma and trying to survive it all so he can return home to his family. “When Saahil came to me, he had finished writing the song. It was such a great challenge to bring those emotions to the screen,” Rahal says. “It’s an honour to be nominated alongside such amazing work, and I hope this helps more people learn about this hidden piece of Indian history.” Incidentally, the McCartney work nominated alongside in both categories is When Winter Comes. It is the final track on McCartney III, the former Beatle’s 18th solo album. The Ma work nominated for Best Music Video is See Me: A Global Concert, a 23-minute pandemic-era production that was filmed remotely and features collaborations between acclaimed musicians, orchestras and choirs playing from around the world. The LA festival is in its 25th year and will be held virtually for the first time this year, starting July 1. “It is such a high honor for the LA Shorts International Film Festival to welcome Kohima into competition this year. Only a handful of films were accepted into the brand-new Music/Dance category. In fact, we created the special Music/Dance program due to high quality content from exceptional artists such as Paul McCartney, Yo-Yo Ma and India’s own Saahil Bhargava,” festival founder and director Robert Arentz said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-youth-nominated-with-yo-yo-ma-mccartney-at-la-shorts-international-film-festival-101624474725672.html
24-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra mulls stricter curbs amid Delta Plus Covid cases||Taking serious note of the Delta Plus variant Covid-19 cases found in the state, Maharashtra is mulling stricter restrictions as the transmissibility and virulence of the strain is more than the other variants. The matter was discussed in the cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will also be holding a discussion with the state task force before reaching a decision.State health minister Rajesh Tope said they have decided to isolate all 21 Delta Plus cases. It has also decided to start contact-tracing and testing of high-risk and low-risk contacts of index cases and will also conduct genome sequencing of all those found Covid positive. The state is also sending a detailed report sought by the Centre.The state has found 21 cases, covering six districts. Of them, nine cases are in Ratnagiri, seven in Jalgaon, two in Mumbai and one case each in Thane, Palghar and Sindhudurg.“Delta Plus variant is found to be the common cause behind the places where the third wave is coming. This is a matter of concern for Maharashtra as well as the state has also found cases of Delta Plus. A few ministers opined that the state should reconsider its decision of a five-level relaxation plan. Chief minister will be discussing it with the task force members before taking any decision,” said a senior minister, requesting anonymity.The health minister said, “The daily cases have hit a plateau as they are not going down, which is a cause for concern for us. They have been stagnant between 8,000 and 10,000 for the past 10-12 days.”A senior official privy to the development said the daily testing has also been reduced in the state. “If the daily testing increased to around 300,000 a day then daily cases will come anywhere between 10,000 and 15,000 cases,” he said.Tope also informed that the Delta Plus, formed by mutation in the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, has been classified as a “variant of concern” from the current “variant of interest” by the Union health ministry.“With the help of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB), the state government has taken up a project of genome sequencing of positive patients and found 21 Delta Plus variants in 3,400 samples. The percentage is too less (0.005%), which indicates that the Delta Plus, has not replaced the Delta variant, but its behaviour and effects are not good,” the health minister said.“The state government has kept all the 21 patients in isolation. They will be monitored round the clock. For further studies, we will be checking their travel history, if they are re-infected or got infected even after getting vaccinated as the Delta Plus is capable of escaping antibodies that are developed with the help of Covid-19 vaccine,” Tope said.He said that the positive side is that the state has reported not a single death among the 21 Delta Plus variant cases and a few patients found to have recovered.“The Centre on Wednesday has informed Maharashtra that they have put the Delta Plus virus from ‘variant of interest’ (VOI) to ‘variant of concern’ (VOC), because of its transmissibility and virulence, which is more than the Delta Plus variant. It also has the ability to escape the antibodies,” Tope said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mulls-stricter-curbs-amid-delta-plus-covid-cases-101624474726139.html
24-06-2021||Chandigarh||Meet the fearless female faces of Covid fight in Chandigarh tricity||When a pandemic hit us unannounced and waged a war against humanity, these three women didn’t shy away from taking on the invisible enemy from the frontline. Heading the health departments in the tricity, doctors Amandeep Kang (Chandigarh), Adarshpal Kaur (Mohali) and Jasjeet Kaur (Panchkula) worked day and night, took timely decisions and bolstered infrastructure and Covid response in a matter of months. Due to their tireless efforts, the tricity is better prepared to face further waves.Made crucial additions to infrastructure In February last year, a month before Covid would make entry into Panchkula, Dr Jasjeet Kaur took charge as the civil surgeon. She had no intensive care units (ICU), molecular laboratories or oxygen plants at her disposal — all these would become essential in the days to come. “When I joined, nobody had the slightest idea that a pandemic was coming. But once cases started emerging, there was no looking back. The most challenging months were April to May, when there was complete lockdown and I had to put in place crucial infrastructure.”In April 2020, Dr Kaur set up a 15-bed ICU, subsequently increasing the capacity to 24. From none to 18 ventilators and 40 Bipap machines were installed.When PGIMER “refused” to take critical patients from Panchkula, she took the call to go self-dependent, roped in private hospitals and got more staff hired and trained. “There were days when I and Dr Sarita, then principal medical officer, used to work 14-16 hours a day, without any breaks,” says Dr Kaur, who also tested positive for Covid in November. She says for one year now she has not had a full night of sleep.Cut to present, her timely decisions, 24X7 availability and tireless efforts have earned her credit for Panchkula’s preparedness against the deadly virus.Ramped up RT-PCR tests to 87% in three daysA renowned gynaecologist, Dr Amandeep Kang took charge as Chandigarh health services director in October 2020, when the first wave was on a decline. “As the first measure against the virus, I enhanced the city’s testing centres from three to over 30, increasing the daily screening capacity to 3,000 persons.” She also got ICU beds increased to eight at GMSH-16 to facilitate mild to moderate Covid cases, easing the burden on PGIMER and GMCH-32 and reserving them for critical patients.Ensuring ventilators to all when the cases shot up was the most challenging task, says Dr Kang. “There was a time when the ICU and oxygen-support beds were fully occupied. This situation persisted for 15 days in April-May. The administration then started biomarker tests at the hospital, a kind of investigation needed by doctors to treat the virus. MRI and CT scans were also made available for free.”Recalling a time when the UT ramped up Covid testing in three days, she says, “We got orders to increase RT-PCR testing up to 80%. We immediately roped in private labs on the Haryana pattern, fixed the rates and within three days, the testing was increased to 87%.”Despite her demanding profession, Dr Kang says nothing brings more contentment than doing one’s job with honesty.Sensitised villages, augmented vaccinationMohali has achieved excellent success in vaccinating its populace, kudos to civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur’s tireless efforts. She took the reins against Covid in January this year, a time when the guard had to be upped for the second wave, but would not be easy, given the lack of infrastructure at government facilities.“In first wave, critical patients were being sent to Gian Sagar Medical College. However, no such hospital was assigned to us in the second Covid onslaught.” Taking on the challenge, the Mohali district hospital was converted into a 120 bed Covid facility and routine OPDs were shifted to ESI Hospital. “There was no ICU at the government hospital, so we tied up with private hospitals and managed to ready 370 Covid beds.”Medical in-charge of a district having a huge rural population, spreading awareness and getting people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour was a big test for Dr Kaur. Even so, her colleagues say, she went from village to village, held video campaigns and vaccination camps to ensure that villagers got the jabs and virus spread was contained. “My job sometimes requires 24-hour attention, but I try to take out time for my mother, who is a cancer patient and has advanced stage Parkinson’s disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-chandigarh-tricity-faces-of-covid-fight-are-female-and-fearless-101624474724102.html
24-06-2021||Mumbai||Jitendra Awhad moves temporary accommodation of cancer patients to Bombay Dyeing Mills||A day after chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray stayed a decision of providing 100 Mhada (Maharashtra Housing Development Authority) flats at a redeveloped building near Currey Road to Tata Memorial Hospital for temporary accommodation of cancer patients, the state housing department has decided to provide the same at Bombay Dyeing Mills premises at Wadala. State housing minister Jitendra Awhad made the announcement on Wednesday.The housing department had decided to provide 100 Mhada flats to Tata Memorial Hospital for providing temporary accommodation to cancer patients who have come from other states at a nominal rate of ₹1. However, following objection from local Shiv Sena MLA Ajay Chaudhary, the CM stayed its implementation. Chaudhary had said the people in the surrounding buildings were opposing the facility there. The keys of the flats were handed over to the hospital authorities in May by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar. Awhad on Wednesday tried to downplay the issue and said the CM asked him to find a suitable place. “There was some kind of misunderstanding among locals, to which the CM said he has no objection to the project and asked me to identify a suitable place at the earliest. We have decided to provide temporary accommodation to cancer patients in Mhada flats developed at Bombay Dyeing Mills premises,” Awhad told reporters.Chaudhary, an MLA from Sewri constituency, said over 1,000 families living in the vicinity objected to it. He added that he had requested the housing minister to move it to another place but grievances were unheard, following which he requested the chief minister to intervene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jitendra-awhad-moves-temporary-accommodation-of-cancer-patients-to-bombay-dyeing-mills-101624474543426.html

24-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Unqualified doctor arrested for performing surgeries||Matunga police arrested a doctor from a Dadar-based private piles hospital and rectal centre for allegedly endangering life of a patient by performing surgery on him despite not being qualified to perform the surgery.The accused, Dr Mukesh Kota, practices at Gopal Rao’s Piles and Ano-Rectal Centre and was arrested based on the complaint of a 43-year-old Goregaon resident. Preliminary police probe revealed that the accused doctor has performed 1,000 surgeries in past three years.

Preliminary probe revealed that two of the arrested accused had travelled from Punjab to Mumbai on bikes, carrying the contraband in backpacks.NCB officials said, during the course of investigation, they found out the role played by Kaskar and some other gangsters in the drug trafficking racket. They are also investigating terror angle in the drug supply, as hashish generally comes from Kashmir and lands in bulk in Punjab, from where it is sent mostly to Mumbai, Pune. other metro cities, and Goa.Kaskar, deported from the United Arab Emirates in 2003, was said to be operating Dawood’s real estate business in Mumbai and surrounding areas, the police said. On September 18, the Thane anti-extortion cell had arrested him along with two of his accomplices — Mumtaz Shaikh and Israel Sayyed — for allegedly extorting ₹30 lakh from a Thane-based builder.One more accused Pankaj Hangar, 54, a gambling den owner, was arrested in the case subsequently, as police found he was in touch with Kaskar and Shakeel, a Dawood henchman.On October 11, Thane police slapped stringent provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) on the seven accused, including the four arrested and three wanted — Chotta Shakeel and two Dawood gang shooters, Shammi and Guddu.Thane police later found that Kaskar, Sayyed and Shaikh had allegedly extorted gold from a jewellery shop owner.

24-06-2021||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai: 18-year-old drowns at Pandavkada waterfall, body fished out||An 18-year-old student from Govandi drowned at Pandavkada waterfall in Kharghar on Tuesday evening. His body was fished out of the water on Wednesday morning. The forest department had banned entry to the waterfall last month. Yet, a large number of people from across Mumbai go there for enjoyment.According to the police, Mausam Rambahadur Gharti had visited the waterfall with five other friends at around 3.30pm. Three of them entered the water and started swimming when he drowned. Three other boys from the group were good swimmers and searched for him in the water for a long time, but to no avail. They later went to the police station and narrated the incident.The police and fire brigade officials reached the spot and searched for him till 9.30pm, but they could not trace him. On Wednesday, at around 9.30am, they managed to fish out his body that was stuck under a boulder.Shatrughna Mali, senior inspector of Kharghar police station, said, “The boys in the group were friends since school days and are residents of Mankhurd and Govandi. On Tuesday, they boarded a Panvel-bound train from Mankhurd station and alighted at Kharghar. From there, they hired an auto rickshaw to go to the waterfall. We sent the deceased’s body to a civic hospital in Panvel and later handed it over to his family.”Another police officer said, “The deceased was the only son of his mother. His father too passed away a few years ago. He had cleared his Class 12 exam this year. We have registered an accidental death case,” another police officer said.Shivraj Patil, deputy commissioner of police (zone II), said, “Since the water level changes frequently at the catchment area of the waterfall, no one can judge it accurately. Despite knowing about the ban, people come to that site for enjoyment due to their negligence and carelessness, and thus meet with such accidents. We appeal to the revellers to avoid such places.”Earlier, in August 2019, four girls including three college students were washed away by the strong current of a stream while they were trying to cross it near the waterfall. Several other similar accidents have also taken place at the site.Mali said, “Apart from deploying officials, we have also put banners at several places asking people not to enter the waterfall. But the area is huge and there are several routes to go to the waterfall. Therefore, it is very difficult to prevent people from going.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-18-year-old-drowns-at-pandavkada-waterfall-body-fished-out-101624474243364.html

Other members of the committee will include two principal secretaries from the urban development department and principal secretaries of environment, energy and industries departments along with industry representatives and experts who may be nominated by the state government from time to time.“The steering committee will monitor policy progress, address major impediments to policy implementation and make amendments to the policy, as may be required,” stated an official presentation on the draft EV Policy, which was reviewed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last Monday.The presentation, a copy of which was presented by transport department during a webinar on May 27, stated, “Steering Committee shall be supported by a dedicated team, or a secretariat called the Maharashtra State EV Secretariat. The secretariat will comprise of a team of professionals who be responsible for day-to-day operations of the EV Policy. The secretariat will be housed in the transport department of Maharashtra.”“The CM has reviewed the draft policy and instructed that it be brought before the cabinet at the earliest. We are expecting the nod any day now,” said an official requesting anonymity. “The main function of the apex committee will be to ensure that every department is doing its job, and to ensure accountability. The EV secretariat will keep an eye on daily operations and report the same to the committee, who will step in when required,” said an official with the transport department, seeking anonymity.Education and skill developmentThe new EV Policy 2021 also proposes to amend existing educational programmes and to create new ones including vocational programmes that will cater specifically to electrical vehicle ecosystem. These courses will be offered by state Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and aim to create a skilled pool of talent that can be employed across the industry. The government also plans to rope in manufacturers and research organisations to establish skill enhancement, which will retrain the existing engineering and mechanics workforce in the repairing and servicing of EVs and charging stations, said officials involved in the drafting of the policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-apex-steering-body-to-oversee-implementation-of-new-ev-policy-101624474183973.html
24-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: New e-vehicles policy to bring cut in prices, road tax||Maharashtra’s new draft Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy 2021 aims to bring at least 1,46,000 new battery-operated electric vehicles (BEVs) on state roads by 2025, estimated to comprise about 10% of all new vehicle registrations by that time. The policy is likely to be cleared by the cabinet soon, said officials in the know. The draft policy has proposed a range of sops for those purchasing EVs. These include subsidised vehicle costs, discounts for early adopters, exemption from road tax and registration fees, and providing rebates on property tax to residential establishments that invest in charging stations, among others. The cost of EVs in the state is set to become cheaper as buyers will be able to avail incentives under the state policy as well as the Centre’s Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and EV (FAME) II scheme, officials familiar with the development said. The draft policy was reviewed by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray last week. The policy aims to incentivise purchase of 100,000 electric two-wheelers, 15,000 e-autos, 10,000 cars, 20,000 goods carriers (both three and four-wheeler) and 1,000 e-buses. For each of these vehicle segments, incentives are likely to be funded from the green tax levied on polluting vehicles, said officials from the transport department. There will also be an “early bird discount of ₹2,500/kWh of the vehicle battery capacity in addition to aforesaid incentives for EV purchased before December 31, 2021,” stated an official presentation made to the CM last week, by the policy’s drafting committee.The cost of electric vehicles sold with extended battery warranty of at least five years and buyback options are proposed to be reduced even further. The cost of a single EV sold with an assured buyback guarantee stands to come down by 6% of the retail price, capped at ₹10,000, while the price of those sold with extended battery warranties of at least five years stands to reduce by 4% up to ₹6,000. Other incentives proposed to boost consumer demand include exemption of road tax and registration charges for EVs till the year 2025 and scrappage incentives starting at ₹7,000 for e-two wheelers up to ₹25,000 for e-four wheelers. “Operational guidelines laying down the process of incentive disbursement under the policy shall be notified within 60 days from the date of notification of the policy. The incentive disbursement process will be designed to ensure transfer of incentives to the beneficiaries within 30 days from the date of incentive application. The incentives disbursement mechanism... shall be made digital to ensure timely transfer to beneficiaries,” stated the presentation reviewed by the CM. On the supply side, the state proposed to incentivise as many as 15,500 public and semi-public EV charging stations, though these incentives will not be available for stations already availing of benefits under FAME-II scheme. For slow charging stations up to 3.3kW, incentives will cover up to 60% of the cost of the unit — excluding cost of land — with a maximum incentive of ₹10,000 each. For moderate and fast charging stations above 3.3kW, incentives will cover up to 50% of the cost, at a maximum of ₹500,000 each. The tariff applicable for all EV charging stations and battery swapping stations in the state has been fixed at between ₹4 and ₹6.6 per unit, as per a March 2020 order issued by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory commission (MERC). The government will also create a single-window process for installing EV connections that offer EV-specific tariffs. The EV Policy 2021 also recommends that amenity spaces for EV charging stations be earmarked in development plans of various cities, and that all cities under the National Clean Air Programme prepare a charging infrastructure plan to identify potential locations that can be harnessed to set up EV charging infrastructure. “There will be a particular focus on setting up these stations in already existing petrol pumps,” said a transport department official. Meanwhile, state industries, energy and labour departments will provide manufacturers of vehicles, batteries and other ancillary products with all benefits under the ‘D+’ category of mega projects under Maharashtra’s New Industrial Policy (2019), regardless of whether these manufacturing units will be set up. This means the state will refund 60% of total capital investment in the entity, over a period of 10 years. Officials said the state will not be directly investing in the EV policy, but will rely on strategic, personal investments made by global players in electric mobility to boost infrastructure development. Speaking at a webinar last month, Ashish Singh, ACS transport, had said, “The state is not going to directly invest in the EV policy. Instead, we will incentivise investment from bigger players in terms of tax concessions, land availability, and so on. Till date, we have not invested any money in producing cars or internal combustion engines either.”Importantly, urban local bodies will also provide rebates on property tax to residential establishments that set up EV charging infrastructure on their premises. In fact, the policy targets that all upcoming residential complexes should have 20% of their parking spots dedicated for EVs by 2025. Specific policy measures, details of which are not yet publicly available, have also been drafted to encourage fleet aggregators such as cab services, last-mile delivery providers and logistics companies to transition to EVs. The policy also aims to substitute all government vehicles in major cities with EVs, starting April 2022, officials privy to the developments had confirmed last month. HT had reported the development on May 28. Other goals of the policy include converting around 25% of the existing public transport infrastructure and last-mile delivery vehicles in five major cities to fully electric mode and conversion of 15% of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation’s existing bus fleet of 18,000 vehicles to electric mode by 2025. This is not the first EV transportation policy of the state. Maharashtra had earlier adopted an EV policy in February 2018 which was drafted by the state department of industries. However, that policy had focused largely on attracting investment and providing incentives to end users which, officials said, was not enough for manufacturers to enter the market. The current draft policy aims to remedy that by incentivising infrastructure creation, which will spur demand. Avinash Dhakne, transport commissioner, could not be reached for comment. Ashish Singh, additional chief secretary, transport department, confirmed that the EV Policy 2021 is likely to receive the cabinet’s assent “very soon,” but declined to comment further. Independent experts have viewed the draft policy favourably thus far. “Overall, demand side incentives have been made more comprehensive, with a few good practices adopted from other state EV policies (specifically Delhi’s) but also, with a few unique policies such as the early bird discount and the extended battery warranty and buyback agreement for EVs,” said Madhav Pai, executive director of the WRI India Ross Center. Purchase subsidies are now based on battery capacity rather than base price of vehicle, allowing subsidies to be more effectively deployed. On the supply side, incentives have been provided in line with the Maharashtra Industrial Policy, with EV industries able to avail the most favourable category of incentives, experts pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtranew-e-vehicles-policy-to-bring-cut-in-prices-road-tax-101624474183383.html
24-06-2021||Lucknow||Nishad party chief wants BJP to project him as deputy CM in 2022 UP assembly polls||Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (Nishad) party chief Sanjay Nishad on Wednesday demanded that the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) should project him as deputy chief minister in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections to win the support of the backward communities.Along with a berth in the Union council of ministers, the Nishad party should also be given representation in the state cabinet before the elections, he said.By doing so, the BJP should send a message to the Majhwar, Kewat, Mallah, Nishad and Bind communities that they would get a share in power, he said. The votes of these communities were decisive in around 160 assembly constituencies in east and central UP, he added.Sanjay Nishad was in Lucknow on Wednesday to meet chief minister Yogi Adityanath and other senior BJP leaders.Earlier, on June 10, he met Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda in Delhi to discuss the alliance for the 2022 assembly election. He landed in Lucknow after BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, along with the party’s UP in-charge Radha Mohan Singh, completed two days’ meetings to discuss the election strategy.Nishad said when his party joined hands with the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP leaders had promised that Majhwar, Kewat and Mallah communities would be included in the list of Scheduled Castes.Besides, the BJP had promised that fake cases will be withdrawn from the community members, he said.Even after over two years, the promises had not been fulfilled yet, Nishad said.The BJP had got a taste of the discontent among the backward communities in the three-tier panchayat elections held in April, he said.The independents and Opposition parties won the maximum zila panchayat ward seats, he added.The BJP was aware that it won the 2017 UP assembly election with the support of the backward and Scheduled Caste communities.Now, the BJP must fulfil its promises to win the confidence of the backward classes, he said.Launched in 2016, the Nishad party joined an alliance with the BJP before the 2019 Lok Sabha election.Sanjay Nishad’s son Praveen Kumar Nishad was elected to the Lok Sabha from Sant Kabir Nagar in eastern Uttar Pradesh. In the 2018 Lok Sabha by-poll, the Nishad party had been in the Opposition camp and it gave a jolt to the BJP by winning the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat. The SP and the BSP had supported the Nishad party in the contest for the prestigious seat vacated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nishad-party-chief-wants-bjp-to-project-him-as-deputy-cm-in-2022-up-assembly-polls-101624474064085.html
24-06-2021||Chandigarh||PU should have explored other options to invigilate online exams, say experts||For the third time since last year, Panjab University (PU) has decided to conduct the semester exams in online mode without any kind of invigilation.However, experts say that the varsity could have explored other options even if it had to conduct the exams online. The upcoming semester exams are to be held from June 28 with no mechanism to curb mass cheating. The varsity was considering using image proctoring this time but could not finalise the same.Before their term ended on December 31, the syndicate members of the university had also urged vice-chancellor Raj Kumar that semester exams should be held offline.PU’s former controller of exams, Parvinder Singh, who is vice-chancellor of a private university, said, “A few models could have been explored by the university. They could have changed the question paper structure and introduced objectivity to minimise the use of unfair means.”“Proctoring could have been an option and the university should have spent on it or they could have outsourced the exams,” he said.A former senator said, “The open book exam is certainly a better option. That gives better results. We can have multiple sets of question papers as well, where students of the same college have to solve different papers.”What other universities are doingAn official at Kurukshetra University said they have been conducting the semester exams in online mode since last year with proctoring. “A group of students is assigned to a teacher for supervision during the exams through Google Meet,” he said.Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU), Amritsar, has conducted odd semester exams in offline mode and they are yet to take a final call on how to conduct the even semester exams.Like Delhi University and Jamia Millia Islamia, PU university could have held an open-book exam in the absence of real-time surveillance. It would mean students have the option of consulting their study material while attempting the paper. But the questions would be framed in a manner that would require them to put their analytical skills to use. This would require them to prepare well beforehand to be able to finish the exam in time.PU should prepare for future, says former V-CFormer PU vice-chancellor Arun Kumar Grover said, “At present, the university can do very little regarding this, but they should prepare for the future, be it online teaching, exams or research.”Controller of examinations Jagat Bhushan said, “We were planning to conduct exams offline, but due to the second Covid wave, online mode was chosen. We tried to introduce proctoring in exams, but due to procedural limitations that was not finalised. We are an affiliating university, and we have students in far-flung areas with poor internet connectivity and international students facing travelling restrictions. We had to consider everything before taking a decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pu-should-have-explored-other-options-to-invigilate-online-exams-say-experts-101624473833107.html
24-06-2021||Chandigarh||Convicted in 40 cases, snatcher caught again in Panchkula||A 36-year-old snatcher who has been active in the tricity for two decades and convicted in around 40 cases was nabbed for yet another crime, the Panchkula police said on Wednesday.Identified as Devendra Singh, alias Vikki, he along with an accomplice had fled with a woman’s gold chain in Sector 16, Panchkula, on June 4. The duo was arrested from Dera Bassi, following a tip-off on Tuesday. The aide has been identified as Sumit Kumar, alias Shagun, 24, of Karnal, who joined Vikki only recently, said police. They were produced in court on Wednesday, which sent them to two-day police remand.“Vikki was active in the tricity between 2004 and 2016. He was arrested in at least 100 snatching cases, and found guilty in around 40 of them. He was in jail between 2016 and 2020, and once again became active on being released,” said inspector Aman Kumar, in-charge, crime branch, Panchkula police. The snatcher also carries a reward of ₹5,000 on him.Modus operandiInspector Kumar said that Vikki used to roam around on a bike and target women who were wearing jewellery and walking alone. To evade cops, he used leave the city after each incident. “He had rented rooms in Zirakpur and Panchkula. He belongs to Delhi and had a hideout in Noida too. After committing a snatching in the tricity, he would move to Delhi. After targeting someone there, he used to return to the tricity,” said the crime branch in-charge.Recently, he was involved in some snatching incidents in Mohali as well, said police. No recoveries have been made yet, and police will be taking him to his house in Delhi on Thursday, where some seizures are expected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/convicted-in-40-cases-snatcher-caught-again-in-panchkula-101624473764530.html

We also informed them about the law as they can’t leave a baby like that and will have to face criminal action.” They understood and came back, he added. On Wednesday, the hospital and district administration brought the parents back to the hospital.The infant’s mother denied that they abandoned her, insisting that they had gone back to the village to discuss the child’s medical condition. “We didn’t leave the girl… We went to our village to discuss the condition of the baby with the elders,” she said.“The baby was born 6 years after marriage… We will not leave her,” he said. Dr Raghuvanshi said the baby was under treatment because she weighs less than 2 kg. “Once she gets stable, we will refer the baby to Hamidia Hospital, Bhopal… orthopedic doctors will treat her.”Clubfoot is estimated to afflict nearly 50,000 babies in the country every year and can often be treated by use of miniature plaster casts. If it is not treated, it can make it hard for a child to walk without a limp.(With inputs from Ram Parashar from Harda)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-couple-abandons-newborn-with-clubfoot-returns-after-hospital-reaches-outdoc-101624473584048.html

24-06-2021||Delhi||Every 10-unit rise in PM levels leads to 7 hospital admissions in Delhi||New Delhi: Every 10-unit increase in ultra-fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) leads to at least seven respiratory distress-related hospital admissions in Delhi every week, a study conducted by Maulana Azad Medical College shows.The study that was commissioned by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) was carried out over a span of 15 months, starting April 2019. The researchers studied admission records of six big government hospitals—Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, Lok Nayak Hospital, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital and Madan Mohan Malviya Hospital, according to a press note released on Wednesday. The DPCC did not share the detailed report.According to the study, increase in cases of bronchitis, bronchial asthma is directly proportional to the increase in the air quality index (AQI) in Delhi.The study , led by Dr Nandini Sharma, former dean and the head of the department of community medicine (MAMC), also collected community-based data on activity levels of people (if people are more exposed to outdoor activity), perceived stress, awareness about the causes of pollution, and perceived interventions required for improving air quality from 1,879 people across 11 districts in the national capital.It was found that 96.5% of respondents of the survey believed that vehicular emissions was a major contributor to air pollution in Delhi, while 77% said it was industrial pollution.Around 65% of respondents attributed poor air quality to waste burning, 46% said it was due to construction activities, and 28% of Delhiites blamed stubble burning and firecrackers for air pollution.Another air quality analysis conducted by climate communications initiative, Climate Trends, showed that pollution levels in Delhi dropped significantly during the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown (March, April and May), but the 2021 lockdown was not as effective in improving air quality.The analysis showed that Delhi’s average PM 2.5 concentration in the months March, April and May dipped from 95.6 ug/m3 in 2019 to 69 ug/m3 in 2020. However, in 2021 in the same period, the levels bounced back to 95ug/m3. The safe limits for PM 2.5 levels in India according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was 40ug/m3.Along with Delhi, the analysis also showed the fluctuation in pollution levels in Kolkata, Lucknow and Mumbai during the same period.Mumbai’s average concentration of PM 2.5 between March and May in 2019 was 21.6 ug/m3, which increased to 31.3 ug/m3 in 2020, and then to 40.3 ug/m3. The analysis showed that in Kolkata’s PM 2.5 concentration swayed from 41.8ug/m3 in 2019 to 27.9 ug/m3 in 2020 and 37.3 ug/m3 in 2021.In Lucknow, PM 2.5 concentration in the three months decrease consistently from 2019, but it still remained above permissible limits. Its average PM 2.5 concentration in 2019 for the months of March, April and May was 103 ug/m3 which dipped to 92 ug/m3 in 2020 during lockdown and further to 79.6 ug/m3 in 2021.“Lockdown has provided an opportunity to examine the background pollution in the atmosphere when everything was shut down in 2020; atmosphere was fairly clean. However, we did not meet the condition of 40ug/m3 prescribed by the CPCB. We need to redefine the natural conditions in India, for which particulate matter concentrations are more than 50-60ug/m3 even in the clean atmosphere in north India,” said professor SK Dhaka, from Rajdhani College, Delhi University.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment said, “Air pollution is known to cause irreparable damage to residents’ health, and it is seen through several analysis that long term exposure leads to some serious repercussions. The government and the public will have to come together to implement long term, holistic measures to ensure that our future generations can lead healthy lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/every-10-unit-rise-in-pm-levels-leads-to-7-hospital-admissions-in-delhi-dpccstudy-101624472444345.html
24-06-2021||Delhi||In separate cases, two women stabbed by their husbands; Murder cases filed||Two women were murdered by their husbands in two separate incidents. Police have pressed murder charges on the suspects in both the cases.In the first case reported from north east Delhi’s New Usmanpur, 71-year-old Abdul Hakim stabbed his wife to death. Hakim’s daughter-in-law Heena informed police that he and his wife Zainab (70) had a fight over some issue some weeks ago, following which they were living separately in two different floors of their house. In her police statement, Heena said that on Tuesday afternoon, while she was talking to her mother-in-law, Hakim came to their room on the first floor and stabbed Zainab.“I tried to save her but he stabbed me on the shoulder.

24-06-2021||Delhi||All vaccination centres to open for 18+, Delhi administers 109,000 doses||Age will be no bar at vaccination centres in Delhi from Wednesday, health minister Satyendar Jain said, adding that government centres will vaccinate all beneficiaries aged above 18 years, and also allow walk-in registrations.On Wednesday, Delhi administered 109,646 doses, according to the Co-WIN dashboard. On Tuesday, 84,539 doses were administered.“Today (Wednesday) onwards, there will only be one vaccination category that is 18+. Now all the centres will be common and anyone can go to any of the centres to get the shot. Walk-ins have also been allowed, so people can come without booking a slot,” Jain said at briefing on Wednesday.“Now that the Centre is procuring and supplying free doses for everyone over the age of 18 years, there is only one category. All vaccines will be used to immunise everyone. Since there is a shortage of Covaxin, it is being administered only at a few centres,” said Jain.With the government providing Covaxin to only those whose second shot is due, Jain did not say when the government will start administering Covaxin for the first dose.Earlier this month, the state government directed all centres – public and private – to stop administering Covaxin as the first dose to those between the ages of 18 and 45 years to conserve the doses for those who need the second shot.When asked about the allegations of the “slow” progress of the vaccination drive by the state BJP, Jain said: “We are not doing what Madhya Pradesh is doing. We are not vaccinating people for a photo-op or an event. We are giving 75,000 to 80,000 shots daily. We have immunised more people yesterday than day before and today more than yesterday, unlike MP, which couldn’t even vaccinate 1% of the number they did on Day 1. Vaccination drive is not meant for just a day.”With walk-ins being allowed, residents who were struggling to book online slots thronged centres across the city on Wednesday. At many places, the beneficiaries said the process was hassle-free and better than trying for days to get a slot on the CoWin app.At Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Kalkaji, people could avail of the walk-in facility until noon. “We live in the neighbourhood and decided to walk in after we got to know about the vaccination drive from the news. The experience has been smooth so far,” said Yashika Kanoija (18), who came to the centre along with her family.At a government school in Pooth Kalan, Rohini, people were able to get vaccinated without any hassle. Shashank, who goes by his first name, tweeted that the centre had excellent arrangements for people who were walking in without registration.But there were some who ended up visiting multiple sites because they were unaware of sites where the walk-in registration was facilitated. People were seen enquiring about vaccination for 18+ category both at Shyama Prasad Mukharjee Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Chittaranjan Park, and School of Excellence, Kalkaji.“We saw on TV that one could simply walk in and get the vaccine. But here, they are only vaccinating people in the 45+ category. They are asking us to visit other centres now,” said Manav Kapur, who visited the School of Excellence centre in Kalkaji but was turned away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/all-vaccination-centres-to-open-for-18-delhi-administers-109-000-doses-101624472383467.html
24-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt gives ₹10,000 each to 1,825 construction workers as Covid relief||The Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board has granted Covid-19 relief disbursement of ₹10,000 each to 1,825 construction workers, the city administration said in a statement on Wednesday.The Delhi government has already disbursed ₹5,000 each to 217,039 construction workers as Covid relief this year. The ₹10,000 aid comes as an additional benefit for construction workers who are hit hardest due to the lockdown in Delhi.“I urge all construction workers who were member of the board before 30th September, 2018 to renew their membership with construction board so that they are able to receive disbursement benefits,” said deputy chief minister and labour minister Manish Sisodia.More than 10,000 construction workers will receive the amount in the coming weeks. “When the first lockdown was imposed due to the pandemic last year, the Delhi government was one of the first governments in the country to grant relief disbursement to all the 39,600 workers who were registered with the board in March 2020. After I took charge of the labour department in November 2020, inspections and mass registration drives were conducted in Delhi’s labour offices. As a result of this, within six months, the number of construction workers registered with the board has increased to 2.38 lakh,” Sisodia said.The registration process of construction workers has been made online, Sisodia said. “Earlier, a worker had to stand in long queues for hours to submit his/her application, but since the entire process is online it will help every worker to easily apply to the government and get his/her daily wage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-gives-10-000-each-to-1-825-construction-workers-as-covid-relief-101624472263897.html

24-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s bulletin adds 740 backlog cases from Safdarjung hospital in 2 days||The Capital added 477 backlog cases of Covid-19, or old infections that went unreported on previous days, to its tally on Wednesday — the second day in a row that such cases were added to the city’s records. On Tuesday, 263 infections from “earlier weeks” were added to the city’s Covid tally, said the government’s health bulletin.The 740 backlog infections reported on these two days are originally from “May-end” in Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and the associated Safdarjung Hospital (both of which are run by the central government) that had not been updated in the national Covid-19 database due to “confusion” that stemmed from a senior official at the hospital having to quarantine, said senior hospital personnel who asked not to be named.A Delhi government spokesperson said, “The hospitals in question are run by the central government. They directly upload Covid-19 data on the centralised portal. We have nothing to comment on this.”As per the Delhi government’s health bulletin, Delhi on Tuesday and Wednesday added 111 and 134 new cases respectively. The total number of confirmed cases in the city, after accounting for the corrections, stands at 1,433,366 as on Wednesday.Officials familiar with the matter said Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital did not report these cases to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) due to “some confusion” when their microbiologist was under quarantine in May-end.“The patients as well as the doctors were informed about their reports, but somehow the cases were not added to the ICMR portal,” the senior hospital personnel quoted above said. Once the data discrepancy was noted in the records, hospital officials said they informed the Union health ministry, ICMR and the Delhi government.Officials, however, were unable to confirm whether more such cases will be added in the future.Calls and messages from HT to Safdarjung Hospital spokesperson Poonam Dhanda on Wednesday enquiring about the discrepancy went unanswered.Such statistical corrections are not uncommon in the country, particularly pertaining to infections during the brutal second wave where several states such as Maharashtra, Bihar, Uttarakhand and Punjab have been adding backlog cases and deaths in recent weeks that previously went unreported. However, the exercise generally implies that the numbers reported during the peak of the outbreak in these regions were under-reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-bulletin-adds-740-backlog-cases-from-safdarjung-hospital-in-2-days-101624472145402.html
24-06-2021||Delhi||India’s first woman Olympic medallist named V-C of Delhi Sports University||The state government on Wednesday named weightlifting champion Karnam Malleswari, the first woman to win a medal for India at the Olympics, the vice-chancellor of the upcoming Delhi Sports University.The announcement came after a meeting between chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, his deputy Manish Sisodia and Malleswari on Wednesday, which was celebrated as International Olympics Day.“Our purpose to establish the Delhi Sports University is to build and create athletes in our country who will make our nation proud,” said Sisodia as he announced Malleswari’s appointment.The state cabinet in October 2019 passed an order setting up the university in Mundka. Delhi chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal at the time, said the university will offer field-specific degrees to interested students that will be at par with those offered in other courses at the graduate, post-graduate and doctoral levels.Construction work on the university has been disrupted because of the pandemic, and has not started yet. Sisodia inspected the proposed construction site in October last year.Sisodia, who is also the state education minister, on Wednesday said the government will focus on “providing a space for individuals to build their athletic talent”, with the aim of nurturing at least “50 Olympians”.After winning a weightlifting bronze at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Malleswari was conferred the Padma Shri, Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, and Arjuna award.Sharing her vision for the university, Malleswari said university officials will start visiting schools as soon as they reopen, to scout for talent. The university plans to use existing infrastructure and coaches to identify athletic acumen in students.“Many have a keen interest in sports, but are unable to pursue their athletic dream due to a lack of infrastructure. We will identify students and match their athletic skills to the sports they are apt for,” she said.The University plans to confer degrees up to the PhD level, and students will be conferred degrees based on their sporting performance. The varsity will also streamline sports facilities and bring talented sportspersons under their ambit to prepare them for national and international competitions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/indias-first-woman-olympian-named-v-c-of-delhi-sports-university-101624472143947.html
24-06-2021||Lucknow||After unity efforts, BJP launches booth connect, rural-centric initiatives in Uttar Pradesh||A day after the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) brokered truce between chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya, the Bharatiya Janata Party got down to work, rolling out a series of booth-connect and rural centric initiatives on Wednesday. The party had also invited all former state BJP chiefs to an important party meeting on Tuesday.The party workers began work on the party’s “booth jeeta, sab jeeta (win booth, win everything)” plan on Wednesday, as did the leaders, each tasked with specific roles. The initiatives were taken with an eye on the 2022 UP assembly polls as well as making an impression in the forthcoming zila (district) panchayat chairpersons’ elections on July 3. Plantation drives till the booth level were launched on Wednesday, Jana Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee’s death anniversary. Now onwards, party workers would head to villages on the last Sunday of each month to listen to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s radio talk, Mann ki Baat, at the booth level. As many as 299 of UP’s 403 assembly constituencies have a rural or semi-rural character. The BJP had lost out to the Samajwadi Party (SP) in the first leg of the panchayat elections for zila panchayat ward members. It is now looking to make amends in the zila chairpersons’ elections. The party leadership rushed national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh twice to UP over the last 20 days to write the “unity” script in the ruling party at the state level. It was as part of this script that chief minister Yogi Adityanath drove from his 5-Kalidas Marg residence to his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya’s 7-Kalidas Marg residence on Tuesday. He had lunch there in the presence of RSS top leaders Dattatreya Hosbale and veteran Krishna Gopal, as well as the other deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma.The CM’s lunch meet was portrayed as a visit to bless Maurya’s son and daughter-in-law, who married at a simple ceremony in Rae Bareli in May due to Covid restrictions. But, political observers were quick to see beyond it. Maurya, an OBC face of his party who was the state unit chief in 2017 UP assembly polls, played down the visit. On Wednesday, he was more active than before and was part of the efforts to placate a recalcitrant, but important ally, Sanjay Nishad of the Nishad party, who is engaged in some hard pre-poll bargaining. “Politics is all about symbolism. If the chief minister’s first visit to his deputy’s place on Tuesday was powerful symbolism, his deputy’s gesture of meeting an important ally and his willingness to play the role of a troubleshooter by helping placate an ally is good news for BJP ahead of elections,” said Irshad Ilmi, a veteran journalist and political observer.Other leaders, too, were on the job. UP ministers have been asked to visit districts of which they are in charge, while Jitin Prasada, the former Congress leader who recently joined the BJP, set out on Wednesday to connect with the key upper caste Brahmin community. In his meetings with ministers, Santhosh reportedly praised Adityanath’s governance. He said that unlike in the 2017 UP polls when the party had only the Modi government’s achievements to talk about, this time the cadres should also market the achievements of the Adityanath government. In his last two visits, Santhosh has praised Adityanath through his tweets at least four times. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, has tweeted in Adityanath’s support once in this period. It was as part of the unity script that all former UP BJP chiefs, including Vinay Katiyar and Laxmikant Bajpai, were called to the UP BJP office for joint consultations by Santhosh before he left for Delhi. During Santhosh’s visit, former IAS officer- turned BJP MLC AK Sharma, a former aide of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, also publicly announced he was “happy” with his new role as UP BJP vice- president. “The government has begun accommodating cadres in commissions and boards while the party is filling up all pending party positions. The government and the party are one, we are in election mode now,” a BJP minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/after-unity-efforts-bjp-launches-grassroots-initiatives-in-up-101624470463905.html

Our team will also motivate all over 18 years of age to take Covid-19 vaccination jabs on priority. Women and child health would also be a key focus area,” Singh said. The teams would work for the empowerment of the rural women and senstise people regarding women rights and help fight social evils like dowry system and sexual harassment, she said. “We would also undertake massive plantation drive of Peepal saplings in these two villages with the help of locals,” she said. To note, the Uttar Pradesh government plans to plant 30 crore (300 million) saplings during the Van Mahotsav (Afforestation festival) beginning first week of July this year and for it had sought support from all people, including the universities, of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uprtou-to-adopt-5-more-villages-in-prayagraj-101624470404483.html

24-06-2021||World||US president, senators strike deal on $1.2 trillion infra bill||The Biden administration and a bipartisan group of US senators announced a historic deal on Thursday to spend $1.2 trillion in infrastructure spending over the next eight years.“We have a deal,” President Joe Biden said to reporters, leading the bipartisan group of senators to a press stakeout on White House grounds after a meeting.“‘I think it’s really important. None of us got whatever we all wanted. I clearly didn’t get all I wanted. They gave more than, I think, maybe they were inclined to give in the first place. But this reminds me of the days we used to get an awful lot done up in the United States Congress. We actually worked.”In a tweet, he added, “We’ve struck a deal. A group of senators - five Democrats and five Republicans - has come together and forged an infrastructure agreement that will create millions of American jobs.”The deal was worked at back-to-back meetings between White House officials and senators, with the key difference being on how to pay for the bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-senators-strike-deal-on-1-2-trillion-infra-bill-101624556691365.html
24-06-2021||World||'We have deal': Biden gives green light to bipartisan infrastructure plan||President Joe Biden announced on Thursday that “we have a deal,” signaling a bipartisan agreement on a $953 billion infrastructure plan that would achieve his top legislative priority and validate his efforts to reach across the political aisle.Biden made a surprise appearance in front of the cameras with members of the group of senators, Republicans and Democrats, after an agreement was reached Thursday. Details of the deal were scarce to start, but the pared-down plan, with $559 billion in new spending, has rare bipartisan backing and could open the door to the president’s more sweeping $4 trillion proposals later on.The president said not everyone got what they wanted and that other White House priorities would be done separately in a congressional budget process known as reconciliation“We’ve struck a deal,” Biden then tweeted. “A group of senators – five Democrats and five Republicans – has come together and forged an infrastructure agreement that will create millions of American jobs.”We’ve struck a deal. A group of senators – five Democrats and five Republicans – has come together and forged an infrastructure agreement that will create millions of American jobs.The senators have struggled over how to pay for the new spending but left for the White House with a sense of confidence that funding issues had been addressed.Biden’s top aides had met with senators for back-to-back meetings on Capitol Hill and later huddled with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.Also Read | Hunter Biden’s escapade with escort woman cost Joe Biden over ₹18 lakh: ReportThe agreement comes with a complex legislative push. Pelosi on Thursday welcomed the bipartisan package, but she warned that it must be paired with the president’s bigger goals now being prepared by Congress under a separate so-called the budget reconciliation process.“This is important,” Pelosi said. “There ain't going to be a bipartisan bill without a reconciliation bill,”The Democratic leader vowed the House would not vote on it until the Senate had dealt with both packages.The major hurdle for a bipartisan agreement has been financing. Biden demanded no new taxes on anyone making less than $400,000, while Republican lawmakers were unwilling to raise taxes beyond such steps as indexing the gasoline tax to inflation. But senators departed for the White House Thursday with a sense of confidence that funding issues had been addressed.“We’re still refining the details, but from my perspective, it is paid for," said Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican and one of 10 lawmakers who met with Biden for roughly 30 minutes.Republican Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said he was confident the agreement had Biden's backing.“We wouldn’t be going there if he wasn’t supportive of the deal,” said Cassidy, adding that the president ”wants to make it flourish.One member of the bipartisan group, Republican Rob Portman of Ohio, met privately ahead of the White House meeting with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell at the Capitol and said afterward that the Kentucky senator “remains open-minded and he’s listening still.”Biden has sought $1.7 trillion in his American Jobs Plan, part of nearly $4 trillion in broad infrastructure spending on roads, bridges and broadband internet but also including the so-called care economy of child care centers, hospitals and elder care.With Republicans opposed to Biden’s proposed corporate tax rate increase, from 21% to 28%, the group has looked at other ways to raise revenue. Biden rejected their idea to allow gas taxes paid at the pump to rise with inflation, viewing it as a financial burden on American drivers.The broad reconciliation bill would likely include tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, so a tension still exists over funding for some Republicans and business groups. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce came out Thursday applauding the bipartisan infrastructure agreement, but Neil Bradley, its executive vice president, warned that “some in Congress are trying to torpedo the deal” unless they get trillions in additional spending.“These are the kind of tactics that have created the mess we are in today, and they must be rejected,” Bradley said.According to a White House readout of the Wednesday meeting with Schumer and Pelosi, the leaders talked with acting Budget Director Shalanda Young, National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice, and they discussed the two-track approach — the smaller bipartisan deal now emerging and the more sweeping plan of Democratic priorities.Schumer said the leaders “support the concepts” they have heard from the bipartisan negotiations.The Democratic leaders also insisted on the two-part process ahead, starting with initial votes in July to consider the bipartisan deal and to launch the lengthy procedure for the Democrats' proposal, now drafted at nearly $6 trillion.The Democrats' bigger proposal would run through the budget reconciliation process, which would allow passage of Biden's priorities by majority vote, without the need for support from Republicans to overcome the Senate's 60-vote threshold. It would require multiple rounds of voting that are likely to extend into fall.Like Pelosi, Schumer said, “One can’t be done without the other.”That's a signal to both parties of the road ahead. Liberal Democrats have been wary of the bipartisan effort because they see it as insufficient and worry it will take the place of Biden's bigger plan. Republicans are also skeptical of passing a bipartisan bill only to be faced with an even bigger Democratic plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-have-deal-biden-gives-green-light-to-bipartisan-infrastructure-plan-101624555443173.html
24-06-2021||World||Astronomers find out when first stars shone, could be seen by Nasa’s Webb telescope||Astronomers have calculated the period when the universe was first bathed in starlight, known as the “cosmic dawn”. According to a new study, the first stars started shining as early as 150 to 250 million years after the big bang, when dark matter haloes were sufficiently massive to induce star formation.The astronomers analysed six of the most distant galaxies and worked out their age to calculate the start of cosmic dawn. The study, led by Dr Nicolas Laporte, from the Kavli Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, was published on Thursday in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.“The Holy Grail has been to look back far enough that you would be able to see the very first generation of stars and galaxies. And now we have the first convincing evidence of when the Universe was first bathed in starlight," BBC News quoted Richard Ellis, co-author of the study, as saying.According to the BBC report, the results suggest that the first galaxies will be bright enough to be seen by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope, the world’s largest and most powerful space telescope targeted for October 31 launch.Also Read | Mystery of ‘see-through’ galaxy deepens after new Hubble observation: NasaA team of scientists will train Webb on six of the most distant and luminous quasars, the active supermassive black holes that are millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun.

Our vaccines do not come with strings attached. We are doing this with the singular objective of saving lives," said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-send-3-million-johnson-johnson-one-shot-covid-19-vaccine-to-brazil-101624549994474.html
24-06-2021||World||51 people unaccounted for in Florida building collapse, say officials||Hundreds of fire and rescue workers scoured through tons of rubble on Thursday after a 12-story oceanfront residential building partially collapsed in southern Florida, with at least one person dead and 51 still unaccounted for, officials said.Sally Heyman, a Miami-Dade County Commissioner, said officials have been unable to make contact with 51 people who "supposedly" live in the building, home to a mix of people including families and part-time "snow birds" who spend the winter months in Florida."We have 51 people that were assumed to have been there, but you don't know between vacations or anything else, so we're still waiting," Heyman told CNN by phone. "The hope is still there, but it's waning."A fire official said 35 people were rescued from the building in Surfside, a seaside enclave of 5,700 residents on a barrier island across Biscayne Bay from the city of Miami, including two who were pulled from the rubble as response teams used trained dogs and drones in a search for survivors.After speaking with local officials, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said it was possible that more victims could be found in the rubble. He said he planned to go to scene."We'll hope for the best in terms of additional recoveries, but we are bracing for some bad news, just given the destruction that we’re seeing," DeSantis said at an event at a community college near Tampa.Built in 1981, the Champlain Towers South had more than 130 units, about 80 of which were occupied.It was unclear how many people were inside at 1:30 a.m. (0530 GMT), when an entire side of the building pulled away and fell to the ground below."It's hard to imagine how this could have happened," Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett told reporters. "Buildings just don't fall down."Construction work was being done on the roof, he said, but it was unclear whether the project involved any heavy gear.Footage from WPLG Local 10, a Miami TV station, showed a rescue team pulling a boy from piles of debris and rebar, and firefighters using ladder trucks to rescue residents trapped on balconies.Assistant Fire Chief of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Raide Jadallah said that rescuers were moving in "heavy equipment" and working to support the remaining structure of the building."We are still continuing the search and rescue operations," Jadallah said.Burkett said that part of the building with balconies facing the beach "pancaked" where one floor appears to have fallen atop another, cascading down."The back of the building, probably a third or more, is totally pancaked," he said.Resident Barry Cohen and his wife were rescued from the building."At first it sounded like a flash of lightning or thunder," Cohen, a former vice mayor of Surfside and a resident of the building, told reporters at the scene. "But then it just kept on -- steadily for at least 15 to 30 seconds -- it just kept on going and going and going."Cohen also said there had been construction for more than a month on the building's roof.The Miami-Dade Police have assumed control of the investigation. More than 80 fire and rescue units responded, the Miami-Dade County Fire Rescue Department wrote in a Twitter message early Thursday.Eyewitness video obtained by Reuters showed neighbors gathering across the street from the rubble."This whole building here, it's completely gone," a person can be heard saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/51-people-unaccounted-for-in-florida-building-collapse-say-officials-101624548531545.html
24-06-2021||World||WHO estimates most vulnerable to Covid-19 would require annual vaccine boosters||The World Health Organization (WHO) forecasts that people most vulnerable to Covid-19, such as the elderly, will need to get an annual vaccine booster to be protected against variants, an internal document seen by Reuters shows.The estimate is included in a report, which is to be discussed on Thursday at a board meeting of Gavi, a vaccine alliance that co-leads the WHO's Covid-19 vaccine programme COVAX. The forecast is subject to changes and is also paired with two other less likely scenarios.Vaccine makers Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc, with its German partner BioNTech, have been vocal in their view that the world will soon need booster shots to maintain high levels of immunity, but the evidence for this is still unclear.The document shows that the WHO considers annual boosters for high-risk individuals as its "indicative" baseline scenario, and boosters every two years for the general population.It does not say how these conclusions were reached, but shows that under the base scenario new variants would continue to emerge and vaccines would be regularly updated to meet these threats.The UN agency declined to comment on the content of the internal document while Gavi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The document, which is dated June 8 and is still "work in progress", also predicts under the base case that 12 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses will be produced globally next year.That would be slightly higher than the forecast of 11 billion doses for this year cited by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA), signalling that the UN agency does not expect a significant ramp-up of vaccine production in 2022.The document predicts manufacturing problems, regulatory approval issues and "transition away from some technology platforms" as potential drags on supplies next year.It does not signal which technologies could be phased out, but the European Union, which has reserved the world's largest volume of Covid-19 vaccines, has bet heavily on shots using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, such as those by Pfizer and Moderna, and has forgone some purchases of viral vector vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.Worst-case scenarioThe scenarios will be used to define the WHO's global vaccination strategy and the forecasts may change as new data emerge on the role of boosters and the duration of vaccine protection, Gavi says in another document, also seen by Reuters.So far about 2.5 billion doses have been administered worldwide, mostly in rich countries where over half of the population has received at least one dose, whereas in many poorer countries less than 1% has been vaccinated, according to Gavi's estimates.This gap could widen next year under the WHO's most pessimistic forecast, as the need for annual boosters could push once again poorer nations to the back of the queue.In its worst-case scenario, the UN agency says production would be 6 billion doses next year, due to stringent regulation for new shots and manufacturing issues with existing ones.That could be compounded by the need for annual boosters for the entire world, and not just the most vulnerable, to combat variants and limited duration of protection.In the more optimistic situation, all vaccines in the pipeline would get authorised and production capacity would ramp up to about 16 billion doses to meet demand. Vaccines would also be shared equitably across the world.There would be no need for boosters as vaccines would show strong efficacy against variants and long protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-estimates-most-vulnerable-to-covid-19-would-require-annual-vaccine-boosters-101624546684129.html

In an interview with CNN, Wu said that the government of Taiwan cannot take any chances, given China’s unwillingness to renounce the use of force and frequent military exercises around the island.The warning comes a week after the island reported the largest daily incursion by the Chinese air force as they entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone (ADIZ). The incursion involved 14 J-16 and six J-11 fighters, as well as four H-6 bombers, which can carry nuclear weapons, and anti-submarine, electronic warfare and early warning aircraft, as per Taiwan’s defence ministry.The latest incursion is the largest since the defence ministry began regularly reporting PLA activities in Taiwan's ADIZ last year. The previous record was of 25 aircraft reported on April 12, 2021. In the past, China has described such missions as necessary to protect the country's sovereignty and to deal with "collusion" between Taiwan and the United States."As Taiwan decision makers, we cannot take any chances, we have to be prepared," Wu told CNN in Taipei. "When the Chinese government is saying they would not renounce the use of force, and they conduct military exercises around Taiwan, we would rather believe that it is real.”Also Read | Taiwan condemns political oppression after closure of Hong Kong dailyBeijing has been pushing for “peaceful reunification” of Taiwan with China under “one country, two systems”, which has threatened Taiwan’s claim of sovereignty. Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-Wen has long maintained that the self-governed island can not accept China’s “one country, two systems” policy which undermines the “cross-strait status quo.”Wu said that China’s attempt to undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy using draconian security law has shown that Taiwan’s sovereignty is crucial to protect the world’s only Chinese speaking democracy. "If you look at the situation in Hong Kong, it is a modern tragedy," Wu said.The Group of Seven richest democracies, or G7, recently issued a joint communique underscoring the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and encouraged the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-needs-to-prepare-for-military-conflict-with-china-says-foreign-minister-wu-101624543961154.html
24-06-2021||World||China carries out military drill in Tibet||China’s armed forces recently took part in a “record-breaking” high-altitude drill in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) focusing on combat training, the Chinese defence ministry said on Thursday.Organised by the Tibet Military Region, the training simulated battle situations that required integrated operations or joint training between different units of the troops deployed in the region.The ministry added that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has carried out more than 100 tactical exercises this year in which the quantity of ammunition had significantly increased.The Tibet Military Region is part of PLA’s Western Theatre Command (WTC), China’s largest command, which oversees the long and disputed border with India.The ministry did not say where in the TAR, which borders India, Nepal and Bhutan, the large-scale training took place but said the intensive training was held in altitudes over 3,700m.The drill took place in the backdrop of the ongoing military friction between India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Answering a question, the defence ministry spokesperson Colonel Ren Guoqiang said the exercise “Peak of the Snowy Region 2021” was a record-breaking mass training event for the PLA.The drills focused on three aspects: Actual combat training, training with science and technology and training soldiers according to the traits required to fight on high-altitude plateau.The activities were carried out on 23 subjects related to high-altitude battles, which included comprehensive operations by combat and sniper teams, field repair and rescue.The drills were carried out under unfamiliar geographical conditions around the clock, the spokesperson said.Earlier this year, the Tibet Military Region held a rare multi-dimensional exercise amid the ongoing New Delhi-Beijing dispute.The exercise involved ground assault forces as well as PLA’s aviation unit, which deployed attack helicopters, China’s official military media reported.The report published in the PLA Daily said a multi-dimensional exercise was being held to improve combat capabilities. “A composite brigade of the Tibet military region joined hands with the Army Aviation Force to launch a three-dimensional assault, starting a normalised joint exercise and training.”Spokesperson Ren said China has been focusing on combat-level drills through 2021.Answering a related question on PLA’s training this year, Ren said the armed forces had taken part in at least 100 tactical joint training exercises and that the use of ammunition had “significantly” increased.Ren added that all the theatre commands launched real-world mission exercises, continued to focus on the periodic rotation of combat readiness missions for trial troop training and deepened cross-domain and cross-service arms joint special training.President Xi Jinping, in 2021’s first order issued in January to the PLA, had focused on the need for “full-time combat readiness” and said the armed forces must use frontline conflicts to polish troop capabilities.Xi said the PLA must be ready to “act at any second”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-carries-out-military-drill-in-tibet-101624544749959.html

Cowessess and the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN), which represents Saskatchewan's First Nations, said in a statement that the number of newly found unmarked graves was "the most significantly substantial to date in Canada."The unmarked graves were found at the former Marieval Indian Residential School, in Saskatchewan, which operated from 1899 to 1997 about 140 kilometres east of Regina. In the 1970s, the First Nation took over the school's cemetery from the Catholic Church, which ran most of the schools. While the group didn’t reveal specific numbers, it said it would announce at a news conference on Thursday morning "the horrific and shocking discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at the site of the former Marieval Indian Residential School."The reports reveal Canada’s legacy of an abusive and assimilationist system under which the country's residential school system forcibly separated about 150,000 indigenous children from their families between 1831 and 1996. The Marieval residential school hosted indigenous children between 1899 and 1997 before it was demolished and replaced by a day school.Also Read | Canada minister says lack of papal apology in indigenous school abuse 'shameful'Many indigenous children were subjected to ill-treatment and sexual abuse, and more than 4,000 died in the schools, according to Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission which called the system "cultural genocide" in its report.Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said the news was "absolutely tragic, but not surprising. I urge all Canadians to stand with First Nations in this extremely difficult and emotional time."While Canada's federal government apologised for the system in 2008, the Roman Catholic Church, which ran most of the schools, has not apologised.Earlier this month, Pope Francis said he was pained by the news, a statement dismissed by survivors.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/horrific-hundreds-of-unmarked-graves-discovered-by-indigenous-group-in-canada-101624537595260.html
24-06-2021||World||China deleted Covid data ‘gold mine’ in possible cover-up: Study||China deleted early data on novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 in a possible attempt to conceal its existence and, therefore, impeding the investigation into its origins, a researcher has claimed in a new study. According to a scientific paper, over a dozen coronavirus test sequences that were taken during the early months of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic were removed from an international database used to track the virus' evolution."The fact that such an informative data set was deleted has implications beyond those gleaned directly from the recovered sequences. Samples from early outpatients in Wuhan are a gold mine for anyone seeking to understand the spread of the virus," the author said.Jesse Bloom, a virologist and evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, said in the report that he identified a data set containing Sars-CoV-2 sequences that had been deleted from the National Institutes of Health's Sequence Read Archive. For the study, Bloom recovered the deleted files from the Google Cloud and reconstructed partial sequences of 13 viruses from the initial outbreak.Also Read | What the world wants China to disclose in Wuhan lab leak probeThe report suggests that the sequences from Huanan Seafood Market that were the focus of the joint report prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO) and China are not “fully representative of the viruses in Wuhan early in the epidemic.” According to Bloom's research, Sars-Cov-2 was circulating in Wuhan before it was detected at local wet markets, including the Huanan Seafood Market.“There is no plausible scientific reason for the deletion...It therefore seems likely the sequences were deleted to obscure their existence,” the report said.“Particularly in light of the directive that labs destroy early samples...and multiple orders requiring approval of publications on [Covid-19], this suggests a less than wholehearted effort to trace early spread of the epidemic,” it added.The report titled ‘Recovery of Deleted Deep Sequencing Data Sheds More Light on the Early Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic’ has not been peer-reviewed yet and is available on a pre-print server.In a statement on Wednesday, NIH confirmed that some of the earliest samples of coronavirus in China were removed from the international database where they were initially stored at the request of Chinese researchers. The researcher asked that the data be removed “to avoid version control issues”, saying the sequence information had been updated and was being submitted to another database, according to the US agency.“Submitting investigators hold the rights to their data and can request withdrawal of the data,” the agency said. “NIH can’t speculate on motive beyond the investigator’s stated intentions.”The mystery around the source of Covid-19 has further intensified after a series of revelations gave the lab-leak theory a fillip. Last week, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said China will face 'isolation in the international community' if Beijing does not cooperate with a further probe into the origin of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-deleted-covid-data-gold-mine-in-possible-cover-up-study-101624535964659.html
24-06-2021||World||UK man tested Covid positive for 10 straight months, hospitalised 7 times||A 72-year-old British man tested positive for coronavirus for 10 months in what is thought to be the longest recorded case of continuous infection, researchers said on Thursday.Dave Smith, a retired driving instructor from Bristol in western England, said he tested positive 43 times, was hospitalised seven times and had made plans for his funeral."I'd resigned myself, I'd called the family in, made my peace with everybody, said goodbye,", he told BBC television.His wife, Linda, who quarantined with him at home, said: "There was a lot of times when we didn't think he was going to pull through. It's been a hell of a year".Ed Moran, a consultant in infectious diseases at the University of Bristol and North Bristol NHS Trust, said Smith "had active virus in his body" throughout."We were able to prove that by sending a sample of his virus to university partners who managed to grow it, proving that it was not just left-over products that were triggering a PCR test but actually active, viable virus."Smith recovered after treatment with a cocktail of synthetic antibodies developed by the US biotech firm Regeneron.This was allowed on compassionate grounds in his case but the treatment regime is not clinically approved for use in Britain.Results of a clinical trial published this month showed the treatment reduced deaths among severe Covid patients who are unable to mount a strong immune response."It's like you've been given your life back", Smith told the BBC.He and his wife cracked open a bottle of champagne when he finally tested negative, 45 days after receiving the Regeneron drug and some 305 days after his first infection.Smith's treatment was not part of an official medical trial but his case is now being studied by virologist Andrew Davidson at the University of Bristol.A paper on his case will be presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases in July, saying that his is thought to be "the longest infection recorded in the literature"."Where does the virus hide away in the body? How can it stay just persistently infecting people? We don't know that," Davidson said.Smith had a history of lung disease and had recently recovered from leukaemia when he caught the virus in March 2020.He told The Guardian daily that since his recovery, he still gets breathless but has travelled in Britain and is teaching his granddaughter to drive."I've been down to the bottom and everything's brilliant now," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-man-tested-covid-positive-for-10-straight-months-hospitalised-7-times-101624531352127.html

He also expressed his hopes of eradicating polio in the coming year.“This time last year we had 56 reported cases - this year so far only 1 case. InshaAllah we will eradicate polio completely in the coming year,” Khan said.The Gates Foundation in collaboration with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) supplies technical and financial resources for community-driven immunisation programs. The foundation also runs emergency operations centres in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Wild poliovirus currently impacts only two countries in the world-Afghanistan and Pakistan. In early June, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led government launched a nationwide drive to eradicate polio by the end of this year. However, the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has hampered the drive’s reach to a considerable extent, according to UNICEF’s estimates.The eradication programme is also marred by frequent attacks on local healthcare workers. A few days after the launch of the national program gunmen on a motorcycle shot and killed two police officers assigned to protect polio vaccination workers in northwest Pakistan, reported the Associated Press.Khan also said that he asked Bill Gates’s if a Microsoft incubation lab could be set up in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spoke-with-bill-gates-last-night-imran-khan-on-pakistan-s-polio-eradication-programme-101624531254046.html

The Sichuan-Tibet railway is a major transport construction project of the 14th five-year plan that covers the period from 2021 to 2025.China has been rapidly developing infrastructure in Nyingchi, which like the rest of TAR is not accessible to foreign journalists and diplomats. The Chinese government is building the Sichuan-Tibet railway’s Ya’an-Nyingchi section, which will be 1,011km in length and include 26 stations when completed - taking the railway right up to the boundary with India.The state media report added that its completion and opening is a realisation of “everyone’s dream of ‘getting on a train to Nyingchi’, and it is of great significance to help rural revitalisation and promote the high-quality development of Tibet”.The city of Nyingchi already has a functional airport, which is said to be of dual use – civil and military.The Lhasa-Nyingchi highway, too, has been in operation for two years.The 409.2km highway cuts travel time between the two cities in TAR from eight hours to four hours.In May, China completed the construction of a strategically significant highway through the world’s deepest canyon in TAR on the Brahmaputra river (known as Yarlung Zangbo in China), connecting remote areas along the Arunachal border.It was the “second significant passageway” to Medog county that borders Arunachal, the Xinhua news agency reported in May, directly connecting the Pad township in Nyingchi to Baibung in Medog county.Earlier this year, China’s state planning organisation, the National Development and Reform Commission, said it will strengthen construction of railway projects, which are strategic for border defence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tibets-1st-electric-railway-line-near-india-border-to-be-inaugurated-on-friday-101624520926137.html

The terror attack claimed 329 lives. The flight used to operate on the Montreal to Delhi route via London.The terror attack is recognised in Canada as a National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the “despicable act of terror remains the deadliest terrorist attack in Canada’s history. Sadly, it was not the last time Canada had to confront the malice of terrorism”.Family members of the victims said Canada needed to remain “vigilant” about terrorism. Among them is Deepak Khandelwal, who was 17 when he lost his elder sisters, Chandra and Manju. “Canada has to learn from the past, from these types of mistakes,” he said, adding that he was painfully reminded of his sisters’ absence at this time particularly because of the pandemic as both were in the medical field. Susheel Gupta, who lost his mother Ramvati on the flight, visited a memorial in Ottawa. Such memorial services, he said, “advocate on behalf of victims of terrorism, and we feel a responsibility to remind people that terrorism has occurred here and could happen again”.Indian officials laid wreathes at memorials, with India’s high commissioner to Canada Ajay Bisaria doing so in Ottawa; consul generals in Toronto and Vancouver, Apoorva Srivastava and Manish, in their respective cities; and the representative of India to the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Shefali Juneja, visiting the site in Montreal.Among the video services to be held were one by the Air India 182 Victims’ Families Association.The commemorative services took place under the shadow of a recent revival of the pro-Khalistan movement in Canada.Over the past few months, pro-Khalistan groups in Canada have been repeatedly voicing support for the ongoing protests in India against farming deregulation laws, with the aim of drawing attention towards their own movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/36-years-after-kanishka-bombing-canada-remembers-the-dead-with-commemorations-101624513606421.html
24-06-2021||World||Delta variant more transmissible, says US top surgeon as 85 nations report cases||As world is witnessing the rapid spread of the delta variant of Covid-19, which has triggered the need for countries to reimpose restrictions and lockdowns in order to curb its spread, America’s surgeon general Dr Vivek Murthy said on Wednesday the variant is significantly more transmissible and more dangerous with regard to the severity of illness that it causes.Highlighting the fact that the Delta variant makes up 90 per cent of all new cases, Dr Murthy told MSNBC news, “We have seen how quickly it has taken over in the United Kingdom, where it’s become - getting close to 100 per cent of new Covid cases, Delta. And we have seen a surge here too. So I am worried.”Dr Murthy said he is worried for those people who haven’t been administered the vaccine against the Covid-19 disease. Referring to studies from the United Kingdom, he added that if people are completely vaccinated, they are well protected against hospitalisations and deaths.“The worry is if you’re not vaccinated, that you’re at even greater risk than you were before. So, what I don’t want to see is a growing divide in our country between the unvaccinated and vaccinated. We’ve got to close that gap. That’s why we’re working so hard to get people vaccinated everywhere,” the top doctor said while responding to a question.The United States, which is currently the worst-hit from the pandemic, has so far inoculated nearly 56 per cent of its citizens with both doses of the vaccine and 65.4 per cent have received the first dose. The vaccination rate for children aged 12 years and above is 62.5 per cent and over 65 per cent are over 18 years.Dr Murthy pointed out the level of risk of getting infected with the variant depends on where people live and how high the vaccination rates are. “And this is why we always say - and I say this as a dad who’s got two young kids, three and four, whose -… we don’t have a vaccine available for kids that young. So, I’m worried about my kids, just like any other parents are,” he further told MSNBC news.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Delta variant has been reported in 85 countries so far and is continuing to be detected in more countries. “Delta, now reported in 85 countries globally, continues to be reported in new countries across all WHO Regions, 11 of which were newly reported in the past two weeks,” the WHO said in its weekly updated, adding this variant is more transmissible than Alpha variant and can become a dominant lineage if current trends continue.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-more-transmissible-says-us-top-surgeon-as-85-nations-report-cases-101624512027261.html
24-06-2021||World||Singapore plans to shift to new normal amid Covid. Check details||It's been more than a year sicne the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Though the number of cases is still high, and new variants are emerging every few weeks, the countries are learning to live with the disease. Many of them have chalked out a plan for the new normal and Singapore is one of them. "The bad news is that Covid-19 may never go away. The good news is that it is possible to live normally with it in our midst," Singapore's three ministers of a multi-ministry task force on coronavirus said on Thursday as they outlined the plan for the new normal.Focussing on vaccination against the virus, a roadmap is being drawn up to shift to this new normal and it will be done in tandem with achieving certain vaccination milestones, said the co-chairmen, minister for trade and industry Gan Kim Yong, minister for finance Lawrence Wong and minister for health Ong Ye Kung.Also read: Singapore shortens stay-home notice for travellers from higher-risk countriesThe ministers said that with enough vaccinated people, Covid-19 can be managed like other endemic diseases like common flu, hand, foot and mouth diseases in Singapore.Here's how the task force plans to shift to the new normal:The priority in the next few months will be to prepare the country for life with Covid as a recurring, controllable disease, the ministers were quoted as saying by The Straits Times, reported PTI.To prepare for Covid becoming an endemic Singapore has ramped up its vaccination drive amid the fight to reduce the spike in cases. Vaccination has reported to appear effective in reducing the rate of infection and transmission. Fully vaccinated people showed mild or no symptoms in case of contraction.The ministers said that by early next month, two-thirds of the population will have received at least one dose of the vaccine. "Our next milestone will be to have at least two-thirds of our population fully vaccinated with two doses around National Day, supply permitting. We are working to bring forward the delivery of vaccines and to speed up the process," they said.Next, the ministers said in time, people infected with the virus will be allowed to recover at home to reduce the stress on the healthcare system. The close contacts of the infected people can purchase test kits from pharmacies to test themselves.Testing will be made universal and will no longer remain a tool for ring-fencing and quarantining people. They said that it will be used to screen those who enter office buildings, malls, schools and other places.The daily updates on the coronavirus numbers will shift to focus on outcomes like home many people fell severely shift and how many ended up needing the intensive care unit, the same way the flu is monitored. Eventually, safe management rules can be eased and large gatherings will be allowed like the National Day Parade or New Year's Eve countdown, The Straits Times report said.Travel will begin again, with vaccination certification, with countries that have also controlled the contagion and turned it into an endemic. The travellers may even be exempted from quarantining with a negative test on arrival.Also read: Singapore latest to cast doubt over Chinese Sinovac efficacy. Here’s whyThe fear of economic disruptions from the lockdowns will also not exist for the businesses, the report said."Science and human ingenuity will eventually prevail over Covid-19. Cohesion and social consciousness will get us there faster. We must all do our part," the ministers said.Singapore, as of Wednesday, had reported a total of 62,470 Covid-19 cases. The country has recorded 35 deaths from the infection to date.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-plans-to-shift-to-new-normal-amid-covid-check-details-101624508545585.html
24-06-2021||World||US intelligence warns Kabul could fall in 6 months after US pull-out: Report||US intelligence has warned that Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, could fall to the resurgent Taliban group within six months of the departure of the last of the US and international troops, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday - ahead of a White House meeting on Friday between President Joe Biden and top Afghan leaders Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah.The warning came amid growing international concern about Taliban making gains since May 1, when the US and allied troops began leaving Afghanistan in accordance with a timeline announced by Biden for complete the withdrawal by September 11 - the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that had led to the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.India, a key stakeholder in Afghanistan’s reconstruction, called for a UN-led ceasefire in the country during a UN Security Council debate on Monday, pointing to a sudden escalation in violence in the country since May 1.The Wall Street Journal reported that US intelligence experts had earlier assessed that the government of President Ghani would survive for two years after the US withdrawal based roughly on the time it took for the fall of Saigon in Vietnam after US troop pull-out in 1975.US intelligence and military analysts have since revised their assessment and now believe that Kabul could fall in six to 12 months after the departure of American troops, the WSJ reported, adding that officials in other western countries fear the capital could fall far sooner, possibly in three months.US military has planned to wind up the withdrawal by as soon as July, going down from the 3,500 currently stationed there to zero, barring a small force to be left behind for the protection of American diplomatic missions and officials. “I will say that while, in general, we are seeing elevated attacks on ANDSF (Afghan National Defence and Security Forces) and Afghan government versus a year ago, we have not seen an increase in attacks on our military presence since February 2020,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in response to a question about the rapid military gains made by the Taliban. “We also assess that, had we not begun to draw down, violence would have increased against us as well after May 1, because that was what the Taliban were clearly conveying. So, the status quo, in our view, was not an option,” Psaki added.American lawmakers, too, are worried by Taliban’s advances and sought assurances from US defence secretary Lloyd Austin and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley at a congressional hearing on Wednesday.Miley said, “Yes, we’re concerned, we’re watching it, but there’s a 300,000 plus or minus military force” of the Afghan army and the police “and it is their job to defend their country”. He said the Taliban group currently controls 81 district centres of Afghanistan, but not any of the provincial capitals yet.Austin sought to address concerns expressed by lawmakers about US ability to prevent Afghanistan from sliding back under the control of terrorists after the withdrawal of troops, saying America has “very” effective over-the-horizon capability in keeping an eye on Afghanistan, currently from partner countries in the Gulf region and from platforms at sea.“What we’d like to do going forward is shorten the legs that were required to utilise by getting an agreement with one of the neighbouring countries to base some of our ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) in one of those countries,” said Austin.Austin did not name these countries, but Pakistan appears to be a leading candidate, as has been clear from repeated public protestations from Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has said his country won’t agree to give the US bases on its soil.Asked about Khan’s position, a US state department spokesperson told HT, “As President Biden said, the United States will reorganise our counterterrorism capabilities and substantial assets to prevent reemergence of terrorist threats, in Afghanistan or anywhere else.“The United States respects the sovereignty of other nations and their ability to make decisions about what is in the best interest of their national security.”Central Asian countries such as Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are also options for the US to have bases because of their shared boundaries with Afghanistan.The US had bases there in the past, but people familiar with the region said getting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nod might be a problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-intelligence-warns-kabul-could-fall-in-6-months-after-us-pull-out-report-101624510365558.html
24-06-2021||World||US warns Pfizer, Moderna Covid vaccine recipients to watch for enlarged heart symptoms||The US government continues to recommend coronavirus vaccinations for everyone 12 years of age and older, albeit with a new warning to watch for symptoms of an enlarged heart reported by a fraction of people receiving the Pfizer or Moderna inoculation, the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention said."The known and potential benefits of Covi-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks, including the possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis [enlarged heart]. Also, most patients with myocarditis and pericarditis who received care responded well to treatment and rest and quickly felt better," the CDC said in a press release on Wednesday.The release, however, urged vaccine recipients to "be on the lookout for any of the following symptoms: chest pain; shortness of breath; feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart" and to seek medical care if any of the symptoms occur following the first or second jab.The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to add similar warnings accompanying both vaccines, according to media reports.The CDC release was issued following a day in which the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) began reviewing reports of myocarditis connected with the two vaccines - the most detailed data coming from the Israeli Health Ministry, according to one presentation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warns-pfizer-moderna-covid-vaccine-recipients-to-watch-for-enlarged-heart-symptoms-101624509428428.html
24-06-2021||World||Kamala Harris to make 1st visit to US-Mexico border area regarding migration||Vice President Kamala Harris will make her first visit on Friday to the US-Mexico border since taking office, following criticism from members of both parties for failing to go earlier despite her role leading the Biden administration’s response to a steep increase in migration.Harris will visit the El Paso area, accompanied by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, according to a statement Wednesday from Harris senior adviser Symone Sanders.Harris has faced months of criticism from Republicans, and even some frustration from those in her own party, for not visiting the area.She was tasked earlier this year by President Joe Biden with taking on the root causes of migration from Central America to the United States, and so far she's focused largely on outreach to local leaders and advocacy groups with the goal of improving economic and living conditions in the region. Harris has said her goal is to offer residents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico hope for their future, so they no longer feel compelled to leave home for better opportunities.Her aides have repeatedly insisted her efforts are distinct from the security issues that plague US. officials trying to handle a spike in border crossings. But Republicans have pointed to the failures by both Harris and Biden to visit the border to paint the administration as absent in a crisis.Harris will arrive in the area just days before former President Donald Trump is to visit the border with a group of House Republicans and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, and Trump is certain to use the opportunity to drive Republican attacks on Democrats as soft on immigration.The border issue shadowed Harris’ first foreign trip earlier this month, to Guatemala and Mexico, where she met with both nations’ presidents and local officials to discuss economic and humanitarian solutions to the significant outmigration from both countries.During that trip, she sat for an interview with NBC News in which she dismissed a question about why she hadn't made a trip to the border by responding, “I've never been to Europe,” and adding, “I don't understand the point you're making.” Harris and White House aides were subsequently forced to parry repeated questions about the decision and her remarks.Harris said she was focused on “tangible” results “as opposed to grand gestures," but she also said she might visit in the near future.She has noted that as a senator from California, she has visited the border in the past, and she has asserted that unless the root causes of migration are addressed the situation there will never be fixed.It's unclear what Harris' plans include during her visit to the area, but one migrant detention facility in El Paso, at the Fort Bliss military post, has drawn criticism from advocates who have described unsafe conditions and allegations of abuse toward some of the thousands of children housed there.On Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the trip was “part of the coordinated effort between her office, her work, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, to continue to address the root causes and work in coordination to get the situation under control.”While Psaki emphasized that border security is under Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas' purview, she added that “it’s important every component of our government is coordinated” on the issue.US Customs and Border Protection recorded more than 180,000 encounters on the Mexican border in May, the most since March 2000. Those numbers were boosted by a pandemic-related ban on seeking asylum, which encouraged repeated attempts to cross the border because getting caught carried no legal consequences.The numbers have led even some centrist Democrats to join Republicans in their calls for Harris to make a trip to the area. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat whose district stretches from south of San Antonio down to the southern border, wrote a letter to Harris earlier this month inviting her to “observe the ongoing humanitarian crisis and share the perspective of Americans who live there.”“I believe it is critical that you meet with local stakeholders and residents, consider their concerns, and use their lived experiences to implement more effective policies,” he wrote.Cuellar issued a tweet Wednesday thanking Harris for her plans to visit.But his engagement on the issue underscores the potential political peril for Democrats on immigration. An AP-NORC poll conducted in April found that more Americans disapprove than approve of how Biden is handling the sharply increasing number of unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the US-Mexico border.And Trump's trip to the border marks another sign of how closely Republicans continue to align themselves with Trump and the extent to which they see the border as a winning campaign issue. The former president immediately took credit for Harris' trip, speculating in a statement that the vice president would not have made plans to go if he hadn't been headed there himself.Psaki said the administration "made an assessment within our government about when it was an appropriate time for her to go the border.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-make-1st-visit-to-us-mexico-border-area-regarding-migration-101624508957764.html
24-06-2021||World||Hong Kong residents snap up final edition of pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily||Hong Kong's pro-democracy Apple Daily tabloid said it was a "victim of tyranny" in a defiant final edition on Thursday after it was forced to close under a new national security law, ending a 26-year run of taking on China's authoritarian leaders.The sudden death of the popular newspaper is the latest blow to Hong Kong's freedoms, deepening unease over whether the international finance centre can remain a media hub as China seeks to stamp out dissent.Queues formed across Hong Kong on Thursday as residents raced to snap up one of the one million copies Apple Daily said it planned to print. Many vendors sold out within minutes and were awaiting fresh deliveries.The swansong front page featured the paper's own journalists waving goodbye to crowds outside its headquarters."Apple Daily is dead," deputy chief editor Chan Pui-man, who was arrested last week on a national security charge, wrote in a farewell letter to readers."Press freedom became the victim of tyranny."In the working-class district of Mongkok, hundreds queued through the early hours of the morning to get their hands on the final edition, some chanting "Apple Daily we will meet again!""It's very shocking," a 30-year-old woman, who was in the queue and gave her first name as Candy, told AFP."Within two weeks, authorities could use this national security law to dismantle a listed company."Asset freezeHong Kong's most popular tabloid had long been a thorn in Beijing's side, with unapologetic support for the city's pro-democracy movement and caustic criticism of China's authoritarian leaders.Those same leaders used a new security law to bring about its rapid demise.Owner Jimmy Lai, currently in jail for attending democracy protests, was among the first to be charged under the law after its imposition last year.But the final chapter was written over the last week when authorities deployed the security law to raid the newsroom, arrest senior executives and freeze its assets.That last move crippled the paper's ability to conduct business or pay staff and the news group decided Thursday's newspaper -- a run of one million copies in a city of 7.5 million -- would be its last.Overnight it took down its website, Twitter and Facebook accounts.Some 1,000 people, including 700 journalists, are now out of work."Hong Kongers lost a media organisation that dared to speak up and insist on defending the truth," eight local journalist associations said in a joint statement, as they called on colleagues to dress in black on Thursday.Forbidden opinionsChina imposed its security law on Hong Kong last year after the city was convulsed by huge and often violent democracy protests in 2019.The prosecution of Apple Daily was sparked by articles and columns that allegedly supported international sanctions against China, a view now deemed illegal.Lai, chief editor Ryan Law and CEO Cheung Kim-hung have all been charged with colluding with foreign forces to undermine China's national security and remanded into custody.On Wednesday, Yeung Ching-kee, one of the paper's top columnists, was arrested on the same charge.The decision to freeze Apple Daily's assets also laid bare the sweeping powers now at the disposal of authorities to pursue any company deemed to be a national security threat.Multiple international media companies have regional headquarters in Hong Kong, attracted to the business-friendly regulations and free speech provisions written into the city's mini-constitution.But many local and international outlets are questioning whether they have a future there.First trialHong Kong has plunged down an annual press freedom ranking by Reporters Without Borders, from 18th place in 2002 to 80th this year. Mainland China languishes at 177th out of 180, above only Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea.China and Hong Kong's authorities have hailed the security law for successfully restoring stability after the 2019 demonstrations and said media outlets must not "subvert" the government.Authorities initially said the law would only target "a tiny minority".But it has radically transformed the political and legal landscape of a city that China promised would be able to keep key liberties and autonomy after its 1997 return by Britain.On Wednesday, the first trial under the new law got under way for a man accused of riding a motorbike into police officers.His trial is not being heard by a jury, a major departure from Hong Kong's common law traditions.His case is unusual because he is the only Hong Konger so far charged under the security law with an explicitly violent act.More than 60 people have now been charged under the law, including some of the city's best-known democracy activists, but their offences are related to political views or speech that authorities have declared illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-residents-snap-up-final-edition-of-pro-democracy-newspaper-apple-daily-101624508501602.html
24-06-2021||World||Britney Spears tells judge: 'I want my life back'||After 13 years of near silence in the conservatorship that controls her life and money, Britney Spears passionately told a judge Wednesday that she wants to end the “abusive” case that has made her feel demoralized and enslaved.Speaking in open court for the first time in the case, Spears condemned her father and others who control the conservatorship, which she said has compelled her to use birth control and take other medications against her will, and prevented her from getting married or having another child.“This conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good,” the 39-year-old Spears said. “I deserve to have a life."She spoke fast and sprinkled profanity into the written speech that lasted more than 20 minutes as her parents, fans and journalists listed to an audio livestream. Many of the details Spears revealed have been carefully guarded by the court for years.Spears told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny that “I want to end this conservatorship without being evaluated."Penny thanked the pop star for her “courageous” words but made no rulings. A long legal process is likely before any decision is made on terminating the conservatorship.Spears said she wants to marry her boyfriend Sam Asghari and have a baby with him, but she is not allowed to even drive with him.“All I want is to own my money and for this to end and for my boyfriend to be able to drive me in his (expletive) car,” Spears said.“I truly believe this conservatorship is abusive," Spears said, adding at another point, “I want my life back.”When an attorney representing her co-conservator said the hearing and transcript should be kept sealed if private medical information was to be revealed, Spears shouted her down, saying her words should be public.“They’ve done a good job at exploiting my life,” Spears said, “so I feel like it should be an open court hearing and they should listen and hear what I have to say.”She went on to say she was forced to take lithium — which made her feel “drunk” — after rehearsals broke down for a Vegas residency in 2019, which was subsequently canceled.She said all she had done was disagree with one part of the show's choreography.“I’m not here to be anyone’s slave,” Spears said. “I can say no to a dance move.”“Not only did my family not do a goddamn thing, my dad was all for it,” Spears said.She accused her father of relishing his power over her, as he showed when she failed a series of psychological tests in 2019 and forced her to go into a mental hospital.“I cried on the phone for an hour, and he loved every minute of it," Spears said. ”The control he had over someone as powerful as me, as he loved the control to hurt his own daughter 100,000%."Spears said she felt forced to do the Las Vegas residency on the heels of a tour, and felt like a great weight was lifted when it was canceled. She has not performed or recorded since.Spears also said several nurses often watch her every move, not even letting her change her clothes in private.Vivian Thoreen, attorney for Spears’ father, James Spears, gave a brief statement on his behalf after conferring with him during a recess.“He is sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain,” Thoreen said. “Mr. Spears loves his daughter, and misses her very much.”James Spears serves as co-conservator of his daughter’s finances, and also had control of her life decisions for most of the conservatorship. He currently serves as co-conservator of her finances.Britney Spears said her years-long public silence has falsely created the impression that she approved of her circumstances.“I’ve lied and told the whole world, ‘I’m OK, I’m happy,' ” she said. “I’ve been in denial, I’ve been in shock. I am traumatized.”More than 100 fans from the so called #FreeBritney movement gathered outside the courthouse before the hearing, holding signs that read “Free Britney now!” and “Get out of Britney's life!”Fan Marissa Cooper was inside the courtroom, and cried and occasionally clapped during the remarks.“It was insane,” Cooper said outside court. “Everyone that’s been following this has been called crazy since the beginning, and conspiracy theorists, so it just feels really really good to actually hear it from her.”Spears said she has not felt heard in any of her previous appearances before the court, all of which were sealed from the public.Her court-appointed attorney, Samuel Ingham III, said he made no attempt to “control, or filter, or edit” his client’s words. He said Spears has not officially asked him to file a petition to end the conservatorship.Spears said she had done research that showed her conservatorship could be ended without further evaluation of her. But under California law, the burden would be on her to prove she is competent to manage her own affairs, and an intensive investigation and evaluation is probably inevitable before it can come to an end.The conservatorship was put in place as she underwent a mental health crisis in 2008. She has credited its initial establishment with saving her from financial ruin and keeping her a top flight pop star.Her father and his attorneys have emphasized that she and her fortune, which court records put at more than $50 million, remain vulnerable to fraud and manipulation. Under the law, the burden would be on Spears to prove she is competent before the case could end.Britney Spears' ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake was among many who expressed outrage at her revelations.“What’s happening to her is just not right,” Timberlake tweeted. "No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britney-spears-tells-judge-i-want-my-life-back-101624508229884.html
24-06-2021||World||Delta variant now reported in 85 countries globally: WHO||The Delta variant, the significantly more transmissible strain of Covid-19, is expected to become a “dominant lineage” if current trends continue, the WHO has warned after it was reported in 85 countries and continues to be detected in more places around the world.The Covid-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update released on June 22 by the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that globally, the variant Alpha has been reported in 170 countries, territories or areas, Beta in 119 countries, Gamma in 71 countries and Delta in 85 countries.“Delta, now reported in 85 countries globally, continues to be reported in new countries across all WHO Regions, 11 of which were newly reported in the past two weeks,” the update said.WHO said the four current 'Variants of Concern' being monitored closely – Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta - are widespread and have been detected in all WHO regions.“The Delta variant is significantly more transmissible than Alpha variant, and is expected to become a dominant lineage if current trends continue.”The update said that India reported the highest numbers of new Covid-19 cases, 441,976 over the past week (June 14-20, 2021), a 30 per cent decrease as compared to the previous week. The highest numbers of new deaths were reported from India (16,329 new deaths; 1.2 new deaths per 100,000; a 31 per cent decrease).The South-East Asia Region reported over 600,000 new cases and over 19,000 new deaths, a 21 per cent and a 26 per cent decrease respectively compared to the previous week.“Decreasing trends in weekly case and death incidence in the Region are predominantly associated with decreases reported in India,” the update said.WHO noted that since the last detailed update on June 8, new evidence has been published on the phenotypic characteristics of the Delta variant. “A study from Singapore showed that infection with Delta variant was associated with higher odds of oxygen requirement, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death,” it said.Further, a study in Japan "estimating the relative instantaneous reproductive number (a measure of transmission at a specific point in time) showed that the Delta variant was associated with greater transmissibility" when compared to the Alpha variant.“When compared with the variants circulating in Japan before December 2020, the relative instantaneous reproduction number for Alpha was estimated to be at 1.56 and for Delta 1.78. Overall, this study showed Delta was associated with 1.23 times higher transmissibility than Alpha,” the update said.The update also took note of two studies that have provided evidence of the effectiveness of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty and AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria vaccines against the Delta variant. One study reports on the effectiveness of these vaccines against severe disease (hospitalisation) due to Delta among persons over the age of 16 years in the United Kingdom.Vaccine effectiveness estimates against hospitalisation due to Delta and Alpha variants over 14 days post second dose was estimated to be 96 per cent and 95 per cent respectively for Pfizer BioNTech- Comirnaty and 92 per cent and 86 per cent respectively, for AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria.Single dose effectiveness against hospitalisation over 21 days after immunisation remained high for Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty at 94 per cent against Delta and 83 per cent against Alpha. Effectiveness of one dose of AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria against hospitalization was similar for Delta and Alpha variants.A second study from Scotland found that two doses of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty were 83 per cent and 79 per cent effective against symptomatic disease and infection due to Delta, respectively, over 14 days after receipt of second dose in persons 15 years and older.“Together, these studies suggest moderately reduced VE at preventing symptomatic disease and infection due to the Delta variant as compared to Alpha...The studies also provide further evidence of the importance of two doses of both Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty and AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria in preventing hospitalisation, symptomatic disease and infection due to both Delta and Alpha variants,” the update said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-now-reported-in-85-countries-globally-who-101624506558825.html
24-06-2021||World||US confirms removal of Wuhan coronavirus sequences from database||Details of the genetic makeup of some of the earliest samples of coronavirus in China were removed from an American database where they were initially stored at the request of Chinese researchers, US officials confirmed, adding to concerns over secrecy surrounding the outbreak and its origins.The data, first submitted to the US-based Sequence Read Archive in March 2020, were “requested to be withdrawn” by the same researcher three months later in June, the US National Institutes of Health said in a statement Wednesday. The genetic sequences came from the Chinese city of Wuhan where the Covid-19 outbreak was initially concentrated.The reason cited at the time for withdrawal was that the sequence information had been updated and was being submitted to another database, the agency said. The researcher asked that the data be removed “to avoid version control issues,” it said.“Submitting investigators hold the rights to their data and can request withdrawal of the data,” the agency said. “NIH can’t speculate on motive beyond the investigator’s stated intentions.”The disappearance of the genetic sequences from the database raises questions about what else from the Wuhan outbreak has been shielded, said American virologist Jesse Bloom, who publicized his discovery that they were missing earlier this week. Bloom, who subsequently recovered the information, said it didn’t provide definitive details on where or how the virus originated.Politicians and scientists from around the world have grown increasingly frustrated by China’s efforts to deflect an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus, especially the possibility that it leaked from a Wuhan laboratory. Though a World Health Organization expert team visited China earlier this year for an investigation, they were not allowed access to raw data and their conclusion -- that the virus likely crossed over from animals -- has been criticized as being premature.US President Joe Biden has ordered American intelligence agencies to probe the issue again, while China has strenuously denied that the Wuhan laboratory had any link to the outbreak.“I don’t think we can say very much with high confidence,” said Bloom, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, referring to the virus’s origins. He added that his findings “reminds us of how little we know.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-confirms-removal-of-wuhan-coronavirus-sequences-from-database-101624506061204.html
24-06-2021||World||Scientists developing universal vaccine to fight Covid-19 variants, human trials next year||Scientists at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health have come out with news of major relief amid the rising concerns of Delta and Delta Plus variants of coronavirus. They have developed a hybrid vaccine, being dubbed as 'super vaccine', which is expected to prevent infections from future coronavirus variants.The vaccine effectively generated neutralising antibodies, when injected in mice, against the multiple spike protein, which coronaviruses use to latch onto healthy cells, including one associated with B.1.351 that was first identified in South Africa, the scientists said.Also read| More Delta Plus cases reported in India: How this variant is rapidly spreadingThe researchers further said that the universal vaccine protected mice not just against Covid-19, but also other group 2B coronaviruses. It even triggered the immune system to fight off a dangerous Covid variant. They designed the vaccine to provide protection against the current SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and a group of coronaviruses that have the potential to transmit from animals to humans."Our findings look bright for the future because they suggest we can design more universal coronavirus vaccines to proactively guard against viruses we know are at risk for emerging in humans,” said PhD, a postdoctoral researcher at the Gillings School. “With this strategy, perhaps we can prevent a SARS-CoV-3," he added.Within the extensive family of different coronaviruses, Sarbecoviruses are also called "group 2B". Sarbecoviruses are a priority for the virologists after two coronaviruses outbreak--SARS and Covid-19--in the past two decades."The vaccine has the potential to prevent outbreaks when used as a new variant is detected,” said Ralph Baric, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Gillings School and professor of immunology and microbiology at the UNC School of Medicine.Additional testing could also lead to human trials next year. The paper includes data from mice infected with SARS-CoV and related coronaviruses. The vaccine was noted to prevent both infection and lung damage in the mice.The findings of the study were published in the journal 'Science' by lead authors Martinez and a Hanna H. Gray Fellow at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute along with Baric.The lead authors worked with a team of scientists from UNC-Chapel Hill, Duke University School of Medicine and the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.Also read: Delta sparks fears and fresh curbsAccording to Baric, the researchers also pivoted to look at a second-generation vaccine after testing the effectiveness of the first generation of Covid-19 vaccines.The approach to the development of the vaccine began similar to the current Pfizer and Moderna vaccine ie with the mRNA. However, instead of including the mRNA code for only one virus, the researchers welded together mRNA from multiple coronaviruses.The study was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health and the North Carolina Policy Collaboratory, with funding from the North Carolina General Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-developing-universal-vaccine-to-fight-covid-19-variants-human-trials-next-year-101624499580298.html
24-06-2021||World||US negotiators prepare for return to Iran for 7th round of nuclear talks||US negotiators are prepared to return to a seventh round of indirect talks with Iran on re-entering on 2015 nuclear deal once the leadership in Tehran is ready, a senior administration official said.President Joe Biden’s negotiating team, led by Iran envoy Robert Malley, could return to talks in Vienna as early as next week, though that date might be pushed back, according to the official, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.Earlier Wednesday, the Jerusalem Post said the administration wanted to delay the start of the next round of talks to hear from Israel’s new government on the issue. The newspaper said the administration believes it’s worth a delay to better cooperate with Israel.But the administration official said Malley’s team has consulted with Israeli officials, including the new government, regularly, and described those conversations as “substantive.” The US is ready to go back to Vienna when Iran, which recently elected a new, hard-line president, Ebrahim Raisi, has completed its own process.In comments to state TV, Raisi called on the US this week to fulfill its commitments under the nuclear deal by lifting sanctions. He said Iran would continue to diplomatic efforts to revive the accord and sought verification for sanctions removal, in his first remarks as the country’s president-elect.Oil markets are closely watching the negotiations for signs of how soon the US penalties are likely to be removed and how quickly Iran, a member of OPEC, will increase oil production and boost exports of crude.Israel’s new government, like its predecessor, is opposed to a re-entry to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the accord that former President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018. But top American officials say they consult regularly with Israel on the matter given their close alliance.“The fact is the United States and Israel are absolutely united in the proposition that Iran must never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at a news conference in Jerusalem last month. “We share exactly the same goal. It’s no secret that we sometimes have our differences with regard to the best way to achieve that goal, and that’s what allies and partners do. We work together, try to find the best way to achieve a common objective.”Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, met Wednesday with Aviv Kohavi, chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, Emily Horne, a National Security Council spokesperson, said in a statement.“The officials discussed the challenges to security and stability in the Middle East, including the threat posed by Iran’s malign activities in the region, and Mr. Sullivan affirmed the president’s commitment to ensuring that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon,” Horne said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-negotiators-prepare-for-return-to-iran-for-7th-round-of-nuclear-talks-101624496810240.html

But she added that she was hopeful that “many people are becoming more and more ready to tell it like it is”.Policy choices made now, like promoting plant-based diets, can limit these health consequences - but many are simply unavoidable in the short term, the UN report says. The 4,000-page draft report is scheduled for release next year. It predicts that up to 80 million more people than today will be at risk of hunger by the year 2050.“The basis for our health is sustained by three pillars: the food we eat, access to water, and shelter,” said Maria Neira, director of public health, environmental and social determinants of health, at the World Health Organization. “These pillars are totally vulnerable and about to collapse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uns-draft-report-on-climate-lets-us-face-reality-greta-101624492595058.html

24-06-2021||World||Delta sparks fears and fresh curbs||The Delta variant of the coronavirus is spreading rapidly in the US and now accounts for a fifth of recent Covid-19 cases, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said, as the variant continues to spread fear and trigger fresh curbs around the world.Rochelle Walensky, CDC head, said on Wednesday the rapid growth in the Delta variant is being seen after it had accounted for just 3% of Covid-19 cases analysed several weeks ago.The news in Europe was grim as well, with the highly transmissible variant showing the potential to account for 90% of new Covid-19 cases in the EU in the coming months, the bloc’s disease control agency said. “It is likely the Delta variant will circulate extensively during the summer, particularly among younger individuals not targeted for vaccination,” Andrea Ammon, director of the European CDC said, adding that “by the end of August, it will represent 90%” of new cases in the EU.In Russia, authorities warned of an “explosive” spread of the Delta variant amid rapidly rising infections and deaths. “The situation has become explosive,” said Moscow’s mayor Sergei Sobyanin.Fears over the Delta variant also forced authorities in Sydney to bring back curbs, while Wellington upgraded its alert level.In England, meanwhile, officials have tracked 41 cases of the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19, an even more transmissible strain.AZ, Pfizer jabs effective against Delta: StudyCovid-19 vaccines made by AstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech alliance remain broadly effective against Delta and Kappa variants, according to a scientific study.

24-06-2021||World||Boris Johnson told lack of climate action puts COP26 in jeopardy||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson risks failure when he hosts key climate change talks this year, unless he delivers on promises to eliminate greenhouse gas pollution, an independent government watchdog said.Two years after the U.K. government enshrined in law a target to reach net zero emissions by 2050, strategies covering everything from transport to home heating have been scrapped, delayed, or fell short when they were published, the Climate Change Committee said Thursday.As a result, Johnson’s promises may ring hollow with other leaders when they convene in Glasgow, Scotland, later this year for a round of global talks known as COP26, said John Gummer, chairman of the committee. As COP26 president, the U.K. will need to encourage other nations to set their own mid-century decarbonization goals, putting the world on a path to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius.Other countries “want us to say and do the same thing. And if we do that, then I think we can make a real success of COP26,” said Gummer, who is also a member of Parliament’s upper chamber, the House of Lords. “If we don’t, then it seems to me that it puts the whole process into jeopardy.”The government has set targets to reduce greenhouse gases by 68% in the four decades to 2030 -- rising to 78% by 2035 -- as it plots a course to reaching net zero emissions by 2050. These are some of the world’s most ambitious climate targets, aligning with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5. Celsius. But the government watchdog said these lofty targets have yet to be backed by firm policies.The business department scrapped its Green Homes Grant less than a year after launching it and has yet to announce a replacement program to encourage people to insulate their homes.The committee, which advises the U.K. government on climate change, singled out Rishi Sunak’s Treasury Department as “procrastinating” over its review into the costs of meeting net zero. The review was initially slated to be published in autumn 2020 but still hasn’t got a publication date. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sunak told lawmakers in Parliament this week that it would come “imminently.”The watchdog also criticized the government for failing to incorporate the net zero targets into planning laws. That led to a local government last year approving plans for a new coal mine in the north of England, said Gummer, a former secretary of state for the environment.Progress WoefulThe watchdog estimates U.K. emissions fell by 13% in 2020, compared with a global decline of 6% from 2019 levels. However, the dramatic drop was caused by pandemic lockdowns and is likely to rebound, said Chris Stark, chief executive of the committee. He said the U.K.’s progress has been “woeful” on cutting emissions from farming, while advances in the waste industry have stalled.“The targets they have set are not going to be achieved by magic,” Stark said.A spokeswoman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy defended the government’s climate policy, saying the U.K. had decarbonized faster than any other Group of Seven nation. “Any suggestion we have been slow to deliver climate action is widely off the mark,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-told-lack-of-climate-action-puts-cop26-in-jeopardy-101624490988535.html

Mothballing them cut the sovereign’s income to 9.4 million pounds ($13.1 million) in 2020-21 from 20.2 million pounds a year earlier, according to annual accounts published Thursday.British taxpayers funded the Queen to the tune of 85.9 million pounds in 2020-21, the royal accounts show. Of that, 51.5 million pounds went toward official travel, property maintenance and the operating costs of the monarch’s household. An additional 34.4 million pounds went toward renovating Buckingham Palace in London.The queen’s official expenditure is paid for by the British public in exchange for the surrender of the revenue from the Crown Estate -- lands traditionally held by the monarch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-ii-s-uk-tourist-income-falls-53-in-covid-19-pandemic-101624491004609.html
24-06-2021||World||Countries dependent on Chinese Covid-19 vaccines reporting surge in cases||Seychelles, Mongolia, Chile and Bahrain have in recent months relied on China’s vaccine diplomacy to propel their inoculation drives and get back to a version of normalcy in the time of a pandemic.The four countries have administered at least one dose of the vaccine to a large chunk of their populations, ranging between 58.7% for Mongolia to nearly 72% for Seychelles.Yet, they are now battling a fresh surge in Covid-19 infections that scientists say shouldn’t be happening.Some experts say one of the key reasons could be the vaccines themselves. The millions of doses provided by China to the countries in recent months may not be very effective in containing the coronavirus disease, especially when faced off against the new virus variants that have triggered outbreaks in regions world over.“If the vaccines are sufficiently good, we should not see this pattern,” Jin Dongyan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, told the New York Times, which first reported about this on Tuesday.“The Chinese have a responsibility to remedy this,” he added.Others referred to the scarcity of data that emerges out of China, be it the clinical trials for the vaccines or efficacy and safety results. The country has approved seven domestically developed vaccines, including two of them for children as young as three years old.Of these, the two widely made available across the world – the shots developed by Chinese firms Sinovac and Sinopharm – have been given the World Health Organization’s emergency use listing (EUL).Sinovac’s CoronaVac shot has a low efficacy of 51%, and Sinopharm’s 79% against symptomatic disease. In contrast, both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines – primarily deployed in the western world – have shown efficacy rates of well over 90% against symptomatic disease in clinical trials.The last few weeks have seen cases jump in the four countries. Mongolia, which is largely relying on Chinese vaccines, recorded 2,400 new infections on Sunday -- a quadrupling from a month before.In Seychelles – where the vaccination drive was largely based on the Sinopharm shot – the number of daily new cases is more than 716 per million, according to the NYT report. The country has administered at least one shot to nearly 72% of its population.This too is stark shift from Israel, which has vaccinated 63% (at least one shot) and where daily new cases are at six per million of its population.Similarly, a virus surge in Chile has overwhelmed hospitals and prompted the government to extend border closures through June. Bahrain, where nearly 50% of the population is fully vaccinated and most received the Sinopharm jab, earlier this month allowed people to take a third booster shot as it recorded a spike in infections.Officials from the four countries, however, say there may be other reasons for this uptick in cases. A health ministry official in Mongolia told NYT that the country may have eased restrictions too quickly, adding that the Chinese vaccines likely prevented severe illness and a higher mortality rate.Authorities in Seychelles, too, defended the vaccine.The Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement there was no direct link between the recent outbreaks and its vaccines, and that the vaccination rate in some regions may not be high enough to prevent the disease from spreading.William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University, told the NYT that the efficacy rates of the Chinese vaccines may be low enough “to sustain some transmission... even though it keeps people largely out of the hospital”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/countries-dependent-on-chinese-covid-19-vaccines-reporting-surge-in-cases-101624482868372.html
24-06-2021||World||Nepal SC ousts most of PM Oli’s cabinet||Nepal’s Supreme Court delivered a fresh blow to embattled communist Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli by removing 20 recently appointed ministers, pending a ruling on whether a caretaker premier can make such sweeping cabinet changes.“This is an interim order and the court will give its final verdict later,” court official Bhadrakali Pokharel told news agency Reuters on Wednesday, a day after the decision by a two-judge bench.With the Himalayan country struggling to contain a deadly second wave of coronavirus infections and beset by political turmoil, Oli lost a vote of confidence in May as a result of factional infighting within his Communist Party of Nepal (UML).Oli dissolved parliament and ordered fresh elections for November, while staying on as caretaker prime minister until the elections are held.In a bid to hold onto power and ditch opponents within his own party, Oli ealier this month dropped most ministers from his cabinet, and named 20 replacements, who were mainly members of a junior coalition partner.The ministerial appointments had been “against the spirit of the constitution”, the Supreme Court judges said, as Oli was only a caretaker prime minister.The court’s removal of the 20 ministers means the cabinet is left with just five members, including the prime minister.“The prime minister had completely disregarded the constitution in making the appointments … the court has applied a brake to this,” petitioner Dinesh Tripathi said.There was no immediate comment from Oli but his aide Rajan Bhattarai said the government would comply with court order, though he described it as “politically incorrect”.Meanwhile, on Wednesday, a five-member Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court began hearing nearly 30 petitions challenging Oli’s dissolution of parliament.The hearing began with the writ jointly filed by 146 lawmakers backing Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba’s claim to prime ministership.According to the apex court’s order, 15 hours have been allocated to the writ petitioners and respondents for pleading.On June 9, the court had issued a show-cause notice to the defendants -- Office of the President and Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers -- seeking explanation on their decision to dissolve the House, within 15 days.Both, the Office of the President and the Prime Minister, in their written replies to the court, had justified their move to dissolve the House.Asserting that the House of Representatives was dissolved as per the constitutional provisions, Bhandari told the Supreme Court that it cannot overturn her decision on the matter or subject it to a judicial review.On his part, Oli told the court that it is not up to the judiciary to appoint a premier as it cannot undertake the legislative and the executive functions of the state.The petitioners, however, say the President should have left it for the House to test if Deuba had a majority or not. Had he failed to prove a majority, he would have been unseated, thereby leading to the automatic dissolution of the House.While Nepali politicians are locked in a power struggle the coronavirus continues to spread, with levels of testing and vaccination both woefully inadequate. Still, official data suggested that the second wave probably peaked in May. Some 3,703 new infections were reported on Tuesday, compared with a daily peak of 9,305 reported on May 12.Meanwhile, Nepali Congress president Deuba has called a meeting of the opposition alliance on Wednesday evening.The meeting will discuss the latest political developments, and the Supreme Court’s decision on Cabinet expansion, a Nepali Congress leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-sc-ousts-most-of-pm-oli-s-cabinet-101624482691547.html

A building was severely damaged by the explosion, which blew out the windows of nearby structures and hit several cars. The windows and walls of Saeed’s house, too, were damaged.“As far as the question of the house of a high-value target is concerned, you would have seen there is a [police] picket near the house, and the car couldn’t get close to that house only because of the picket,” Punjab province’s police chief Inam Ghani told reporters at the site of the attack when he was asked if the blast was aimed at Saeed’s house. “Our view is that the target was the police and they wanted to undermine law enforcement agencies.”There was no claim of responsibility for the blast and Ghani said officers were trying to ascertain whether the car bomb was triggered by a suicide attacker or detonated remotely.Ghani confirmed three deaths. Some of the injured, including children, were in critical condition, said a spokesperson for Jinnah Hospital where the wounded were being treated.Officials said many of the injured were hit by ball bearings packed into the bomb.Fahim Ahmad, a witness, told reporters that a car parked close to a house had exploded, setting ablaze other cars and motorcycles. Images and footage aired by TV news channels showed badly damaged vehicles and homes, including a building with collapsed walls.Saeed has been designated a terrorist by the United Nations and the United States, which has offered a $10mn bounty on him.The LeT had carried out the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks that killed 166 people, but Saeed was never charged in connection with the carnage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blast-near-hafiz-saeed-s-house-leaves-3-dead-101624482065721.html
24-06-2021||World||WHO finds problems at Russian vaccine plant; flags data, testing results||The World Health Organization said Wednesday it had uncovered problems at a Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine production site which Moscow insisted had been resolved.WHO approval has been sought for the Sputnik V jab created by Russia's Gamaleya research institute, which is already being used in 40 countries.The UN health agency inspected four Sputnik V manufacturing sites.On Wednesday, it released a summary report of its preliminary findings, detailing six issues found during its May 31 to June 4 visit to the Pharmstandard Ufa Vitamin Plant in Ufa, southern Russia.The inspectors had concerns with the data integrity and testing results from monitoring during manufacturing and quality control, and with the monitoring and control of aseptic operation and filling.The inspection identified issues with the traceability and identification of vaccine batches.There were also concerns over the filling lines, sterility assurance, sterile filtration validation and the risks of cross-contamination."Communications have been initiated with the relevant manufacturer, the applicant and the respective national regulatory authority with the view that the preliminary findings outlined in this report are investigated and addressed as quickly as possible," the WHO told AFP.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were "some shortcomings identified by the inspection group, and from what we know, they were taken into account and all that needed to be changed was changed."Of course the necessary controls by the control bodies are in place. It is obvious that this is the strictest control possible", he added.- WHO approval process -The WHO's emergency use listing (EUL) approval is the green light that gives countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities assurance that a vaccine has met international standards.The WHO said it had so far conducted nine inspections of the Sputnik V manufacturing sites.They included five clinical trial sites jointly visited with the European Medicines Agency regulator and four manufacturing sites, two of which were joint visits with the EMA.Out of the latter four inspections, the WHO "found non-compliance with good manufacturing practices at one manufacturing site", it said."Findings from the other manufacturing sites of the Sputnik V vaccine that WHO has inspected are still being assessed but they have not raised similar concerns."The organisation said it would continue to assess Sputnik V vaccines from different manufacturing sites and publish its decision on EUL status once all the data is available and the review is complete.EUL paves the way for countries to approve and import a vaccine for distribution quickly, especially those states without an international-class regulator of their own.It also opens the door for the jabs to enter the Covax global vaccine distribution facility, which aims to provide equitable access to doses in poorer countries.The WHO has so far given EUL status to vaccines created by AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Sinopharm and Sinovac.The WHO's vaccine overview shows that of the other vaccines yet to receive EUL status, the Sputnik V is the furthest ahead in the process.Sputnik V is already being used in 40 countries, according to an AFP count.Besides Russia, those nations include Argentina, India, Iran, Kenya, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-finds-problems-at-russian-vaccine-plant-flags-data-testing-results-101624479338542.html

A Catalan government source familiar with the event who was not authorized to be named in media reports confirmed to the AP that the dead man was McAfee.Spain’s National Court had approved the extradition of detained antivirus software entrepreneur John McAfee to the United States, where he was wanted on tax-related criminal charges that carry a prison sentence of up to 30 years.The decision can be appealed and the final extradition will need to be approved by the Spanish Cabinet.Tennessee prosecutors charged 75-year-old McAfee with evading taxes after failing to report income made from promoting cryptocurrencies while he did consultancy work, as well as income from speaking engagements and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary.The charges refer to the three fiscal years from 2016 to 2018, according to the Spanish court's ruling on Wednesday.The entrepreneur was arrested last October at Barcelona’s international airport. A judge ordered at that time that McAfee should be held in jail while awaiting the outcome of a hearing on extradition.In a hearing held via videolink earlier this month, McAfee argued that the charges against him were politically motivated and said he would spend the rest of his life in prison if he was returned to the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antivirus-creator-mcafee-found-dead-in-prison-after-court-allows-extradition-101624477673723.html
24-06-2021||World||Republicans block voting bill. What happens next?||Senate Republicans have blocked debate of a sweeping overhaul of how elections are run in the US. The bill was pushed by congressional Democrats who argued it was needed to counter a spate of new GOP laws this year tightening voting rules in the states.A look at what has happened so far, what’s in the bill and what happens next:WHY DID SENATE REPUBLICANS BLOCK THE BILL?Republicans have long opposed Democratic efforts to overhaul elections in the US and say the reforms being proposed are more about ensuring Democratic victories than fairness in voting. They note that Democrats introduced their overhaul two years ago, before the 2020 election, and say the massive bill amounts to a federal takeover of elections, which are run by state and local election offices. Congressional Republicans argue increased voter turnout in the 2020 election is proof that reforms are not needed. But, at the same time, their counterparts in state legislatures have pointed to unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud as justification for tightening rules and increasing election oversight at the state and local level.WHAT DOES THE BILL DO?The bill, known as the For The People Act, would create minimum standards for voting in the US and establish Election Day as a federal holiday. It requires all states to offer automatic voter registration and at least 15 days of early voting. Some states already do this, but others do not. And Democrats argue that federal standards would reduce confusion among the public. They also say the standards would blunt the impact of new state laws creating barriers for voters.But the bill doesn't just address election issues. There are scores of other provisions packed into the 888-page bill, including a broad expansion of public funding for campaigns, a revamp of redistricting and ethics reforms. Written when Democrats were out of power, it was more a statement of priorities than legislation to be ultimately enacted. It’s been refined a few times and more changes are expected.IS THIS THE END OF THE ROAD?Democratic leaders expected Tuesday's vote and their efforts to pass the bill will continue. “In the fight for voting rights, this vote was the starting gun, not the finish line,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in remarks after the vote. But with a 50-50 split in the Senate, they have few options due to the filibuster rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation. Now the fight turns to whether Democrats can agree that voting legislation is so important it's worth changing or setting aside the filibuster.They'll also continue to try to build public support for their efforts. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who chairs the powerful Rules Committee, said Tuesday she would hold a hearing in Georgia on a law approved earlier this year by the GOP-dominated Legislature that has raised concerns of more hurdles for voters and the potential for partisan interference in local election administration.ARE DEMOCRATS UNITED?At least two Democratic senators, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, have said they oppose eliminating the filibuster rule. Sinema supports the voting reform bill but argued in a recent opinion piece that the rule “compels moderation and helps protect the country from wild swings.”Manchin, who initially opposed the bill, has crafted a new version that would remove some of the more contentious provisions such as same-day voter registration and the public financing option. His proposal also calls for a national ID requirement, something Democrats have not done previously but appear open to considering. The requirement would be less strict than ones pushed by Republicans in certain states and allow voters to provide nonphoto ID such as a utility bill.WHAT SORT OF CHANGES ARE DEMOCRATS CONSIDERING?Discussions are ongoing among congressional Democrats on how to proceed, with leaders noting privately that both Sinema and Manchin oppose eliminating the rule — but that doesn't mean they would oppose changing it. And President Joe Biden has signaled a willingness to consider a change. Democratic leaders argue there is an opportunity to improve the process and are weighing three potential changes:—require that 41 senators of the minority party be present if they want to block a vote on any legislation.—create a narrow exemption for the rule to be suspended for any legislation dealing with voting and elections. There is precedent for this. Democrats previously eased the rule to allow most executive branch nominees to be confirmed with a simple majority, and Republicans eliminated the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees during the Trump administration.—require opposing lawmakers to speak on the floor continuously to block the legislation from advancing — a version of a talking filibuster that would include a gradual reduction in the number of senators who can prevent a vote -- starting at 60 and eventually reaching a simple majority over a period of weeks.WHAT DOES THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DO NEXT?Biden has pledged to wage what the White House calls the “fight of his presidency” over ensuring Americans’ access to voting, but he hasn't been at the center of the fight yet. Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the administration’s efforts, speaking with lawmakers and various voting rights’ advocates in recent weeks and meeting with Democratic state lawmakers from Texas who are pushing against a GOP effort there to tighten voting rules.On Wednesday, Harris met virtually with leaders from several voting and civil rights groups. She noted her visit the day before to the Senate chamber to preside over the vote was to “make clear that our administration takes the issue very seriously, we are paying close attention and we will be actively involved.”In the weeks ahead, Biden will use the “bully pulpit” of the presidency to highlight the importance of voting rights, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.“What you should expect to hear from him is that there are many ways to work across the country — with activists, with states, with legislators — using every lever at our disposal to expand access, improve access to voting across the country,” Psaki said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-block-voting-bill-what-happens-next-101624477126621.html
24-06-2021||India||Kerala women panel chief Josephine roasted for ‘then you suffer’ retort. Apology follows||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala women’s commission chairperson M C Josephine lost her cool during a live television show when a woman who called into the TV show to speak about her husband and mother-in-law beating her, said she hadn’t complained to the police or told a soul about the thrashings she got at home.“Then you suffer, OK,” Josephine shot back and disconnected the line. The state’s woman panel chief was on the show, a special programme put together by a Malayalam channel, to focus attention on women harassed and assaulted at home.On June 21, a 23-year-old who married a government official last year died by suicide. Initial investigations by the police indicate that she was allegedly beaten for months by her husband who was upset with the dowry she had brought.Josephine’s reaction to the woman’s plight on the TV show provoked sharp criticism on and off social media. Many people underlined that the woman, who was in an abusive relationship, had taken the first step when she dialled the show and should have been encouraged, not snubbed. Some of them were also people known to otherwise support the ruling the Communist Party of India (M), of which she is a central committee member.Josephine initially sought to justify her response. But as she and her party came under pressure, the party released a fresh statement issued by her to express regret.BJP state chief K Surendran said a FIR should be filed against her. “When a woman called up to narrate her woes, Josephine behaved in an insulting manner… How will women approach the commission with such a person at the helm?” Surendran asked.The Kerala Congress also asked the government to remove Josephine. Its women’s wing also held a demonstration and burnt her effigy to make their point.In her apology later, Josephine said a woman would get justice if she files a complaint.She said she was angry that many women suffer silently.“I was talking to her with motherly affection. If my words have pained anyone, I regret,” she said, acknowledging that many women continue to suffer in silence and are scared of going to the police against abusive husbands and relatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-women-panel-chief-josephine-roasted-for-then-you-suffer-retort-apology-follows-101624559091136.html
24-06-2021||India||NHRC teams reach Bengal to probe post-poll violence, two regions on radar||A team constituted by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) visited a part of North 24 Parganas in south Bengal on Wednesday to probe allegations of post-poll violence while a second team reached north Bengal in the afternoon. Police officers aware of the development said the NHRC teams, which are part of a committee, will be touring parts of north and south Bengal over the next few days. There are seven people in the committee that includes a member of the West Bengal Human Rights Commission and a member of the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority. On June 21, the Calcutta high court’s five-judge bench headed by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal dismissed a petition by the West Bengal government seeking recall of the June 18 order that asked the NHRC to probe allegations of human rights violation during alleged violence after the recent assembly polls. The NHRC was asked to submit its report before the court by June 30, the next date of hearing. Hours later, the NHRC constituted a seven-member panel to “enquire into complaints of post-poll violence in West Bengal” and told the panel to identify people who were prima facie responsible for the violence and the officers who maintained a “calculated silence”. The committee is led by Rajiv Jain, the former Intelligence Bureau chief who assumed charge as NHRC member on June 2, a statement by the human rights agency said. The committee also comprises National Commission for Minorities vice-chairman Atif Rasheed, National Commission for Women member Rajulben L Desai, NHRC’s (director) investigation Santosh Mehra and DIG (investigation) Manzil Saini, West Bengal Human Rights Commission registrar Pradip Kumar Panja and West Bengal State Legal Services Authority member secretary Raju Mukherjee. The high court, which heard several petitions on the violence that erupted after the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) won the state elections, ordered on June 18 that the NHRC has to constitute the committee. The state government rushed to the high court the following day with a review petition, requesting the five judges to recall their order. The judges heard out the state government on Monday but were not convinced. The bench made a pointed reference to complaints of police inaction and observed that the conduct of the state did not inspire the confidence of the court. The court also pointed out that the NHRC had received 541 complaints while the state human rights commission did not receive a single one. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has mounted a relentless campaign against the Mamata Banerjee government, alleging that its supporters are being targeted. The BJP has alleged that more than 30 people have been murdered and women have been raped and molested as well for supporting the saffron camp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-teams-reach-bengal-to-probe-post-poll-violence-two-regions-on-radar-101624558191034.html

And amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, what is better to purify than sanitiser. As the viral video, shared by news agency ANI, shows, the local workers were made to stand in a queue. Then they were given sanitiser, not a blob on the palm, but generous spraying of the sanitiser all over their body. It was all apparently done in good humour as the workers were asked to close their eyes before they were sprayed with sanitiser and were given the TMC flag after they were purified. #WATCH| West Bengal: Trinamool Congress' local leaders in Ilambazar block of Birbhum perform ‘purification' ritual of workers who are joining TMC from BJP, with the spraying of sanitizer. pic.twitter.com/Q4krju0fXTThe purification appears to be symbolic but local Trinamool leaders have said that they believe that the 'BJP virus' was with them and so the BJP workers needed to be purified with the sanitiser.Reports said that while this video might have become viral, such purification process is actually not new as local Trinamool leaders elswehere too are making sure that those who are doing 'Ghar Wapsi' must do some atonement.In West Bengal's Hooghly, about 200 BJP workers were taken back to the Trinamool after purifying them with Ganga water. Some also shaved their heads as a mark of penitence, reports said.Just ahead of the West Bengal Assembly Election 2021, Trinamool witnessed a mass exodus from the party. One of the big-ticket exits was Suvendu Adhikari, who is now the leader of the opposition in the state assembly. The exits were reported at all levels as many grassroots workers jumped the ship ahead of the elections. After the election results were announced and the Trinamool government came to the power for the third consecutive time, the party is now witnessing a series of homecoming, the major one being that of Mukul Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/watch-how-trinamool-congress-sanitised-bjp-workers-before-welcoming-them-to-the-party-101624554937827.html
24-06-2021||India||After Sonia meeting, Congress firms up nationwide protest plan from July 7||NEW DELHI: The Congress party will launch nationwide protests early next month against economic issues like inflation and rising fuel prices and expand its Covid outreach to cover 3 crore households in 30 days, a major political manoeuvre to make its presence felt on ground after losing elections in Kerala, West Bengal and Assam, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday after Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s meeting with top party officials.Gandhi, in her opening address at the meeting with the party’s general secretaries, state in-charges and state leadership, referred extensively to the Covid pandemic. She stressed that it was “absolutely essential that our party plays an active role” to ensure full vaccination coverage and encourage people to register for the jabs. In addition, the Congress should also continue to put pressure on the Narendra Modi government to treble the daily rate of vaccination to ensure at least 75% of India’s population is inoculated at the end of 2021.Gandhi also asked the leaders to give “urgent attention” and take “provocative measures” in the context of a possible third wave of the Covid virus. “We have to take steps to be better prepared if and when this strikes. The second wave these past four months has been devastating for lakhs and lakhs of individual families all over the country. We must learn from this traumatic experience so that we do not have to experience it yet again,” she said.“No doubt, this is dependent entirely on the adequacy of vaccine supply. We must continue to put pressure on the Union government which has, at our Party’s insistence, finally taken on the responsibility for this. At the same time, we have to ensure that registration takes place, that vaccine hesitancy wherever evident is overcome and vaccine wastage is minimized,” Gandhi said in her opening remarks.Gandhi also spoke about the “intolerable burden being imposed by rising fuel prices” and how “prices of many other essential commodities like pulses and edible oils too have skyrocketed causing wide-spread distress.”The Congress followed up the concern, announcing that it will launch a 10-day-long nationwide agitation from July 7 with programmes at block, district and state levels. The party’s frontal organizations will also step up. A cycle yatra at district levels, march and processions at state level and even a signature campaign at petrol pumps to demand reduction of prices of petrol and diesel would be part of this programme.The Congress hasn’t been able to carry out “political activities” due to Covid restrictions and needs to get back in the game. a senior Congress leader said.“We did campaign in the recent assembly elections, but round-the-year movements were missing. And in some states, lack of opposition activities has been a key reason for electoral losses,” said the leader who was present at Thursday’s meeting.The Congress’ Covid care campaign, which asks each volunteer to reach out to more than 200 households every day for a month, is targeted to cover 7,199 blocks and 7,935 towns across the country’s 736 districts. This is a part of the plan detailed in a circular by general secretary organization KC Venugopal reported by HT on Thursday.In the urban and semi-urban areas, the party wants to approach “auto/battery and cycle rickshaw drivers, plumbers, electricians, gardeners, mechanics, domestic workers, slum dwellers, delivery boys and street vendors” under its covid care programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-sonia-meeting-congress-firms-up-nationwide-protest-plan-from-july-7-101624553810669.html
24-06-2021||India||India says focus on domestic vaccination programme, appears to rule out exports||India on Thursday appeared to rule out any immediate resumption of Covid-19 vaccine exports to neighbouring countries, saying its focus was on the domestic immunisation programme while simultaneously working to boost vaccine production. The vaccination programmes of several neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal were affected when India put the brakes on its vaccine export scheme after the country was hit by a devastating second wave of Coronavirus infections in late March. Responding to questions on the possible resumption of vaccine exports, especially to neighbouring countries, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a weekly news briefing that India’s position on this issue had been “consistent and clear”. “We have always stated that overseas supply of vaccines from India would depend on vaccine availability and our domestic vaccination programme,” he said. “For the moment, our priority remains on utilising made-in-India vaccines for our own vaccination programme, which, as you know, has received a boost with the new phase of vaccination that was launched on June 21. We are also making efforts to further increase our domestic vaccine production,” he added. Referring to the possibility of other vaccines such as the one made by Pfizer being introduced in India, Bagchi said the government is “making all efforts to augment vaccine availability in the country through domestic production or imports”. The issue of specific vaccines and the status of their imports into India is a matter to be decided by regulatory authorities, he said, without giving details. Before exports were halted, India supplied almost 66.4 million doses of vaccines to 95 countries, including 10.7 million doses as grants and 19.9 million doses through the WHO-backed COVAX facility. The country’s neighbours had been among the first to get vaccines both as grants and commercial supplies. India is currently using the AstraZeneca, Covaxin and Sputnik V vaccines for its domestic vaccination programme and talks are on to introduce other vaccines that have been authorised by the World Health Organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-says-focus-on-domestic-vaccination-programme-appears-to-rule-out-exports-101624553690634.html

24-06-2021||India||Mukul Roy eligible for assembly committee as BJP MLA, says Mamata Banerjee||Being a legislator of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Mukul Roy can become a member of the public accounts committee (PAC) of the West Bengal legislative assembly, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Thursday, stoking speculations that the Trinamool Congress (TMC) wants Roy to be the committee’s chairman, a post conventionally enjoyed by the main opposition party. The BJP and TMC got involved in a tussle on Wednesday when Roy, who left the saffron camp and returned to the ruling party on June 11, filed his nomination for induction into the PAC. On June 18, the BJP submitted a petition before speaker Biman Banerjee, saying Roy, the legislator from Krishnanagar North constituency in Nadia district, should be disqualified under the anti-defection law as he did not resign from the BJP before switching sides. The Bengal assembly has 41 committees and among them the PAC, which works as the audit watchdog for the assembly is considered the most important one.ALSO READ | BJP, TMC face off over Mukul Roy’s induction in public accounts committee“Anybody can file nomination papers for inclusion in the PAC. He (Roy) is a BJP member. He has been supported by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. If required, we will support him too. We will win if there is an election. Let people see who is more powerful. The speaker takes these decisions,” Banerjee told the media during a press conference on Thursday afternoon. According to rules, it is the discretion of the speaker to select the chairpersons of the various committees in the assembly. The BJP wants Ashok Lahiri, the former chief economic adviser to the government of India who won the Balurghat seat in north Bengal, to be the PAC chairman. The BJP on Thursday submitted a letter to the speaker saying Roy’s nomination should be cancelled because the party did not nominate him. Stating that the BJP may seek legal action, the letter said Roy should be disqualified under the anti-defection law. The decision to disqualify a member is taken only by the speaker. The Constitution does not specify any time frame for the process which involves inquiry and setting up of a committee. Mamata Banerjee’s protege-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the BJP in December last year and defeated her in the assembly polls, is the leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly. He filed the application for Roy’s disqualification. Roy, who joined the BJP in 2017 and became the party’s national vice-president, returned to the TMC along with his son Subhranshu Roy, but did not officially resign from the BJP, said opposition leaders. Reacting to the chief minister’s statement, BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said, “Let Mamata Banerjee decide first which party Roy belongs to. She says he has returned to the TMC but when it comes to a post she says he is a BJP member in the assembly. In her kingdom, she is the one who decides everything.” Roy avoided the media and could not be contacted despite several attempts. The speaker said on Wednesday that six BJP MLAs have filed their nomination for the PAC. Nominations have been filed for other committees as well. “It seems elections will be held in four committees as the number of candidates exceeds the strength of these committees. Elections were never held in the past for these posts as the candidatures were amicably decided through discussion,” the speaker said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mukul-roy-eligible-for-assembly-committee-as-bjp-mla-says-mamata-banerjee-101624551110540.html

"I am certain I have violated no law and that no law agency would have found anything offensive in my tweets," the BJP MP wrote, attaching a screenshot of the notice that he has received.Varun Gandhi wrote that he is shocked by Twitter's behaviour as it advocated for free expression, but "fails in deed". The MP said that before putting out these tweets, he enquired whether the government had sent any such request to Twitter. "If Twitter really has received a complaint regarding my content, let it share the said legal notice and its provenance in the interest of transparency," Varun Gandhi wrote.I have put out these tweets after enquiring from all possible avenues connected with the Indian law enforcement within the Govt. If @Twitter really has received a complaint regarding my content,let it share the said legal notice & its provenance “in the interest of transparency”.In the communication, Twitter said it has not taken any action as Twitter believed in defending and respecting the voice of Twitter users. "It is our policy to notify our users if we receive a legal request from an authorised entity to remove content from their account," Twitter wrote as found in the screenshot that the MP shared."For too long now, Twitter has indulged in online bullying of our citizens for their diversity of political views to make us conform with their "woke" propaganda. It should stay a platform, not an ostracizing tribunal. This harassment of Indians will not fly with the law of the land," Varun Gandhi wrote.Varun Gandhi's clash with Twitter comes at a time when the microblogging platform is at loggerheads with the government and has lost legal protection in the country. The ongoing disagreement between the government and Twitter started in January this year after the Centre asked Twitter to take action against accounts tweeting on 'farmer genocide' after farmers' protest in Delhi on Republic Day. According to the government, the social media platform dragged its feet in responding to the government's request. Following this, there have been several flashpoints including Twitter's non-compliance to the new IT rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varun-gandhi-slams-twitter-s-woke-propaganda-after-getting-notice-101624550452011.html

24-06-2021||India||India rejects Pak leadership’s remarks on Kashmir, Afghanistan, says focus on terror||India on Thursday brushed aside the Pakistani leadership’s recent assertions about the Kashmir issue and India’s role in Afghanistan, and said Islamabad should focus on creating an atmosphere conducive to normal bilateral relations by taking action against terrorism. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi was responding to comments by Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi that India’s presence in Afghanistan is larger than it ought to be, and Prime Minister Imran Khan’s contention that both countries wouldn’t need nuclear weapons if they settled the Kashmir issue. Referring to the remarks by Pakistan’s foreign minister on India’s role in Afghanistan, Bagchi said: “We firmly believe that it is for the Afghan people to decide their partners and the size of the partnership. India has brought electricity, dams, schools, health clinics, roads and community projects to Afghanistan. And the world knows what Pakistan has brought to Afghanistan.” Indian officials have for long blamed Pakistan’s security establishment of having close links to terror groups active in Afghanistan, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Haqqani Network, a key faction of the Afghan Taliban. Bagchi also dismissed the Pakistan prime minister’s comments on the Kashmir issue, saying: “Regarding developments in Jammu and Kashmir, this is clearly an internal matter for India.” He added, “As far as our bilateral relations with Pakistan are concerned, our stand is well known. We desire normal relations with all our neighbours, including Pakistan. Pakistan must work towards creating a conducive atmosphere, including by taking credible, verifiable and irreversible actions to not allow any territory under its control to be used for cross-border terrorism against India in any manner.” The spokesperson also responded to several questions on India’s position on the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan and the reported outreach to Taliban factions and leaders amid the drawdown of US troops, which is likely to be completed well before the deadline of September set by the Biden administration. “Our perspective on Afghanistan has been enunciated on various occasions. India supports all peace initiatives and has a long-term commitment towards development and reconstruction of Afghanistan,” Bagchi said. “In this context, we remain in touch with various stakeholders, including regional countries,” he added. Bagchi also referred to external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s statement at a UN Security Council debate on Afghanistan on Tuesday, saying it had laid out India’s concern at the upsurge in violence and the vision for Afghanistan’s future. Without directly naming Pakistan, Jaishankar had called for zero tolerance for cross-border terrorism and also sought full transit rights for Afghanistan. He also called for a permanent ceasefire to end a surge in violence, including targeted attacks on women, minorities and civil society activists, and said India will welcome any move towards a genuine political settlement in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-rejects-pak-leadership-s-remarks-on-kashmir-afghanistan-says-focus-on-terror-101624546310022.html

He stressed that holding assembly elections, just like the successful conduct of the District Development Council (DDC) elections, is a priority, said a second person aware of the details.In three tweets minutes after the meeting, PM Modi emphasised this message.“Our democracy’s biggest strength is the ability to sit across a table and exchange views. I told the leaders of J&K that it is the people, specially the youth who have to provide political leadership to J&K, and ensure their aspirations are duly fulfilled,” PM Modi said.Our priority is to strengthen grassroots democracy in J&K. Delimitation has to happen at a quick pace so that polls can happen and J&K gets an elected Government that gives strength to J&K’s development trajectory. pic.twitter.com/AEyVGQ1NGyPM Modi said the country’s priority is to strengthen grassroots democracy in Jammu and Kashmir. “Delimitation has to happen at a quick pace so that polls can happen and J&K gets an elected Government that gives strength to J&K’s development trajectory,” he added.There has been a demand for the restoration of statehood and resumption of elections in the UT and the issue was raised at the meeting.“It was discussed that elections can happen soon after delimitation and by and large most participants expressed support for this,” said a third person.“The PM expressed satisfaction with the acceleration of development in Jammu & Kashmir and said that it is creating new hope and aspirations among the people.

24-06-2021||India||Govt closely following Covaxin’s effort for obtaining WHO approval: MEA||The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told reporters on Thursday that any development regarding Covaxin’s Emergency Use Listing (EUL) authorization by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is being closely followed by the government.“We are closely following the developments regarding efforts by Bharat Biotech to obtain Emergency Use Listing (EUL) authorization from the World Health Organisation,” ANI said quoting Bagchi.Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of Covaxin, had expressed confidence in getting the UN body’s approval based on "its experience of getting its other vaccines prequalified by WHO”, and that an approval for emergency use listing is expected during July-September. The manufacturer has also claimed that around 90 per cent of the required documents have already been submitted to WHO and the remaining will be sent in July.Also Read: Bharat Biotech likely to attend pre-submission meeting with WHO for Covaxin emergency use listingThe Hyderabad-based manufacturer also held a pre-submission meeting on July 23 with the UN body. MEA is coordinating with Bharat Biotech to secure WHO’s approval for the country’s indigenous Covid-19 vaccine.The lack of endorsement from WHO has been hampering travel plans for individuals as many countries are only accepting vaccines approved by the public health body. Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to Prime Minister Modi on Thursday urging his intervention in the approval process."A large number of students from all over the country travel abroad every year for higher studies and many of them have got themselves vaccinated with Covaxin. They came to learn later on that their vaccination certificate is not valid abroad. These students are now in a fix regarding their next course of action and their career is at stake," Banerjee said to the Prime Minister, reported PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-closely-following-covaxin-s-effort-for-obtaining-who-approval-mea-101624544719180.html
24-06-2021||India||Students in a fix: Mamata seeks PM’s intervention for WHO’s approval of Covaxin||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling for his intervention in order to facilitate early approval for India’s indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin from the World Health Organisation (WHO) so that students aspiring to go abroad for studies do not face any problem.In a letter that Banerjee addressed to the PM and posted on Twitter, she wrote, “It is learnt that Covaxin is still not approved by WHO and it is not possible to travel abroad, as many countries are allowing only those people who are fully vaccinated with WHO-approved vaccines.”She pointed out that a large number of students from across the country travel overseas every year for higher studies, and several of them have got themselves inoculated with Covaxin shots. “They came to learn later on that their vaccination certificate is not valid abroad. These students are now at a fix regarding their next course of action and their career is at stake,” the chief minister further wrote.She added out that an early approval for Covaxin will also benefit those who are travelling abroad for jobs, business and any other purpose.Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, which has developed Covaxin, reportedly submitted the third-phase trial results of the vaccine to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on Tuesday. “We have received the data from phase-3 trials,” news agency ANI quoted a senior government official as saying.A top representative of Bharat Biotech said that from July onwards more private hospitals across the country could offer Covaxin doses as the drugmaker will be supplying 25 per cent of the total production volume of its Covid-19 vaccine to the private sector next month. At the moment, the company supplies 10 per cent of the total production volume.This comes amid a controversy over data from the phase-3 trials of Covaxin that Bharat Biotech earlier said it would make public in June, only to announce later that the data would, in fact, be made public in July, marking a delay of nearly a month from the originally announced timeline.Last week Bharat Biotech quashed rumours about its submission of Covaxin’s third phase trial data to the WHO for its approval, calling such reports “incorrect and lacking any evidence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/students-in-a-fix-mamata-seeks-pm-s-intervention-for-who-s-approval-of-covaxin-101624543375353.html
24-06-2021||India||China’s amassing of troops, bids to change status quo to blame for LAC standoff: India||India on Thursday blamed China’s actions of amassing troops in border areas and attempting to change the status quo on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) for the ongoing military standoff, dismissing Beijing’s contention that New Delhi’s policies were to blame for the tensions. The latest war of words between the foreign ministries of the two countries came against the backdrop of a lack in progress in disengagement and de-escalation of frontline troops following a limited drawdown on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February. India has insisted that peace and tranquillity on LAC is a prerequisite for normalcy in the overall bilateral relationship. “It is well recognised that it has been the Chinese actions over the last year, including amassing of a large number of troops close to border areas in the western sector, and trying to unilaterally alter the status quo along the LAC, which have seriously disturbed peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a weekly news briefing. These actions, he said, have violated several bilateral agreements, including the 1993 and 1996 agreements which “mandate that the two sides shall strictly respect and observe the LAC and that the two sides will keep their military forces in the areas along the LAC to a minimum level”. Bagchi was responding to questions regarding the Chinese foreign ministry’s contention on Wednesday that Chinese troops were deployed at the border to prevent India from encroaching on Chinese territory, and that India’s aggressive policies alone were to blame for tensions on the LAC. “The military deployment by China in the western sector along the border is a normal defensive arrangement. It is meant to prevent the encroachment or threat against China’s territory by relevant country,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian had said. Zhao had contended the Indian side had been increasing its military presence along the border and “encroaching upon Chinese territory”. This, he said, was the root cause of the “tense situation along the borders”. The Chinese side further said the border issue shouldn’t be linked to bilateral ties. The strong Indian response to the stance adopted by China’s foreign ministry reflected the position taken in recent weeks by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who has maintained that Beijing’s actions were responsible for the military standoff and that bilateral relations could move forward in all spheres only after the two countries addressed the situation on the LAC. India has repeatedly said complete disengagement at all friction points on the LAC and peace and tranquillity in the border areas alone can lead to the normalisation of the overall bilateral relationship. Participating in a virtual dialogue at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday, Jaishankar said the onus is on China to adhere to written agreements with India on not deploying large numbers of armed troops along the border so that the two countries can take forward their ties on the basis of mutual sensitivity, mutual respect and mutual interest”. Though there has been considerable speculation about India and China holding a meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, Bagchi told the briefing that he didn’t “have any update to share for the moment”. More than a year after the standoff began, the disengagement of troops is yet to be completed after 11 rounds of military talks and seven rounds of diplomatic talks. China’s People’s Liberation Army has continued the deployment of troops and heavy equipment on the LAC and inducted the army’s air defence units in its air force command chain, establishing a joint air defence system for the first time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinas-amassing-of-troops-bids-to-change-status-quo-to-blame-for-lac-standoff-india-101624543669827.html

"We kept five demands in the meeting- grant statehood soon, conduct Assembly elections to restore democracy, rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits in J&K, all political detainees should be released and on domicile rules," Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said after the three-hour meeting concluded. "The Home Minister said the government is committed to granting statehood to Jammu and Kashmir," the Congress leader said.Today’s meeting with political leaders from Jammu and Kashmir is an important step in the ongoing efforts towards a developed and progressive J&K, where all-round growth is furthered. pic.twitter.com/SjwvSv3HIpMeeting the leaders from the Valley, PM Modi said that there would be political differences, but everyone should work in the national interest for the benefit of the people. PM Modi said there should not be 'Dil ki Duri' and 'Dilli ki Duri', news agency ANI reported, citing sources.Also Read: Why all-party meeting on J&K is important and what's on agenda"Today’s meeting on Jammu and Kashmir was conducted in a very cordial environment. Everyone expressed their commitment to democracy and the constitution. It was stressed to strengthen the democratic process in Jammu and Kashmir," Union minister Amit Shah said."We first expressed anger over how the bifurcation was done. We have said there should be development and for that statehood and elections are necessary. We said we need a guarantee that land and jobs will be protected. There should be immediate steps for the rehabilitation of Pandits," the former chief minister of the former state said.PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti, who earlier commented that PM Modi should speak to Pakistan too, said she told PM that J&K's people do not accept the manner in which Article 370 was abrogated. "People of J&K are in a lot of difficulties after 5th Aug 2019. They are angry, upset and emotionally shattered. They feel humiliated. I told PM that people of J&K don't accept the manner in which Article 370 was abrogated unconstitutionally, illegally and immorally," Mufti said.While the political parties raised the demand for the restoration of the statehood before elections, Union minister Amit Shah said elections can't be held without completing the delimitation exercise, which got delayed because of the pandemic, Ghulam Nabi Azad said.National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said it was conveyed to PM Modi that what the Central government did to J&K on August 5, 2019, was a breach of trust. "We told PM that we don't stand with what was done on 5th August 2019. We are not ready to accept it. But we won't take the law into our hands. We will fight this in court. We also told PM that there's been a breach of trust between the state and the Centre. It's the Centre's duty to restore it," Omar said.People's Conference leader Sajjad Lone said the meeting was cordial. "We came out quite positive that hopefully there will be some delivery for the people of Jammu and Kashmir," Sajjad Lone said.J&K Apni Party's Altaf Bukhari said PM Modi heard everyone and asked all to participate in the delimitation process. "We have been assured that this is the roadmap towards elections," Altaf Bukhari said.The fact that the meeting went on for over three hours is in itself an indication of the success of the meeting, BJP's Ram Madhav tweeted soon after the conclusion of the meeting.Minister of State in PMO Jitendra Singh, principal secretary to Prime minister P K Mishra and Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla were among those who attended the meeting apart from PM Modi and Amit Shah. Four former chief ministers of the erstwhile state Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah of the National Conference, Congress’ Ghulam Nabi Azad and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti were also present in the meeting.

The cases filed by the previous All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government include those related to protests against the Chennai-Salem expressway, Kudankulam nuclear power plant, hydrocarbon extraction projects, and the three new farm laws passed last year.Stalin, who made the announcement on the last day of the current assembly session, said the cases were being withdrawn to uphold the rights of the protesters and protect the freedom of expression. He also announced ₹1,000 crore for temple renovation in the state.Activists say over 10,000 cases were registered against protestors across five districts in Tamil Nadu over the protests against the Salem-Chennai expressway alone. “We welcome the government dropping cases against us, but this is not enough,” said A Chandramohan, state secretary, All India Kisan Mahasabha.Also Read | Chennai nurse, first case of Delta Plus variant in TN, has recoveredHe asked the government to pass a resolution in the assembly insisting that the central government scrap this project. “Tamil Nadu revenue department is the local authority for the land acquisition process. Without its support, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) cannot implement it.”In December 2020, the Supreme Court upheld the land acquisition notifications for the expressway partially allowing appeals of the Union government and the NHAI.Stalin met Prime Minister Narendra Modi this month in Delhi and sought the scrapping of several centrally sponsored schemes and projects including the Salem-Chennai expressway. Stalin has announced a resolution that will be passed against the farm laws and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the budget session of the assembly scheduled in July.On June 13, Stalin wrote to Modi saying no hydrocarbon projects should be taken up in the protected agriculture zone in the interests of the agrarian community and the ecology of the region.Stalin earlier ordered the withdrawal of most of the cases against anti-Sterlite protestors on the third anniversary in May of the police firing that killed 13 civilians. The civilians were protesting in Thoothukudi district against the Sterlite facility. The DMK government has also decided to provide no-objection certificates to those arrested during the protest for pursuing higher education and jobs.The previous AIADMK government, before the assembly elections, dropped a majority of cases against anti-CAA protestors, Covid-19 lockdown violators, and pro-jallikattu activists. A few of these protests were supported by the DMK when it was in the opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-cm-stalin-announces-dropping-of-cases-against-protesters-101624540009831.html

Health minister Rajesh Tope was also present,” ANI quoted the secretariat as saying.This comes after Rajesh Tope said on Wednesday that he has directed officials to closely monitor the Delta Plus variant of SARS-CoV-2 causing Covid-19. He added that officials have also been asked to collect and record information regarding cases related to the variant for study. “We are taking 100 samples from every district,” he told ANI.Citing a study, Tope further stated that the Delta Plus variant could be more virulent than other variants of the virus. His remarks came as Maharashtra reported 21 independent cases of the Delta Plus variant. Tope added that a separate hospital ward has been formed for such patients.“It is a matter of concern for the state as the number of fresh (daily) Covid-19 cases is not dropping below 8,000. In the last 7 to 8 days, the state has been adding around 7,000 to 8,000 new Covid-19 cases per day but the number is not going down,” Tope said.Notably, Maharashtra reported 10,066 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, highlighting another jump from Tuesday’s daily case count of 8,473 cases, the state health bulletin data showed. Following this, the cumulative tally of coronavirus cases in the state has climbed up to 59,97,587, the bulletin data added.India has been grappling with rising cases of coronavirus due to the Delta Plus variant, with 40 samples found to have been infected till now. According to a statement by the union ministry of health and family welfare, most of the cases have been detected in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala.Tamil Nadu confirmed its first case on Wednesday after a top government official confirmed that a Chennai-based nurse contracted the variant of the virus. On the other hand, two cases – one each in Mysuru and Bengaluru, were also detected in Karnataka on the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-cm-talks-to-7-district-collectors-asks-to-gear-up-for-covid-third-wave-101624537961120.html

Bangalore-based Maheshwari moved the high court after the Ghaziabad Police summoned him to its Loni Border police station on Thursday to record his statement in connection with a video that seemed to show a hate crime targeting a Muslim man in Ghaziabad, and was amplified as such. The police, however, subsequently claimed it was not a communal incident.Maheshwari’s counsel told the court that he is an employee of Twitter and he had nothing to do with the offence. He also highlighted that Ghaziabad Police wanted Maheshwari to be present in-person despite Supreme Court and high court stating that the statement can be recorded through video-conferencing.Twitter India MD Manish Maheshwari, who lives in Bengaluru in Karnataka received a notice from the Ghaziabad police on June 17 and was asked to join the probe. The police also gave him seven days to get his statement recorded in the case.Ghaziabad Police booked Twitter Inc, Twitter Communications India, news website The Wire, journalists Mohammed Zubair and Rana Ayyub, besides Congress leaders Salman Nizami, Maskoor Usmani, Shama Mohamed and writer Saba Naqvi with connection to the case on June 15. The police alleged that these people mentioned above tried to disrupt communal harmony by spreading such messages. In the video, the elderly man, Abdul Shamad Saifi, claimed that he was thrashed by some young men who had also asked him to chant ‘Jai Shree Ram’ on June 5. Journalist Rana Ayyub was granted transit anticipatory bail for a period of four weeks in connection with the case by the Bombay high court.Police claim that the altercation was not due to any communal reason but over some amulets sold by the man to a few youths in the area who assaulted him over the sale. Police arrested nine men - Kalloo Gurjar, Parvesh Gurjar, Adil, Intezaar, Saddam, Himanshu, Anas, Shavez and Babu - following the assault on the elderly man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-hc-grants-interim-relief-to-twitter-india-head-in-ghaziabad-assault-case-101624536830689.html
24-06-2021||India||Rajasthan seeks relocation of tigers to MHTR, conservation team plans visit||The lone tigress at the Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR) in Rajasthan’s Kota district is likely to get a companion soon as the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has formed a team to inspect the area in an attempt to strengthen and improve the Reserve.The hill reserve, which had a significant tiger population in 2018, is now left with an 8-year-old tigress MT-4 since two tigers and two cubs died last year between July-August, and another tiger MT-1 went missing.Chief Wildlife Warden, Mohan Lal Meena said the Rajasthan forest department had submitted a proposal to NTCA for relocating two tigers and a tigress to MHTR, along with the compliance report of the recommendations made by them. “We had discussions with them, now a NTCA panel will be inspecting the compliance of work done by the state forest department,” he said.According to Meena, the NTCA had recommended increasing the prey base, making the reserve disturbance free with relocation of villages and other steps. The prey base has increased and the shifting of over 500 chitals has been approved and relocations of villages have been completed.Environmentalists have time and again raised their concerns over the health and fertility of the lone tigress at the Mukundra Hills Tiger Reserve , if pairing was not done soon.Even after spending ₹30 crore on the fencing of MHTR for tiger safety and creation of the required infrastructure, the reserve is left with only one tigress. Tigress MT-4 is still living in an inner soft enclosure of 28 hectares, where tigers are kept before their release in the wild area spread over 80 square km at MHTR. Two tigers and two cubs of MHTR died between July and August last year.“MT-4 is nearly eight years old and has delivered cubs twice. The tigress can deliver twice more before she is 10 years old. The average age of tigers in the wild is 15 to 16 years,” said Daulat Singh Shaktawat, former deputy conservator of forests of the Ranthambore Tiger Reserve in Sawai Madhopur and a representative of NTCA.“Staying alone can have an adverse impact on the age, health and fertility of the lone tigress, so its pairing is necessary,” he said.Shaktawat emphasised the importance of pairing by giving an example. “When the wildlife department was facing difficulty in tranquilising tiger MT-1 in the forests of Ramgarh Vishdhari Sanctuary in Bundi, it played out recorded voice calls of a tigress to lure the tiger. And the trick worked. The tiger came out after hearing the voice call of the tigress, and the forest department staff succeeded in tranquilising it,” he said. “Tigers and tigresses feel stressed if they are kept alone for long.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-seeks-relocation-of-tigers-to-mhtr-conservation-team-plans-visit-101624536048318.html
24-06-2021||India||Pfizer says its vaccine highly effective against Delta variant||Pfizer which is in the final stages of striking an agreement with India claimed on Thursday that its vaccine is highly effective against the Delta variant of Covid-19, the variant which has emerged as a new threat to the world. In India, the Delta variant was considered to be the reason behind the second wave. A second mutation of the variant, called Delta Plus, has also been reported in India and in some other countries, including the UK and the US. Hence, all vaccine makers are relooking their data on the effectiveness of the vaccines on these variants."The data we have today, accumulating from research we are conducting at the lab and including data from those places where the Indian variant, Delta, has replaced the British variant as the common variant, point to our vaccine being very effective, around 90%, in preventing the coronavirus disease, Covid-19," Alon Rappaport, Pfizer's medical director in Israel told local broadcaster Army Radio, Reuters reported.As Pfizer seems all set to enter India, its effect against the Delta variant will amp up India's fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. The union health ministry has said that both Covishield and Covaxin, the two vaccines which have been part of India's vaccination drive, are effective against the Delta variant.Sputnik V, the Russia-made vaccine available now in India, has also claimed that the vaccine is effective against the Delta variant.Delta variant, first reported from India, has proved to have been more virulent than the previous variant. It is now responsible for around 100 per cent of Covid-19 infections in the UK.Pfizer in IndiaPfizer CEO Dr Albert Bourla recently said that the agreement with the Indian government is being finalised. The company, as it did in all other countries, wanted legal protection in India, which initially created a bottleneck as no other vaccine maker enjoys indemnity in the country as yet. "My hope is that very soon we will finalise the approval of the product in India by the Indian health care authorities and the agreement with the government so that we can also start sending vaccines, on our side,” Bourla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pfizer-says-its-vaccine-highly-effective-against-delta-variant-101624535364701.html
24-06-2021||India||US lobby group views India's e-commerce plan as worrying, email shows||A top lobby group that is part of the U.S Chamber of Commerce believes India's proposed new e-commerce rules are a cause for concern and will lead to a stringent operating environment for companies, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.India this week spooked online retailers like Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart by outlining plans to limit "flash sales", reining in a private label push and mandating them to have a system to address grievances.The Washington-headquartered U.S-India Business Council (USIBC), of which Amazon and Walmart are members, described the rules as concerning in an internal email, saying some provisions were in line with New Delhi's stance on other big digital companies.India's draft plan "includes several concerning policies, including significant limits on platforms' ability to organise sales and handle grievances," USIBC said in an email to its members.USIBC has in the past urged India not to tighten a separate set of rules governing foreign investment in companies like Amazon and Flipkart, an issue that has often soured trade relations between India and United States.USIBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The new rules - open for consultation until July 6 - are expected to have an impact across the board in an online retail market forecast to be worth $200 billion by 2026.They will also apply to Indian firms like Tata's BigBasket and Reliance Industries' JioMart, but the proposal comes after Indian retailers for years complained that market leaders Amazon and Flipkart used complex business structures to bypass India's foreign investment law, hurting small businesses.The companies deny any wrongdoing.India's new proposed rules have raised concerns they will force Amazon and Flipkart to review their business structures, industry sources and lawyers have told Reuters.The USIBC email noted that India's proposals "preclude (e-commerce) platforms from owning vendors".Amazon specifically holds an indirect stake in two of its top sellers and a Reuters investigation in February cited Amazon documents that showed it gave preferential treatment to a small number of its sellers.India's rules also will force e-commerce companies to reveal the country of origin of a product and suggest alternatives to ensure a "fair opportunity for domestic goods".Some of the new provisions align with India's similar federal policies "for social and digital media companies ... and will result in a more stringent e-commerce regime," USIBC said in its email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-lobby-group-views-india-s-e-commerce-plan-as-worrying-email-shows-101624534201343.html

AAP leader Ravindra Jugran said, “The breaking of pots was a symbolic protest to signify that with the fake Covid test scam in Mahakumbh, BJP’s pot of sins was going to burst. With the scam in Mahakumbh, India’s reputation has taken a hit.” Demanding a judicial probe in the scam, Jugran added, “The role of BJP leaders and government officials is clearly visible in this scam. Hence, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat who is also the state health minister, should resign from his position.” Congress state spokesperson Garima Dasauni on Thursday also accused the government of “misleading the public by claiming no scam happened in the Mahakumbh.” She said, “We are holding a fast at Ganga ghats but actually, the BJP should have done this for the blot on the dignity of Maa Ganga this scam has brought.” A day ago, she had shared photographs of the owner of the private agency under the scanner with BJP heavyweights, and said, “The photographs which feature him with BJP heavyweights such as JP Nadda, Smriti Irani, Narendra Singh Tomar, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, Uttarakhand CM Tirath Singh Rawat, MPs Sunny Deol and Ajay Bhatt, just shows what relations Pant, the mastermind of the scam, had with them.” The BJP meanwhile refuted the allegations, saying “Congress is frustrated”. “The Congress has lost its mind in frustration. It is normal for any big leader to have photographs with various people. If the photographs of their big leaders is pulled out, then they would be in trouble,” said party state vice president Devendra Bhasin. He added, “As far as the alleged scam is considered, the government is determined to take strong action against those involved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ukhand-fake-covid-testing-congress-s-state-wide-protests-on-friday-101624535087196.html

24-06-2021||India||After court pulls up, U'khand CM says preparations on to combat Covid third wave||Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said on Thursday that the state government is making all preparations in order to combat the possible third wave of coronavirus (Covid-19).He added that he has also directed to convert the chief minister’s residence into a Covid care centre in view of the probable third wave of the viral disease.“I had not even thought of the second Covid wave. It was bad. Now, we have controlled the situation and increased the number of hospitals in the state. They will possibly reach 30 in number,” Rawat was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Saluting the medical fraternity, the chief minister further stated that he himself had experienced the tragedy wrought by pandemic as he had to perform the last rites of several police and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) personnel.This comes after the Uttarakhand High Court earlier in the day reprimanded health secretary Amit Negi for the state government’s preparedness to tackle the possible third wave and the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19.Hearing public interest litigation (PIL) on the handling of the pandemic by the state government, the court said that the administration cannot “leave the children to die” and that their arrangements are inadequate.“The Delta variant was spread across the country in a month, the Delta Plus variant will not take even three months. What are you doing to save our children? You must be thinking that Delta Plus variant will say let the government prepare first and then it will attack,” the division bench said, as reported by ANI.“Stop fooling us as we know the reality. Don't tell the Chief Justice that there is Ram Rajya in Uttarakhand and that we live in heaven,” the court further noted.India is among 11 countries where Covid-19 cases related to the Delta Plus variant have been confirmed. As many as 40 samples from across the country have been found infected so far, with most cases being in Kerala, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Tamil Nadu also reported its first Delta Plus variant case, with a Chennai-based nurse getting infected, a top government official said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, two cases of the variant were reported in Karnataka – one each from Bengaluru and Mysuru, state health Minister Dr K Sudhakar said.The variant that has till now affected almost 200 people worldwide has been labelled as a “variant of concern” by the Indian government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-court-pulls-up-u-khand-cm-says-preparations-on-to-combat-covid-third-wave-101624532655584.html

The petition challenges BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari’s victory over the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo from Nandigram constituency in 2021 West Bengal Assembly elections.Banerjee also appeared for the hearing virtually.Appearing for Banerjee, advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi mentioned instances that show Justice Kausik Chanda has connections with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and highlighted a case where the Judge moved the intervention application on behalf of the saffron party, news agency ANI reported.“You lawyers also have political affiliations. You are from Congress and Mukherjee (Mamata Banerjee’s counsel Soumendra Nath Mukherjee) has BJP background. But you are appearing for TMC’s Mamata Banerjee’s case,” ANI quoted Justice Chanda as saying to Singhvi.Justice Chanda, as per the report, said that the petitioner has full right to move for recusal and that the matter will be decided judicially.Banerjee has also moved an application to change the judge in the case, alleging that Justice Chanda has links with the central ruling dispensation.Notably, the matter was deferred to this day on June 18 after Mukherjee requested the same to the court. “In the meantime, the Registrar shall file a report before this court as to whether the petition has been filed in conformity with the Representation of People Act,” the Calcutta High Court had directed in the order.According to a Bar and Bench report, Justice Chanda further asked Banerjee’s unit as to why the recusal application was not pointed out on June 18, when the matter was first heard.Adhikari, who was once a close-aide of Banerjee in TMC, defeated her in Nandigram by 1,956 votes. Soon after, the chief minister alleged that the returning officer of the Assembly seat had said that he was threatened against recounting of votes.Despite the loss, TMC pulled off a landslide triumph in the polls by winning 213 seats of a total of 294, while the BJP emerged as the primary opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/calcutta-hc-reserves-order-on-mamata-banerjee-s-plea-on-nandigram-poll-result-101624530995852.html

Out of 577 Prasar Bharati centres across the country, 10% adopted e-office in 2019. By 2020, it was 74% of Prasar Bharati centres and the remaining 16% joined by June 18, 2021. Also Read | Prasar Bharati looks at BBC model for makeoverAnuradha Agrawal, additional director general (Tech), Prasar Bharati, said, “In 2019, we adopted e-office and it was picking up. But, it helped when Covid hit; files could not move and everyone was home. Even though we were home, data was available on e-office and we could complete our daily work very smoothly and efficiently. Covid did not affect even 1% of our work.”She said adoption of e-Office was CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati’s initiative. “He made it clear that he would not receive any files in physical form. So in Delhi, we adopted e-office even before Covid and other centres did so during the pandemic. That’s how we became 100% paperless.”According to the government statement, the CEO office has cleared 11,186 e-files since August 2019. Currently, only new files have been digitised and the old files remain in physical form. However, the public broadcaster aims to digitise the old files in the next phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prasar-bharati-goes-100-paperless-101624531967798.html

Every farmer will be given a maximum of ₹6,000 under the scheme to buy fodder.Patnaik said while almost all other sectors of the economy were in a state of turmoil, only agriculture and allied sectors were keeping the economy afloat during the Covid-19 pandemic.During the state-wide lockdown amid the second wave of Covid-19, dairy farmers were hit hard when OMFED, the top body of milk producers and other cooperative unions in the state, cut down milk procurement from about 5.45 lakh litre a day to 2-3.75 lakh litres a day during the lockdown citing low demand.The sale of dairy-based products like cheese, ghee and curd also dipped considerably with shops remaining closed and lockdown restrictions forced distress sale, several dairy farmers said.“Dairy farming plays an important role in the rural economy and is especially helpful in the livelihoods of small and marginal farmers. A large decline in the demand for milk and dairy products due to the Covid pandemic has seriously affected the livelihoods of dairy farmers,” Patnaik said, explaining the rationale behind the assistance package.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-announces-package-for-lockdown-hit-dairy-farmers-101624530766965.html
24-06-2021||India||State boards can come up with own Class 12 assessment schemes: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Thursday said that state boards are free to have their own assessment scheme for Class 12 students but has insisted that it be notified within 10 days and results should be announced by July 31.The order was passed by a bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari on a public interest litigation filed by a group of parents led by Anubha Shrivastava Sahai. The petition demanded cancellation of all state board examinations and a uniform assessment scheme for Class 12 students across the country.Haryana state board opposed the idea of a uniform assessment scheme and sought a clarification. Assam informed that the assessment scheme is under preparation.The bench said, “We make it clear that each board may formulate its own scheme. We direct the boards to formulate and notify the scheme not later than 10 days from today and declare results by July 31, which is the timeline specified for the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE).”The decision by the court is set to be benefit over 10 million Class 12 students across various state boards. In all, 21 state boards cancelled the Class 12 examinations this year in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Six state boards had already conducted the examination in March-April this year. The only exception was the state board of Andhra Pradesh, which informed the Supreme Court on Wednesday that it will be holding Class 12 examinations by July-end. The state government indicated in its affidavit that it was confident to hold Class 12 examinations for over 519,000 students by putting in place all safety protocols. But the bench pointed out many gaps in the state’s preparedness. “Going by your affidavit, the state would need 34,634 classrooms to accommodate 15 students per room. These rooms have to be ventilated. Do you have so many rooms? Merely stating that we want to hold examination is not enough. All logistics have to be arranged with regard to invigilators and support staff. You have to take responsibility of students, staff and frontline workers,” the bench said.“It is not a question of holding an examination alone but about the health and safety of every individual. No state board has willingly cancelled the examination...In the second wave, everything was over in 10 days. If it happens again, are you ready to risk the life of students?” it asked.Terming the situation uncertain, particularly with experts warning of a third wave, the bench said, “We don’t know what will happen in July. If you hold examinations, when will you announce results? If you are unable to hold them, is there a contingency plan?” The state agreed to answer to all these questions by Friday, when the bench will again hear the matter.In its affidavit, the state had said that the decision to hold examinations was taken in the interest of students since Class 12 marks are crucial for admission to future courses. In Class 10, the state board awards grades and there was no reliable means to assess Class 12 students based on internal tests conducted by schools. The bench said it was open for the state to consult its experts or take advice from CBSE, CISCE. Any delay to take decision will cost students admission into central educational institutions this year, the bench observed.On a separate application by a group of parents challenging Kerala state board’s decision to hold Class 11 examinations in September, the bench directed the petitioners to approach the Kerala high court as the matter heard by the top court related to Class 12 examinations alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-boards-can-come-up-with-own-class-12-assessment-schemes-supreme-court-101624528306830.html

Fourteen leaders, including four former chief ministers (CMs) of the then state have been invited. Union home minister Amit Shah, National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval, Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor Manoj Sinha and home secretary would also attend the meeting.This is the first high level interaction to be held between the central government and Kashmir's political leadership since 2019, when the former scrapped Article 370 and 35A, which gave special status to J-K and its people. The meeting is expected to lay down a road map for conducting assembly elections. Talks are also expected on issues and problems faced by the Union Territory's population. The issue of revocation of Article 370 and 35A , which has invited sharp criticism from top political brass of J-K including the likes of National Conference (NC) patron Farooq Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti, is likely to be raised.

He did not take part in Nambi Narayanan's interrogation or arrest. He only interrogated Mariam and D Sasi Kumaran, the former space scientist.He interacted with Fauzia Hassan, another Maldivian woman just one time. Other than that, he was not connected with the episode. He has not even met Nambi Narayanan and had no reason or occasion to do anything against him.

At the national level, the daily rate of vaccination has to treble so that 75% of our population gets fully vaccinated by end of this year,” she said in her opening remarks at a meeting with the party’s general secretaries and state chiefs.“No doubt, this is dependent entirely on the adequacy of vaccine supply. We must continue to put pressure on the Union government which has, at our Party’s insistence, finally taken on the responsibility for this. At the same time, we have to ensure that registration takes place, that vaccine hesitancy wherever evident is overcome and vaccine wastage is minimised,” Gandhi said.Also Read | Chennai nurse, first case of Delta Plus variant in TN, has recoveredNearly 6.4 million doses of vaccines were administered against Covid-19 across the country till 11 pm on Wednesday, as per the Co-WIN dashboard – making it the day with the second-highest daily inoculation figures since the start of the drive.India’s latest round of vaccinations began on Monday with a record 8.5 million doses administered, but the numbers saw a slight drop on Tuesday when there were around 5.4 million daily jabs with numbers fluctuating heavily across states.Gandhi asked the party leaders to give “urgent attention” and take “provocative measures” in the context of a possible third Covid-19 wave. “We have to take steps to be better prepared if and when this strikes. The second wave these past four months has been devastating for lakhs and lakhs of individual families all over the country. We must learn from this traumatic experience so that we do not have to experience it yet again,” she said.The meeting to deliberate on an outreach programme by the Congress was called as the party now aims to focus on the daily wagers and unorganised sector hit by the pandemic.HT reported on Thursday that Congress general secretary KC Venugopal has written to the state party units saying they aim to provide relief “especially to those who have kept essential services running but are not recognised as frontline workers”.Gandhi referred to the letter and the tasks ahead for the Congress workers. She spoke about the “intolerable burden being imposed by rising fuel prices” and how “prices of many other essential commodities like pulses and edible oils too have skyrocketed causing wide-spread distress.”“This price rise is taking place at a time when livelihoods are being lost in unprecedented numbers, when there is mounting unemployment and when economic recovery is not a reality,” she said.A Congress leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the party is working on an action plan for protests against the price rise of essential commodities and fuel.The Congress’s new approach to Covid-19 related outreach will now include farmers, agricultural labourers, street vendors, artisans, washermen, weavers, potters, masons, domestic workers and carpenters.There was no immediate response from the government or the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/continue-pressure-on-govt-to-treble-daily-vaccination-rate-sonia-gandhi-to-aicc-101624521107367.html

The total subsidy swindled in this manner amounted to ₹3.49 crore,” said JN Pankaj, deputy inspector general of the wing.Kamaljeet Singh was arrested following a complaint by Rigin Bennet, manager of Redlands Ashlyn Motors PLC- a company that sells the mechanised machines in Kerala’s Thrissur. Harpal is yet to be arrested. The duo falsely claimed to have sold 278 machines in the company’s name to farmers of western Odisha districts of Bolangir, Sambalpur, Bargarh and Sonepur.An amount of Rs1.92 crores in different bank accounts of the two accused and their firms has been frozen.In March this year, an MLA of ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD), Sudhanshu Sekhar Parida faced similar accusations of siphoning subsidy amount meant for purchase of farm equipment. A complaint was filed before Odisha Lokayukta alleging the MLA had embezzled ₹6 lakh subsidy claiming to have purchased paddy harvesters.Paddy seedlings grown in a mat nursery are transplanted using a self-propelled machine. While manual paddy transplanting requires 8-12 labourers for one acre, a self-propelled rice transplanter covers four acres in a day by engaging only three people.Odisha government has been offering subsidy to encourage mechanisation of farming||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-police-arrests-fraudster-for-swindling-rs-3-5cr-of-farmers-subsidy-101624519545973.html

The bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari was reacting to the affidavit presented by the Andhra Pradesh government before the court."The state should have a decision and concrete plan. How can it play with the lives of students?" the bench asked. It said that the situation is very uncertain and if the exams are conducted in July, the results will be delayed further.In the affidavit, the Andhra Pradesh government said that around 5.20 lakh students will appear for the board examination and there would be precautionary measures in place, including holding exams on alternate days and allowing only 15 to 18 students at one exam centre."Going by your affidavit, you will need 34,634 rooms with 15 students per hall. Have you worked out a formula. Do you have so many rooms?" the bench asked.“Unless we are convinced that you are geared up to hold examinations without a single fatality, we will not permit you to hold examination," the bench told the counsel who appeared for Andhra Pradesh government.It also asked Andhra Pradesh government to produce by Friday all details about logistics, staff and safety protocols as it was not convinced by the state’s confidence to hold the examination.The strong words from the court came on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking cancellation of Class 12 physical examinations in view of the Covie-19 situation. Several students had also intervened in the petition seeking cancellation.The court had earlier told the state that it cannot keep the students hanging on fire and that if there is "even one fatality" then the state will be "held responsible for it".While hearing the case on Thursday, the Supreme Court said that there can't be a uniform scheme for assessment for all state boards across India. It directed all state boards which have cancelled Class 12 examinations to frame an assessment scheme based on internal assessment at the earliest and notify the same not later than 10 days from Thursday (June 24).The apex court also directed all states to announce results by July 31, the same timeline as fixed by Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and ICSE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-andhra-pradesh-insists-on-holding-class-12-exam-a-warning-from-supreme-court-101624517675884.html

We must continue to put pressure on the Union government which has, at our party's insistence, finally taken on the responsibility for this," she added.This comes days after the Congress, in a white paper on the Covid-19 pandemic, has sought free, universal vaccination for all Indians in the shortest possible time frame and compensation for those who died after contracting the viral disease.The document, released by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday asked the government to invoke compulsory licensing provisions under the Patents Act 1970 to ramp up domestic vaccine production.Releasing the paper, Gandhi said 90% of Covid-19 deaths in the second wave were “needless” as they could have been saved if oxygen or drugs were available, and demanded a commission to look into “what went wrong” in the government’s strategy .Thursday's meeting comes ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament which is likely to start in July.The Congress has been also attacking the government on issues related to the farmers' agitation against three new agri laws and fuel price hike.India has administered over 300 million coronavirus vaccine doses by Wednesday.India on Thursday recorded 54,069 fresh Covid-19 cases and 1,321 deaths, taking the caseload and death toll to 30,082, 778 and 391,981 respectively, according to the Union health ministry’s update at 8am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/work-to-address-covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy-sonia-gandhi-to-cong-members-101624516191681.html

24-06-2021||India||Chhattisgarh: 3 forest officials removed, 2 suspended over elephant’s death||Twelve days after a wild elephant was found dead in Chhattisgarh’s Surajpur district, three forest officials including a district forest officer (DFO) were removed and two others were suspended for negligence in duty, officials said on Thursday. Chhattisgarh principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF) Rakesh Chaturvedi said these officials acted “irresponsibly” and failed to take “immediate and effective” steps in the case of the elephant’s death, suspected to have occurred on June 3, but discovered by forest officials only eight days later on June 11. The officials claimed that the elephant was struck by lightning near Darhora village under Pratappur forest range. Particulars of the alleged negligent and irresponsible conduct by the errant employees were not available at the moment. The DFO of Surajpur Forest Division, Duleshwar Sahu was attached to a forest office in Raipur while sub-divisional forest officer (Pratapur) BK Lakra and forest ranger (Pratapur) Premchand Mishra were posted to the office of chief conservator of forest (CCF) of Ambikapur. Forest range assistant Vijay Kumar Kujur and beat guard Maan Singh were suspended, a forest department spokesman said. In another incident, a wild elephant was found dead in Dharamjaigarh forest division of Raigarh district on Tuesday and the exact reason of the death was yet to be ascertained. North Chhattisgarh was home to around 240 wild elephants, which roam in the forest lands in Surguja and nearby regions of the state, often triggering human-elephant conflicts. In the last decade, the state recorded an increase in its wildlife population including elephants, whose numbers rose from 225 to 290, as per the state forest department. Between June and October last year, 15 elephant deaths were reported in the state in separate incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-3-forest-officials-removed-2-suspended-over-elephant-s-death-101624515825766.html

The participation of over 1,500 teams during the grand finale of the first event indicates a bright future. The event also strengthens the Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign,” PM Modi said and lauded the participants from Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and other places who presented their digital toy ideas based on India’s history, mythology and the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic among others.The Prime Minister also made an appeal to the country’s youth with regard to self-reliance and coming up with local solutions in the world of toys and digital gaming.“Toys and games influence our mental power, creativity and our economy. All of us know that a child’s first school is his/her family. But the first book and first friends are toys,” PM Modi said.Toycathon 2021 was jointly launched by the Education ministry, Women and child development, Textile ministry, Department for promotion of textile and internal trade, Information and broadcasting ministry, MSME ministry and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) on January 5 this year to crowd-source innovative toys and game ideas.Around 120,000 people across the country took part in this event and over 17,000 ideas were submitted of which 1,567 were shortlisted for the final event which is being held from June 22-24. Amid the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic, the final will have teams with digital toy ideas and a separate offline event take place for non-digital toy ideas.“India’s domestic market as well as the global toy market offers a huge opportunity to our manufacturing sector. Toycathon-2021 is aimed at boosting the Toy Industry in India to help it capture a wider share of the toy market,” the Centre said in a statement.The launch of this event can be linked to PM Modi’s pitch for Made in India toys last year. During the 68th edition of his Mann Ki Baat on August 30, 2020, Modi said that the global toy industry was over ₹7 lakh crore and India’s share was very small. “We will have to work to increase it,” he said and called upon entrepreneurs to ‘team up for toys’ as it is time to be vocal for local toys. He also urged entrepreneurs to develop computer games in and about the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tradition-technology-india-s-greatest-strengths-pm-modi-at-toycathon-2021-101624511893925.html
24-06-2021||India||As PM Modi meets J&K politicians, here are the key players||Political leaders from Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) are all set to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday for the first engagement of this kind since August 2019, when the region was stripped of its semi-autonomous status with the effective nullification of Article 370. The parties invited to the meeting include the following: National Conference (NC): Former chief minister (CM) Farooq Abdullah-led NC also leads the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), which was formed last year for the restoration of Article 370. He said that their single focus right now is to ensure the unity and integrity of J&K. “Any talks that can take us out of this chaos and will lead to the welfare of the people, we are all for it,” he said. Abdullah will attend the meeting along with NC’s Members of Parliament Mohammad Akbar Lone and Hasnain Masoodi.Also Read | Unease in sections of BJP-RSS over all-party Kashmir meetingPeople’s Democratic Party (PDP): Former CM Mehbooba Mufti, who has been vocal about the restoration of J&K’s special status, will represent the party at the meeting. Mufti told HT that J&K has “been a crown of India”, which was dismantled by New Delhi “because it is a Muslim majority area.” The PDP has said that its sole motive for attending the meeting is to convey to Modi that the “unconstitutional move”, that stripped J&K of its special status, has been rejected by the people. It maintained the agenda is not just the restoration of statehood, but also getting “back the special rights”. Mufti has maintained that she will not contest elections until special status is restored.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP): Ravinder Raina, the party’s J&K chief, Nirmal Singh, and Kavinder Gupta will represent the BJP at the meeting. Gupta said they will enlist the benefits of the nullification of Article 370. Raina referred to Mufti’s demand for “holding talks with Pakistan as India was even engaging with Taliban” and added that “talks and terror cannot go together.” He added that PAGD’s demand for the restoration of the special status is useless.The Indian National Congress: Former CM Ghulam Nabi Azad, Tara Chand, and J&K unit chief Ghulam Ahmed Mir will attend the meeting on behalf of the Congress. Mir said any effort, big or small, towards undoing J&K’s bifurcation will be welcomed.Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI (M): The party is an ally of the PAGD. CPI (M) leader Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami, who will attend the all-party meeting, said the engagement is a result of the BJP’s realisation that its moves in the region have not been in the best interest of the people. He added that he does not want to speculate and lend any false hopes to the people as the agenda of the meeting is still unclear.Also Read | J&K BJP rejects PDP’s suggestion to talk to Pak before all party meetJammu & Kashmir Panthers Party (JKPP): JKPP leader Bhim Singh said his party’s primary demand at the meeting will be that an elected government be put in place.

He added he will apprise Modi of the “ground realities of pain and suffering.”J&K Apni Party: Altaf Bukhari, the party leader who is among those meeting Modi, has backed the restoration of the region’s statehood. The party was formed after the end of J&K’s special status. He said that they do not want to fix an agenda and are more concerned about the problems that the people of J&K face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-pm-modi-meets-j-k-politicians-here-are-the-key-players-101624514505769.html

24-06-2021||India||Fast unlocking, lesser vaccination rates risk renewed Covid spike, says report||The rush by India’s states to end lockdowns as new coronavirus infections (Covid-19) drop, rather than waiting for vaccination rates to rise, risks triggering fresh restrictions and holding back the nation’s recovery, according to global forecasting firm Oxford Economics.“States are easing lockdowns based on lower test positivity rates rather than vaccination progress. This risky strategy increases the chances of renewed outbreaks that would further delay the recovery," Priyanka Kishore, head of India and South East Asia Economics at Oxford Economics, wrote in a report to clients.The report said that provinces including national capital New Delhi have begun reopening amid signs of Covid-19 infections decreasing, causing mobility rates to improve as of mid-June. While that’s likely to foster return of some demand in the near-term, there’s the risk of consumption and business activity suffering going ahead should newer restrictions be placed to control a resurgent coronavirus wave.With only 3.9% of India’s population fully vaccinated, Kishore sees economically important states, including Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu not yet reaching the “safe” levels of vaccination.“The vaccine situation keeps our outlook cautious,” said Kishore, who maintained India’s growth forecast for this year at 9.1% -- a pace slower than the 9.5% predicted by the nation’s central bank. “Economic data also doesn’t support an upward revision to our growth expectations at this point,” she added.Earlier on Wednesday, it said that states' re-opening strategy in the wake of decline in Covid-19 cases is not "prudent" and might even result in rise in infections as vaccine coverage remains low in many states.The Oxford Economics also said that vaccination rates are far below the levels deemed to be safe for easing social distancing measures substantially in the more populous and economically important states."... we think this reopening strategy is not prudent and may result in a renewed rise in infections and re-tightening of restrictions in the future," the report added.According to the report, re-opening has commenced at a faster pace than it had anticipated as states have focused on declining test positivity rates as the guiding factor for easing measures rather than the share of population vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fast-unlocking-lesser-vaccination-rates-risk-renewed-covid-spike-says-report-101624509066637.html

Chakraborty filed the complaint saying the man posed as an IAS officer and requested the actor-turned-politician to be present at a Covid-19 vaccination drive organised by him.The TMC MP said she had attended the drive and even got herself vaccinated there to encourage people to take the Covid-19 vaccinations to contain the spread of the virus."He said that he was running a special drive for transgenders and specially-abled persons and requested for my presence. I took Covishield vaccine at the camp to motivate people for taking jabs. But I never received a confirmation message from CoWIN," she said.Chakraborty also claimed that the man was using a car with a blue beacon and fake sticker.The police have identified the arrested man as Debanjan Dev. Officials said that Dev had set up the free inoculation camp introducing himself as a joint municipal commissioner of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC).Outgoing mayor and chairman of the KMC board of administrators Firhad Hakim said if any official of the municipal corporation is found to be involved in the matter, the person will face strict action.The police further said that several people were administered Covid vaccines at the camp for which Dev had no permission from the KMC.The cops, however, said they haven't come across any vial having an expiry date and the seized vials will be sent for testing to find out if they are genuine or not."We haven't come across any vial having an expiry date.

24-06-2021||India||Delta Plus more virulent, Maha cases not falling below 8,000 a concern: Minister||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope has said the Delta Plus variant of the coronavirus could be more virulent than other variants. He was citing a study to say that the severity of Delta Plus could be higher.The minister's remarks came as Maharashtra recorded 21 cases of Delta Plus variant. Tope said a separate hospital ward is formed for such patients.“These are the index cases of Delta Plus variant and its severity could be higher. The study of this variant has indicated that it could be more virulent compared to the previous mutants,” Tope said on Wednesday. He said 100 samples each from 36 districts of Maharashtra have been taken and sent for genome sequencing.The minister also expressed concern over the number of daily cases not falling below 8,000.“It is a matter of concern for the state as the number of fresh (daily) Covid-19 cases is not dropping below 8,000. In the last 7 to 8 days, the state has been adding around 7,000 to 8,000 new Covid-19 cases per day but the number is not going down,” said Tope.Maharashtra on Wednesday reported more than 10,000 Covid-19 cases after a gap of one week, taking its tally to 59,97,587, according to state health department bulletin.The new Delta Plus variant has been formed due to a mutation in the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant, first identified in India and one of the drivers of the deadly second wave. Though there is no indication yet of the severity of the disease due to the new variant, Delta Plus is resistant to the monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment for Covid-19 recently authorised in India.Some cases of the Delta Plus variant of coronavirus have also been found in Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. The Centre has already declared the Delta Plus variant as 'variant of concern'.So far, 40 samples across the country have been found infected with the Delta Plus variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-plus-more-virulent-maha-cases-not-falling-below-8-000-a-concern-minister-101624510221080.html

In the course of investigation, the special team arrested one Amir Arsh of Ballabhgarh (Haryana) with the help of the Haryana State police," the release said.During interrogation, the accused confessed to the crime, explained the modus operandi and provided other leads."It is learnt that more than five groups have operated in Chennai city. A sum of ₹4.5 lakh was recovered from him (the arrested person). The special team is camping at Faridabad to arrest the remaining accused," it added.According to police, totally ₹48 lakh has been stolen from Automated Cash Withdrawal and Deposit Machines also known as Cash Deposit Machines (CDM) located in various places, including Velachery here.The CDMs provide a 20-second window to customers to take cash away and if it was not done, the cash went back into the machines.If cash was taken, the lid of the machine would slide and get closed.Probe indicated that the suspects first took the cash from the machines (using withdrawal option in such machines) and then prevented the lid from getting closed for a while by using their hands.The sensors appeared to have misread this action for "cash not being taken away" by customers and sent messages to servers that cash has not been withdrawn.Hence, the related bank accounts were not debited while cash was taken away from machines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-arrested-for-sbi-atm-heist-explains-modus-operandi-to-police-101624509467019.html

The water level could touch 5.67m at Sagar near the confluence of the Ganges and the Bay of Bengal. During the daily high tide, the water level reaches around 4.5m,” said an official, who did not want to be named.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee held a meeting on Wednesday to take stock of the situation and alert the district officials.Also Read | BJP, TMC face off over Mukul Roy’s induction in public accounts committeeThe state has received excess rainfall since June 1. The India Meteorological Department has predicted more rains. The state usually receives around 226 mm rain till June 23. This year, it has received 315 mm so far.“The coastal district of South 24 Parganas received 84% excess rain while East Midnapore received 63% excess rain during this period. Kolkata too received 83% excess rain,” said an official, who did not want to be named.Cyclone Yaas also inflicted severe damage to the sea dykes and river embankments in the coastal areas and Sunderban islands. Not all the damages could be repaired properly as the monsoon has set in.Officials fear if some of the weaker and damaged sections of embankments collapse, some of the villages will be flooded again.A storm surge triggered the maximum damage when Cyclone Yaas hit on May 26 . The cyclone coincided with the perigean spring tide (which occurs when the moon is closest to earth) and triggered the storm surge of 7m-8m high. Several villages were flooded and caused damage to property worth thousands of crores.The neighbouring states of Jharkhand and Bihar have also received excess rain.“When the neighbouring states receive excess rain, they release water from the dams. As a result, some of our districts including Howrah, Hooghly, Burdwan get flooded. The district administrations have been alerted,” said another official, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coastal-districts-in-bengal-on-high-alert-ahead-of-full-moon-tide-101624509465634.html

The privacy-focused app is also likely to be liable under the Information Technology Act and the provision of safe harbour in it is unlikely to be applicable to it due to the non-compliance, they added.The officials said the app, developed by the Silicon Valley based nonprofit Signal Foundation, has not shared the details of a compliance officer with the government under the new guidelines.Signal is a significant social media intermediary as it has over five million users in the country.Also Read | HC refuses to stay CCI notice to Facebook, WhatsApp in privacy policy matterThe new guidelines also mandate such as Signal and WhatsApp to share the details of the first originator of a message. WhatsApp has challenged the clause related to the new guidelines saying it is at odds with end-to-end encryption.“Signal has not complied with the guidelines. Services like iMessage do not fall under the traceability clause since the significant social media intermediaries in the nature of messaging services have to comply,” said an official, requesting anonymity.HT reached out to Signal for comments but did not receive a response immediately.At least eight parties have contested the new rules in several high courts, saying they are beyond the scope of the Information Technology Act they have been formulated under.Twitter, too, has faced off with the government over its failure to comply with the new guidelines. The guidelines mandate social media companies to appoint compliance officers, nodal officers, and grievance redressal officers.Signal became the most downloaded on the Apple App Store in March as WhatsApp faced privacy concerns. It was one of the most downloaded apps on Google Play Store on Monday.Namrata Maheshwari, Encryption Policy Fellow, Access Now, a digital civil rights organisation, said Signal cannot comply with the traceability requirement without weakening end-to-end encryption. “For example, Signal’s end-to-end encryption currently has a privacy-enhancing feature called ‘forward secrecy’ which ensures that the chain of a message on its platform cannot be tracked.” Maheshwari said if Signal is forced to change its service to comply with “these unlawful, disproportionate rules”, it would undermine privacy and security for its many users in India. “The main problem remains that these rules contain an unclear mandate on messaging services to facilitate surveillance that undermines encryption and enables potential misuse and selective application--which are concerns now being adjudicated by Indian courts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/messaging-application-signal-not-in-compliance-with-new-rules-say-officials-101624508925464.html
24-06-2021||India||Unease in sections of BJP-RSS over all-party Kashmir meeting||There is an unease in sections of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ideological fount, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), over the talks on Jammu & Kashmir being held under the shadow regional parties sticking to their demand for the restoration of the Constitution’s Article 370, people aware of the matter said.The parties, including the National Conference (NC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks in Delhi on Thursday. This is the first such meeting after Jammu & Kashmir was stripped of its statehood and semi-autonomous status.According to a person aware of the matter, the timing of the meeting has raised eyebrows in the party and the Sangh. The person added it is felt the government after opting for a muscular Kashmir policy seems to have climbed down from its position of not engaging with parties if they seek the restoration of Article 370. The Article gave the erstwhile state a special status and Article 35 (A) defined domicile rules.On August 5, 2019, the erstwhile state was bifurcated into two union territories of Jammu & Kashmir with a legislature and Ladakh without a legislature. Articles 370 and 35 (A) were read down after Parliament passed the Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation Bill.Also Read | J&K BJP rejects PDP’s suggestion to talk to Pak before all-party meet“Abrogation of Article 370 was a long-standing demand of the Sangh and the BJP. There is a section of people who feel that by inviting PDP and other parties that have a hardline view about issues such as reimposition of Article 370 and engagement with Pakistan, the government is following the policies of the (previous) Congress government,” said a party functionary.Bifurcation of the state into two union territories and abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35 (A) tops the list of the Modi government’s achievements.The regional parties have been critical of the decision and have been unambiguous in demanding the restoration of the status quo ante.In an interview with HT, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti said, “Article 370, which gave the state its special status, was unconstitutionally removed. It was a bridge that also connected us emotionally to the rest of India. We will not settle for less. We want Article 370 to be restored. We are fighting within the Indian Constitution, of which 370 was a part.” She added that restoration of statehood will not be enough. “We will not settle for anything other than the restoration of Article 370.”The decision to invite PDP, which was an ally of the BJP before the coalition government in Jammu & Kashmir fell on June 18, 2018, and its stated position of nudging India to hold talks with Pakistan and reimposition of Article 370 has particularly caused consternation, said a second functionary.Also Read | Explained: Why all-party meeting on J&K is important and what’s on agenda“Post-August 5 (2019) there was an indication that there would be a shift in the Union Territory’s polity. Newer political outfits and formations would get space that was occupied by the regional satraps. But the decision to invite PDP has raised a question about their future. A large number of workers, who quit the PDP and NC to join newer outfits such as the Jammu & Kashmir Apni Party and Jammu & Kashmir People’s Conference, in the hope of a new political beginning, might return to their old base and consequently derail the process of a newer political realignment,” the second person said.To be sure, both new parties will also be part of the all-party talks.Anil Gupta, a BJP spokesman in Jammu, said the talks are being held with political parties with a mandate. “Newer parties are present along with the older ones. The criterion (for invitations)... was some kind of mandate in the DDC (District Development Council) elections (held last year) and former chief ministers and deputy chief ministers,” he said.After August 2019, when the leaders of the mainstream parties were incarcerated, newer political parties such as Apni Party and Jammu & Kashmir Workers Party were floated in the erstwhile state. While there was scepticism that the foundations of these new parties were laid in Delhi, their leaders asserted that the new entities would fill the political vacuum.The meeting also sends a mixed message, said the first functionary. “The government and the party claimed that the parties have lost their relevance and the cases of corruption against them have exposed them. Now, these parties are back at the talking table.”Another grievance is the absence of voices from the Jammu region and no representation from the Kashmiri Pandit community. Ajay Chrungoo, chairman of the Panun Kashmir, which seeks a separate homeland for Pandits, said, “We do not know why these parties have been invited. But we have no invitation to join.”On Monday, the Panthers Party, the Dogra Front, and the PoJK Refugees Front staged protests in Jammu against what they alleged is the “neglect” of the Jammu region.Gupta said it is wrong to say that communities are being left out. “...all these political parties represent all the communities including Dogras and Kashmiri Pandits,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unease-in-sections-of-bjp-rss-over-all-party-kashmir-meeting-101624507905375.html

24-06-2021||India||J&K BJP rejects PDP’s suggestion to talk to Pak before all party meet||The sharp divide in opinions of political parties in Jammu and Kashmir has come to the fore ahead of the all party meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday with the J&K Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Ravinder Raina vehemently opposing People’s Democratic Party’s (PDP) suggestion to engage Pakistan in talks.“Talks with Pakistan are not possible. Guns and talks can’t go together. Pakistan is training and pushing terrorists into J&K for causing bloodshed, and operating terror camps in PoK (Pakistan occupied Kashmir). In the past 35 years, Pakistan has caused bloodshed in J&K. Therefore, the question of holding talks with Pakistan doesn’t arise at all,” Raina said on Wednesday afternoon before leaving for Delhi to take part in the all party meeting on Jammu and Kashmir.14 leaders, including some ex-chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir, have been invited to attend the first such meeting between the Centre and mainstream parties from the region after the abrogation of Article 370 and 35(A) and the bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two union territories in August 2019.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, whose party is one of the six in the Gupkar alliance, has suggested that India can talk to Pakistan “If they can... talk to the Taliban” to bring about a resolution to the Kashmir issue. People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) has also said that it will press for restoration of Article 370, 35(A) and Jammu Kashmir’s statehood.The battle lines are clearly drawn for the Thursday meeting with the J&K BJP having declared that they will oppose any attempt by the PAGD to raise demands for restoration of Article 370 and 35-A and talks with Pakistan and separatists.Raina also brushed aside concerns that some Jammu-based parties were not invited and said that BJP will represent all Jammu residents at the meeting. “We have represented them and will do so again. They should feel rest assured that their issues ...will [be] put forth... before the PM,” he said.Raina and Dr Nirmal Singh and Kavinder Gupta, the two former deputy chief ministers of the party left for Delhi on Wednesday afternoon.Other leaders who are scheduled to participate in the meeting are Congress’ Ghulam Nabi Azad, Tara Chand and GA Mir; National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah; Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti; J-K Apni Party’s Altaf Bukhari; CPI(M)’s MY Tarigami; National Panthers Party’s Prof Bheem Singh; and Peoples Conference’s Sajad Gani Lone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-bjp-rejects-pdp-s-suggestion-to-talk-to-pak-before-all-party-meet-101624505266296.html

24-06-2021||India||Explained: Why all-party meeting on J&K is important and what's on agenda||The Centre has invited mainstream politicians of Jammu and Kashmir for a meeting in Delhi. The meeting will be chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This is the first outreach initiative from the Centre since the abrigation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the region into two union territories: Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), a group of five parties in Jammu and Kashmir, held a meeting earlier this week to decide about the Centre's move. The group confirmed participation in the meeting and its leaders have reached Delhi.Mehbooba Mufti, the chief of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) - one of the constituents of PAGD - arrived in Delhi on Wednesday afternoon and National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah will fly to the national capital on Thursday morning.Union home minister Amit Shah, National Security advisor Ajit Doval, Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor Manoj Sinha and Union home secretary will also be present at the meeting which will take place at PM Modi's residence at 3pm.Who all are participating?The Centre has invited 14 leaders of mainstream political parties for Thursday's meeting. These include four former chief ministers - NC leaders Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar, PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, and senior Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad.Apart from these leaders, Congress' Tara Chand and GA Mir; J-K Apni Party's Altaf Bukhari; BJP's Ravinder Raina, Nirmal Singh and Kavinder Gupta; CPI(M)'s Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami; National Panthers Party's Prof Bheem Singh; and Peoples Conference's Sajad Gani Lone have also been invited to the meeting.Most of the 14 leaders have reached Delhi.What's on the agenda?No official agenda has been set for the meeting and a freewheeling discussion is expected. But leaders from Kashmir have indicated that they will press for restoration of Article 370 and full statehood.“We will put our point of view in the meeting tomorrow. The biggest thing what has been taken away from us should be given back to us,” said CPM leader Tarigami, the spokesperson for PAGD.“We (Congress leaders) will ask for agenda for this important meeting and then put our point of view before the PM,” said J&K Congress president, Ghulam Ahmad Mir.Discussions on delimitation and assembly elections are also expected to take place at today's all-party meeting.Why is this meeting important?The all-party meeting signals the restarting of political engagement between mainstream Kashmiri parties and the Centre, which in August 2019 voided Articles 370 and 35A that bestowed special status to Jammu and Kashmir and privileges to its residents, and split the state into two Union territories.All mainstream political leaders were detained, internet and phone connections were snapped and curfew-like restrictions were imposed in the Valley for months.Response in Kashmir valleyThe meeting, though first between the leaders from Jammu and Kashmir and the Centre since the August 2019 developments, drew lukewarm reactions in the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley. Here, limited trust in mainstream parties and hostility over the revocation of Article 370, which granted Jammu and Kashmir special status, persisted among residents.“Common Kashmiris have very little expectation from the meeting. Many are not even interested,” Abdul Gani, a retired government employee of Srinagar, told Hindustan Times.He believed that the calling of a meeting by the PM was a ‘routine political exercise’ to break the monotony after the decisions of August 2019.Politicians in the Valley remain bitterly opposed to J&K's bifurcation and revocation of Article 370.Political analyst Professor Noor Ahmad Baba said that Kashmiris doubt the intentions of the central government and mainstream Valley politicians. “The experiences of people in Kashmir prompt them to doubt the centre as well as local political leaders,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-why-all-party-meeting-on-j-k-is-important-and-what-s-on-agenda-101624504035701.html

The comoany had denied any role in the video going viral Maheshwari offered to join the pobe through video conference. But the Ghaziabad Police sent fresh summons on Tuesday asking the Twitter India MD to appear before it.“Clarification given by you is inappropriate. Being the MD of Twitter in India, you are the representative of the company. Therefore, you are bound by the Indian law to cooperate in the investigation,” the notice sent by the police said.Maheshwari is expected to visit at Loni Kotwali along with his lawyer at 10.30am, Livehindustan reported.It further said that the police have prepared a list of 11 questions for Maheshwari, including the one about failure to remove the controversial video. The police will also ask about the number of complaints against the video and what action the micro-blogging platform has taken, according to Livehindustan.The police on June 17 sent a set of summons over to the social media company over a video that went viral and seemed to show a hate crime targeting a Muslim man in Ghaziabad, and was amplified as such, but which the state’s police has subsequently claimed was not a communal incident.HT has seen a copy of the summons, which cites Section 41A of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) seeking the appearance of a person who has been named in a complaint. This section gives cops more authority to demand the presence of a person. The first notice was sent citing Section 160 of the criminal procedure code, which allows the police the ability to question any person who they believe may be aware of facts related to a complaint.The video being probed by the Ghaziabad Police shows a 72-year-old Muslim man being beaten up and his attackers chopping his beard. The police said the incident was not communal but a personal dispute of the victim with the suspects. However, the victim’s family has alleged a religion angle.The video surfaced on June 14 and a complaint against Twitter and several journalists was lodged at Loni Border police station on June 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-india-md-to-appear-before-cops-today-11-questions-ready-for-him-report-101624500071791.html

The Union health ministry said on Wednesday that there are 40 confirmed infections with the Delta Plus variant, up from 22 a day before."The Public Health Response, in this case, while broadly remaining the same, has to become more focused and stringent. Thus, you are requested to take up immediate containment measures in these districts and clusters including preventing crowds and intermingling of people, widespread testing, prompt tracing as well as vaccine coverage on a priority basis," Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a letter sent to state chief secretaries.Also Read: States prep for Delta+ as mutation cases riseDelta Plus has already been declared a variant of concern by the central government. The cases have primarily ben concentrated in three states - Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala.In Kerala, three villages have been shut and residents are being mandatorily tested for Covid-19, while in Maharashtra, health minister Rajesh Tope said that 100 samples from each district will immediately be sent for genome sequencing.

Though neutralisation has dropped, it's enough to protect against Delta variant. Delta Plus should also behave (in a similar manner). We are working in this direction. We have isolated this variant and we are going to conduct a study soon. We will come back with the study," she said.All Delta sub-lineages are treated as variants of concern (VOC) and properties of AY.1 are still being investigated.

24-06-2021||India||Chautala finishes prison term early; was out on parole||Former Haryana chief minister Om Prakash Chautala, sentenced in 2013 in a corruption case, has completed his prison term two months before he was supposed to on account of a special remission granted to around 20 convicts who have less than six months remaining in their jail term, people familiar with the matter said.Chautala has been out on parole since March 26 last year, when Tihar jail authorities released 1,000 prisoners on parole to decongest prisons in view of the Covid pandemic.Prison officials said Chautala did not return to Tihar in February this year, unlike the others released with him, citing medical grounds.The 86-year-old veteran politician, who continued to head the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) through his prison term, was admitted to a Gurugram hospital and moved the Delhi high court for an extension of his parole.“It was extended twice by the HC,” said a prison official on condition of anonymity.But Chautala will have to come to prison once to complete the formalities of his release.“He will be a free man. Since the former chief minister is on parole, he will have to surrender before the prison authorities for completing formalities,” Chautala’s lawyer Amit Sahni said.Tihar prison’s director-general Sandeep Goel said Chautala will be released because he has less than three months jail sentence to go, which would be counted as remission. An e-mail sent to his lawyer said he would have to formally surrender to complete the formalities.Officials said his son Ajay Chautala, however, did not qualify for special remission because he still has to serve about seven to eight months.Chautala, his son Ajay, 60, and 53 others were convicted on January 13, 2013, by a Delhi court for illegally recruiting 3,206 basic teachers in Haryana in 1999-2000 when the INLD chief was the chief minister. The Central Bureau of Investigation was ordered to probe the case by the Supreme Court on a petition filed by IAS officer Sanjeev Kumar, who accused Chautala of taking bribes to recruit teachers, and said he was forced to change the list of selected candidates.Chautala has been released on parole in the past, too, between July 5 and October 8, 2019, on different grounds such as his grandson’s engagement and wedding, and his wife’s death. His party, the INLD, hopes his presence will change the outfit’s fortunes, and called it a historic day for Haryana.“He will continue to fight for the farmers and labourers’ plight. He will reach out to workers across the state once he is discharged from Medanta hospital,” said INLD’s state president Nafe Singh Rathee.A family feud led to OP Chautala’s son Ajay Chautala to walk out of the party and form the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) with his sons Dushyant and Digvijay Chautala in December 2018.Dushyant’s JJP won 10 seats in the 2019 assembly polls and he has been serving as deputy chief minister in Haryana’s coalition government led by Manohar Lal Khattar of the Bharatiya Janata Party.OP Chautala’s INLD was confined to only seat, which was won by his son Abhay Singh Chautala from Ellenabad seat in Sirsa. Abhay resigned from the assembly in January this year in support of farmers protesting against three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chautala-finishes-prison-term-early-was-out-on-parole-101624484971987.html

Isro was to carry out the first unmanned flight of the human-rated GSLV Mk III and the country’s first solar mission, Aditya L1, in December, according to the revised schedule.“The decision on the new timelines for the missions is awaited,” an official from the agency said on condition of anonymity. Another official said the missions were likely to be delayed beyond their schedule.Last year, the space missions were impacted by the inability to move equipment and parts from across the country during the lockdown necessitated by the pandemic.The third lunar mission, carrying aboard only a lander and rover, was initially slated for the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021, but has since been pushed to 2022. The government green-lit the third mission soon after the lander-rover of the Chandrayaan 2 mission crashed and lost communication just 2.1km from the surface.The first unmanned Gaganyaan flight was initially planned for December 2020, the second for July 2021, and the first manned spaceflight was to happen by December 2021 ahead of the Prime Minister’s deadline of Independence Day 2022.Only three PSLV missions have been carried out since the pandemic began last year – the EOS-1 earth observation satellite mission in November, the CMS-1 communication satellite mission in December, and a mission carrying the Brazilian earth observation satellite as the main payload in February.The launch of GISAT 1, an earth imaging satellite, was postponed in March last year after technical issues following which it was scheduled for March this year but is yet to happen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-delays-big-ticket-launches-by-isro-this-year-101624483121219.html
24-06-2021||India||Borrowers’ nod needed to alter interest rates, says commission||Banks cannot change home loan interest rates without taking the consent of the borrowers, the Delhi consumer commission ruled in a judgment which further held that automatic change in interest rates amounts to “unfair trade practice”.The commission, presided over by justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal, noted that banks have to inform borrowers and seek their consent whenever interest rates of the home loans were being changed under the floating rate of interest plan.Citing a 2015 judgment of the Supreme Court, and a 2019 judgment of the national consumer forum, the commission said that it was not in dispute that in cases of floating rate of interest, the rate of interest on the loan kept fluctuating and these interest rates were changed as per the approvals of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). By signing a loan agreement, a borrower would also agree to these alterations in rate of interest as well as changes in total tenure of the loan repayment, noted the commission.“In simple terms, an opportunity must be afforded to the borrower before changing the floating rate of interest,” maintained the commission, adding that banks were duty-bound to inform the borrowers.“Consequently, we are of the view that the increase or decrease in the interest rates by the Opposite Party (bank) without taking the consent from the borrower/complainant amounts to unfair trade practice,” it declared. The commission’s judgment is dated May 11. It was released recently.The commission was adjudicating a consumer complaint by Vishnu Bansal, who availed of a home loan from ICICI Bank Ltd in November 2005 at a floating rate of interest of 8.75%. The adjustable margin was 1.5%. The loan was payable in 240 equated monthly instalments (EMIs).According to the complaint, Bansal noticed in 2010 that while the bank was initially charging EMI at the rate of 7.25%, the interest rate first increased to 8.75% and then to 12.25% without informing him. The tenure was also increased from 240 months to 331 months.Bansal cleared the home loan taken from ICICI by taking another home loan from a different bank but he complained that an additional amount of ₹1.62 lakh was charged on account of increase in interest rates.After the banking ombudsman failed to resolve Bansal’s complaint, he approached the consumer commission in 2019. The bank argued that Bansal was bound by the loan agreement containing stipulations regarding the floating rate of interest, which was signed by him after understanding it and admitting its contents. The commission noted that although ICICI had the power to change the rate of interest or change the number of the EMIs, the complainant was never apprised about these facts, and it was hence an unfair trade practice.It then directed the bank to pay back the amount of ₹1.62 lakh charged towards increase in rate of the interest, along with an interest of 6% from the date of filing of the complaint before the commission. The commission also ordered ICICI to pay ₹1 lakh to Bansal for mental agony and cost of litigation.An order of a state consumer commission can be appealed before the national consumer forum. ICICI officials did not respond to queries seeking a comment.Srinath Sridharan, independent markets commentator, said: “Consumers’ interest will need to be balanced with financial institutions’ concerns regarding asset-liability mismatch. I would suggest an ‘opt-out’ method could do the needful here when we have the trinity of Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile making even the most rural populace accessible to banks,” said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/borrowers-nod-needed-to-alter-interest-rates-says-commission-101624482295269.html

Two cases of the new variants have been reported in Karnataka – one each in Bengaluru and Mysuru, the minister said.The minister said the information has been shared with the Union health ministry and a further course of action is being planned. Adding that the state is monitoring the emergence of new variants, he announced that six genome labs were functioning in the state. “Wherever we have a suspicion, we are doing genomic sequencing. We are doing random checks of five per cent of the total samples checked,” Sudhakar said. The Delta variant of coronavirus has been held responsible for the deadly second wave of the pandemic in India. Several other countries also consider Delta as the factor behind a sudden surge of infections. He said that in the case detected in Mysuru the patient has been isolated and he is asymptomatic. “The virus hasn’t infected the primary and secondary contacts. The person is under observation,” the minister said. “Monoclonal Antibody treatment that was effective for the Delta variant is being resisted by the Delta Plus variant. Wherever there is a possibility of the Delta variant being found, across the districts, genome sequencing is being done there. A minimum 5% of random check-up is also being done,” he added. Stating that vaccination is the only way forward, Sudhakar said that the government is confident that the Covid-19 virus can be controlled. “CM BS Yediyurappa has flagged off an accelerated vaccination drive recently which resulted in 11,24,355 lakh doses of vaccination in a single day. We are ramping up the vaccination process every day. Yesterday (Tuesday), our state completed providing 2 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses,” the minister said. He added that the state received 4.5 lakh vaccine doses on Wednesday. “We have set up more than 13,000 sites to administer vaccines to people. Our state has been conducting more than 1 lakh Covid-19 tests every day,” he said. On Tuesday, the high-level committee led by Dr Devi Shetty formed to prevent the possible Covid-19 third wave submitted an interim report to the government. “It has been decided that within 45 days, preparations will be made at the district level, from setting up ICU units to deploying health care staff,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengaluru-logs-first-case-of-delta-plus-variant-says-karnataka-health-minister-101624479044256.html

He added that the state received 4,05,000 vaccine doses on Wednesday. “We have set up more than 13,000 sites to administer vaccines to people. Our state has been conducting more than 1,00,000 Covid-19 tests every day,” he said. On Tuesday, the high-level committee led by Dr Devi Shetty formed to prevent the possible Covid-19 third wave submitted an interim report to the government. “It has been decided that within 45 days, preparations will be made at the district level, from setting up ICU units to deploying health care staff,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-case-of-delta-variant-reported-in-b-luru-minister-101624478323530.html
24-06-2021||India||K’taka govt unveils ₹195 cr digi-learning initiative||Bengaluru The Karnataka government on Wednesday launched its ambitious ₹195 crore Digi-learning initiative that it hopes will bridge the gap between urban and rural geographies among other hurdles faced by students pursuing collegiate education. The launch of technology-interventions like smart classes comes at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown has forced a higher dependence on online classes across the country. “These initiatives will be helpful to resolve the imbalances between offline & online, digital & physical, rural & urban, government & private, rich & poor and also english & native language barriers with respect to access for quality teaching and learning, besides providing a strong platform to implement National Education Policy effectively,” Dr CN Ashwath Naryan, the deputy chief minister of Karnataka said in a statement on Wednesday. The state government also distributed 1,55,000 tablet PCs to students from across the state, amounting to ₹163 crore. The government also said that it had developed 2,500 smart classrooms at a cost of ₹27.77 crore and a Learning Management System (LMS) that cost ₹4.04 crore. The decision to take online classes was necessitated by the rapid surge in Covid-19 cases, endangering the lives of students and others in Karnataka and other parts of the country. However, a digital divide was seen in the rural areas where issues like affordability and connectivity added to the challenges of students who were forced to remain away from physical classes. The PCs will be distributed to first-year students of 430 government first grade colleges, first and second year students of 87 government polytechnic colleges and the all first, second and third year students of 14 engineering colleges, Narayan said. The department of higher education said that it had created around 3,05,000 materials of content, an online library with option for feedback rating, integrated student and teacher work diary and other measures as part of its reforms to the education sector. The smart classrooms will be equipped with projectors, white board, android box, UPS and internet facilities to enable both offline and online classes, the government said. The initiatives comes a day after the BS Yediyurappa government said that it is considering reopening higher education institutions in a phased manner after the technical advisory committee (TAC) submitted a report and recommendations on the imminent third wave of Covid-19 infections. Yediyurappa said that the decision will be based on the recommendations of the expert committee and following the vaccination of teachers and students. The initiatives on Wednesday are said to benefit 25,000 teaching staff and around 5,00,000 students in state-run institutions. The other features include PPT, video and study material for each subject, multiple choice questions for assessment, analysis of student’s performance and other benefits. The state government is also mulling introduction of CBSE and ICSE-like syllabus and assessment for students in primary and secondary education to mitigate challenges like assessing students without exams in extraordinary situations like this academic year. The state government has cancelled exams for second-year pre university students and they will be graded on their performance in the previous year. However, the state government has decided to conduct at least two papers for class 10 in the third week of July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-govt-unveils-195-cr-digi-learning-initiative-101624478143531.html
24-06-2021||India||Kerala on alert as Delta Plus variant detected in 3 villages||Thiruvananthapuram: Three villages in Kerala have been shut, at least for a week, after a genome sequencing study found presence of highly infectious Delta plus variant in some of the Coivd-19 patients, state health officials said. Experts have warned that the new variant is highly infectious, with strong binding to receptors of lung cells, and affects monoclonal antibodies fast. On Tuesday, one case was reported from Pathanamthitta and two in Palakkad district. “In Pathanamthitta, it was found in a four-year-old boy in Kadapra village, and he has tested negative now. We have cordoned off the area and all residents are undergoing RT-PCR tests. We have examined the travel history of the family and it seems mutation might have taken place locally,” said district medical officer Dr A L Sheeja on Wednesday. She added that many patients from the area were earlier infected with Delta variant and mutation might have taken place locally. In Palakkad, the variant was detected in two women in their 50s and both of them tested negative later. Palakkad DMO KP Reetha on Wednesday said their primary contacts were tested negative and a massive testing was on in the area. District collector Mrunami Joshi said two villages -- Parali and Pariyari -- will be closed for a week and all residents will have to undergo RT-PCR tests. Experts said as of now very little is known about the virus, which has reportedly been found in nine countries, including India. Head of the national experts’ group on vaccination V K Paul on Tuesday said that affected states were sent advisory and asked to step up vigil. He said 40 cases were detected in the county till date, with Maharashtra reporting the maximum 21 cases. According to experts, the new variant is a mutant version of B.1.617.2 strain, but there is little evidence how virulent the strain is. After some preliminary studies in Maharashtra, experts found that transmission rate of the new strain is quite high, and it reduces monoclonal antibody response. The detection of the new variant has come at a time when Covid-19 cases have declined in the state, prompting the government to open up several sectors that were under lockdown for more than 40 days. On Wednesday, Kerala reported 12,787 new Covid-19 cases with a test positivity rate of 10.29%. For more than a week, the state has been reporting the highest number of cases in the country. It also reported 150 deaths, taking total fatalities to 12,445, according to the state health department bulletin. Though cases are high, the state’s fatality rate is .38% against the national average of 1.33%, the bulletin added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-on-alert-as-delta-plus-variant-detected-in-3-villages-101624476883476.html
24-06-2021||India||BJP, TMC face off over Mukul Roy’s induction in public accounts committee||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Wednesday got involved in a tussle when Mukul Roy, who left the saffron camp and returned to the ruling party on June 11, filed his nomination for induction in the public accounts committee (PAC) of the West Bengal legislative assembly. The Bengal assembly has 41 committees and among them the PAC, which works as the audit watchdog for the assembly is considered the most important one.On June 18, the BJP submitted a petition before assembly speaker Biman Banerjee, saying Roy, the legislator from Kishnanagar North constituency in Nadia district, should be disqualified under the anti-defection law as he did not resign from the BJP before switching sides. The decision to disqualify a member is taken only by the speaker. The Constitution does not specify any time frame for the process which involves inquiry and setting up of a committee. Since a leader from the opposition is conventionally made chairman of the PAC, Roy, 67, stoked speculations that he may get the post because of his seniority although the much younger former cabinet minister and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s protege-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the BJP in December last year, is the leader of the opposition in the assembly. Roy, who joined the BJP in 2017 and became the party’s national vice-president, returned to the TMC along with his son Subhranshu, a former MLA. According to rules, it is the discretion of the speaker to select the chairpersons of the various committees in the assembly. The BJP wants Ashok Lahiri, the former chief economic adviser to the Government of India who won the Balurghat seat in north Bengal, to be the PAC chairman. “Six BJP MLAs have filed their nomination for the PAC. Nominations have been filed for other committees as well. It seems elections will be held in four committees as the number of candidates exceeds the strength of these committees. Elections for these posts were never held in the past as the candidatures were amicably decided through discussion,” the speaker said. “My mission is to ensure that Roy is disqualified. He will not remain an MLA so the question of him becoming the PAC chairman does not arise. However, we will wait for the decision of the speaker,” said Adhikari. “If the speaker decides that someone from the ruling party will head the PAC there is nothing we can do although opposition leaders usually get the post,” said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh. “Adhikari does not know the rules of the assembly. It is the speaker who decides who gets these posts,” said senior TMC legislator Tapas Roy. Since the Congress and the Left parties could not win a single seat in the recent state polls, the 213 TMC MLAs and the 75 BJP MLAs can claim membership of the various committees. The BJP had bagged 77 seats but two MLAs resigned from the assembly to retain their Lok Sabha seats. By-polls will be held in seven constituencies. Mamata Banerjee, who was defeated by Adhikari in Nandigram, will contest again from Bhawanipore, her old seat in south Kolkata. The seat was vacated by minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay who will also contest again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-tmc-face-off-over-mukul-roy-s-induction-in-public-accounts-committee-101624476824011.html
24-06-2021||India||From singer to counsellor: 48-yr-old wore many hats||Sanghamitra, 48, and her son 24-year-old Soham Chatterjee had a song. She would sing it to him to mollify him when he was upset, they would sing snatches of it to each other during a hum-drum day, and they would even perform it as a duet at family gatherings. And when Sanghamitra was on her deathbed, Chatterjee sang it for her one last time.“But she couldn’t hear it, as she was unconscious. I broke down after singing the first few lines, but dad asked me to finish it,” he said.The song -- a Kishore Kumar–Sushma Shreshta duet Tera mujhse hai pehle ka nata koi ( written by Sahir Ludhianvi and featured in the 1973 film, Aa Gale Lag Jaa) -- “symbolized their relationship,” said husband Dhurjati Chatterjee (55), adding that his wife was “a great singer”.“She tested positive on May 6 after we rushed her to a hospital because of her Covid-19 symptoms. By then she had started sinking. On May 12 we got a video-call from the hospital. That’s when I sang our song out to her,” Chatterjee said.Sanghamitra died of Covid-19 related complications in a Kolkata hospital on May 13. On that day, West Bengal reported 20,839 cases, the second highest caseload till date.Born to a middle-class Bengali family in north Kolkata, Sanghamitra was the younger of the two siblings. She was the soft-spoken one and did well academically. Her older sisters recall Sanghamitra receiving an impossible score of 99 out of 100 in a Bengali exam in secondary school. Sanghamitra inherited all of her schoolteacher father’s books after he passed away earlier this year in March, older sister Sharmistha Bhattacharya said.Both parents were trained classical singers -- their father trained under legendary singer Dwijen Mukhopadhyay -- and so, Sanghamitra and her siblings were made to learn music, too.“We were trained in classical music as children. Shomu, as we used to loving call her, trained under Pandit Tarapada Chakraborty,” said Bhattacharya.But Sanghamitra was inclined to other arts as well. Trained in a Bengali-medium school, she had an excellent command over the language and would write Bengali poetry.“After our annual exams, our father used to take us to watch some of the good Bengali movies, mostly films by Satyajit Ray, in cinema halls and buy story books,” Bhattacharya said.Sanghamitra married Durjati soon after she finished high school; she was 18 then.From a softspoken girl, who was talked little, Chatterjee came into her own after marriage. She completed a post-graduate diploma in counselling and struck conversations with people across all age groups. With children, in particular, Sanghamitra had a knack of breaking the ice easily, said his son.“She was a great cook. My father’s colleagues used to steal the tiffin my mother used to make for him. My friends and our relatives dropped in quite often just to eat something cooked by her,” Chatterjee said.“She was a trained counsellor. But she never took it up professionally. Over the last few years, however, she started counselling. Her fame spread by word of mouth,” her son added.Sanghamitra had health concerns, including hypertension and diabetes, and was doubly careful during the pandemic -- she barely stepped out.“We never thought that she would get infected by Covid,” Chatterjee said.On May 12, when Chatterjee sang the song to his unconscious mother, the medicos in the room could not help but be moved.Critical care doctor Dipsikha Ghosh who made the call to Chatterjee from her phone wrote on her social media account on May 12: “The song changed us. The song would always be there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-singer-to-counsellor-48-yr-old-wore-many-hats-101624474905287.html
24-06-2021||India||PMGKAY, India’s Covid relief programme, praised by UN wing: Official||The World Food Programme (WFP), the food-assistance wing of the UN, has praised India’s Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), a Covid-relief programme that gives free food handouts to nearly 80 million beneficiaries, as a “notable step to tackle hunger by any developing nation” during the pandemic, Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey has said.The food secretary said the WFP has conveyed to the government that it would like to undertake a case study of the scheme so that other emerging economies could benefit from its design and implementation.“The WFP has praised the scheme and said they would like to use it as a case study and a model that can be shared with others nations,” the food secretary said. The global body also tweeted about PMGKAY on June 7.The official also said the programme, launched during the first Covid wave and currently in force, involved a federal spending of nearly ₹3 lakh crore, allocation of nearly 60 million tonne of foodgrains for a duration of 15 months since the pandemic broke out in 2020.Under PMGKAY, the government gives five kilos of rice or wheat and one kilo of pulses free every month through the public distribution system. It will continue till Diwali, November 4, 2021.The secretary said a study of the programme by the firm Dalberg found that 96% of the beneficiaries benefited from the scheme. The study was commissioned by the Union finance ministry.A comment from the Rome-based WPF was not immediately available and the organisation hasn’t replied to a query sent to it till the time of going to press.“The WFP is working to improve the efficiency, accountability and transparency of India’s own subsidised food distribution system, which brings supplies of wheat, rice, sugar and kerosene oil to around 800 million poor people across the country,” a page on its India operations on its website states.Food-security campaigners say the country needs to do more to ensure India’s malnutrition levels go down. India ranked 94 out of 107 nations according to the Global Hunger Index 2020, which found a serious level of hunger.The National Family Health Survey 5, released in December 2020, found that in 13 states, the percentage of stunted children aged under five has gone up slightly in comparison to 2015-16.“We would like to see universal coverage under the PDS as a solution to chronic problems malnutrition and hunger,” said Ayesha, who goes by one name, of the Right to Food Campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmgkay-india-s-covid-relief-programme-praised-by-un-wing-official-101624474844050.html
24-06-2021||India||Arrested RJD MP transferred $11 mn to VVIP chopper case accused, says ED||Amarendra Dhari Singh, the Rajya Sabha member arrested in an alleged fertiliser scam earlier this month, had transferred $11 million through two Panama-based companies to AgustaWestland scam middleman Rajiv Saxena in 2013, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has told a Delhi court.The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP had also allegedly made cash payments running into several crores to several people in 2018-2019, the agency said, adding that money laundering worth ₹40 crore has already been linked to Singh.People familiar with the probe told HT that the source of all these funds, which Singh failed to account for during questioning, is being investigated.The submissions were made by ED through special public prosecutor Nitesh Rana and counsel Zoheb Hossain in the court of special judge Vikas Dhull on Wednesday while opposing the bail of Singh, who was arrested on June 2.ED’s money laundering case is based on a corruption case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) last month against U S Awasthi, the managing director and CEO of Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited (IFFCO), and Parvinder Singh Gahlaut, CEO of Indian Potash Limited (IPL), apart from the RJD MP and Saxena. CBI alleged that IFFCO and IPL imported fertilisers and raw materials running into thousands of metric tonnes from foreign suppliers at highly inflated rates between 2007 and 2014. For this, CBI alleged, illegal commissions worth over ₹685 crore were paid through sham transactions disguised as consultancy agreements.The central agency has found that two companies owned by Singh in the Republic of Panama — Summerpark Corporation and Lake Village Assets Corp — had transferred $11 million in 2013 from their bank account at Banque Heritage, Geneva (Switzerland), to Rajiv Saxena, for the purpose of real estate investments.These transactions are reflected in an email dated November 30, 2013, sent by Lake Village, and addressed to Saxena, confirming the transfer of $1 million on April 29, 2013. Another email was sent by Summerpark on the same day to Saxena, confirming the transfer of $9,75,000 from November 16, 2012, till June 21, 2013.ED has also referred to cash payments running into crores made by Singh to several people between September and November 2018.While seeking bail, Singh’s lawyers, Siddharth Aggarwal and Madhav Khurana, sought relief on the ground that he has been suffering from lymphatic cancer since 2002 and has to travel to the United States regularly for medical check-up. They also said that he is a law-abiding citizen.But ED opposed the plea, saying that the accused is not suffering from any life-threatening disease as per his own admission and releasing him will hamper the investigation.The court dismissed Singh’s bail request, saying he is a Rajya Sabha MP as well as a member of the parliamentary standing Committee on fertilisers. “Therefore, there is a likelihood that the accused, being a powerful person, may influence certain witnesses, who are working with different entities involved in the import of fertilisers,” the judge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arrested-rjd-mp-transferred-11-mn-to-vvip-chopper-case-accused-says-ed-101624474783479.html

These terrorists are falsely labelling these innocent people as informers…,” the IGP said.On Tuesday, a police officer was killed in a suspected terrorist attack on the outskirts of Srinagar.Officials said that Inspector Pervaiz Ahmad, who worked with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) wing of J&K police, was fired upon critically at Nowgam near his home.He was rushed to Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) hospital in the old city where doctors declared him ‘dead on arrival’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25yrold-gunned-down-by-terrorists-in-srinagar-101624474664781.html
24-06-2021||India||LAC deployment a defensive arrangement, says Beijing||The Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday said the country has deployed troops at the border to prevent India from encroaching its territory, while blaming New Delhi’s “aggressive policies” for the ongoing tension along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).“The overall Sino-India bilateral ties should not be linked to the boundary dispute either,” the Chinese ministry said, reiterating its opinion that the disagreements on the border should be kept at its right place in the range of aspects in the relationship.The Chinese foreign ministry was reacting to a question on Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s comments on Tuesday where he said that the Chinese military deployment at the border and uncertainty if Beijing will fulfil its promise on troop reduction remain challenges in bilateral ties.New Delhi has also repeatedly said that complete disengagement at all friction points on the LAC and peace and tranquillity in the border areas alone can lead to normalisation of ties in other spheres, such as trade and investment – especially in context of Beijing’s repeated statements that the border question should be kept in its right place.In an interview with Bloomberg at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday, Jaishankar said that the “issue there is whether China would live up to the commitments it has made -- written commitments it has made -- about both countries not allowing a large armed force at the border.”China’s “close-up deployment still continues, especially in Ladakh,” Jaishankar said.Beijing, however, stuck to its narrative of blaming New Delhi.“The military deployment by China in the western sector along the border is a normal defensive arrangement. It is meant to prevent the encroachment or threat against China’s territory by relevant country,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at the regular ministry briefing on Wednesday.“For quite some time the Indian side has been increasing its military along the border and encroaching upon the Chinese territory. This is the root cause of the tense situation along the borders,” Zhao added.“We advocate that we should address the boundary issue through peaceful negotiations, and we don’t think that the border issue should be linked up to our bilateral ties,” the spokesperson added.India had earlier said that PLA troops had transgressed across the LAC, triggering the friction in eastern Ladakh.New Delhi has told Beijing that given the seriousness of the Galwan Valley incident, it cannot be business as usual - and the border dispute cannot be swept under the carpet -- until full disengagement is completed at friction points.Jaishankar has also spelt out the Indian government’s position on the disengagement process, saying the LAC “must be strictly respected and observed as this is the basis for peace and tranquility in the border areas”.More than a year after the ongoing tension began, disengagement of troops is yet to be completed despite 11 rounds of military and seven rounds of diplomatic talks – under the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs – having taken place.China’s People’s Liberation Army has continued deployment of troops and military equipment along the LAC and has even inducted the army’s air defence units in its air force command chain in Western Theatre Command, establishing joint air defence system along the border for the first time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lac-deployment-a-defensive-arrangement-says-beijing-101624474664077.html
24-06-2021||India||Molesters throw UP girl off building, 2 held||Two of the three men, who allegedly threw a 17-year-old girl off the second floor of a house in the Chaatha area of Mathura district on Monday night, were arrested on Wednesday, the police said. The search is on for the third , police added.“A case has been registered under various sections of Indian Penal Code, including that for molestation and attempt to murder. The age of the girl was not revealed at the time of the complaint but later, she we found out she is a minor,so, the relevant provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act are to be added,” said Shirish Chandra, Mathura’s superintendent of police (Rural). All three accused were in their early twenties, said Chandra.The three men , according to the family of the girl, had stalked and harassed her in the past too. It is believed that frustrated at their attempt being scotched in the past, they decided to attack her.The family alleged police inaction adding that they went to the local police station on Monday night itself but were told to come the following day. Chandra said that the girl’s family gave a written complaint at the local police station on Tuesday morning after which the FIR was lodged.The father of girl alleged that the three men, including two from Bihar, lived in same locality and had molested the girl in the past. The three men had been harassing his sister for about a year, the girl’s brother was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. However, the family did not register a complaint about these,Chandra said.According to the brother, a little after 8 pm, the “three men arrived on a motorcycle and barged into our house. They assaulted my family members, including mother and sister. Two of them forcibly took my sister to the second floor and threw her from the balcony, breaking her spinal cord,” he alleged.The police have CCTV footage from the neighbourhood which purportedly shows the girl falling flat on the street outside the house.“The victim is under treatment in Kosi town. The exact injuries are yet to be confirmed as the girl has been sent for an MRI to Mathura by doctors,” Chandra added.“She is admitted to a private hospital and has got severe injuries in her spinal cord and other parts of the body. She is in a critical condition,” the girl’s father told reporters.Meanwhile, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked the state’s Bharatiya Janata Party government over crimes against women.“In Mathura, goons who had been harassing a girl for a year entered her house and threw her from the terrace. A girl, troubled over being teased, ended her own life in Hamirpur,” she said in a tweet in Hindi. “In jungle raj, the safety of women is in God’s hands.”“I am not aware of the exact details but all I can say is that whatsoever the case is, in this government, the guilty will not be able to use influence to escape the law....,” said UP BJP spokesperson, Harish Srivastava.(with PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/molesters-throw-up-girl-off-building-2-held-101624474663404.html
24-06-2021||India||Assam NGO files FIR against former NRC coordinator Prateek Hajela||A Guwahati-based NGO has lodged a police complaint against former coordinator of National Register of Citizens (NRC) Prateek Hajela, alleging manipulation of family tree verification to include names of illegal migrants in the list, which was to include names of genuine Indian citizens.“We suspect there was manipulation in family tree verification during the process that led to inclusion of many illegal and doubtful persons in the updated NRC,” said Abhijeet Sharma of Assam Public Works (APW), whose petition in the Supreme Court in 2009, had set the ball rolling for updating the NRC for Assam.“We suspect Hajela and his close associates in collaboration with some officers, data entry operators and leaders from minority community used government mechanism to insert names of illegal migrants in the list,” Sharma added.APW has filed the first information report (FIR) against Hajela and his unnamed associates with Assam criminal investigation department (CID) on Monday.This is the 10th FIR lodged by APW alleging irregularities in the updated NRC and seeking re-verification of the entire process. The NGO plans to file 12 more such complaints in future.The updated NRC, which was made public in August 2019, had left out 1.9 million of the nearly 33 million applicants. The list was dubbed by almost all parties and organisations as faulty citing exclusion of genuine citizens and inclusion of persons with doubtful identity.The NRC was first prepared only for Assam in 1951 on the basis of the census conducted the same year. The process to update the 1951 list started in 2015 following directions from the Supreme Court, which acted on petitions seeking detection of illegal immigrants, especially from Bangladesh.The updated list was to include names of all those persons (or their descendants) who appear in the 1951 NRC, or in any of the electoral rolls up to the midnight of March 24, 1971—when the liberation war for Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan began.The verification of an applicant’s family tree with help of records provided to show his/her link to an ancestor included in the 1951 NRC or in subsequent voter rolls was a key part of the process to update the list.“The verification of a family tree would have been the fool proof method of NRC verification, had it been done properly. But as there was no quality check, the officers with migrant backgrounds got a free hand to include names of the suspected foreigners at their will. The entire mischief was done by the then state coordinator in connivance with some antinational element,” the FIR stated.In November 2019, three months after the NRC was published, Prateek Hajela, an IAS officer, was transferred to Madhya Pradesh following a SC order. The NRC process is still in limbo as the updated list is yet to be notified by the Registrar General of India and the process of filing of appeals by those left out of the list hasn’t started.In May this year, Hajela’s successor Hitesh Dev Sarma filed an application in the apex court seeking a complete, comprehensive and time-bound re-verification of the updated draft as well as the supplementary list of NRC as some “glaring anomalies of serious nature” were detected in the process.The application sought re-verification to be done under supervision of a monitoring committee preferably represented by district judge, district magistrate and superintendent of police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-ngo-files-fir-against-former-nrc-coordinator-prateek-hajela-over-anomalies-101624474484905.html
24-06-2021||India||Banks given ₹9k-cr of seized assets, says ED||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has handed over ₹9,041.5 crore worth of assets, mostly in shares, to Indian banks that lost over ₹22,585.83 crore to bank fraud by three fugitive businessmen, Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, the agency said in a statement on Wednesday, underlining that this implied the public sector banks have already recouped 40% of their losses in cases involving the three.ED has already seized assets worth Rs. 18,170.02 crore, 80.45% of the total loss to banks in cases involving the three businessmen, and transferred a part of the attached or seized assets to the banks and the government, the statement said. This includes their properties worth ₹969 crore in foreign countries including the UK, the US, France and the UAE. India is also pursuing their extradition.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman responded to the ED announcement on Twitter. “Fugitives & economic offenders will be actively pursued; their properties attached & dues recovered,” she said.Wednesday’s statement came after the Debt Recovery Tribunal, on behalf of the State Bank of India-led consortium, sold Vijay Mallya’s stake in United Breweries Limited for ₹5,824.50 crore.Vijay Mallya left India in March 2016 after a clutch of banks got together to initiate proceedings to recover more than ₹9,000 crore from him, accusing him of wilful default. The UK high court last year ordered Mallya’s extradition and his request for permission to file an appeal in the UK Supreme Court has been turned down. But he is learnt to have applied for asylum there.Diamantaire Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi face fraud charges in India in connection with their involvement in fraudulent transactions that led to losses of about ₹13,578 crore in the state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB). They left the country in January 2018, weeks before the Central Investigation Bureau received a complaint from the bank about the fraud. Nirav Modi is fighting India’s attempt to seek his extradition from the United Kingdom, while Mehul Choksi is fiercely opposing an attempt to get him deported from Dominica, an island nation in the Caribbean, where he has been arrested for illegal entry.Nirav Modi has been in a jail on the outskirts of London since March 2019; his repeated requests for bail have been rejected. In February this year, a UK magistrate’s court ordered Nirav Modi’s extradition. On Wednesday, he lost the first stage of his extradition appeal in the high court.ED said that it unearthed the money trail by exposing a web of what it described as domestic and international transactions and stashing of assets abroad . The investigation revealed that the three used dummy entities controlled by them for rotation and siphoning off the funds provided by the banks, it said.Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal said ED has attached assets much more than the money that was allegedly due to the banks. “In this case, banks will recover more than 100% of the principal as well as interest”.“However, for the people who have been declared fugitive, I have my doubts as to how will banks get the money as in fugitive economic offenders (FEO) act, there is no provision to give money to the victims and it is confiscated by the central government.”Mallya’s lawyers could not be contacted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/banks-given-9k-cr-of-seized-assets-says-ed-101624474064534.html

24-06-2021||India||Deadline set for CM Amarinder to act on poll promises: Rawat||The Congress has asked Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to act within a deadline on some of his poll promises, particularly the resolution of emotionally sensitive issues such as the 2015 desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in Bargari and the drug menace in the state.This was revealed on Wednesday by All India Congress Committee general secretary and in-charge of Punjab affairs, Harish Rawat, at a media briefing held after his meeting with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi. The Wayanad MP earlier met Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa and state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal.Rawat said that the three-member AICC committee set up to resolve differences among the Punjab Congress leaders has given the CM a fixed timeframe to act on his 18 poll promises. The committee, comprising Rajya Sabha MP Mallikarjun Kharge, former Delhi MP Jai Prakash Agarwal and Rawat, discussed all these issues with the CM on Tuesday. The meeting was their second in less than three weeks.“Bargari is an emotional issue in Punjab. We respect the emotions of the people. The CM has been told to take action in accordance with the public sentiment within the legal parameters. On drugs, strong action has been taken. Action in pending cases will be taken soon,” said Rawat who is the former chief minister of Uttarakhand.He added that the CM has also promised to act on his other promises such as free power of up to 200 units, scholarships for Scheduled Caste students, loan waiver for poor people and the securing of their land rights, and action against sand and transport mafias.“The chief minister has agreed to act. He will hold a press conference soon and give details on all these issues,” said Rawat.Several of these issues were raised by Navjot Singh Sidhu and other dissenting ministers and MLAs who have been critical of the chief minister in recent weeks.Asked about Sidhu’s statements against the CM, Rawat said the committee has taken note of them too. “I have called for his statements. I will give him advice wherever needed. In case there is need for a direction, I will do the needful,” Rawat said, going soft on the former minister.Some party leaders, including two MPs, drew the attention of Gandhi and Kharge to Sidhu’s statements on Tuesday. But Rawat said that Congress president Sonia Gandhi will take a decision on this by the first week of July and everyone, including Sidhu, have agreed to abide by it.On the controversy over the government appointments given to the sons of two Congress MLAs Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey on compassionate grounds, Rawat said he has been told that the duo had agreed to thank the government and not to take these jobs. “Bajwa has agreed. I am to check with Pandey,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deadline-set-for-cm-amarinder-to-act-on-poll-promises-rawat-101624474004045.html
24-06-2021||India||6.4 million doses given as Covid-19 vaccination drive picks up pace||Nearly 6.4 million doses of vaccines were administered against Covid-19 across the country till 11pm on Wednesday, as per the health ministry’s Co-WIN dashboard – making it the day with the second highest daily inoculation figures since the start of the drive.A total of 6,395,250 doses were administered on Wednesday, according to the Co-WIN dashboard as at 11pm. In a major milestone for India’s inoculation drive, the total number of vaccine shots administered across the country crossed the 300 million mark (300,969,538), according to government data.India’s latest round of vaccinations started on Monday with a record 8.5 million doses administered, but the numbers had seen a slight drop on Tuesday when there were around 5.4 million daily jabs with numbers fluctuating heavily across states.The central government on Wednesday said it has now removed all bars on age-wise use of vaccines for states. “With effect from June 21, both the state government and Government of India supplies, irrespective of the type of supply, are to be used for population above 18 years as all categories of priority groups are now unified and are to be provided vaccination free of cost at the state-designated government Covid vaccination centre,” the health ministry said in a statement.Around 52 million people have been completely vaccinated across the country (having received both shots), while another 193 million people have been partially vaccinated, according to government data.Officials in the Union health ministry said keeping in mind vaccine the supplies in hand, they expect daily numbers to remain around the 5 million mark for the rest of June. “With the vaccine supplies at hand, and the way states are performing the drive, it looks like the number will remain steady at more-or-less 5 million doses a day. But in July, we expect the numbers to go further up,” said a senior health ministry official, requesting anonymity.Government experts overlooking the country’s Covid-19 vaccination rollout said they expect the country to be prepared to administer around 10 million jabs on a single day by August, and added that vaccine availability will not be an issue in coming weeks with about 200–220 million doses likely to be available in July.“Our aim is to vaccinate at least one crore people every day. Our capacity is such that we will easily be able to administer 1.25 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine every day,” said Dr NK Arora, chairperson, national technical advisory group on immunisation in India (NTAGI).India’s vaccine drive began on January 16, for health care workers, expanded to include all front-line workers on February 2, and then, everyone over the age of 60 years and people over the age of 45 with co-morbidities, on March 1. On April 1, it was further expanded to include everyone over the age of 45. Then, in response to demand from states and people, the drive was opened up further, to everyone over the age of 18 years, although states were told they would have to pay for the vaccines of those between the ages of 18 and 45.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/64-million-doses-given-as-drive-picks-up-pace-101624473943410.html
24-06-2021||India||U’khand fake testing: Firms get temporary relief||The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday granted temporary protection from arbitrary arrest to the owners of two private firms under investigation for allegedly conducting 100,000 fake tests during the Mahakumbh but dismissed their petitions to quash an FIR against them in the high-profile case.The court directed representatives from Max Corporate Services, a Noida-based private agency that bagged the contract to carry out Covid tests during the holy event, to appear before an investigating officer on Friday and cooperate in the ongoing probe into alleged fake Covid testing during the Mahakumbh.Justice NS Dhanik, who heard both petitions, also granted temporary protection from arbitrary arrest to Max Corporate Services and Hisar-based Nalwa Labs.“In view of the judgment rendered by hon’ble apex court in Arnesh Kumar vs. State of Bihar ...the petitioner should be arrested only when the investigating officer has reason to believe on the basis of information and material collected, that he has committed an offence,” said the order.The 2014 Arnesh Kumar judgment required the police to conduct a preliminary probe before making arrests where offences were punishable with imprisonment for less than seven years. Under these guidelines, a police officer has to record reasons for an arrest in writing and it can be done only if it fulfils certain conditions.Allegations of fake testing surfaced at the Kumbh last week after a Faridkot resident complained to the authorities that he received a message for collecting his Covid-19 report despite never having been tested. The complaint triggered a probe that unearthed roughly 100,000 fake rapid antigen tests.Three firms – Lalchandani Lab, Nalwa Lab and Noida-based private agency Max Corporate Services – were booked under sections of the Indian Penal Code, disaster management act and epidemic diseases act last week. Days later, all three firms approached the high court separately to quash the FIR.At present, three separate probes are looking at the allegations: one by the police, one by the district administration and one by the mela administration.In court, both Max Corporate Services and Nalwa Labs said they were ready to cooperate with the probe. Kartikeya Hari Gupta, who represented Max Corporate service partner Mallika Pant, informed the court that she was ready and willing to join the investigation, comply with the court’s order and appear before the investigating officer on Friday.“We are humbled and grateful to the court to uphold our client’s right to appear freely before the SIT inquiry and co-operate. We have written to the Investigation Officer and shall be sharing all documents with the investigating team. My clients are victims of another’s wrong and justice shall prevail,” said Apoorva Agarwal, legal representative for Max.Parikshit Saini, counsel for Nalwa labs and its owner Navtej Nalwa, said they were ready to cooperate with the probe and had already appeared before the investigators in person.A third petition, by Delhi-based Lalchandani Labs, is likely to be heard on Thursday.On June 18, Max Corporate Services filed a writ petition, demanding quashing of FIR against it and stay on arrest. The agency said that it was a service provider and didn’t have the expertise or clearance to carry out tests, which was done by the two labs.In its petition, Nalwa labs claimed that it signed a memorandum of understanding with Max on March 10 but neither received any payments nor sent any technicians to conduct tests at the Kumbh. Max rejected the allegations.Lalchandani Labs told the high court that it signed a MoU with Max on March 10 and conducted only 12,000 rapid tests between April 1 and 26.The Kumbh mela was curtailed this year but devotees thronged Haridwar for months despite experts saying the crowds and rampant violation of Covid protocol could spark a surge in infections. Roughly 9.1 million pilgrims took the holy dip in the Ganga from January 14 to April 27. The bulk of this -- at least six million people -- congregated in April, coinciding with the worst surge in the second wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ukhand-fake-testing-firms-get-temporary-relief-told-to-appear-before-probe-officer-101624473883349.html
24-06-2021||India||3 top fashion designers asked to appear before E.D. in PMLA case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned three top fashion designers, Manish Malhotra, Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Ritu Kumar , in connection with a money laundering probe against Punjab Congress legislator Sukhpal Singh Khaira, people familiar with the development said on Wednesday.ED believes that Khaira made certain cash payments, around ₹15-16 lakh in total, to the three designers on different occasions in 2018-19 and wants to seek clarifications in this context, said an agency officer.Khaira is already under investigation in two cases registered by the federal agency earlier this year to probe money laundering charges linked to a trans-border drugs smuggling network unearthed in Fazilka, Punjab in 2015, and a fake passport racket in Delhi.The agency carried out searches at the residence of Khaira and his son-in-law Inderveer Singh Johal in March and the two have subsequently been questioned a few times. Khaira was last questioned by ED on Wednesday.The designers have been told to appear at the agency’s headquarters in central Delhi’s Khan Market over the next two days. Two of them are already in touch with ED officials, said an agency official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.HT reached out to the three designers but there was no comment till filing of this report.The politician or his legal team could not be contacted for comments. But in the past, Khaira denied any wrongdoing and alleged that he was being targeted as he opposed Centre’s three new farm laws.Khaira, who was earlier in the Congress, was elected MLA from Kapurthala’s Bholath seat in 2017 on an Aam Aadmi Party ticket and appointed leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly. He was removed from the post in July 2018 and later formed the Punjab Ekta Party (PEP). He rejoined the Congress earlier this month.The Fazilka drugs case relates to the seizure of 1,800 grams of heroin, 24 gold biscuits, two weapons, 26 live cartridges and two Pakistani SIM cards by Jalalabad police (Punjab) in 2015. But it was only in 2017 that Khaira’s name cropped up during the investigations.Although not named in the Punjab police charge-sheet, a Fazilka court summoned Khaira, then an AAP MLA, on November 30, 2017. However, the Supreme Court quashed the proceedings against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-top-fashion-designers-asked-to-appear-before-e-d-in-pmla-case-101624473833612.html
24-06-2021||India||Kishor again meets Pawar amid talks of a new front||Prashant Kishor was back at Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) founder Sharad Pawar’s residence in Delhi on Wednesday, the third time since June 12 (and the second in the past three days), adding to the speculation that the senior opposition leader and the election strategist are working on a possible anti-BJP front.HT spoke to leaders in both the NCP and the Trinamool Congress Party (TMC) who confirm that the talks, which are still nascent, are happening with an eye on the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. However, both parties steered clear of saying so on record.``Prashant Kishor did an excellent job for TMC in Bengal. While we don’t know what his meetings with Mr Pawar are about, we have taken note of them,’’ said TMC’s key strategist and Lok Sabha MP Saugata Ro. ``Mr Sharad Pawar is very fond of Mamata Banerjee,’’ he added.The NCP’s Supriya Sule, Pawar’s daughter, played down Kishor’s visit. ``Prashant Kishor is a personal friend. He knows my husband and he knows me also for a long time and so he came to see me today (Wednesday). He didn’t meet Pawar Sahab today at all.’’Soon after the meeting, Pawar and Sule left for Mumbai.Kishor did not comment on the meeting. On Monday, he said he was not taking on the NCP as a client and has retired from the business of helping parties win elections.But his visits to the Pawar household are significant because they bookended a meeting of prominent civil society leaders and members of opposition parties there on Tuesday, where they discussed the fuel price rise, unemployment, and the need for creating an “alternative vision” for India. The meeting was not attended by anyone from the Congress and leaders who were present there said there was no discussion about the formation of a front to take on the BJP.The TMC is of the opinion that after defeating the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) by a huge margin Banerjee was ready for a larger national role and to even be the opposition’s consensus candidate.However, since the TMC’s win in West Bengal, there’s been talk of a joint front, with Mamata Banerjee playing a significant role, to take on the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kishor-again-meets-pawar-amid-talks-of-a-new-front-101624473765061.html
24-06-2021||India||Centre should return what was snatched from us: Hasnain Masoodi||There is a realisation in Delhi that things haven’t gone the way they wanted, People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration coordinator and National Conference parliamentarian Hasnain Masoodi told Mir Ehsan a day ahead of the Centre’s meeting with leaders from Jammu & Kashmir.Edited excerpts:Has the National Conference changed its stance on the situation vis-à-vis Jammu & Kashmir?Not at all. Our stand is clear -- we want restoration of the pre-August 5 situation. The situation should have never reached here. Now if they (Centre) have done it, they should give us what has been snatched from us.Why do you think this meeting has been organised?They (Centre) have not achieved what they had desired by revoking Article 370 and 35A. Now they have invited all those leaders for talks who were jailed, or against whom they said many bad things. Even the “political saplings” they planted failed to deliver, and in the interest of the country and J&K, they have realised they should again talk to people whom people trust.Did the participation of the PAGD in the District Development Council polls played any role in calling for an all-party meeting.Yes, it was the game-changer. The people voted for the alliance despite the leadership not getting a chance to campaign. After winning maximum seats, Delhi has realised the importance of the parties which are part of the alliance. They (Centre) should have initiated dialogue process earlier, but still its good if they have realised this after two years.There aren’t any conditions from either side for these talks, how do you take it as the alliance partner?During the meeting with the PM, the alliance will get a chance to explain what have been taken from us, and our leaders will try to convince the PM that things should be given to us that were taken from us without keeping in consideration the framework of the constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-should-return-what-was-snatched-from-us-hasnain-masoodi-pagdcoordinator-101624473763402.html
24-06-2021||India||J&K leaders set to meet PM today, Valley remains sceptic||Mainstream leaders from Jammu and Kashmir arrived in Delhi for a key all-party meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, the first such outreach since the controversial scrapping of the region’s special status and its bifurcation two years ago.The meeting drew lukewarm reactions in the Muslim-majority Valley where limited trust in mainstream parties and hostility over the revocation of Article 370, which granted Jammu and Kashmir special status, persisted among residents.The meeting, to be attended by 14 political leaders, doesn’t have any fixed agenda but Kashmir leaders have indicated that they will press for restoration of Article 370 and full statehood.“We will put our point of view in the meeting tomorrow. The biggest thing what has been taken away from us should be given back to us,” said Mohammed Yousuf Tarigami, Communist Party of India leader and spokesperson for the five-party alliance, People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD)In a meeting on Tuesday, PAGD decided to attend the meeting to be held at the PM’s residence at 3pm. All participants have been asked to submit negative Covid reports.Peoples Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti arrived in Delhi on Wednesday afternoon and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah will fly to the Capital on Thursday morning.”Farooq Abdullah will travel to Delhi on Thursday for the meeting. Omar Abdullah is already in national capital and he is also scheduled to attend the meeting,” said NC spokesman Imran Nabi.Tarigami, Peoples Conference chairman Sajjad Lone, Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari. former deputy chief minister Muzuffar Beig, Congress J&K president Ghulam Ahmad Mir and former J&K deputy chief minister Tarachand also reached Delhi on Wednesday. “We (Congress leaders) will ask for agenda for this important meeting and then put our point of view before the PM,” said J&K Congress president, Ghulam Ahmad Mir.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state chief and former deputy chief minister Nirmal Singh also arrived in Delhi.The meeting signals the restarting of political engagement between mainstream Kashmiri parties and the Centre, which in August 2019 voided Articles 370 and 35A that bestowed special status to Jammu and Kashmir and privileges to its residents, and split the state into two Union territories. All mainstream political leaders were detained, internet and phone connections were snapped and curfew-like restrictions were imposed in the Valley for months.When the leaders were released in 2020, they came together as PAGD and adopted a resolution to demand the region’s full statehood and special status. Current PAGD members include the NC, PDP, CPI-M, J&K Awami National Conference, and the J&K People’s Movement.Politicians in the Valley remain bitterly opposed to J&K’s bifurcation and revocation of Article 370. In the past, PAGD members have clashed with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which backed the scrapping of special status.Despite the frenetic political activity in Delhi, the mood in Srinagar was subdued with little expectation. “Common Kashmiris have very little expectation from the meeting. Many are not even interested,” said Abdul Gani, a retired government employee of Srinagar.He believed that the calling of a meeting by the PM was a ‘routine political exercise’ to break the monotony after the decisions of August 2019.“It is a reconciliatory measure to move forward the political process so that elections are held. The decisions over special status are cast in stone. We don’t expect any change in that,” he said.Waseem Ahmad, a resident of south Kashmir’s Pulwama, said that he does not expect much to change.“After the changes to special status, the people at Centre tried to raise a political alternative in J&K and failed. Now they have realised that they cannot do away with NC and PDP which are cadre based parties,” he said.“The demands of the PAGD seeking return of Article 370 will now be just political rhetoric with no sincerity,” said Bilal Ahmad, a teacher of north Kashmir’s Baramulla.Political analyst Professor Noor Ahmad Baba said that Kashmiris doubt the intentions of the central government and mainstream Valley politicians. “The experiences of people in Kashmir prompt them to doubt the centre as well as local political leaders,” he said.J&K BJP spokesman Altaf Thakur said “The BJP delegation comprises of state president Ravinder Raina, Kavinder Gupta and Nirmal Singh.”They will speak about delimitation and elections in the UT.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-leaders-set-to-meet-pm-today-valley-remains-sceptic-101624473643404.html
24-06-2021||India||Check jab status of frontline workers before giving salaries: Assam govt||The Assam government on Wednesday directed all department heads to ascertain the vaccination status of frontline government employees before releasing their monthly salaries.The order was issued by chief secretary Jishnu Barua, in his capacity as chairperson of State Disaster Management Authority, Assam (ASDMA) after it was observed that several frontline government employees in the state were yet to get their Covid vaccination doses.“Non-vaccination of such frontline government servants may give rise to the possibility of further spread of the virus, which in turn may endanger the lives of common citizens especially the vulnerable groups like children, pregnant women etc,” the order said.“Direct all department heads to ascertain the vaccination status of such government servants before releasing the monthly salary/remuneration from current month onwards,” it added.There is no precise data on how many frontline government employees in the state were yet to get the Covid vaccine doses. Some officials, however, indicated that the figure runs into several thousands.Assam directed all government employees who got both doses of the Covid vaccine to join office on June 14. Chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma indicated last week that plans were afoot to open all government offices from July 1, and directed all employees to take vaccine doses.“During evaluation, it was found that thousands of frontline government employees who were registered in the Co-Win portal are yet to get their doses. Since these employees are in touch with the public, we don’t want them to get infected and spread the Covid19 virus,” said Dhiraj Saud, state project coordinator, ASDMA.“The order is not meant for all government employees but only for employees of departments like police, health, disaster management, revenue, transport, district administrations etc. where there is contact with the public,” he added.Assam is witnessing large turnouts in the vaccination centres across the state, but there are still some who haven’t taken doses for fear of side-effects and due to their medical conditions. According to officials, nearly 30,000 anganwadi workers and around 1% of the state’s police force are yet to get vaccinated. The state government has launched an awareness drive urging everyone to get their doses without apprehension.The government’s directive was, however, termed improper by some experts.“Whether to take vaccine or not is a matter of choice of any individual and can’t be forced upon by the government. Employees could have medical conditions that prevent them from getting vaccinated and some could be posted in remote areas where vaccination drives are not taking place,” said neurosurgeon Dr Navanil Barua.Assam started an “enhanced immunisation drive” on June 21 with the aim of administering Covid vaccines to at least 300,000 people daily for a month. Till Wednesday, over 6.3 million doses (5.2 million first dose and 1.1 million second dose) were administered across the state.On Wednesday, the state recorded 2,728 new Covid19 cases. Assam has recorded nearly 490,000 Covid19 scases and 4,310 deaths since the start of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/check-jab-status-of-frontline-workers-before-giving-salaries-assam-govt-to-dept-heads-101624473585215.html
24-06-2021||India||Digital connectivity between India, EU 'fairly fertile area' to be explored, says EAM S Jaishankar||Underlining the importance of digitisation in the post-Covid world, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Wednesday discussed said that connectivity in general and digital connectivity between India and the EU is a "fairly fertile area to be explored"."Going forward, the areas that the two partners (India and the EU) would be looking at would be technology and artificial intelligence. Data security, cyber security and privacy, EU and their conversations with big tech were all issues of interest to India. Connectivity in general and digital connectivity, in particular, is a "fairly fertile area to be explored" between India and the EU," he said."Connectivity, data, technology even the climate challenge -- all of this is going to require us to work together more closely. We have crossed a threshold, we have seen more momentum more energy in the relationship," he added.His remarks came while he was participating in a discussion on 'The future of India-EU relations' at a virtual event organised by Observer Research Foundation (ORF)."We have just launched our connectivity partnership. Digital connectivity, energy connectivity, and human connectivity. On the physical connectivity the views of India broadly tally with the views of India," said Jaishankar.Regarding human connectivity, Jaishankar said, "Knowledge economy will require flow of talent, more seamless we make that, we are helping ease of business, helping growth of creativity in respective societies.""We have migration and mobility partnership with different countries. Done some agreements with EU countries like France, we are looking at number of other countries, Portugal is one of them," said Jaishankar, adding, "Digital connectivity - is very much on our minds, we are looking at digital investment forum. We are looking at taskforce on AI."He laid stress on the buzzword connectivity, with several initiatives in the pipeline. He also discussed about the major pillars of India-EU connectivity, importance of digitisation post Covid-19 pandemic, leveraging digital connectivity, building data proposition networks - different than in the US, China and more attractive to Asians and Africans.Portugese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva, who was also present in the event virtually, said India was one of EU's key partners in Asia, not China, which he described as a "selective partner," "competitor" and "systemic rival"."The way we see institutions, the way we see political fundamentals, the way we see human rights, the way we see the role of civil society is very different when you see from the point of view of Brussels or when you speak from the view of Beijing," Silva said."That is why in these crucial areas our partner in Asia is not China, our partner in Asia is India," he said.According to Silva, the European Union was paying less attention to India than it should have. The US, the UK and several European countries had prepared their national strategies for the Indo-Pacific region."We needed to focus on this issue at the European level. This (a EU level strategy for the Indo-Pacific) was the purpose of the (India-EU) Leaders' meeting that was held in virtual format in Porto last month. The main results of the India-EU summit were political -- the resumption of a high level dialogue between the two largest democracies, India and the EU, the improvement of sectoral partnerships that are very, very important, the connectivity partnership and the resumption of the free trade talks," he said.On the question of waiver of patents related to vaccines, Silva said that the EU was of the view that innovation and research and development needed to be preserved given that there were predictions of future waves of the Covid-19 pandemic.The EU had given one billion euros for scaling up vaccine production in Africa and a similar amount was being contemplated for Latin America, he said.Jaishankar stressed that to scale up vaccine production to meet the challenges for inoculating the world, Europe needed to keep open supply chains as well as consider a waiver of patents as proposed by India and South Africa at the WTO.The minister said that without "dramatically" scaling up production, the world would not be able to deal with the challenges of today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digital-connectivity-between-india-eu-fairly-fertile-area-to-be-explored-says-eam-s-jaishankar-101624472997600.html
24-06-2021||India||Nurse from Chennai is Tamil Nadu's first Delta plus variant Covid-19 case||Tamil Nadu on Wednesday reported its first case of Delta Plus variant of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), taking the total cases of the mutated virus to 40 in the country. A nurse from a city hospital has reportedly been infected by the virus, health secretary J Radhakrishnan said.The state health department had sent a total of 1,159 samples for genome sequencing, out of which reports of 772 samples were received on Wednesday, in which one sample came back positive. The samples were sent in May to INSACOG (Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia). The nurse has also recovered from the virus, officials said. "Of the 772 samples, one has been reported as Delta Plus variant from Chennai. It pertained to a 32-year-old lady employed as a staff nurse at a hospital," Radhakrishnan told PTI.The official has confirmed that there is no need for alarm and panic so long as the citizens follow Covid-19 safety protocols. "We have seen the British variant and double mutant variant. There is no need to panic as of now," Radhakrishnan said. The IAS officer tasked with Covid-19 pandemic handling in the state said there is a need to adhere to Covid-19 prevention measures like wearing face mask, avoiding crowds and getting vaccinated.The Delta Plus variant's properties, which are being investigated, is characterised by a mutation in the spike protein, which helps the virus gain entry into human cells.A total of four states have confirmed the presence of the Delta Plus variant. These include Kerala, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. On Tuesday, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had said the Delta variant is found in 80 countries around the world, including India, and it is a variant of concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nurse-from-chennai-is-tamil-nadu-s-first-delta-plus-variant-covid-19-case-101624471846408.html
24-06-2021||India||Delhi rejects Centre’s ‘rejection’ of ration plan, says grounds frivolous||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said the Union government has rejected the Delhi government’s ambitious doorstep delivery of ration scheme even though no proposal was sent for the Centre’s approval in the first place, and described some of the reasons given in the letter as “frivolous”.The two sides have been locked in a standoff over the scheme since March, and the matter has come to a head in recent weeks with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal raising objections against the plan, and Delhi chief minister sending back the file to the L-G with clarifications and counter-objections.“Yesterday (Tuesday), Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent a letter to the Delhi government through the Union food and consumer affairs ministry saying that our doorstep delivery of ration scheme has been rejected. The excuses given for rejecting the scheme are so frivolous and funny that it reflects how the PM wants to pick up a fight with someone or the other,” Sisodia on Wednesday said in a digital press briefing.“They are saying that this scheme has been rejected, but we never sent it to them for approval. So, how can they reject it?” he added.Later, Kejriwal tweeted some of the reasons cited by the central government in its letter. “The Centre’s letter has come. It is very disappointing. They gave such reasons to reject our ration scheme: what if the van carrying the ration for delivery gets stuck in traffic or breaks down on its way; how will the ration be delivered if a beneficiary lives on the third floor; how will the delivery van go in narrow lanes - India of the 21st century has reached the moon, and you’re stuck on the third floor,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.“It is not right to fight with everyone every time - Twitter, Lakshadweep, Mamata didi, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Delhi government, farmers, traders, and even with the chief secretary of West Bengal. How will the country progress if you keep fighting so much and keep doing politics all the time? The doorstep delivery of ration scheme is in national interest. Do not fight over this,” he added in a second tweet.In its letter to the commissioner of Delhi’s food and supplies department, the Union ministry wrote that the proposal doesn’t meet the statutory and functional requirement of the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and therefore, “can’t be accepted”.Flagging “concerns and shortcomings” regarding the scheme, the ministry said that the Delhi government has not mentioned the prices of ration under home delivery. It asked whether people who opt for home delivery can later revert to taking ration from the fair price shops. It also raised concerns about how the Delhi government will ensure continued home delivery of ration if the beneficiary changes their address and how such a database will be maintained as most of them “keep changing their temporary accommodation”.The Centre’s letter, written by DK Gupta, director (public distribution), stated that “every beneficiary shall expect the vehicle in front of their door” and if that is not done, “there may be issues of favouritism and nepotism”.“Free movement of the delivery vehicle may be hindered. Moreover, doorstep delivery may not be successful in multi-storey buildings with multiple floors. Thus, these constraints may defeat the whole purpose of the ‘home delivery’ and in fact, the beneficiaries may actually be called to come till the van/vehicle and collect their packets,” read the letter, a copy of which was seen by HT.It also questioned how the Delhi government will coordinate with the beneficiaries during the time of delivery as most of them are daily wagers, labourers, household job (holders) and so on. “…timely delivery at a fixed date/time may be hampered due to tackling traffic congestion, breakdown of delivery vehicles etc. Absence of beneficiaries during home delivery date/time/trips of van shall impact their food security, as compared to choosing their own convenient date, time and cost of lifting food grains… Food items loaded on the delivery vehicles for doorstep delivery may be subjected to variable weather conditions such as rain, heat, mist, dust, pollution, humidity, etc resulting in wastage,” said the letter.Responding to the points, Sisodia said that the Centre could have simply asked the Delhi government about the prices involved in this scheme. “We would have told them... Distribution of ration under the NFSA is the preparative of the state government. We assure the Centre that the cost to the beneficiary for availing the scheme will not be more than the rates prescribed by it,” he said.He added that it was in these narrow lanes of Delhi that pizzas are getting delivered. “When people can get pizzas delivered to their houses; fridges, clothes, food and any other consumable item can be delivered by Amazon, why can’t the poor get their ration delivered? How do these things reach the third floor? I want to tell the PM, this is young India. Today the youth of our country have the capacity to deliver ration even to the moon.”The Centre also suggested in its letter that the Delhi government first start the scheme on a pilot basis. It further sought clarity whether there will be a single contractor for the whole of Delhi or multiple contractors and how they will be made accountable under NFSA.This is the third time this year that the scheme has been stalled due to differences between the Delhi government and the Centre. On June 16, Kejriwal wrote a note to Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal in response to the L-G’s comments asking the CM to reconsider the proposal and seek the Centre’s approval citing an ongoing court case in the matter.In his note to the L-G, Kejriwal addressed the price issue as flagged by the Centre, saying that any beneficiary who avails doorstep delivery of ration will have to pay ₹2 per kg only for processing the wheat into flour, and that this does not include services such as cleaning, packaging and transportation, and is based on a letter issued by the Union government’s department of food and public distribution on November 3, 2014.The scheme was to be launched on March 25, but the Union food and consumer affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 raising two objections— the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and that any change in the delivery mechanism requires an amendment in NSFA that can be done only by Parliament. The Delhi government, on March 24, passed a Cabinet decision to remove the name “Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna” for the scheme and to implement doorstep delivery of ration as part of the existing NFS Act, 2013.Delhi currently has around 1.78 million ration card-holder households, which according to government records, translate to 7.2 million beneficiaries. Ration is currently distributed to them through a network of 2,000-odd fair price shops.Anjali Bhardwaj, member of the Right to Food campaign, said it is very unfortunate that at a time when people are facing the double whammy of a health disaster and economic distress, and millions are in dire need of rations, the central and state governments are indulging in politics over food.“They should both focus on increasing food security net in Delhi. Only 37% (72 lakh people) have ration cards while many more need ration. Last year, under the e-coupon scheme, the Delhi government had to provide rations to nearly 70 lakh people without ration cards. The Delhi government can issue temporary ration cards and use home delivery for non-PDS delivery by starting a state level scheme to avoid getting into a tussle with central government,” said Bhardwaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-rejects-centre-s-rejection-of-ration-plan-says-grounds-frivolous-101624472203375.html
24-06-2021||India||IMD’s string of wrong monsoon forecasts for Delhi||Since Friday, residents of the national capital have waited with bated breath for rain. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had on June 17predicted that “moderate rainfall and thunderstorms” will sweep through the city on the weekend as the monsoon hits the Capital, more than 10 days ahead of its usual onset date. But, as it turned out, residents spent the weekend sweating, with no rain anywhere in the city.But this was not the Met department’s first inaccurate weather forecast of the year. The IMD’s predictions, short- and long-term, have missed the mark on several occasions in 2021.While Met officials argued that some “volatile” and unforeseen weather conditions unique to northwest India this year led to these inaccuracies, independent experts said such patterns are not unusual, and said IMD should be in a position to come up with more precise predictions.The weather body’s string of missed monsoon forecasts began on June 11. IMD announced that the arrival of monsoon in Delhi, along with other parts of northwest India, had advanced by at least 12 days. Instead of its usual arrival date of June 27-28, monsoon showers would hit by June 15, the department said.“A low-pressure area over northwest Bay of Bengal and the formation of a trough over the region is showing favourable conditions for the advancement of south-west monsoon in most parts of northwest India,” the forecast said.This prediction was revised on June 13, and Met officials advanced their prediction of the onset date by a day. The forecast said “conditions were favourable for further advancement of south-west monsoon into most parts of Madhya Pradesh, parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab” by June 14.But two days later, the Met department’s forecast took a U-turn and revised the monsoon arrival date again. Another revision came more than a week later on June 22, when IMD in an official statement said the arrival of the south-west monsoon over Delhi was unlikely till at least June 29.“Due to the adverse influence of mid-latitude westerlies, a hiatus in the further advancement of south-west monsoon into remaining parts of northwest India is seen. The situation is being monitored continuously and will be updated on a daily basis,” the revised forecast read.While the weather body has now refrained from committing on the date of the monsoon arrival in Delhi, they have also over the past week missed the mark with some short-range forecasts in the region. The department on June 17 said there was a possibility of rainfall and thunderstorms over Delhi and the National Capital Region. This activity was to on June 19 intensify into moderate showers, leading to a drop in temperatures in the Capital.Nearly two weeks since the original monsoon forecast, Delhi is yet to see any significant rain, with the days mostly hot and humid since then.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre on Wednesday told HT that the monsoon is likely to arrive in Delhi by the first week of July — a few days after its usual onset date, but over two weeks than the IMD’s prediction.Explaining the yawning gap between the monsoon forecast for the season and the actual weather conditions, Srivastava said, “Between June 10 and June 15, the low-pressure system was advancing very fast till eastern Uttar Pradesh. However, after that, even though the trough has persisted, the low-pressure system is not as intense.”The department’s prediction inaccuracies this year have not been limited to the monsoon. The IMD in 2021 has also got the summer predictions for northwest India wrong. In March, this year the Met department released a long-range forecast for summers, warning that temperatures are expected to be higher than normal this year.The forecast said that in March, April and May, regions along the Indo-Gangetic Plains including Delhi, Haryana, UP, Punjab and Bihar, were expected to clock maximum temperatures at least 0.71 degrees Celsius above the normal Long Period Average (LPA). LPA is considered the normal range of temperatures and rainfall, which helps note deviation.However, since March this year, Delhi is yet to record a single heatwave day. In fact, the summer months this time recorded lower-than-normal temperatures this year, due to a greater number western disturbances and two cyclonic storms — Tauktae, which struck India’s wester coast, and Yaas, which hit the east.Senior Met officials said that usually, long-range forecasts are only around 50% accurate, while short-range forecasts (predictions closer to the weather event) can go up to 70-80%. Weather experts pointed out that IMD only recently started making long-range forecasts, and said that these predictions are expected to improve over time.“There are a few factors that come in the way of accurate weather forecasts. Firstly, northwest India as a region is a little volatile in its weather activities, which makes it slightly trickier to make on-point forecasts compared to other parts,” a senior IMD official said.“Another reason is that the models that we use for forecasting have its limitations. We will probably be able to improve with better technology,” the official added.Private forecasters agreed that while the error margin of IMD predictions has reduced from 7-10% in the previous decade to around 5% now, more needs to be done to ensure better forecasts.“With climate change leading to extreme weather events, it has become more difficult to get forecasts totally right. However, that’s not to say that the role of regular monitoring and confirmation of weather conditions through multiple models is discounted. In a country like India, everything revolves around the weather and it is imperative that our government agencies work to better the predictions,” said Parth Sinha, a Noida-based climate researcher and private weather forecaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imds-string-of-wrong-monsoon-forecasts-for-delhi-101624472204077.html
24-06-2021||India||States prep for Delta+ as mutation cases rise||India has begun setting up a sentinel surveillance system specifically for Sars-Cov-2 variants, with five hospitals and labs in each state sending samples for whole genome sequencing on a regular basis, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, adding that 40 cases of the Delta Plus variant have been detected in India so far.Delta Plus refers to a variant scientifically known as the AY.1, which belongs to the same lineage as the Delta variant that is now established to be significantly more transmissible and possibly resistant to vaccines. AY.1 was classified as a “variant of concern” (VOC) by India on Tuesday. A new genome surveillance system will allow a better understanding of how the virus is mutating and could potentially help catch variants of concern before they take hold.“In addition to what was earlier being practised, hospital-based sentinel sites in all states for sample collection are being operationalised. As many as 18 more labs have been recently added to the list of 10 labs in the national Insacog network to scale up genome sequencing. Also, states have to regularly provide 5% positive samples from community to Insacog labs,” said a senior official in the Union ministry of health, on condition of anonymity.Insacog refers to the Indian Sars-Cov-2 genomic sequencing consortia, which was set up in December after the Alpha variant arose. The network had raised an alarm about the Delta variant but authorities were subsequently accused of delaying timely action which could have mitigated the severity of the second wave that began in March. For instance, not enough viral genomes were sequenced in the run-up to the second wave. The establishment of the sentinel sites should address that gap.The Union health ministry in a statement on Wednesday added that there are approximately 40 confirmed infections with the Delta Plus variant, an increase from 22 announced by the Union health ministry on Tuesday. These cases have been found in six districts – two each in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala.The Union government asked officials in these states to redouble containment and testing efforts, and carry out surge vaccinations, it said on Tuesday.In Kerala, three villages have been shut, officials said, and residents are being mandatorily tested for Covid-19. The cases were among three people, a four-year-old boy and two women in their 50s, all of whom have now recovered, said an official.In Maharashtra, state health minister Rajesh Tope announced that 100 samples from each district will immediately be sent for genome sequencing.Officials in Karnataka on Wednesday said genome sequencing found Delta Plus variant cases in three people, and that they had stepped up efforts to sequence more samples.According to the Union health ministry statement, states have identified five laboratories and five tertiary care hospitals as sentinel sites, and each is expected to send 15 samples routinely to designated regional genome Sequencing Laboratories (RGSLs).Also read | Delta plus in 11 countries, 197 cases: What we know about Covid variant so farAccording to the health ministry, in addition to the sentinel surveillance, there will be additional event-based surveillance for special or unusual clusters – where cases have either grown unexpectedly, there is a change in symptoms or hospitalisation, or that show high breakthrough infections (those that happen despite vaccination).The details of the epidemiological investigations, study methodology, number of samples to be collected for genome sequencing would depend on the situation or event, the person added.One expert said more needs to be done, especially since Insacog has sequenced only 45,000viral genomes since its inception. “We need baseline plus targeting; 5% or 3% of all positive samples plus all deaths, vaccine breakthroughs, unusual presentations, children with hospitalisations, etc, [must be done]. 5% of the 20 million cases we have had since Insacog was established is 1 million. So, we have done one-twentieth of what was proposed,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, physician-scientist, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.Another said resource limitations must be kept in mind for successful genome surveillance efforts. “When the case load is higher than what you can handle, the best thing to do is to go for smart sequencing, and do more sequencing in areas that look problematic such as areas from where such cases are being reported more, clusters or reporting of other conspicuous events,” said Shahid Jameel, senior virologist, and director, Trivedi School of Biosciences, Ashoka University. Jameel headed an advisory group to Insacog before he resigned from the position in mid-May.“What is interesting is that for the Delta Plus variant you don’t need to do whole genome sequencing which is expensive and time consuming. One can go for genotyping assays that are cheaper and faster to do and can provide results in even 48 hours. It’s no rocket science as you already know the mutation, so you design probes to detect those changes. Public Health England is already doing this and for a country like ours, smart sequencing and genotyping assays will give us good results,” he added.“The actual Iinsacog work started around mid February when caseload was around 10-12,000 new cases per day but the country didn’t have the capacity to handle 5% of 200,000-400,000 cases that were getting reported in a day at one point. All 10 labs put together had the capacity to perform about 30,000 sequences per month and that is when they put on hold all other work and focus only on Covid-19. The grouping has done well in finding out what’s circulating, and alerted in March about B.1.617 variant that is now being called the Delta variant, and later on also about the Delta Plus variant,” he added.The Union health ministry also said that all sub-lineages of the Delta variant , including AY.1 and AY.2, are now considered VOCs. “All Delta sub-lineages are treated as a variant of concern, although properties of AY.1 are still being investigated. Currently, the variant frequency of AY.1 is low in India. Cases with AY.1 have been mostly reported from nine countries of Europe, Asia and America,” it said in a statement.The inclusion of AY.1 (Delta Plus) and AY.2 in VOC’s list was first made by Public Health England in its most recent technical briefing on June 11.With inputs from HTC in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Thiruvananthapuram||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-prep-for-delta-as-mutation-cases-rise-101624471663349.html
24-06-2021||India||Haridwar testing probe: 8-member team calling 98,000 phone numbers||118,000 Covid-19 rapid antigen tests. 98,000 different phone numbers used to register patients in two labs. Just eight investigators to track down the people behind the numbers.This is the scale of the task in front of officials probing allegations of mass fake testing during the Mahakumbh in April, prompting each of the eight members in the district administration’s team to dial roughly 450 numbers a day. Over the past week, the team has called up nearly 3,500 numbers a day, totaling about 25,000 -- only a fourth of the target.Haridwar district magistrate C Ravishankar said he ordered the humongous task after allegations that phone numbers registered for Covid-19 tests belonged to people who never visited Haridwar or didn’t get tested.“A week into this probe, I am convinced that irregularities occurred in the testing process. This process of calling up every phone number and seeking their response will help establish the crime and the extent of it,” said Ravishankar. “In the one week we have so far managed to dial 25,000 phone numbers and received a host of varied responses,” he added.The district administration’s probe is one of three looking into charges that two private labs – Delhi-based Lalchandani Labs and Hisar-based Nalwa Labs – conducted roughly 100,000 fake tests during the holy event. A third, Noida-based private agency Max Corporate Services, outsourced the testing. The allegations were triggered after a Faridkot resident complained to the authorities that he received a message for collecting his Covid-19 report despite never having been tested. All three firms have been booked by police under the Indian Penal Code, disaster management act and epidemic diseases act.Roughly 9.1 million people took the holy dip in the Ganga, coinciding with a devastating surge in coronavirus infections. The mela was cut short after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an appeal to seers on April 17 but by then, officials in many north Indian states had found infections in people who had travelled to Haridwar.The DM said the probe process involves dialling each number to ask a set of questions to the person at the other end of the line. If a respondent confirms that they were at the mela and got tested, they are asked follow-up questions to confirm that the testing was genuine.But many respond to the officials saying they had nothing to do with the mela or Covid-19 testing, but received text messages about supposed tests. “These are suspicious cases, which could either be examples of fake tests or errors in noting down numbers,” said Ravishankar.In many cases, the same number is mentioned against several tests. “There are quite a few such instances. In many instances, one phone number was mentioned against four-five tests. That could also be because they all belonged to one family or group,” said Ravishankar.But one such case was that of Indore-based contractor Kamal Patel, whose number was mentioned against 56 tests. “I have received over a dozen calls from health officials already,” said Patel.What has complicated the probe is that a lot of phone numbers are either not in service, out of reach, or simply switched off. “Then there are people who don’t want to talk to us, or simply do not understand our language or what we are conveying,” said Ravishankar.When the probe began a week ago, the district administration set a deadline of 15 days. “But the process of calling up every number, many of them multiple times, means that it will take much longer,” said Ravishankar.Apart from making these calls, the district administration is also issuing notices to the labs and government officials to join the probe.A parallel probe by the Haridwar Police’s special investigation team is questioning lab officials and mela administration. “Our probe is at a preliminary stage, but it mainly involves inspecting documents and questioning the officials,” said Senthil Avoodai Krishnaraj, senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Haridwar.A third probe is by the Kumbh mela health department. “Appropriate action will be taken against anyone who found to be involved in irregularities,” said Harbeer Singh, additional mela officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-haridwar-testing-probe-eight-member-team-calling-98-000-phone-numbers-to-check-status-101624471603298.html
24-06-2021||India||UK high court denies Nirav Modi’s request to file appeal||The UK high court has turned down diamantaire Nirav Modi’s appeal against his extradition to India, leaving him with five days to mount a further appeal in what is expected to be a protracted legal process.In February, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court cleared Nirav Modi’s extradition, finding him guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and dismissing his claims that he wouldn’t get a fair trial in India. UK home secretary Priti Patel subsequently approved the extradition in April.Nirav Modi approached the UK high court to ascertain if there were any grounds for an appeal against Patel’s decision or the Westminster Magistrates’ Court order. This appeal was rejected by a high court judge on Tuesday.A UK high court official told PTI the permission to appeal was “rejected on paper”, leaving Nirav Modi with the option of making his case at an oral hearing in the high court through a renewed “leave to appeal” application that has to be filed within five days.Also read | Banks cheated by Mallya, Modi and Choksi get ₹9,371 crore from EDIt is believed Modi plans to make such an application, and a judge will then determine if the matter should proceed to a full appeal hearing.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Tuesday’s decision by the UK high court was just one step in what is set to be a protracted legal process. There is also speculation that Nirav Modi will have the option of approaching the European Court of Human Rights after exhausting all his legal options in the UK.The 50-year-old businessman has been held at Wandsworth Prison in southwest London since March 2019, when he was arrested on the basis of India’s extradition request. He is the second high-profile economic offender, after former liquor baron Vijay Mallya, whose extradition has been cleared by a trial court in the UK. Mallya lost his appeal against extradition in April 2020, though the British government has said his extradition is being held up by a “confidential legal issue”.Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought the speedy extradition of both economic offenders during a virtual summit with his British counterpart Boris Johnson in May.In its judgement in February, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court asserted that Nirav Modi has a case to answer and said that he, along with his brother Nehal Modi and others, defrauded Punjab National Bank, laundered the money taken from the bank and conspired to destroy evidence and intimidate witnesses.Nirav Modi’s argument that India has poor prison conditions was rejected by Westminster Magistrates’ Court, with the judge saying that conditions at Barrack Number 12 in Arthur Road Jail in Maharashtra, where he will be held, “are far less restrictive and far more spacious than the current regime he is being held in within the prison estate in our own jurisdiction”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-high-court-denies-nirav-modi-s-request-to-file-appeal-101624471483377.html
24-06-2021||Today's||Vaccination: The State must lead the charge of the enlightened brigade||On April 26, when the murderous second wave was at its peak, my colleagues and I zoom-huddled over an excel sheet. We were trying to understand how informal workers could be readily vaccinated. At the time, we assumed vaccine equity was the single biggest challenge. Our data was counter-intuitive.A fortnight earlier, we had surveyed 4,774 adults from 2,097 families to glean their perceptions about vaccination access. Our respondents were from 14 slums across Delhi and Ghaziabad. Much to our surprise, only 7% of the respondents were willing to be vaccinated.Some of the stated reasons were no surprise. About 20% said since they were well, an “injection” was unnecessary. Some believed they would pull through, since they had survived this long. But 31% described themselves as “afraid” of the vaccine’s aftermath. “Please,” wailed a young man tearfully into his cellphone, “don’t ask me to take the teeka. What will happen to my children?” Evidently, one of the overwhelming fears was of death by vaccination. Vaccine-caused impotency was an additional concern. Most unexpected was a throwback to 1857; Hindus and Muslims believed the shot contained extracts of sacred or banned animals.The role of fake news, rumours and poorly-informed local influencers is palpable. Those who expressed (misplaced) fears claimed they received this information from WhatsApp and general chatter, and claimed that “everyone knew this”. They had not received any other kind of scientific information to encourage them to vaccinate. Such damaging misinformation seems to be filling in an information vacuum.In May, as the second wave persisted, we called 1,200 people to be vaccinated. Of these, only three per cent agreed. Then we enrolled a charismatic leader from a Delhi slum, who convinced 12 people to get the first shot. In the videos she made, they were pleasantly surprised to be unharmed. Yet, women said it was impossible for them to leave their children, figure out centres and reach there. Not only is the digital divide a barrier, but the multiple roles women have had foisted on them, is an additional challenge.Erasing vaccine hesitancy in every pocket is pivotal to closing the chapter on this endless pandemic. What approach might work?The State must lead the charge of the enlightening brigade. Fighting false information is daunting, but possible. Campaigns with influencers such as the local councillor and legislators to celebrities can build confidence. Doctors must weigh in as well. The media and social media should amplify this.Vaccines must be made easily available, especially when we have enough of them. Instead of hoping that the poor will overcome multiple roadblocks and register or forego a day’s earnings in these hard times, mobile units should roll out, on priority, in all slums. Why not use our under-used public transportation buses for walk-in vaxxing?Local leaders have a special role in ensuring this becomes a game-changer, as Mumbai showed us. Currently, camps are held in the clubs and localities of the better-off, mostly organised by themselves. Even when domestic staff is encouraged to attend, it doesn’t touch most of the urban poor. And, remember, much as 40% of the urban population lives in slums. We must reach them more effectively. Some of India’s influential upper-middle-class citizens proclaim that the poor don’t seem to have been hit as intensely by even the second wave, far less the first. In reality, we don’t know. We don’t have credible data. Anecdotal interactions are too local, hiding as much as they reveal. And irrespective of which class got affected to what degree, the simple fact is that each of us has to take the jab for all of us to be safe. With the second wave ebbing, a new vaccine policy framework in place, and a renewed push by governments to encourage vaccination, there is hope. But to see light at the end of this tunnel, India must ferociously identify where vaccine hesitancy still exists and battle this.

24-06-2021||Today's||Design a climate-ready governance system||Countries around the world, including India, face the challenge of building a climate-ready State. Because almost all sectors and many parts of society contribute to greenhouse gases and are vulnerable to its impact, the climate crisis requires an all-of-government and all-of-society response. Because the shifts required must be rapid to address the urgency of the problem, we need strategic ability, including modelling, analysis and direction-setting. And finally, because these shifts will be disruptive, and create winners (renewable energy companies) and losers (coal-dependent communities), a climate-ready State must be able to limit the fallout for those disadvantaged by the transition.There has been a steady chorus calling for enhanced policy and targets by all countries in the build-up to the Glasgow Conference of Parties in November, and climate has been central to global discussions such as the recent meeting of G7 leaders. Yet, there has been too little discussion about how India, and other countries, can get climate governance right. In addition to targets and policies, we need to deepen and enhance systems of governance for the climate crisis, which include dedicated organisations, policy frameworks, capacities, and financing mechanisms.Also Read | Britain risks missing net zero emissions due to lack of policies: ReportThis enormous governance challenge has long been under-addressed, in India, as elsewhere. A national plan, created in 2008, limited itself to eight priority sectors, with uneven progress across the various “missions”. No durable bodies were created to orchestrate a strategic national response over the long run. An advisory council under the prime minister has not met since 2015. An apex implementation body composed of senior bureaucrats has been similarly inconsistent, meeting only six times between 2013 and 2019. India has accumulated a growing patchwork of climate policies, with some benefits, but these are scattershot and untethered to a larger national goal.An eight-country study by the Centre for Policy Research that compares climate governance systems tells us how national governments could tackle the climate governance challenge. It is clear there is no one-size-fits-all institutional framework; different needs, governance systems, and political support all matter. The United Kingdom, with arguably the most well-developed climate governance, has a law-backed independent commission that recommends five-yearly carbon budgets to the government, which filters through to each department. In the fractious climate politics of the United States, after failed efforts at climate law, the federal government has chosen to embed climate capacities across departments. China has a top-down approach that parcels out targets decided at the highest levels of government to lower rungs under threat of sanction. Which approach is right for India?India’s approach must be driven by its development and carbon context. India’s energy needs are growing, and we emit far less carbon per capita than the rich world. Yet, for our own sake, India must meet an increasing share of energy needs from low-carbon sources. And we must ensure that the India of the future, from infrastructure to industrial foundations, is compatible with low-carbon development. As argued in these pages earlier, India should focus on low-carbon development pathways and establish institutions for this.Crucially, they must be able to peer into the future to assess how policy choices today might shape decisions in later stages of growth. A choice between electric vehicles or public transport determines the future carbon-intensity of cities, automobile manufacturing and the electric grid, for example.In a new policy brief, we lay out an institutional architecture capable of crafting such low-carbon development pathways. We ground our prescriptions in the understanding that the system must fill a strategic void through credible information and analysis; that it must be open to voices across society; that it must appropriately address different levels of governance in India; and that it must be able to coordinate ministries pulling in different directions even while working with the grain of existing systems. This is a delicate balancing act.At the core of our proposal lies an independent, non-executive low-carbon development commission (LCDC), anchored in new climate legislation and composed of both experts and stakeholders. It is meant to craft low-carbon development pathways and recommend policy opportunities to ministries, deriving authority from the credibility of its analysis. But equally, its links to key stakeholders — business, labour, civil society — will allow it to embed technical analysis in broad public discourse.To improve chances of uptake, we propose that ministries be made to report to Parliament and the public on their annual plans, goals and achievements. Budgetary incentives for mitigation might speed up the process. To coordinate a growing body of policy, now in a different context, we recommend revitialising the body of senior bureaucrats mentioned above – the executive committee on climate change. The ministry of environment, forests and climate change will continue as the nodal ministry, handling key functions, including monitoring. As climate science advances and India’s developmental position evolves, this architecture must be capable of reimagining itself to address other formulations, including net zero-emission targets.Climate is now firmly entrenched in the global, and Indian, agenda. A great deal of energy goes into debating policies and targets. For these to be strategic, effective, and consistent with India’s development goals, India now needs to also build a climate-ready system of governance.Navroz K Dubash is professor, Centre for Policy Research (CPR), New Delhi.

24-06-2021||Today's||From 1901 to 2011, what the census tells us about India’s population||In recent years, a section of the political class has been stridently demanding a “population control” law.The argument offered in its defence by its votaries is simple: India is experiencing a population explosion. This imposes growing strains on economic resources and contributes to fraying the social contract that holds our society together. Our neighbour, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), has demonstrated how tough population control action over the last 40 years rapidly accelerated its economic transformation and raised a billion people out of poverty. We can only replicate this with decisive (read harsh) legislation.It seems a stretch to make such an assertion at face value. There is a great deal of posturing about the urgency and all the arguments are anecdotal. These anecdotes are coloured by the political proclivities of the proponents. A chief minister (CM) of a major northeastern state wants a particular minority community to decelerate its birth rates as “(population) is the main root of social menace like poverty, land encroachment and we can reduce this social menace if the population is reduced”.A state’s law commission chairman offers this gem. “Population is nearing an explosive stage. It is causing other issues too — related to hospitals, foodgrains, houses, or employment”. In contrast to the CM, he is at pains to add that this has nothing to do with a “particular” community.There is a simple way to separate the wheat from the chaff when we grapple with such questions. Look at what the Census of India is telling us. Let us start by examining how India’s population has grown over the last 12 censuses, from 1901 to 2011.India’s population grew almost five-fold over 110 years.There was only one decadal population decline, of 0.31% from 1911 to 1921. This was the decade that ended in the flu pandemic of 1918. Professor David Arnold of Asian and global history at Warwick University writes in Death & the Modern Empire: The 1918-19 Influenza Epidemic in India, “In India the 1918–19 influenza pandemic cost at least twelve million lives, more than in any other country; it caused widespread suffering and disrupted the economy and infrastructure”.If these lives were to be added to the 1911 population, the decade would have ended at 265 million Indians. In effect, it took a decade’s worth of population growth out of the trend, and the echoes of lives lost in our great grandparents’ generation continue to resonate through India’s demographics, a century later. (This begs the question: Will the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic scar India’s demographics such that the effects will still be palpable in 2121?)The political will to bring runaway population growth under control is evident in the change in the momentum of growth between 1961 and 2011. The growth rate, which had been accelerating from Independence to the beginning of the third five-year plan in 1961, began to flatten in the next decade and then began falling, for the next 40 years.The momentum of the growth rate (change in the rate of change) dropped from +8.20% in 1961 to -3.84% in five decades. If this trend has persisted through the 2011 to 2021 decade, the momentum would have slipped further, to around -5.3%. This would result in the decadal growth rate dropping from 17.7% to 12.4%, the slowest growth in India’s population since 1931.Using this as a rough and ready number, the 2021 Census ought to come up with an all-India population of 1.358 billion. After adding 180 million per decade for the previous two decades, we would add a mere 140 million, about as much as we did between 1971 and 1981, but on a nearly 90% bigger population base.Things become more interesting if we project a similar momentum to the next decadal Census. If the growth momentum drops to -6.8%, and there are sound trends that support this, the population growth rate to 2031 would be just 5.6%, giving us an estimated population a decade hence of 1.434 billion, a population increase of a mere 76 million people. For context, that was almost exactly the population growth between 1951 and 1961 on a population base that was one-fourth of what it is now.Does this look like a population explosion to you? The demographic changes which India is grappling with, today and in the future, are rather different from the simplistic tropes of “explosion” fear-mongering. They pertain to the real and present dangers of populations beginning to shrink in several states. They pertain to a diminishing pool of people of working age, the “demographic dividend” which our leaders love to boast about. They pertain to an increasing burden of the aged and infirm on the society, economy and health care infrastructure. There are real demographic problems that need to be solved. But they are not what politicians are trying to scare you with.Paritosh Joshi is a media professional with a keen interest in audience measurement The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/from-1901-to-2011-what-the-census-tells-us-about-india-s-population-101624533286834.html
24-06-2021||Today's||The fine line that separates judicial transparency and the right to be forgotten||The Delhi high court recently granted relief to a petitioner seeking to exercise his “right to be forgotten”. The petitioner, who was earlier acquitted in a narcotics case, had come before the high court praying for the removal of the judgment of his acquittal from online platforms such as Google and Indian Kanoon.The court passed an interim order granting the relief. Justice Prathiba M Singh, while passing the order, recognised that the case raised an important question of whether a court order can be removed from online platforms to protect an individual’s right to privacy and the need to balance it with the right to information of the public and maintenance of transparency in judicial records.This is not the first case of this kind in India and it will not be the last. With deeper integration of technology and the digitisation of data, the “practical obscurity” that was associated with court decisions is diminishing, and a simple Google search can yield a plethora of information about an individual, including judgments that their names figure in. Cases like these involve the determination of a crucial issue: Can the right to be forgotten (RTBF) be granted in case of judicial decisions?Also Read | Narada case: SC judge recuses himself from hearing Bengal CM’s petitionThe right to be forgotten RTBF is a right to have one’s personal information removed from publicly available sources on certain grounds. While it has its roots in the French right of oblivion which allows for individuals who have been convicted of a crime to prevent the publication of facts about the crime, RTBF gained currency after the 2014 decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) in the Google Spain case.In this case, the CJEU ruled in favour of a Spanish national who had requested Google to remove two links to newspaper articles about him. It held that personal information found to be inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive in relation to the purposes of the processing should be erased, even if it was published lawfully. RTBF went on to be incorporated in Article 17 of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation which came into effect in 2018.RTBF in IndiaIn India, RTBF has not attained legislative sanction yet. However, in the Puttaswamy judgment, which held that the right to privacy is a fundamental right, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul touches upon RTBF in cases where such information has become irrelevant and serves no legitimate interest. That case, however, did not discuss the specific question of whether RTBF can be granted in the case of judgments.So far, the Supreme Court has not dealt with a case directly on the RTBF issue. Different high courts have adjudicated upon such requests. The Gujarat high court refused the application by an accused in 2014 while the high courts of Karnataka (2017) and Orissa (2020) have allowed masking the name of victims in criminal proceedings, recognising their right to privacy. However, the inconsistent approaches adopted by high courts in dealing with RTBF can be illustrated by two recent judgments along with the Delhi high court’s interim order.In January, a division bench of the Bombay high court refused an applicant’s prayer to treat an order recording consent terms in a petition for quashing an FIR as confidential or even block the name of the applicant from the order. The rationale adopted by the Bombay high court was that a request for “blocking the name made after a long gap of four years, cannot be accepted”. It also pointed out that no such request was made when the order was passed and by virtue of the lapse in time, it cannot be agitated that the presence of the order on a Google search will cause prejudice to the applicant.In March, the Kerala high court was approached by an applicant seeking the un-indexing of links of an order passed by the court directing the local registrar to accept her application for marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. Since the marriage fell through, the presence of the order online was causing prejudice to her marriage prospects as it appeared on entering her name as a keyword on Google. Recognising the important question of law involved in the case, the court has now referred the case to a division bench. As interim relief, the court has directed the registry to mask the name and address of the petitioner in the cause title of this order.Of judicial decisions and RTBFIt is important to understand that the implications of granting RTBF in the case of judicial decisions are very different from granting RTBF for other content on the internet. This can be seen in the approach adopted in the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. While Clause 20 of the bill includes a right to be forgotten, Clause 36 makes it inapplicable to the processing of personal data by any court or tribunal in India that is necessary for the exercise of any judicial function. The possible explanation for carving out this exception is the need to preserve the independence of the judiciary and maintain transparency.Judgments have always been treated as public records and fall within the definition of a public document according to Section 74 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The principle of “open courts” is crucial to the functioning of the Indian judicial system. Openness does not only refer to access to courts and public hearings, but also includes access to court orders and judgments. Open courts promote transparency and help make the judiciary more accountable. Access to judgments allows the public to critically analyse the functioning of the courts. It is for these reasons that a report by Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy on Open Courts in the Digital Age suggested that RTBF cannot be extended to official public records, especially judicial records as that would undermine public faith in the judicial system in the long run.Balancing the right to know with the right to privacyWhile it is obvious that information on adverse judgments against an individual or an entity might be harmful to their reputation, it is critical that the courts delicately balance society’s right to know with the individual’s right to privacy. The lack of clarity on the grounds on which RTBF can be granted with respect to judgments has turned getting relief from the courts into a lottery. While the Delhi high court has granted interim relief on the ground of the “irreparable prejudice” caused to the applicant, the Bombay high court has rejected such a ground citing lapse of time and lack of promptness on the part of the applicant. The Kerala high court, on the other hand, has noted the public nature of court records but granted an interim order since the matter involved was not of public interest.The diverse approaches adopted by the high courts point to the need for a uniform test to determine requests for delinking court orders or masking names of parties. Though a straightjacket test may be undesirable, there is a need for clear directives on how the RTBF can be applied in specific situations. The Supreme Court is best placed to come up with a policy on the implementation of RTBF by courts.Such a policy needs to balance the competing interests of the public’s right to know, the need for transparency in judicial records, and the individual’s right to privacy. Any such guidelines will have to indicate the time frame within which to approach the court and lay down the factual parameters for which RTBF might be available. Striking the right balance will be key to the development of RTBF jurisprudence in India. At a time when the judiciary is entering Phase III of its ambitious eCourts project, rights such as RTBF will have to be coded into any technology solution that is developed for judicial data storage and management.Apoorva and Jigar Parmar are Research Fellows at Vidhi Centre for Legal PolicyThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-fine-line-that-separates-judicial-transparency-and-the-right-to-be-forgotten-101624521826341.html
24-06-2021||Today's||Multi-modal integration: The key to transforming India’s transport systems||In India, urbanisation is increasing rapidly, offering economic opportunities across various sectors. This leads to domestic immigration of the working-class population to these urban centres, boosting its productivity, further leading to more economic activity through the establishment of more business centres and markets. This development cycle, through an analysis of its contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), shows that urban centres are the engines of economic growth, and their contributions to GDP will continue to grow.However, the needs of a rising population in an urban landscape must be met. Rapid urbanisation means more pressure on infrastructure, increasing congestion, rising pollution and unmanageable urban sprawl. In the last few decades, governments have tried to meet the increasing travel demand. But the pace of rising demand has consistently beaten the rate of infrastructure development. Ever-rising transport demand which corresponds with economic growth has been difficult to meet in the absence of integrated planning of land use and transport.Also Read | Reforms under Aatmanirbhar Bharat improved ease of living, writes PM ModiSupporting infrastructure to keep pace with rising economic activity, therefore, is essential. Along with urban development programmes such as the smart cities mission, AMRUT and housing for all, among others, the focus on mobility infrastructure is equally important to ensure that the economic potential does not get constrained.Policy planners have been advocating public transport solutions to free up Indian cities from traffic congestion and high pollution levels. These high-investment and high-operational expenditure projects have been approved because of the long-term, socioeconomic benefits they bring with them.India has emerged as one of the fastest-growing markets for urban rail systems. The government has invested intensively in urban transport systems such as metros across tier-1 and 2 cities, inter and intra-city high-frequency bus services, monorails and so on. However, despite these projects being successfully implemented, ridership numbers have been far below the projections of the policymakers. These numbers have further been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.From a commuters’ viewpoint, these projects provide an affordable, reliable, safe, fast and green alternative to other transport modes. However, there is scope for improvement in multi-modal connectivity. Unimodal and multi-modal networks involve transfers points where users can move from one mode to another. The walking and waiting time during these transfers discourage people from opting for public transport. Urban transport systems require several functions to be performed in a well-coordinated manner for a seamless travel experience. Unfortunately, there is a lack of coordination among the agencies.Also Read | Shaping India’s urban futureEvery agency is looking at commuters with a myopic view as their exclusive users, and not as one who wants to travel from one point to the other on more than one mode seamlessly. Public Transport agencies operate in isolation and have so far resisted plans of cross-integration in many cases.Public transport platforms such as the Indian railways, metro trains, regional rapid transit system (RRTS), interstate buses, bus rapid transit (BRT) as well as aviation can no longer operate in isolation. There also remains the choice between public and personal transport. This depends on several factors such as duration, route, purpose, fare, convenience and comfort. To ensure that these advanced transport modes become the natural choice for commuters, from every stratum of our society, we need to provide for the end-to-end travel requirements.Addressing these challenges requires enabling the convenience and comfort of door-to-door trips by ensuring integration based on well-established global transport integration frameworks. In an international forum I attended, the transport integration framework was outlined at two levels.First, the physical integration primarily comprising the implementation of efficient interchanges at stations/stops/terminals to minimise back-tracking, walking distances, level changes between services, and provide safe (off-street) and secure (well-lit) and weather-protected facilities.Second, the service integration comprising network structure of route alignments and stoppage locations, level of services, schedules, fare structures and passenger information.Despite an increased focus on the implementation of advanced public transport systems, the lower modal share of these systems has raised questions on the core objectives, not only from the perspective of financial viability but also from the perspective of the economic return from these projects. This includes the impact on the lives of citizens, reduction in pollution and lower congestion on roads. Therefore, solving these challenges calls for focused action with an emphasis on integrating multi-modal services at the planning stage.Also Read | Effect of high temperatures, low productivity on India’s growth prospectsPrime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day 2020 address, emphasised the government’s commitment to bring in a paradigm shift in infrastructure by integrating key modes of transportation. He highlighted that it is critical to move away from the era of “working in silos”. The opportunity is now to make our cities more accessible by enhancing multi-modal integration and improving the commuter’s experience.Hong Kong’s public transport system serves as a good example. Its transport system includes railways, trams, buses, ferries and taxis. With multi-modal integration, Hong Kong has achieved public transit modal share close to 90%. Other great examples include Tokyo, Singapore, London, Madrid and Paris.The creation of the Unified Metropolitan Transportation Authority (UMTA) in Indian states has been advised by the Centre, but hasn’t proliferated across the country. Given that the public transport agencies are still taking a narrow view in many cases and not opening up for integration, empowering the UMTA to take ownership of the transport ecosystem will help reach this goal.It is also the responsibility of the upcoming projects to ensure integration with the existing modes of transport, and at the same time, it is equally important for the authorities to support this. With this in view, at National Capital Region Transportation Corporation (NCRTC), we plan to connect several nodes of NCR, by way of the country’s first RRTS. We have been interacting with authorities to holistically integrate all public transport networks in the region.Multi-modal integration, which is central to our planning, is a key enabler in increasing ridership as it incentivises commuters to shift from private transport. For example, the Sarai Kale Khan RRTS station will be a mega multi-modal transit hub of NCR, where all the three priority RRTS corridors will converge and integrate with the existing Delhi metro station, Nizamuddin Railway station, and ISBT.At NCRTC, commuter convenience takes precedence over ease of implementation. We are committed to combine engineering solutions with top-class technology to provide sustainable urban mobility to the commuters of NCR. Multi-Modal integration and seamless connectivity will remain at the core of our planning and implementation.Vinay Kumar Singh is managing director, NCRTCThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/multimodal-integration-the-key-to-transforming-india-s-transport-systems-101624516425918.html
