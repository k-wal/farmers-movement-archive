On Monday, the ASI had issued a notification allowing monuments and museums under its watch to reopen. The footfall, on the first day, remained tepid with many tourists stating that they were unaware of the reopening or the online ticket mechanism. Delhi has over 70 monuments protected by the ASI, including Red Fort, Humayun’s Tomb and Qutb Minar, which are also on the list of UNESCO’s world heritage sites. At least 13 monuments under the ASI in Delhi requires tickets for entry. The Red Fort saw visitors after nearly five months. The 17th century fort was closed on January 19 on account of the bird flu scare. The closure was further extended after violence broke out at the monument on Republic Day during a tractor rally taken out by farmers protesting against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre. An ASI official, who did not wish to be named, said while most of the repair work had been completed, some minor tasks were left. “Turnstiles need to be placed again. Our vendors will be supplying the same but due to the lockdown, the consignment got stuck near Jaipur. Once the consignment reaches us, work will be completed soon,” said the official. Nasir Ali Khan (33), a businessman from Kolkata, said he was visiting Chandni Chowk when he decided to check if the fort was open for visitors. “This was my first visit to the Red Fort. It was largely empty, so I enjoyed exploring the place,” said Khan. Jitender, a resident of Delhi who also visited the fort on Wednesday, said he was disappointed since there were no tour guides. “It took a while to reach the fort since there were many traffic diversions. Entry is not being allowed from all gates. There were no signboards to inform visitors about the same,” he said. Abhishek Babu (22), a student from Andhra Pradesh, visited Humayun’s Tomb along with his family of five on Wednesday. Though he was not aware of the reopening, he was glad that the family’s efforts didn’t go in vain. “My family enjoyed the experience since we stepped out together after a long time. While there were no crowds, announcements regarding Covid protocols should be made,” said Babu. At Humayun’s Tomb, visitors could only book tickets online and no physical tickets were being issued. Tickets could be purchased from the counters at Red Fort. The lack of information regarding issue of tickets miffed some people. “The online system here is not working well and physical tickets are much more expensive. We saw the tomb from outside and decided to pay another visit on some other day,” said a visitor at Humayun’s Tomb.While the overall footfall remained low for the first day, shopkeepers in and around the vicinity of monuments were relieved. Arvind Jain (60), who owns a souvenir shop inside Red Fort premises, said that something was better than nothing. “We have not earned anything since January. There were no sales today (Wednesday) as well. Tourism needs a push from the government for people to return. Many people are also confused about the ticketing system. Not everyone can purchase online tickets. There are no signboards. People from outside are not able to figure out if the fort is open or not. These issues need to be resolved,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhis-monuments-receive-few-visitors-on-day-1-of-reopening-101623868152820.html

The Kaushambi township has an estimated population of about 20,000 and it is adjacent to a high pollution area surrounded by Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area, ISBT Kaushambi, and ISBT Anand Vihar. “We have written to all the 22 high-rises to convert their diesel-based generators to cleaner CNG fuel and also to raise the height of the chimneys which should be over the rooftop. These issues cause noise and air pollution. The high-rises have been asked to prepare a work plan and send it to us within 15 days,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB. “The chimney height should be 2-3 metres above the rooftop from the nearest building. The DG set should be sound-proof and should not be generating noise. The Central Pollution Control Board is also trying to come up with guidelines for retro-fitting options for DG sets. If the guidelines come in the meantime, the residents will have option for retrofitting as well,” he said. The communications also apprised the high-rises that operation of the DG sets is not allowed during the Graded Response Action Plan, except for essential services. “Many high-rises also use DG sets for non-essential services which is not proper. In view of the requirement of residents during the GRAP period and also during the pandemic when many people work from home, it would be proper to convert the diesel-based gensets to CNG fuel,” Sharma added. The communications served to high-rises also mention a petition which is in the Supreme Court. Kaushambi Apartment RWA (Karwa), the apex body of Kaushambi high-rises, is contesting the petition against several agencies for providing residents with a clean environment. Karwa moved the National Green Tribunal in 2015 with the petition and later moved the Supreme Court in September 2020 against the polluted surroundings near Kushambi. “Our 22 high-rises will be responding to the communications sent by the UPPCB and all are in support to curb air pollution in and around Kaushambi. However, converting the DG sets to CNG and raising the height of the chimneys requires a huge investment of about ₹40-45 lakh and the RWAs have no such funds available with them. In such a case, we asks the government to provide us 90% subsidy,” said VK Mittal, president of Karwa. He further said that when the township was constructed in 1980s by the Ghaziabad Development Authority, the DG sets (250 KVA each) were also handed over to RWAs. “The height of the chimneys goes to a maximum of about five metres (up to two storeys) while most of the buildings are up to 13 storeys. Since the norms have changed over years, it will be a tough task to raise the height of chimneys. We have an average consumption of about 150-200 litres of diesel per day due to power cuts,” Mittal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/to-curb-air-pollution-uppcb-asks-kaushambi-high-rises-to-comply-with-dg-set-norms-101623868152179.html

Many students were confused if they had downloaded the wrong paper,” she said.Khatana said she pointed out the issue to her teachers. “Our teachers too didn’t know about it till we pointed it out to them. They said they will look into the matter. I have done my undergraduate degree from DU but this has never happened that we have received the same paper,” she said.The 100-mark question paper had six questions, of which students had to attempt any four. All the questions were exactly the same as the one in the question paper for the Law of Contract examination in December 2020.University officials condemned the incident and demanded an inquiry into the same. J L Gupta, a member of Delhi University Court and a former executive council member, said, “This is a complete lapse on the part of the examination branch as either the paper has not been moderated or the moderation committee has failed to discharge its duty judiciously.” Gupta has demanded that an inquiry committee be instituted to probe the “grave lapse causing utter confusion among students.”Dean (examinations) DS Rawat said the matter has not been brought to his attention so far. “We have not received any complaints in this matter so far. I will talk to the Faculty of Law dean and an appropriate decision will be taken on the basis of it.” When questioned on the possibility of conducting the paper again, Rawat said, “If there is a mix-up, we will take appropriate decision at the university level.” Despite calls and messages, the Dean of Faculty of Law did not comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dus-law-faculty-question-paper-repeated-officials-call-for-probe-101623868031492.html

Last year, the government had announced that students of classes 11 and 12 in Delhi government schools would get the seed money to develop and execute their projects.Reviewing the projects on Wednesday, Sisodia said, “..It is a matter of pride that all these projects have earned profits. Divine Creations project sold madhubhani paintings and earned a profit of ₹3,100. Similarly, a project called ‘Mobisite’, led by eight Delhi government school students, sold two refurbished phones worth ₹3,500 each and earned a profit of ₹570.”The education minister also said that mentors from DTU played a significant role in “streamlining projects of students and building their confidence.” Speaking to the mentors, Sisodia said, “We began with piloting this field project and despite several hurdles caused by Covid-19, our children and mentors have made these projects into successful enterprises.” The education department will also hold a one-day exhibition to exhibit the projects of students along with DTU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sisodia-reviews-7-entrepreneurial-projects-by-govt-school-students-101623867971481.html

The Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, justified the move, since a similar committee was constituted weeks ahead of the city administration’s order, on the directions of the Supreme Court.Addressing a digital press briefing, Sisodia said the Delhi government on May 27 issued an order setting up its own six-member committee to assess every Covid-19 deaths that took place due to a scarcity of oxygen and approve compensation of up to ₹5 lakh for their families. The committee comprised five doctors from Delhi government hospitals and one member from the state director general of health services’ office.“As all of you know, there was an oxygen crunch during the previous Covid-19 wave in Delhi. Oxygen supply was diverted to other places [states]. There were also some deaths due to the lack of oxygen supply in the city. Following the court’s directive, the Delhi government constituted a committee of health experts to look into the incidents and ascertain what led to these deaths. It is extremely saddening that the central government has dismissed this committee. I don’t understand why the central government has an issue with this,” he said. Central government spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.Delhi struggled with a severe shortage of medical oxygen during a crippling fourth Covid-19 wave between April and May, forcing the Supreme Court to step in and order the Centre to ensure the Capital’s oxygen requirements were met.Sisodia on Wednesday also accused the Centre of regularly interfering with state governments, and preventing them from doing “good work”. “As a responsible government, the Delhi government wants to offer compensation of up to ₹5 lakh to the families of those who died and investigate and confirm what led to these deaths. The central government is not letting this happen. Why does it like to obstruct any good step taken or work being done by the state governments? This is not just about Delhi. Many other states including West Bengal, Maharashtra, and Jharkhand are facing different kinds of obstructions from the Centre,” he said. “This decision to dismiss the committee is unreasonable and has no logic. I appeal to the Centre to stop their childish practices. The people of Delhi want the government they elected to work without any obstructions, but the Centre has continued to act as an obstruction to the rights of the people,” he said. The Delhi unit of the BJP accused Sisodia of “dirty politics” over compensation for families of Covid-19 patients who “died due to the negligence of the Delhi government.” “The Supreme Court of India already formed a committee with regards to oxygen deaths compensation on May 6, 2021, comprising Dr Randeep Guleria (director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi), Dr Sandeep Budhiraja (director, Max Healthcare) and one joint secretary-level officer each from the Centre and Delhi government. This Supreme Court committee was working for 10 days when the Delhi government jumped in to form a separate committee on May 27,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.The BJP instead appealed to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Sisodia to focus on preparing for a potential third wave of Covid-19 and augmenting health infrastructure accordingly. “Today (Wednesday), in light of the fact that a high powered four-member committee with the Delhi government’s representation is working on the matter, the city administration has been asked to disband its committee,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/centre-dismissed-the-delhi-govt-s-panel-to-audit-oxygen-deaths-sisodia-101623867853401.html

Satara witnessed 915 new cases, while Pune which included Pimpri Chinchwad recorded 1,186 cases.There were 2,23,509 tests done on Wednesday, while the number of recoveries was 10,567.There are currently 136,661 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 17,820 patients followed by Mumbai with 17,782 active patients.The death toll in the state stands at 115,390. Pune leads with 15,744 deaths, followed by Mumbai with 15,227.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor, government of Maharashtra on Covid-19 management, cites various factors for the rise. “The authorities are not able to effectively implement the mechanism to contain the virus. The pace of vaccination has also been very slow. In addition, we saw the virus arriving late there and hopefully, in the coming days, the cases will be contained and the downward trend will start,” said Dr Salunkhe. He said that though the cases in Pune city has been contained, the problem is in the outskirts of the city.Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary-general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild blamed the negligent behaviour of the people in those regions for the surge of cases. “We have seen the people in these districts hardly wearing masks or observing social distance. In addition, the current mutant of the virus is very lethal and spreading rapidly,” said Gilada.Meanwhile, on Wednesday Mumbai clocked 821 new Covid-19 cases with 11 deaths. The total number of cases in Mumbai reached 717,172 with 15,227 deaths to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-10-107-new-cases-4-districts-continue-to-log-high-numbers-101623867731991.html
16-06-2021||Mumbai||Third Covid-19 wave could see double the infections of second, projects Maharashtra||Maharashtra, which reported over four million Covid-19 cases in the second wave, could see double the cases in a possible third wave of infections, stated a presentation made by the state health department to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday. The cases could double due to the new Delta plus variant of Covid-19, it said. The health department has also projected that the state’s active cases could go up to 800,000, while infants and children could amount to around 10% of the total cases. However, state Covid-19 task force members said that the mathematical projections in the first two waves of Covid-19 infections have not been accurate. The task force also said that Delta plus variant may not play a major role, adding that vaccinating the susceptible population is the key to take the sting out of the third wave.Thackeray, on Wednesday, held a meeting with senior bureaucrats, health department officials, and members of the state Covid task force over the preparation for the third wave, which could hit between August or September. Thackeray directed officials to prepare for the possible third wave by ramping up hospital infrastructure, beds, medical equipment, and liquid medical oxygen.A statement from the chief minister’s office said, “Compared to the first wave, the number of cases doubled in a smaller period. With the threat of the Delta plus variant, the number of cases could double in the third wave again. In the first wave, the state had 1.9 million, while the second wave saw over 4 million cases. In a presentation made by the health department, the number of active cases could go up to 800,000 and of the total cases [in the third wave], around 10% cases could be among children.”The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has further mutated to form the Delta plus or ‘AY.1’ variant. The B.1.617.2 strain or the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 was identified as one of the main drivers of the second wave of Covid-19 infections that devastated parts of India, including Maharashtra, earlier this year.The task force also said that a large chunk of the population needs to be inoculated to reduce the impact of the third wave. Task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said, “The faster we are able to shrink the susceptible through vaccination, lesser will be the impact of the third wave… We cannot be complacent; we need to go ahead with aggressive testing and saturate at least 70% of the population with vaccination. If the Government of India can provide 1 crore vaccines a day in the next three months, we should be able to target [inoculating] 10 lakh people per day. We will be able to vaccinate a large population of 12 crore in the state.” The state Covid task force members in the meeting suggested that serosurvey should be carried out in all the districts to find out the susceptible population versus exposed population. Dr Joshi said that talk of delta plus variant hitting hard is “premature”. He said that the virulence part of the delta strain has not been well documented so far. “Delta plus variant is epiphenomenon as every variant has some sub-types. So, that does not worry us much,” he said. He also said that the projections should not worry the people as most mathematical models have failed to predict Covid-19 wave. “All projections are dependent on models, up till now, none of the models have been able to make reasonable predictions… Virus does not follow any mathematics. One should not get scared with such models,” he said.Globally, third wave of covid-19 infections have hit after a gap of eight to 12 weeks between the second and third wave. State health department is anticipating that the third wave could hit by August or September. The task force members believe that next wave of infections could hit the unexposed population and in areas where vaccination in poor, as opposed to being a wave hitting the minor population of the state. “We believe that it may not be a paediatric wave, but it may be a wave [impacting] the less exposed population, which could be in the lower socio-economic strata, like an urban slum, where the vaccination is poor. Wherever there is vaccine hesitancy or poor vaccination, there is a likelihood of the wave to occur... In this [third] wave, we anticipate that the number of hospitalisations, critical cases and deaths will reduce dramatically as a large population will be vaccinated,” Dr Joshi said after the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/third-covid-19-wave-could-see-double-the-infections-of-second-projects-maharashtra-101623867731408.html

They want the honorarium to be increased up to ₹18,000.State Asha Workers Action Committee president MA Patil held a meeting with the state health minister Rajesh Tope and reiterated the demands. “We asked the state government to hike the honorarium. The health minister too admitted that the demand made by us is reasonable and expressed sympathy to the hardship being faced by Asha workers. But also said that they are not in a position to increase burden owing to the financial crisis,” Patil said.It was the second meeting with the health minister in the last three days. The first meeting was held on Monday. “We want a sum as remuneration which will help Asha workers to survive at least as they are working for eight hours a day,” he stressed.Asha workers are considered the backbone of the rural healthcare system in the state. They have been playing a significant role in the state’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.“The health minister didn’t even assure to consider the demands or offer any proposal,” Patil said, adding that they want the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to intervene and get them justice.Asha workers are on indefinite strike since Tuesday.Asha or Accredited Social Health Activist was formed under the National Rural Health Mission to provide every village in the country with a trained female community health activist.

TMC, however, claimed that it is impossible to get a certificate without getting vaccinated and said that they will probe the matter. Sudhakar Ratnakar, a resident of Sawarkar Nagar, has drafted a letter to the civic body regarding the same. He has also alleged that the vaccinator at the centre claimed that he will have to pay a fine of ₹500 if he does not get vaccinated. Prasad Ratnakar, his son said, “My father went to Wadia Hospital along with one of his friend who had an appointment with a doctor there. While waiting, he casually went to the vaccination kiosk to enquire about the availability of the vaccine. The person at the booth asked him if he carried any documents. My father had a photo of his Pan card on his mobile, which he gave it to the person.” The employee then asked Ratnakar to go and get vaccinated as there was no crowd at the centre. Prasad said, “My father, however, had accompanied a friend and did not want to get vaccinated at the moment. The vaccinator then claimed that he will have to pay a fine of ₹500 if he does not get the jab immediately. In the evening, he received a message and a certificate that he took his first dose. We have written a letter to the civic body to inquire the matter.” Ratnakar is now worried about getting his first dose of the vaccine as the application has already has updated his vaccine status. Vaijayanti Deogekar, health officer, TMC said, “We got the letter today. I have asked the medical officer at the centre to inquire into the incident.” Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, however, claimed that there could not be any mix-up. “There is no way that a certificate will be uploaded on the portal, without the person being vaccinated. There is some misunderstanding by the resident, as we upload the details only after vaccination. However, we will conduct an inquiry into his allegations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/went-to-ask-about-vax-got-cert-sans-jab-alleges-thane-man-101623867611396.html
16-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body sends notice to housing society for vax drive details||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday sent a notice to Hiranandani Heritage, Kandivli, seeking detailed information about the vaccination drive conducted on their premises on May 30 for internal inquiry. Preliminary investigation has also shown that the housing society didn’t sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with any hospital before the drive, which is in violation of the civic body’s rule. “Through social media, we got to know about the incident where residents alleged that they did not receive vaccination certificates. Also, there are claims that of the 390 beneficiaries, not a single person developed minor side effects such as fever or body ache after being administered the jab. So, we need to know the nitty-gritty of the drive for our own investigation,” said Sanjay Kurhade, assistant municipal commissioner of R-South ward.When asked how vials were procured for the vaccination drive and logged into the centralised CoWIN app with the login details of employees of other hospitals, he said, “We can’t comment until we get the details. We have also written to the police who are already investigating the matter,” he added. Later, the BMC in a statement announced that they will submit the report of their internal inquiry on the incident within 48 hours. The civic body also urged citizens to follow guidelines while conducting vaccination drive, and to check ID cards of coordinators visiting their societies from other hospitals or vaccination centres. “In addition to signing an MoU with the concerned private vaccination centre for immunisation, the identity card of the employees who have come for immunisation from the centre should also be verified. Beneficiaries should be urged to get digital certificates immediately after vaccination,” read the statement. BMC urged the public to inform the health officer from their ward if they observe any suspicious matter. The Kandivli beneficiaries have received vaccination certificates in the names of Nanavati Max Super Speciality and Lifeline Hospitals along with the civic-run NESCO jumbo centre, Goregaon who weren’t involved in the vaccination drive. So, the civic body has asked for the vaccination certificates received by the beneficiaries for cross-verification.However, around 120 beneficiaries are yet to receive the certificates. “Since the time we have raised the issue about the dubious role in the vaccination drive, the remaining beneficiaries have stopped receiving messages about their pending certificates,” said Hitesh Patel, a resident of the society. Society has violated BMC’s ruleIn May, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) issued detailed guidelines permitting housing societies and workplaces (private) to tie up with private hospitals/ Covid vaccination centres (CVC) to hold vaccination drives on their premises. So, on May 30, Hiranandani Heritage held a vaccination drive for the residents. As alleged, a person named Mahendra Singh who claimed to be associated with Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Andheri promised to conduct the drive in association with the hospital. But primary investigation into the “spurious” vaccination drive revealed that the society didn’t sign an MoU with the hospital. Also, in violation of BMC rules, the society didn’t even inform the Local Health Authority (LHA) and the ward officer. “It is mandatory to sign a MoU with the hospital and inform the local health officers. But in this case, they haven’t done anything. So, we didn’t even know about the vaccination drive that was conducted on May 30,” said Vishwas Shankarwar, deputy municipal commissioner (DMC).As alleged by the residents, the vaccinators and coordinators didn’t register them on the centralised Co-WIN portal on the day of inoculation. This also stands as a violation of the guidelines of BMC.“The vaccination centres need to have nodal officers who are responsible for checking all the required documents. They are responsible for registering the beneficiaries on the Co-WIN portal on the day of vaccination. However, now we are being informed that these beneficiaries were registered on the portal after 7-8 days of vaccination,” he added.BMC has allowed private hospitals to vaccinate in society premises to ease the rush at vaccination centres. But public health officers said this kind of unauthorised vaccination drives can prove fatal if a beneficiary develops any Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) after vaccination. “We have clearly stated in the guideline that private societies will be treated as sub-vaccination sites and it should be linked to a nearby health facility for the management of AEFI,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC.Following the incident, BMC has also decided to spread awareness among citizens on rules to hold vaccination in private societies. “Societies need to be aware of the guidelines before going ahead with the vaccination drive,” said Shankarwar.‘Vaccinators were called from another hospital’A few residents of the society claim that on the day of vaccination, the accusers got vaccinators from a private hospital in Charkop. Later, when they visited the hospital, they saw those staffers who were present at the society as vaccinators and coordinators on May 30.“When the two hospitals (Nanavati and Lifeline) informed us that they didn’t send vials or vaccinators to your society, we visited the Charkop hospital for inquiry and saw the staffers. But when we asked the officers at the hospital, they also refused their involvement in the drive,” said Patel. Despite repeated calls and messages, the founder of the hospital didn’t respond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-sends-notice-to-housing-society-for-vax-drive-details-101623867552030.html
16-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC junks plan to purchase vaccine directly as Centre announces free vax for all||As the Central government has announced the distribution of free Covid for all above 18 years of age group, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to junk its plan of purchasing vaccine directly from the manufacturers in the international market or domestically.According to BMC officials, considering the Central government is giving free vaccines, it will not be financially sound for the civic body to spend money and procure vaccine doses. Earlier, the BMC had floated global tenders and was also in talks with Dr Reddy’s laboratory for procurement of the Russian Sputnik vaccine.The BMC had invited a global expression of interest (EoI) on May 12 for the procurement of 10 million Covid vaccines directly from the international market. Followed by this, it extended the application window twice on May 18 and May 25 for a week. On June 1, 2021, the BMC closed the application window stating that it had received nine proposals, of which eight were for supplying Sputnik and one company had offered to supply any approved vaccine. However, on June 4, the BMC announced cancelling the bidding process considering none of those who had shown interest submitted documents to prove their connection with the manufacturer.Following this, BMC had said that based on its discussion with Dr Reddy’s Laboratory who is sole distribution rights for the Russian Sputnik vaccine in India, the firm has agreed to supply Sputnik vaccine on an experimental basis by the end of June 2021. But three days later on June 7, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that vaccines will be given for free to all above the age of 18 years.Hence, the BMC has now decided to not procure vaccines directly. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “The Central government has announced that vaccines will be given for free and in this case, even if we procure, there might be an audit query that why did we buy vaccines when we were going to get free vaccines from the government. Hence, we have decided to not procure vaccines from the market directly.”Chahal added, “In a way, I think it was better we did not have to qualify anyone for the global bids that we had floated. This is because if we would have shortlisted suppliers from that tender, we would have ended up spending around ₹1,000 crore. So, in a way, I feel we have saved ₹1,000 crore. However, we will help private hospitals in the city get the Sputnik vaccine. We will aim to conduct aggressive vaccination in the city once there is appropriate availability.”Meanwhile, on Wednesday 68,565 citizens were vaccinated in the city. Overall, in the city 4,256,312 citizens have been vaccinated since January 16, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-junks-plan-to-purchase-vaccine-directly-as-centre-announces-free-vax-for-all-101623867491938.html

Besides, 18-45 years age group was also needed to book their slot online for vaccination.In cluster model, the entire district which had approximate population of 40 lakh would be divided into clusters and each cluster will cover a population of 20,000 people.One booth will be set up for 200 persons in each cluster and team deputed on each booth will approach families to administer vaccines.Dr Gautam said, “We are hopeful that by adopting this cluster model teams would be able to reach all families in their respective booth areas”.Under this cluster model vaccines would be administered to people of 18 plus age group and there would be no need of booking slot for vaccination.Dr Gautam said that no compulsion of slot booking would benefit rural population who has no access to internet.Against the target of 7,44,572 ( age 45 plus) only 4,19,549 people had taken vaccines which is 56.3 percent of the target and only 7,0187 persons had taken booster dose which is only 16.7 percent of the target.In age group 18-45 years 1,71,836 persons had taken jabs between May 1 to June 15 against the target of 2,09,800 which is 81.9% of the target and only 17,124 have been administered booster dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/meerut-to-adopt-cluster-model-to-achieve-vaccination-target-101623866836678.html

16-06-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad to start with ‘cluster vaccination’ pilot project from June 21||The Ghaziabad health department will launch a pilot cluster vaccination project at two locations for all adults from June 21.The project will see the district testing its preparations ahead of the planned mass vaccination campaign from July 1 when every district in the state will be required to vaccinate 1 million people daily. Central to the pilot project will be the door-to-door awareness campaign at the clusters in two areas - Indirapuram (urban) and Bhojpur block (rural). Each area will have a number of clusters made of a number of urban residential wards and rural villages. “The cluster mobilisation teams will start its awareness drive three days prior to the pilot. They will work to remove people’s doubts about the vaccine and encourage them to come forward to get the jabs. From June 21, two teams will be assigned a central location at each cluster like community halls or any similar place for the vaccination drive,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.As per the Cowin portal figures till 6pm on Wednesday, the district vaccinated 785638 beneficiaries of which 672697 were given first dose while 112941 were also provided second dose. The district health department‘s data available till June 15 read that over 75% of these were from urban segments. From January 16 when the drive began, the district has clocked 5,168 vaccinations a day. About 60% of the district’s 4.7 million people are adults.“In rural areas, a cluster may have three or four neighbouring villages, while in urban segments we decided that several of adjacent residential wards will form a cluster. The vaccination teams will continue to work at the cluster locations till the population in the selected cluster is saturated with vaccination. People need not register through Co-WIN,” Dr Gupta said.The UP government, in its June 14 order that spelt out the mass vaccination drive, said that vaccination centres needed to be ‘near-to-home’. It also said that the vaccination teams may stay for four to six days in a cluster before moving on. If anyone is left out, the vaccination teams will visit the cluster again, it said.“Use of hybrid model should be taken up in urban segments where beneficiaries will also be encouraged to register and take up vaccination at static vaccination booths while urban slums may be subjected to cluster vaccination. Workplace vaccination and near-to-home approach should also be used widely at such places,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-to-start-with-cluster-vaccination-pilot-project-from-june-21-101623866773331.html

The move comes nearly 10 days after the Gautam Budh Nagar administration announced to lift the partial Covid curfew as the district had recorded below 600 active cases on June 7.The Okhla Bird Sanctuary (OBS) and Surajpur reserve forest were closed on April 17 — second time due to the pandemic since March last year. The OBS and Surajpur forest were earlier closed from March 2020 to September 15, 2020. “We have decided to open the OBS and Surajpur reserve forest for tourists and birders from Thursday as the number of active cases has continued to drop. The entry will be allowed with masks and we expect the visitors to maintain social distancing,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer (DFO), GB Nagar. He said that the department’s focus is to enhance facilities at the OBS, including providing cycles and installing a water ATM, while the space for a parking lot is being worked out with the department concerned.“A water ATM will be made functional by next week. Two new bio-toilets will be constructed and we have also issued tender to repair the bamboo bridge towards the first watch tower. Besides, we are working on procurement of 20 cycles through a state government agency. The cycles are likely to arrive in the sanctuary by the next month. For the parking, we have identified an area near first gate of OBS that is enough to park over 150 vehicles. Talks are on with the department concerned that holds the land,” added Srivastava.The Okhla sanctuary is home to about 350 species of birds. The sanctuary is spread over an area of 400 hectares, of which about 60% is water body and attracts a number of migratory birds during winters and passage migrants during summers. The migratory birds start arriving in the sanctuary in October, while their strength reaches the peak in December.

16-06-2021||Noida||FASTag on Yamuna Expressway likely to start from today||Thousands of commuters are likely to have the facility of paying the toll on the 165km Yamuna Expressway via FASTag from Thursday as the toll operator, Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL), has completed all formalities to make the facility operational. The implementation will take place after multiple delays in the past few months. Earlier it was supposed to start on April 1.The electronic toll collection system has already been implemented on all national highways, which are maintained by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). But, unlike the national highways in the country, the Yamuna Expressway is managed by a private operator, JIL, which had not been using FASTag for collecting toll payments from commuters. Since the toll collection was manual, commuters were facing inconvenience and long queues on the expressway. “We have put in place all required infrastructure on the expressway so that we can start charging toll via FASTags. Now the process to integrate the Yamuna Expressway with rest of the national highways system is underway. If all is completed as planned, then toll collection via FASTag will start on Thursday, hopefully,” said Ashok Khera, vice-president, JIL.The JIL had started installation of cameras and other equipment on the expressway after the Yauma Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) received complaints from commuters that JIL is yet to install safety features as recommended by a safety audit. The Yeida had repeatedly warned the toll operator that it should either install FASTag at the earliest or face action.“We had wanted the operator to start toll collection via FASTag at the earliest because a safety audit conducted following the orders from the Supreme Court had suggested so. The toll collection via FASTag will provide huge relief to thousands of commuters, who have to face inconvenience in paying toll manually unlike the other national highways. We hope now since all formalities related to the installation of censors and cameras are over, FASTag will start working,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida.The NHAI has recently issued guidelines for toll plazas with FASTag facility which will not allow queues longer than 100 metres from the toll gates. The new guidelines aim to reduce time taken to process toll fees to just 10 seconds per vehicle, even during peak hours. The rules also say that in case a queue gets longer than 100 metres, the vehicles at the front of the queue will be allowed to pass the toll gate without having to pay toll charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/fastag-on-yamuna-expressway-likely-to-start-from-today-101623866594062.html

16-06-2021||Lucknow||Ruling party, govt start showcasing unity ahead of UP polls||When state BJP chief Swatantra Dev addressed ministers of the Yogi government on Monday about the party’s outreach plan at Lok Bhawan in the presence of the CM, it was to many within the BJP, yet another indication that the party and the government had begun making visible moves to showcase unity ahead of the 2022 UP polls. During his unprecedented three-day feedback sessions in Lucknow that ended June 2, BJP general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh had in his one-to-one meetings with UP ministers and party functionaries, stressed on the need for putting up a united front ahead of the assembly elections. Thus, the presence of state BJP chief at the chief minister’s office, one where the two leaders jointly tasked the ministers with the exercise of camping in villages and blocks under their charge, connecting with cadres and collecting feedback of government schemes has its own significance, a party leader said. A day after this joint meeting, the state government on Tuesday asked all departments to provide list of vacancies especially in boards and corporations. “The party and the government are expected to jointly decide accommodating party cadres to these bodies— yet another example of the government opening to the need of adjusting cadres and keeping them in good humour,” a BJP leader said who described the exercise as “satta aur sangthan ka samanvay (coordination between the party and the government)”. The collective show assumes important as before the assembly elections, the BJP also faces the task of doing well in the indirect leg of the panchayat polls. After having seen the opposition Samajwadi Party do better in direct elections to the 3,050 zila panchayat ward members, the BJP, having stood second, is now looking to even the score in the indirect round of polls where elected zila panchayat ward members would vote for the 75 zila panchayat chairpersons. The BJP has been busy patting its own back claiming as compared to 2015, it had vastly improved its performance in the zila panchayat ward members’ elections. “We reduced the dominance of the Samajwadi Party that used to sweep these polls earlier,” said Swatantra Dev. “We will win majority in these rural polls for zila panchayat chairpersons and then get a majority in the UP assembly polls too,” said deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya who was also present during the Tuesday’s briefing by chief minister and state BJP chief. “It has been jointly decided that ministers and party functionaries would undertake joint or simultaneous tours of the state, connecting with the masses and popularising government initiatives,” a BJP leader said. “While party chief Swatantra ji has already started visiting homes of the cadres who died of Covid-19, UP general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal is fine tuning the party’s—seva hi sangathan—the mega outreach initiative, which that has already been rolled out and which gathered steam after BL Santhosh’s feedback sessions,” said the BJP leader.

16-06-2021||Lucknow||BJP, SP wooing each other’s lawmakers ahead of zila panchayat chairpersons’ polls in Uttar Pradesh||Eager to use the July 3 zila panchayat chairpersons’ elections to make a strong statement ahead of the 2022 UP assembly polls, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) have begun winning over each other’s lawmakers. Earlier this month, former BJP MLA Dilip Verma crossed over to the Samajwadi Party (SP) in Bahraich from where his wife Madhuri is currently a sitting BJP MLA. The BJP didn’t do well in the direct leg of the panchayat elections for 3050 zila panchayat ward members’ posts, falling behind the Samajwadi Party. The scene was no different in Bahraich where the BJP trailed behind the SP. The BJP responded by approaching the “estranged” SP MLA from Sirsaganj in Firozabad, Hari Om Singh Yadav, a relative of SP patron Mulayam Singh Yadav to seek his support for the zila panchayat chairperson’s post. Hari Om Yadav’s wife and son are zila panchayat ward members and BJP vice- president Daya Shankar Singh and local MP Chandrasen Jadaun, who visited the SP MLA, said they have been assured of support. The SP has already started declaring its list of zila panchayat chairpersons though the BJP, a touch circumspect, has only just concluded consultations with ministers and lawmakers as well as senior party functionaries about the possible claimants for the post. “Meetings have taken place on these elections at the highest level right up to the level of the chief minister. Ministers and lawmakers in whose regions the party-backed candidates didn’t do well in the zila panchayat ward level elections would obviously want to make amends by helping the party win the zila panchayat chairpersons’ post,” a BJP leader said. Independent candidates are much sought after in these elections and BJP leaders admit that a majority of them are in touch with them. On its part, the BJP has been claiming that it reduced the SP’s clout in these rural polls. “A party that used to win thousands of panchayat wards has to rest content with a few hundred ward wins this time. We would now soon see how the SP fares in the elections to the zila panchayat chairpersons’ posts,” said UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev. “These elections were always known to go with the ruling party. Now that the BJP has tested which way the wind is blowing, they are coming up with explanations,” said SP leader IP Singh. An SP delegation also met senior officials in Lucknow to complain that the SP cadres were being targeted. Beyond such posturing, political observers say the rural polls will impact the assembly elections. “The BSP leadership expelled its two top leaders who were known to enjoy the confidence of party chief Mayawati on the grounds that they didn’t cooperate with the party in the zila panchayat ward level polls. The BJP and SP are wooing each other’s lawmakers. Defections are common in an election year, but these rural polls have added an interesting new dimension to the poll battle,” said veteran journalist Irshad Ilmi. “Newer political players in UP like AAP (Aam Aadmi Party) and AIMIM (All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen) and newer political combinations like Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha have also used these elections to test themselves ahead of the big battle,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-sp-wooing-each-other-s-lawmakers-ahead-of-zila-panchayat-chairpersons-polls-in-uttar-pradesh-101623864491963.html

According to the police, the driver of the bus claimed brake failure as the cause of the collision.The incident took place when the bus was descending the MDI flyover around 4.45pm on Tuesday.“The bus collided with an electrical pole head-on and as a result, the front half of the bus was damaged in the incident. A two-wheeler rider and pillion rider, and an autorickshaw driver, also got injured in the incident as their vehicles came in the path of the speeding bus,” a police official said.The driver of the bus, on realising that the brake had failed, alerted the passengers, asked them to move to the back of the vehicle and hold on to the seat in front, the police said. “The driver, in the interim, tried to find a spot where he could collide with an object and stop it from moving further. The driver intentionally collided with the electric police to stop it. A motorcycle and autorickshaw travelling on the side of the bus also got hit when the bus driver suddenly turned towards the direction of the electric pole,” said the police official cited above.No case has been registered in the incident.“The motorcyclist was severely injured in the accident and was taken to Medanta Hospital for treatment. He is still not in a fit condition to give a statement. Depending on his response, we will register an FIR in the matter. Besides the motorcyclist, the conductor of the bus suffered severe injuries. However, he was discharged after first aid. The remaining suffered minor injuries in comparison,” said inspector Sudhir Kumar, the station house officer of Sector 17/18 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/12-passengers-injured-as-driver-rams-faridabad-bound-bus-into-pole-due-to-brake-failure-101623864132540.html
16-06-2021||Gurugram||Waterlogging-prone spots on MCG’s radar||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram is creating a database of waterlogging spots by roping in residents to report details of such spots through a web hyperlink. Officials said the initiative, a first in which residents have been included in monsoon preparedness, will help them execute remedial measures to mitigate waterlogging this monsoon season and subsequently, carry out large-scale measures for a long-term solution.The hyperlink — http://bit.ly/report-water-logging — is being circulated by the MCG on social media platforms and also pinned to the home page of its website, www.mcg.gov.in. By clicking the hyperlink, residents can report the location of the waterlogging, the extent of it, average duration, type of waterlogging, causes, and possible solutions, along with their basic details, on a web document and submit to the civic body for perusal.All such details will be based on the observation of residents over the last three years, said officials.“Besides the basic details, residents will have to list key details, such as the depth of water stagnation, ranging from less than a foot to more than five feet. Similarly, they will also have to list out the type of water stagnation, such as rainwater, greywater, sewer overflow, industrial waste, or any other type of stagnation. For time duration, residents can report about waterlogging ranging from less than an hour to more than a week,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.The official cited above said that the rationale behind the move is to deal with the waterlogging crisis at a micro-level.“Waterlogging has been a persistent problem in Gurugram, especially over the past decade. Instead of tackling it in isolation, MCG wants to solve it on a citywide scale. Hence, support from residents has been sought,” said Chahat Sanghvi, consultant to the MCG commissioner.The development evoked mixed reactions among residents.Sandeep Kumar, a resident of Sector 10, said that the MCG already has various social media platforms on which complaints are not being addressed. “I have seen various complaints on MCG’s Twitter and Facebook pages going unanswered while even in the ones that are acknowledged, the user who had uploaded the original complaint posts a fresh complaint regarding inaction. As the MCG has failed on this repeatedly, this new move of asking residents to report waterlogging is also likely to be a futile exercise,” said Kumar.Harshit Shukla, a resident of Sector 50, said that there are many areas in his sector where waterlogging takes place. He said that often, residents are unaware of ways to approach the MCG and the civic body’s move to seek help from them will address this missing link. “There are several parts across the sector where waterlogging occurs. Usually, rainwater stagnates there for one to two hours. By the time residents manage to contact MCG and officials come for inspection, the rainwater recedes. Through the online document, we can list details of such points and prompt MCG to take action,” said Shukla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/waterloggingprone-spots-on-mcg-s-radar-101623864133084.html

Officials said that the decision has been taken based on a state government directive as the Covid-19 wave has waned across the state. At the district level, 10 coronavirus infections were reported in the last 24 hours, taking the active case count to 314.The chief medical officer for Gurugram, Dr Virender Yadav, on Wednesday issued an order directing all private hospitals, urban primary health centres and government hospitals to start elective surgeries, including eye, ENT and dental works, with immediate effect. Hospitals have been asked to strictly observe safety protocols of mask discipline, social distancing and sanitisation.“Dental surgeries have been put on halt since last year. It will be resumed after a long time as daily cases of coronavirus infection are on a constant decline. Hospitals will have to ensure basic precautionary norms are followed to avoid transmission of infection in case of heavy footfall,” said Yadav.Elective surgeries were suspended in the last week of March when the district started reporting a surge in daily new cases of Covid-19. As new cases started declining since the beginning of May, hospitals, earlier this week, were allowed to start routine outpatient departments (OPDs) under different medical departments.To prevent the spread of infection, hospitals are continuing with tele-consultation and are issuing slots to patients for visiting hospitals based on urgency.Dr Anjali Kaul, medical superintendent of Artemis Hospitals in Sector 51, said, “With Covid-19 active cases going down, the hospital has started OPDs, and now is the time to resume elective surgeries. All the patients planned for surgeries are screened, appropriately evaluated for Covid-19 status. We are also following the no visitors’ policy so that hospital is less crowded.”Dr Ritu Garg, zonal director, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said, “There are many patients who have been waiting to undergo their planned surgeries and it is very important to get it done now, without any delay, to prevent further disease progression. At the hospital, we are ensuring all safety protocols for patients and their attendants.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-cases-down-elective-surgeries-resume-in-gurugram-hospitals-101623864131217.html

Residents gathered in large numbers at the house of the deceased and pelted stones at the police, following which 100 people were booked for disturbing the law and order situation, the police said.The police also registered a case against a property dealer who had fraudulently sold a plot to the 70-year-old man. His 36-year-old son, who works as a security guard, told the police that the family was living in the village for the past 14 years and his father had bought the land from a property dealer about 15 years ago.The 70-year-old man had recently completed the construction of his house by investing around ₹3 lakh. However, last week, the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of about 10,000 houses in the area as they encroach on the Aravalli forest area.“The property dealer had sold the land to my father saying that the ownership of this land would remain his and there would be no problem. When my father came to know that his house would also be demolished, he committed suicide,” the son told the police.The Faridabad police, in a statement on Wednesday, said, “On the above complaint, police station Surajkund has started an investigation by registering a case against the property dealer. The property dealer selling government land to gullible people will be traced and arrested.”Anshu Singla, the deputy commissioner of police (NIT), appealed to people to maintain law and order. “The police is continuously working to identify all accused and arrest them at the earliest. We appeal to residents to maintain law and order; legal action will be taken against those trying to disturb the situation,” said Singla.On Monday, the Faridabad district magistrate released an order prohibiting the gathering of five or more persons “within a radius of 200 metres of village Khori” fearing heavy protest by occupants and the possibility of unrest.Locals in the area said that the 70-year-old man used to run a grocery shop, but had not opened his shop in the past week.Ravindra Prasad, a 48-year-old resident of Khori and a neighbour of the 70-year-old man, said, “We all knew him as he had a small shop and we would purchase items regularly. He had been tense since last week, when the Supreme Court ordered all our houses to be demolished. He kept worrying about his children and where they would live as he had spent all his money to build the house and did not have the financial strength to rent another room.”Residents of the area said that the man’s wife had also died around five months ago, due to health issues.Residents of Khori village had been protesting since last week, seeking rehabilitation, after the SC ordered the eviction of slum dwellers encroaching on the Aravalli forest area in the Faridabad district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/khori-village-70-year-old-kills-self-ahead-of-demolition-drive-situation-tense-101623864073178.html
16-06-2021||Gurugram||Khori residents: We are living in constant fear||Sitting under the shade of a tree, braving the heat with makeshift hand fans and listening to a local god-man, residents of Khori village in Faridabad on Wednesday were trying to keep their mind off the impending demolition of their houses built illegally on Aravalli land. The residents do not know the date of the demolition but wake up with the fear of eviction every day as electricity and water supply have already been discontinued. Meenakshi, a 43-year-old resident who earns a living by tailoring after her husband lost his job due to the lockdown, said, “With my little savings I was finally able to build a house with a proper roof. I also did a house warming ceremony on June 6 and the very next day, I learnt that all houses in this village will be demolished. I have no money left and there is hardly any work. There is a constant fear that the house will get demolished.” On June 7, the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of houses encroaching on the Aravalli forest area in Faridabad district, holding that “there cannot be a compromise or concession on forest land”. Since then, residents have been demanding temporary rehabilitation, but haven’t received any response from the authorities. The news of a suicide on Wednesday morning turned the mood darker, with many residents saying they have no other option as they cannot afford to live elsewhere. They said that water tankers are also not being allowed to enter. Shabana, a 35-year-old mother of three, while returning from a neighbour’s house where she went to take bath, said, “Today (Wednesday), there was one suicide in the village; in the coming days, there might be more. Our houses will be demolished, but we are already living in unliveable conditions as there is no water supply. Whatever water was stored in my house for the past three days, that is over now. What do I give my children for drinking and how will I cook meals for them?” Families with pregnant women and infants said that they are unable to look for houses elsewhere due to the impending demolition drive. Umesh Kumar, a 35-year-old autorickshaw driver, whose wife is due for delivery in 10 days, said, “For the past two months, I was not able to earn anything because of the lockdown, and now that the situation has improved, I cannot go out to work leaving my wife and two other children behind. If I am here while they come to demolish our house, I will be able to do something to help them, but if it happens when I am away, we don’t know what will happen.” During a visit by HT on Wednesday, some villagers were seen shifting their valuables to other places, either rented accommodations or to their relatives’ houses in nearby areas. Locals said that almost half of the residents have shifted their valuables to other places, but will continue to live in Khori. Shifting a small fridge, bed, cooler and cupboard with documents, a man with a family of eight, said, “I am taking these to my sister’s house in Tughlakabad. But, we will stay here only, as there is not enough space for all of us to live there.” Women from the village also said that people have sold iron doors of their houses to earn money for survival. Many families were seen selling off old almirahs, coolers and auto parts to scrap dealers to get money for making alternative living arrangements. Meanwhile, officials said that they have not received any orders from the administration regarding providing rehabilitation to the residents. Pankaj Kumar, the subdivisional magistrate of Badhkal, which comprises Khori, said, “We have not received any order from the administration regarding rehabilitation, but residents have been given more time to vacate the area. I will also look into the matter of tankers not being allowed inside the village as water is important.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/khori-residents-we-are-living-in-constant-fear-101623864072073.html

Today, we are selling at the lowest possible rates and rates of real estate are bound to increase in the near future due to steep hike in construction material cost like cement, steel, copper, aluminium and PYC. Accordingly, we want the stamp duty reduction scheme to restart in Maharashtra and input tax credit in GST. Faster clearance of sanctions will also help us optimise our cost and timelines. If the projects are approved as soon as possible, we can have some control over the timing and alternative cost of completing the projects. The government should also look into the issue.”“On the one hand, the prices of steel and cement required for construction are steadily rising, while on the other hand, the number of consumers is declining. In such a situation, the central government should intervene and control the prices of steel and cement,” Satish Magar, national chairman, Credai said.Harsh Vardhan Patodia, president, Credai national said, “Based on the report of this survey, we request the government to infuse urgent financial stimulus and initiate quick progressive measures to assist recovery, one-time restructuring of loans and 6 months extension of completion date by Rera, stamp duty reduction or waiver, moratorium extension on principal & interest for 6 months, and freezing of SMA classification for another year. We are hopeful that the government will consider our appeal and will make urgent interventions this time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/credai-president-effects-of-second-covid-wave-trickling-onto-economy-101623863471260.html

The former speaker and MLA from Srimadhopur (Sikar) denied reports that MLAs are bargaining for posts in the cabinet, boards and corporations.“It is absolutely not a bargain for position or power. It is a question of pride, respect and honour of the party workers who have fought for the party for years.

These MLAs have said that the chief minister Ashok Gehlot has not given them their due. On Tuesday, MLAs who defected from the Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) to Congress said that it was they who saved the Congress government in Rajasthan and should be considered for their contribution rather than the Pilot camp who threatened to abandon the government.Sachin Pilot on several occasions have denied reports of a rift between the chief minister and him and said that the Congress remains united in Rajasthan and is set to form the next government in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/pilot-loyalist-cong-mla-no-one-bargaining-for-posts-only-asking-what-s-due-101623862547928.html

None of the aid has reached us as of now.” Last year, the then Ghatshila SDO provided a gas stove and an LPG cylinder to the family when the entire district administration came down to the village. Besides, the family also got the ₹10 lakh compensation from the state government, while Ganesh’s mother Kapra Hansda has been getting his pension from the Indian Army. “But my 67-year-old father Subda Hansda is still not getting old-age pension. We just want to lead our life with self-respect,” said Dinesh.A Jamshedpur-based NGO Sampoorna Manavta Kalyan Sangh (SMKS) convenor Sanjay Giri said they planned to set up a statue of Ganesh Hansda at Bansda chowk. “Governor Draupadi Murmu gave her consent to unveil it on Wednesday, but it has been postponed due to Covid-19 restrictions. We will hold a massive programme with 10,000 people to unveil the statue after two months when situation improves. The Governor has also agreed to our proposal,” said Giri. Meanwhile, Congress national spokesperson Dr Ajoy Kumar wrote to CM Hemant Soren, requesting him to fulfil the promises of a government job, land and petrol pump to families of Ganesh Hansda and another slain soldier Kundan Kant Ojha of Sahibganj district.“Both were sole bread earners of their families. The state government has given ₹10 lakh compensation, but Covid-19 pandemic delayed the process of government job and five acres of agricultural land. I hope the Jharkhand CM will also write to the Government of India for petrol pumps for the national heroes from Jharkhand,” said Dr Ajoy.Former Baheragora MLA and BJP state spokesperson Kunal Sarangi blasted the state government for failing to honour it’s promises. “Leave aside, government job, land or petrol pump, Ganesh Hansda’s elderly father Subda Hansda is not getting old-age pension. The state government has forgotten all its promises,” said Sarangi. Shourya Chakra winner Md Javed and Sainik Parishad, local JMM MLA Samir Mohanty also paid their respects to the slain soldier on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-year-after-galwan-clash-slain-soldier-s-family-awaits-power-gas-connection-101623861611724.html

16-06-2021||Ranchi||‘Restriction on buses hitting farm job prospects of migrant workers’||Restriction on bus transportation is now impacting farm job prospects of migrant workers during the ongoing kharif sowing season, as they are facing problem in returning to their villages, food activists have alleged.The state trade body, Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FJCCI), has also demanded to permit bus services in the state, as it claimed that non-operation of buses was causing huge loss in trade activities.“Migrant workers, who work at construction sites, brick kilns and other temporary projects in cities and outside the state, return to their villages during this period to participate in farming in a bid to ensure food security for their families. Due to restriction on bus transportation, these workers are stuck and struggling to return their villages,” said Ashrfi Nand Prasad, a member of Right to Food Campaign (RFC).This comes even as the state government recently on Tuesday announced a slew of relaxations in the weeklong Covid-19 lockdown from Thursday. It allowed malls, departmental stores, government and private offices to open till 4pm. However, restrictions on bus transportation remain in place, as per the government order.Meanwhile, the monsoon season has set in well in Jharkhand. Farmers have started sowing process of kharif crops in backdrop of excessive rainfall across the state.Raju Oraon (32), who worked at a construction site in Ranchi for past six months, wants to return to his home at Balumath in Latehar district,but is due to non operation of buses. “The construction work has slowed down due to rainy season. Usually, we go back to our village in this period to participate in family farming. But, I am stuck here due to the lockdown,” he said.Lakhs of migrant workers returned to Jharkhand in April and May this year, following lockdown imposed across the country in wake of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. However, food activists have claimed that many were still stuck outside state and different cities of Jharkhand.Prasad said, “We request the government to allow atleast interdistrict bus service or arrange transportation for such workers. The state control room can be used for the service. This is a crucial period for rural migrant workers.”Meanwhile, FJCCI demanded that bus transportation and restaurants be placed under relaxation category. “Like airways and railways, bus transportation also has significant role in boosting the economy. Local traders are impacted in absence of bus service. Buses are the most preferred service of local people. We demand the government to start at least interdistrict bus service with 50% sitting capacity,” said FJCCI general secretary Rahul Maroo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/restriction-on-buses-hitting-farm-job-prospects-of-migrant-workers-101623861554054.html

On June 5, two girl inmates aged 16 and 17 had escaped from the children’s home run by an NGO called Mother Teresa Welfare Trust (MTWT) and were later rescued by the police. They had then levelled serious charges of rampant sexual abuse at the shelter.Jamshedpur city superintendent of police Subhash Chandra Jat said a special team led by assistant superintendent of police Kumar Gaurav arrested MTWT director Harpal Singh Thapar (46), his wife Pushpa Rani Tirkey (45), warden Geeta Kaur (45) and her son Aditya Singh (20) with the help of Singrauli police on Tuesday. Tirkey was also the chairperson of the East Singhbhum district child welfare committee. They were all booked under various sections of the Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and the Indian Penal Code on June 6.“The four of the five named accused have been absconding since June 7 and the team led by ASP Kumar Gaurav tracked them down through their cellphone locations with the help of Singrauli police. They were brought here this morning on transit remand and sent to jail after Covid-19 test,” said Jat, adding that raids are on to nab the fifth accused, Tony David.The city SP said the investigation has found charges of sexual, physical, and psychological exploitation of the two rescued girl inmates and further probe is on to find out “how many more victims were there in the shelter home, actual number of total inmates, how such crimes were suppressed and how girl inmates were used to implicate people in fake cases”.Jat added that two such allegations levelled by a Mango (a Jamshedpur suburb) resident and the wife of a panchayat member are being investigated.Earlier, the two rescued girls had given details about the abuse of other inmates at the children’s home in recorded statements on video. Then on June 11, two more girls went missing from the MTWT home at the time of shifting 41 inmates from there to another children’s home in Patamda.Meanwhile, the Jharkhand government has cancelled the registration of MTWT (not in any way linked to the Missionaries of Charity of Mother Teresa) and terminated the appointment of Tirkey as CWC chief with immediate effect, said D K Saxena, member secretary of Jharkhand State Child Protection Society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/four-of-5-accused-in-sexual-abuse-of-girl-at-jamshedpur-shelter-home-arrested-101623861553217.html

The team of vaccinators completed inoculation of 4,676 people above 18 years of age on Tuesday. Those vaccinated comprise 54% of the population of the panchayat, which has an estimated population of 10,182, said officials. Of those vaccinated, 2,133 were in the 18-45 years of age group and the remaining 2,543 above 45 years of age. It took the team over two months to saturate the panchayat after having launched the vaccination drive on April 10. Bihar has as many as 8,406 panchayats, which are a cluster of villages. The vaccinators had to brave initial vaccine hesitancy, as only 70 people turned up for vaccination on April 18. The highest number of vaccinations recorded in a day was on June 12, when 2,187 people were inoculated. The increased vaccination on June 12 was also attributed to better availability of vaccines in the district. “We received a communication from the East Champaran district magistrate that all the available eligible population of Bijbani South panchayat had been vaccinated. This was the first such communication received from any of the 38 districts in Bihar. There are some other panchayats in the pipeline where 80%-90% vaccination of the target population has been vaccinated,” said a senior official in the health department. East Champaran district magistrate Shirsat Kapil Ashok said that barring children and some migrant workers, the available eligible 18-plus population had been vaccinated against Covid-19. “The vaccination drive at Bijbani was taken up on an experimental basis, on the pattern of Swachch Bharat and open defecation free campaign. For the first time, we involved the panchayati raj institutions by engaging their local representatives like the sarpanch, the mukhiya, even the past sarpanch and mukhiya and village elders. They came forward to motivate the masses. There were also issues with booking vaccination slots, where we stepped in to help the villagers before the facility of on-spot registration was extended to all categories of people,” he said. Ashok said the mini milestone would hopefully now set off a healthy competition among panchayats.“During the mega drive today, we exhausted the available dose of 34,000 vaccine shots by 12 noon. If we were given 1 lakh doses, we may have even achieved that,” added Ashok. Vaccination driveBihar was on course on Wednesday to surpass its highest single-day vaccination figure of 3.64 lakh inoculations in mid-April. Though it had achieved 3,53,606 vaccinations, as per the provisional vaccination figures, released for the day by the state health department, officials said the number would increase when the final figures are reconciled later in the evening. As many as 3.05 lakh beneficiaries in the 18-45 years age group and 47,860 above 45 years of age had taken the shot on Wednesday, as per the provisional figures. Around 6,000 vaccination sites, both static and mobile, were set up across the state on Wednesday, the highest so far in a day since the Covid-19 vaccination campaign was launched o January 16. Bihar received 11 lakh doses of vaccines on Tuesday and had decided a mega vaccination drive on Wednesday. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has asked his officers to complete the vaccination of 6 crore people, still to get the shots, in the next six months.

16-06-2021||Patna||Gold hallmarking becomes mandatory in 13 districts of Bihar||The new hallmarking policy has become effective in 13 districts of the state, including Patna, from Wednesday. According to the guidelines issued on June 15 by the Ministry Of Consumer Affairs, Food And Public Distribution, hallmarking will be made mandatory only at the places having hallmarking centres. In Bihar, only 13 districts, including Patna, Bhagalpur, Bhojpur, Darbhanga, Gaya, Muzaffarpur, Nalanda, Rohtas, Samastipur, Saran Begusarai and Nawada, have the hallmarking centres. While Patna has 12 such centres, the remaining 12 districts have one centre each. Under the new policy, hallmarking of jewellery is now mandatory. On June 15, the Ministry announced that the policy would be effective only in 256 districts having hallmarking centres across the country. “It has offered great relief to the thousands of jewellers who needed the hallmarking facility. They were worried about how to get their jewellery hallmarked during the pandemic,” Ashok Verma, the state convener of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said. Besides, the new policy has come up with a much-needed relief to the small traders also. “Most of these small budget traders get jewellery on loan from big traders for business. They do not use hallmarking while many small traders have not even registered themselves with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS),” he said. Out of over two lakh jewellers in the state, which includes 7,000 in the state capital, only 1,000 jewellers have registered with the BIS. “The rest of the jewellers have been doing it without the licence. They were mainly worried about how to cope up with the requirements of the new hallmarking policy. Under the new hallmarking scheme of the BIS, jewellers would register for selling hallmarked jewellery,” he said. However, traders with turnover below ₹40 lakh have been spared even from this mandatory registration with the BIS, he added. Premnath Gupta, the All India Jewellers and Goldsmiths Federation (AIJGF) secretary, said the new policy is far more beneficial for the buyers. “There will guarantee of quality and purity of the precious metal at every gold shop. This facility is essential for those gold buyers who prefer to purchase gold from the jewellers who have been close to their families, he added. “There’s no chance of any tampering as the small traders will get only hallmarked precious metals from the wholesale dealers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/gold-hallmarking-becomes-mandatory-in-13-districts-of-bihar-101623861491810.html

As per the new mechanism, which got the state cabinet’s nod on Tuesday, each ward member would be getting a monthly incentive of ₹5,000 for running and maintaining the water supply installations. This is beside the grant ₹2,000, which the ward members would get for payment of electricity bill and carry out routine repair of the water stations. Panchayati raj minister Samrat Chaudhary said,“The department would offer extra financial help to the ward members for expansion of the supply network in rural areas on the recommendations of the respective ward management committee upon proper verification.” Additional chief secretary (panchayati raj), Amrit Lal Meena, said the department resorted to a new mechanism to ensure proper running of water supply schemes in rural areas following complaints of irregularities in their operations. “Now, the ward members would be given the responsibility to run and maintain the water supply operation so that they are accessible to villagers,” said Meena. Explaining the modalities for funding, the minister said ward members, who would be given the responsibility to run the supply system, would be authorised to collect water tax of ₹30 from each household per month. “Half of the total water tax collection would be given to the ward members as remuneration, beside monthly honorarium of ₹2000 per month,” said Chaudhary. As per the existing norms, each water supply system is supposed to cater to nearly 200 households. Hence each ward member collect ₹6000 from the water consumers every month. “Of the total sum, 50% would be given to the local panchayati raj institutions, while the rest would be given to the ward members,” said the minister, adding that the department had allocated nearly ₹1.40 lakh as annual expenditure on running each supply system, carry out repairs and pay the electricity charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ward-members-to-run-rural-water-supply-system-101623861491150.html

All vehicles will be directed to take Bangra ghat bridge route, which is located about eight kilometres downstream, to cross the river. The decision to suspend vehicular traffic on Sattarghat bridge was taken in view of the last year’s disaster, in which approach road to the newly constructed bridge was washed away due to heavy current in the river. Additional chief secretary (road construction) Amrit Lal Meena said it had been decided to demolish parts of the approach road to Sattarghat main bridge in the length of 800 metres to give smooth passage of water in Gandak.“About 4.25 lakh cusecs of water was released in the river from Valmikinagar barrage on Wednesday. The approach road to small bridges was damaged last year in the similar kind of flooding,” said Meena, adding that traffic would be restored once the flow normalises. Meena said that a detailed project report (DPR) to build additional bridges, as recommended by the expert committee last year, were being prepared. “The work on additional three bridges in approach road would start after the rainy season,” he said. Around 4,000 vehicles cross the river through the two-lane Sattarghat bridge daily.

The current numerical model indicates a high probability of intense lightning till June 18.”“All open fields, rivers, waterlogged areas, litchi and mango orchards are vulnerable to lightning strikes. In such circumstances, both the direct and indirect strikes of lightning can prove fatal and cause loss of lives and property,” Shankar cautioned.Vivek Sinha, director at Patna Meteorological Centre, said, “The geographical location of Bihar and Jharkhand is prone to lightning and thunderstorm activities, which claim around 150 to 400 lives in Bihar annually. Last year, over 459 lightning deaths were registered in the state.”Deliberating weather forecast, meteorologist Uday Shankar Sinha said, “Widespread rain accompanied with thunderstorm is likely in the state for next three to four days.

For every ten women who got the jab in the district, the data shows 12 men have got the vaccine. Multiple reasons, including illiteracy and lack of awareness of even the lower decision-making capacity among women may make them less accessible to the vaccine, according to experts. The skewed ratio between men and women beneficiaries is almost the same across the state and the country with fewer women as compared to men getting protection against the deadly virus despite the fact that it is equally fatal for all genders. As of Wednesday evening, over 28 lakh people have got the vaccine as per the Co-WIN app, of which over 1.581 million are men and 1.311 million are women. Hence, about 10 women for 12 men. Multiple data also show that more men have been infected and even fatalities among men have been higher than women. However, when it comes to vaccination, it is essential that all beneficiaries get the jab. As per the 2011 census, the district’s sex ration dropped from 919 female for every 1,000 men to 915 women for every 1,000 men. In 2011, Pune had a population of 9,429,408 of which male and female were 4,924,105 and 4,505,303 respectively. The skewed sex ratio could also reflect on the gender disparity. Multiple factors especially in rural areas could have caused this, including vaccine hesitancy over myths about menstruation or fertility and added illiteracy makes it difficult to create awareness. Women also have less accessibility, mobility and also decision-making powers compared to men and this comparison is more stark in rural areas. Digital illiteracy among more women makes it difficult for them to get registered or book a slot on the Co-WIN platform, especially for the younger population aged between 18-45 years who would get the jab only upon online slot booking, the experts added. The vax beneficiary count For every 10 women who got the vaccine, 12 men got it in Pune district. As of Wednesday, Co-WIN portal shows that in the district the total number of men and women who received the vaccine Men: 1,579,675 Female: 1,310,549||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/gender-parity-in-vax-for-every-10-women-12-men-got-the-jab-in-pune-district-101623860951047.html

The state’s politicians, including some rebels within the ruling Congress, have sought the scrapping of the PPAs The state’s power utility, Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), is bearing the burden of fixed charges payable to the IPPs, even without using the power generated. Ultimately, this amount is recovered from consumers through hike in tariff. On June 10, the Punjab State Electricity Board Engineers Association (PSEBEA) held a meeting with the PSPCL management and emphasised the need for cancellation of PPAs with the three private power producers. Three directors from the PSPCL, RP Pandov; Jatinder Goel and Gopal Sharma, attended the meeting with PSEBEA president Jasvir Singh Dhiman and seven of his office-bearers. According to the minutes of the meeting released on June 15, the management has asked the association to submit a detailed proposal for revision of the PPAs with at least one private power plant. The PSPCL management also assured that it will look into the matter. In its recent letter to the Punjab government, however, the PSPCL has said that the termination of PPAs would lead to severe power crisis in the state. The utility also claimed that it would not be able to meet the peak demand of 13,000 MW during the paddy season.In 2006, Punjab decided to have two private sector thermal plants of 1,000 MW capacity each, with coal allocation from the Pachhwara coal mine in Jharkhand. After a change of regime in 2007, the proposed capacity was enhanced, based on peak demand and round the clock supply to farmers. This ignored Central Electricity Authority (CEA) guidelines that state that the installed capacity has to be based on average predicted demand (base-load). The result has been high fixed cost. An average consumer in the state has, thus, been burdened with an expense of at least ₹1,000 per year. This has also meant that the PSPCL has been paying ₹1,500 crore a year starting 2019-2020 towards fixed cost against surrendered power.The PPAs also stipulate that the PSPCL has to pay fixed charges for three years (around ₹10,000 crore or ₹275 crore per month), if it terminates the contract. “The peak power demand of 13,000 MW during paddy season is only for a month. This cannot be an excuse for not cancelling or renegotiating these contracts to PSPCL’s advantage,” said an engineer, not wanting to be named. He added that after the peak season, power demand reduces to a 6,000 MW.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/power-engineers-join-chorus-against-ppas-pspcl-seeks-detailed-plan-of-action-101623860231918.html

Neither has a government job been given to a member of the family, nor has the sepoy’s niece been admitted to an army school. The family, however, has been given ₹50 lakh compensation. A memorial, a playground and a library in his name have all been buried in government files, with nothing on ground. The local government school has been named after him, but it has not been upgraded to Class 12. Gurbinder was recruited in the army in 2018, after passing Class 12. He was unmarried, but had been engaged eight months ago, when he visited the village. He is survived by his parents and two elder siblings, a brother and a sister. The family spent the entire Wednesday in mourning to remembers his sacrifice, but no political leader or administration official joined. “A year has passed, but we have not received any government job. A gate, library and stadium named after him was promised,” said Gurpreet Singh, Gurbinder’s brother.Jasmeen Kaur, Gurbinder’s niece, said Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had made a video call to family members and assured them that she will get admission in an army school, but nothing had happened. “I am proud of my uncle and wish to join the army as an officer, but we are not getting support from the government,” said Jasmeen, a Class-9 student. Sunam sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Manjit Kaur said, “We are following up on Gurbinder Singh’s case. I will look into the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-year-on-galwan-braveheart-s-kin-wait-for-govt-to-keep-its-word-101623859691704.html

The medical body will be wearing black bands and displaying placards to sensitise the public as part of protest against attacks on doctors, on June 18. However, medical services will be functional on that day. IMA doctors are demanding a strict provision to address the rising violence against doctors and Covid insurance cover for private doctors. Dr BL Deshmukh, IMA president for Pune chapter, said, “We demand that the government should ensure that the offenders are penalised under the Central Hospital and Health Care Professionals Protection Act with Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Also, there should be standardisation and augmentation of security in each hospital. Hospitals should be declared as a protected zone. Culprits shall be punished by fast-track courts.” “All health services will be functional as our motive is to spread awareness about the issue and pressurise the government to take action to ensure that medical workers are safe,” said Dr Deshmukh. Dr Meenakshi Deshpande, president-elect of IMA Pune chapter, said, “Multiple incidents of assault against doctors are seen across the country. While the cost of medicines and medical equipment saw a gradual rise over time, doctors’ fees remained the same throughout the pandemic. Families should not forget that we save lives and work round the clock.” Dr Sunil Ingale, secretary, IMA Pune chapter, said that IMA teams will be visiting government hospitals on June 18. On Covid insurance, Dr Avinash Bhondwe, former IMA president Maharashtra chapter, said that till November 2020, around 42 doctors have died due to the virus in Maharashtra. “We meet Maharashtra government officials to ensure that their families get the insurance cover of ₹50 lakh. However, it was denied as the scheme only covered government doctors. After regular follow-ups, families of two doctors got the insurance amount from the government. The authorities have not shared details of families of government doctors who received insurance.” Bhondwe said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ima-to-hold-protest-against-assault-on-doctors-101623859510988.html

According to the resident, the SRA had committed that the work for the new building which will house them will be completed in 18 months but the construction is incomplete and has not progressed. Fed up with the callous attitude of the civic body, the residents staged a protest outside the project on Monday condemning the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) for playing fraud and levelling cheating allegations against the administration. The residents are currently staying in another make shift location where they are being paid ₹3,000 per family. However, residents alleged that the prevailing rent of ₹5,000 to ₹6,000 in the area was making living difficult for them every day with rising inflation amidst Covid-19 crisis. Meanwhile, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) has maintained that a meeting will be held with the developer seeking an early resolution to the dispute. The families in their complaint alleged that Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) officials were not positively responding to their problem and false promises of development at the earliest and completion of the project had been made to them. Social worker Rahul Bhosale said that the project has been put in the cold storage and no work has progressed except the incomplete foundation work. “The families are facing severe financial issues and they must be given ₹5,000 instead of the current ₹3,000 to meet their daily expenses and livelihood. Regular meeting between the residents, builder and SRA authorities for convenience of every and the project should be completed at the earliest,” he said. Housewife Chayya Adsul said, “The current rental of ₹3,000 is very less and living costs have gone up due Covid-19 crisis. Our family members have lost their jobs due to the ongoing crisis and the source of earnings has been lost. We cannot sustain any longer. We request the authorities to carry out the project completion work at the earliest,” she said. The residents have threatened to go on hunger strike if their demands are not met. Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) chief Rajendra Nimbalkar said, “The residents are only protesting and not meeting me along with the developer for their problem which can be sorted out. There was no deadline project for completion of the project and some projects take even 20 years to complete. If these people come to us, then I can understand their problem in a better way and a solution be found out. We have many ongoing projects and a meeting can be arranged. Due to Covid-19 crisis, developers are facing financial issues and projects are stopped. I will hold a common meeting and their problem can be sorted. If the builder is not ready, then we can take over the project. Government has also directed us to lenience and labour issues are there due to Covid-19 crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/126-displaced-families-protest-against-slum-rehabilitation-authority-101623856152013.html
16-06-2021||Pune||PMC uncertain on financial assistance distribution for students||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is uncertain on the disbursement of financial assistance for the year-2020-21 to students of Classes 10 and 12 as the state government has decided not to conduct a board exam due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. PMC’s social development department provides financial assistance of ₹15,000 each for students with distinction in Class 10 and ₹25,000 for distinction in Class 12 under the Abul Kalam Azad and Lokshahir Annabhu Sathe schemes. Under this scheme, a student must have obtained a minimum 80 per cent in SSC or HSC examination in the year February-March-2020-21 and if a student belongs to Backward Category (BC) or studied in PMC regular/night school, he /she is required to have obtained minimum 70 per cent. For 40 per cent handicapped students, he or she should require a minimum 65 per cent in SSC and HSC examination. The scheme was introduced in 2009-10 by Shiv sena party corporator and standing committee chairman Shyam Deshpande. The PMC social development department disburses financial assistance to student’s accounts through Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS). Hemant Rasane, chairman, standing committee said, “We will discuss the issue in the meeting as there is no examination of SSC and HSC this year. Our scheme considers student’s marks obtained in percentage. If there is no examination, how can the state board calculate marks and percentage of students? And how can you disburse the amount to students. It is a challenging task for us.” Ramdas Chavan, program officer of social development department said, “We will have to discuss the issue with standing committee and senior officials to take final call because SSC and HSC examination-2020-21 cancelled due to Covid-19 pandemic. Normally, we give financial assistance to students based on the percentage obtained in SSC and HSC examinations.” He further said, “In 2019-20 year, we disbursed around ₹17.50 crore of amounts to 11,500 students under the financial assistant schemes. The number of students was less as compared to the year 2018-19. The number was 13,500 in 2018-19 year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-uncertain-on-financial-assistance-distribution-for-students-101623856030698.html

The Yuvak Kranti Dal, a students’ organisation is spearheading the demand for fee reduction and has collected 5,000 letters of complaints and demands from students and parents across the state concerning the issue.“The condition of students is not at all good. There are students who belong to farmers’ families and they are struggling for their daily bread and butter. Then we have got calls from students whose parents - either both or one - has died of Covid. Some students were working and studying. Most are not able to pay the college fees. Our demand is that state government should immediately consider this sensitive issue which is related to lives of lakhs of students and their families,” said Jambhuvant Manohar, state convenor of the organisation, at a press conference held on Wednesday. “There are various items included in the last year’s college fees - like maintenance charges, laboratory fees, gymkhana fees, computer lab fees, uniform fees, etc. Nothing was used by students last year. Fees should be reduced or some concession needs to be given to students who are not able to pay now. Colleges cannot stop them from appearing for examinations,” said Sachin Pandule, Pune city president of the oranisation. “We are already in talks with the state education director’s office and have sent our demand letter to them. If the college fees are not reduced then we are planning an aggressive state-wide protest,” he added. Dhanraj Mane, director, state higher education department, said, “There is no decision taken yet by the state government over reduction of fees. We are also getting demands from student organisations. Once we get clear orders it will be worked accordingly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yuvak-kranti-dal-claims-it-has-5-000-letters-from-students-wanting-college-fees-reduced-101623852791797.html

On Wednesday, the Pune traffic police declared the entire stretch, from the main entrance of Sarasbaug (Khau Galli road) till the Peshwe Park entrance, a “no parking” area. A Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) parking lot, operated on as a pay and park in the area is now meant to be used instead.The Dattawadi traffic police division had, in February, proposed this no-parking zone to deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Rahul Shrirame. Suggestions and objections from citizens were then invited, before the final order was issued on June 16. There are at least 50 hotels, vendors and games’ parlours on this stretch, popularly known as “Sarsabaug Khau galli”. Hence, this road is often crowded with a traffic jam, especially in the evening. “We had issued a circular to declare this road a no- parking zone in February and had asked for suggestions and objections. There were no major objections. The final order to make this road a no-parking zone has been issued. Citizens have the option of the PMC parking lot near Peshwe park,” said DCP Shrirame. Joggers coming to Sarasbaug are happy with this decision. Suhas Chintal, a senior citizen said, “We come to the park for a walk in the evening and there is any hardly space to walk, as vehicles are parked everywhere. This decision will certainly reduce down traffic jams and allow ambulances or other emergency vehicles to have access from here from now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sarasbaug-khau-galli-road-officially-no-parking-zone-101623852010478.html

Citing an interview given by Sitharaman, he said the finance minister “angrily rebuffed the interviewer and snapped: ‘What dues, I have cleared the GST (Goods and Services Tax) dues of all states’”. “The FM was wrong. The anger was unjustified,” the former Union finance minister said in a statement. Chidambaram said he has gathered data about GST dues from three states which stand at ₹7,393 crore for Punjab as on June 1, 2021, Rs. 7,142 crore for Rajasthan as on May 21 and ₹3,069 crore for Chhattisgarh as on June 1. “I am trying to gather data from other states,” he said. Opposition-ruled states have been at loggerheads with the Centre over GST dues in the past also and have demanded that they be paid at the earliest so that they can keep funding pandemic-related spending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gst-dues-of-punjab-r-sthan-other-states-not-cleared-pc-101623851230541.html

The saplings developed and bore unusual ruby-coloured mangoes. To the couple’s pleasant surprise, the mangoes turned out to be Japanese Miyazaki. Miyazaki mangoes are among the most expensive in the world and sold at ₹2.70 lakh per kilogram in the international market last year, according to the Japanese media reports.Parihar said thieves last year broke into their orchard and stole the mangoes after it became locally known that they have started growing this rare fruit. He said they somehow managed to save the trees. Parihar added they have this year employed four guards and six dogs to guard the rare trees and seven mangoes, which are rarely grown in India and are also known as an egg of the sun.Parihar said he was on his way to Chennai to buy some saplings when he met a man on a train, who offered him what later turned out to be Miyazaki. “He offered these saplings to me and asked to take care of these plants like our babies. We planted in the orchard without knowing what variety of mangoes it will produce.” He added last year when the saplings started bearing fruits, they found them to be very different. “As I did not know the name of this variety, I named the fruit after my mother Damini. Later, we researched about this variety and found the real name. But it is still Damini for me.”Rani said mango cultivators and fruit lovers were contacting them and a businessman has offered ₹21,000 for a mango. “...a jeweller from Mumbai is ready to pay whatever price we quote. But I have clearly said that we will not sell it to anyone. We will use the fruits to grow more plants,” said Rani Parihar.Madhya Pradesh horticulture department joint director RS Katara said he has inspected the orchard and found the fruit is rare in India. “It is costly because its production is very low, and its taste is very sweet. It looks very different. People abroad give these mangoes as gifts.” He said they will check the fruit again before promoting it among the farmers.G S Kaushal, a former director of Madhya Pradesh’s horticulture department, said after Noor Jahan variety of mangoes of Afghanistan, this Japanese mango has been hitting headlines due to cost not due to taste. “I asked some local scientists to go and inspect the tree and fruits to know whether it is a real one or a hybrid one and why it is so expensive,” said Kaushal. “People should grow it only after scientists approve the quality of this mango.”Jabalpur’s Jawaharlal Nehru Agriculture University scientists were planning to study the mangoes, said its registrar Rewa Singh Sisodia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-couple-hires-guards-to-protect-rare-expensive-miyazaki-mangoes-101623850211132.html

At least 40 Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha workers have been detained by the police.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday had said that the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust in Ayodhya should clarify regarding the allegations levelled against them. He also said that he spoke to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Sanjay Singh, who had originally levelled allegations of corruption and said that he found the evidence provided by the AAP lawmaker ‘shocking’.“The Trust formed for the construction of the temple should clarify if the allegations are true or false. The temple's 'bhoomipujan' ceremony was also attended by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. They should also speak out,” Raut had said. He also said that the Shiv Sena was always committed to the building of the grand Ram Temple and it was a matter of faith for them as well as the people of the nation. Raut said that the members of the Trust were appointed by the BJP and Shiv Sena should have been made part of the body.Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant called the protests a ‘stunt’. Speaking of the clashes between both parties he said for ‘every action there is a reaction’.Another Sena lawmaker said that the BJP workers were warned against protesting outside the party office. “They came with stones outside our office and you cannot expect us to sit inside. It is wrong to protest outside party offices,” Shiv Sena MLA Sada Sarvankar, who is also a Vibhag Pramukh from the area, said.AAP’s Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh and a former minister in the Samajwadi government, Pawan Pandey claimed that the Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust general secretary Champat Rai purchased a piece of land worth ₹2 crore at an inflated price of ₹18.5 crore for the Ram Temple premises and was aided by member Anil Mishra.(with inputs from Swapnil Rawal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-and-shiv-sena-workers-clash-over-alleged-scam-in-ram-temple-land-purchase-101623849375458.html
16-06-2021||Delhi||Virtual summer camps, a breather for kids and parents||For young parents, being confined at home amid the pandemic has been all about juggling between household chores, office work and managing their time with children. And with the onset of summer break, it has become all the more important to keep the young ones engaged and healthy. Consequently, many parents are enrolling their kids into virtual summer camps. “My eight-year-old son is at a stage where he wants to stay entertained. And sometimes I run out of ideas to keep him busy without the use of screens,” rues Prerna Kishore, a marketing professional from Noida, who has registered her son for art and crafts class online. She adds, “The classes are thrice a week, but it keeps him busy, away from screens, for the rest of the week.”Another parent, Kushal Saluja, an entrepreneur from Delhi, believes that these virtual activity classes also lend a hand in building communication skills. “My 11-year-old daughter makes friends and talks to other kids she hasn’t met before in real life; it contributes to her social skills and peer relationships,” he says.With a goal to not only keep the child busy but also help out fellow parents facing challenges, Bhavya Wadhera, a home baker who runs That Baker Mommy kick-started her virtual cooking classes at pocket-friendly prices. “I found my son always grabbing packaged food when I’d be busy. The concern for his health sparked the idea to do something for kids of his age group (6-12 years),” says Wadhera, whose classes don’t involve the use of stove for the safety of the younger ones. She adds, “The aim is to build their interest in home-cooked meals and keep them motivated.” Apart from developing culinary interests in children, some have introduced simple yet effective arts and crafts activities. Kritika Daksh Mehra, from south Delhi who owns Krafty Kids by Merak is taking part-time art and craft workshop says, “There’s a structured plan wherein the child is both physically and mentally involved and active... Amid the pandemic, kids are turning into lazy screen addicts, so, I wanted to help tackle that.” Switching to online route has also helped these workshop organisers expand their reach. Gurugram-based Devika Kaur Dhingra, who runs Nitco School Of Music & Dance has been conducting dance sessions for the 3.5-11 years age group, says, “My online summer camp experience last year made me realise that virtual classes give the chance to bring together students from all over India as well as international students. The audience is definitely bigger (in online classes), but to ensure individual attention, we try to take limited students per session to be able to fully concentrate. It’s challenging but still a learning experience.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/virtual-summer-camps-a-breather-for-kids-and-parents-101623847580293.html

My father had even spoken to my uncle about these incidents,” he further added. He said that people within the party were not ready for the struggle the party is going through following its founder’s death.Five rebel MPs of the Loktantrik Janata Party - Pashupati Kumar Paras, Prince Raj, Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Kaiser - on June 14 removed Chirag Paswan as the national president of the party. These rebel leaders had claimed that they had ‘saved’ the party.“The appointment of the leader of the House is a parliamentary committee's decision, not sitting MPs. There have been reports that I have been removed as the party's national president. As per party's constitution, the national president can only be removed if they die or resign,” Chirag said.Chirag also said that his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras, Ram Vilas Paswan’s younger brother, had betrayed him. He lamented that Pashupati was a person he looked up to and did not expect to backstab him. “All of this had conspired when I was unwell. I tried to speak to my uncle at that time but I failed. I looked up to my uncle after my father’s demise,” Chirag said.“I felt I was not orphaned after my father’s death but now I am after my uncle did this (to me),” he further added. The LJP leader Raju Tiwari said that these five MPs have been dismissed at the party's national executive meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/wheels-set-in-motion-soon-after-my-father-s-death-chirag-slams-ljp-rebels-101623847095921.html

If such blurring gains traction, democracy would be in peril," the HC bench comprising Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambani said.The bench further noted that protests against governmental and parliamentary actions are legitimate and even though such protests are expected to be peaceful, it is "not uncommon" for them to push the limits permissible in law.

16-06-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka Congress asks BJP to resolve feuds later, focus on helping common man||Ahead of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka Arun Singh’s visit to the state, the Congress on Wednesday alleged that the ruling party was busy resolving internal feuds instead of focusing on helping the people of the country.Singh will hold a meeting with ministers of the Yediyurappa cabinet on Wednesday, according to a PTI report. He will also meet the MLAs of the ruling party and address the state core committee on Friday.“Dear Arun Singh, you are rushing here to hold a ‘Platform Panchayat meeting’ (Katte Panchayat) but don't you have the time to address the grievances of people? From the day one of coming to power, this government has been making news about squabbling and not any achievements,” the Karnataka Congress said in a tweet.Speculations of BS Yediyurappa leaving his chief minister’s post was quashed by the BJP last week when the chief minister thanked the central leadership for reposing their faith in him. Yediyurappa confidently had said that he will continue to be the chief minister till 2023.There has been some speculation that a section of the BJP wants to unseat Yediyurappa but the party is wary of any such move as it feels that it will lead to a backlash from the support base as well as from the chief minister, according to a news report by HT. Experts have also pointed out that any move made in haste without a proper replacement for the veteran leader can cause damage to the party in the state.“There will be a core committee meeting on June 18. It's BJP, we believe in democracy. Central leaders are sending Arun Singh to listen to the leaders here in Karnataka. It's not like Congress where no one listens or asks,” state minister Eshwarappa fired back at the Congress on Wednesday. The Congress alleged that the party should focus on the problems faced by the common man rather than solving internal squabbles among its lawmakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-congress-asks-bjp-to-resolve-feuds-later-focus-on-helping-common-man-101623840858569.html

16-06-2021||Other||Everyone backstabbed me: Sasikala in clip||Chennai: A day after the dual leadership in the AIADMK expelled 16 party members for speaking to their ousted former interim general secretary V K Sasikala, new audio clips emerged on Tuesday where she reveals that everyone back-stabbed her and that she would have picked O Panneerselvam as chief minister before she went to prison in 2017. She also offers an explanation for her decision to step away from politics before elections and her determination to reclaim the party now.Sasikala’s team released nine audio clips of her telephonic conversations with party functionaries from across Tamil Nadu. In all her conversations, Sasikala is contemplative, consoles the cadre and sometimes expresses vexation without naming Edappadi Palaniswami and Panneerselvam. Palaniswami and Panneerselvam who head the party as coordinator and coordinator and in the assembly as leader of opposition and deputy were Sasikala’s loyalists who turned against her at different points. A cadre, Sivanesan from Theni district from where Panneerselvam hails is heard telling her that if he hadn’t resigned, he could have brought her out and only the two of them can save the party now. To this Sasikala responded, “At that time, he left on his own. If not I would have seated him on the chair before leaving.”Her statement is unexpected as at that point, Panneerselvam staged a dramatic revolt against Sasikala after he resigned as chief minister to make way for her. Palaniswami was in Sasikala’s camp and hence she picked him before leaving for Bengaluru to surrender to serve her for a four year jail term as a convict in the disproportionate assets case.“Everyone backstabbed me. There is no more space left on my back to be stabbed anymore,” Sasikala tells this cadre. “But how can I be a mute spectator if they do this to cadres also?” In her conversations with other cadres, she even goes on to say that the AIADMK would have won had they been united. “I stepped aside because they said they wouldn’t take me in and they would win,” she says. “So I thought, okay, let’s leave it. Let them do it. Now the cadres are crying to me. How can I be quiet?” She criticised the leadership expelling the cadre a day ago. “The selfishness of one or two people is driving them to expel the cadre and they’re making a scapegoat. That is wrong.” The cadre also complained to Sasikala that the party doesn’t have semblance of its past glory but looks like a caste outfit. This is in reference to Palaniswami’s hold over the party and his nurturing of his community, the Gounders over the Mukkulathor community whom Sasikala had cultivated over the years when late J Jayalalithaa headed the party. Panneerselvam also belongs to the Mukkalathor community.Sasikala told a cadre that after AIADMK returned to power in 2016, Jayalalithaa had shared certain plans with her about the things she wanted to do for poor people. “All that’s in my heart and I will do it,” she says. “I’m very upset about the way they are running the party...People didn’t accept them. Along with Amma I’ve worked so hard for the party. Now there is a necessity for me to save the party and cadre. The time for that has come.”On Monday, the feuding leaders Palaniswami and Panneerselvam united together once again like they did before the elections to keep Sasikala and family away. They released a four page resolution warning party cadre from having any truck with her. Panneerselvam who has softened his stance against Sasikala’s re-entry was elected as deputy legislative leader. Experts say that the dual leadership will continue in the AIADMK. “It is clear that EPS has the majority of supporters in the party and OPS barely has any support. But for now they have a 50% power sharing of the 33% votes,” said political commentator Raveendran Duraisamy. “Panneerselvam will not let that go and neither will want an issue with the party symbol if they split and it freezes. Sasikala has no political capital. She is now a paper tigress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/everyone-backstabbed-me-sasikala-in-clip-101623840189751.html
16-06-2021||Bangalore||No clarity yet on disbursement of ₹1 lakh Covid death relief fund||Bengaluru The BS Yediyurappa-led government is yet to finalise the modalities of the newly announced compensation of ₹1 lakh for the families who have lost their loved ones to Covid-19.Senior officials in the government said that the announcement has just been made but there is still no clarity on who will implement the relief, which political leaders and rights activists say is a case of “putting the cart before the horse” and only for “sake of headlines and publicity”.“It has just been announced and nothing has been worked out yet. The CMs (chief ministers) office will decide which office will implement it and then issue a government order,” said a senior government official, requesting not to be named.Another senior official said that the modalities would not be too difficult to work out since it would require the beneficiary to show their BPL (below poverty line) card and death certificate.The second official cited above said that Karnataka has followed the ICMR death reporting system issued in mid-last year to announce deaths.“We have told very clearly that all Covid deaths have to be covered. Many states, what they are doing, if they are having comorbidities, they are not showing them as Covid deaths,” the official said, requesting not to be named.Yediyurappa on Monday announced that the state government has decided to give ₹1 lakh compensation per family, as a measure to mitigate the hardships due to Covid-19 pandemic.“Several earning members of families have died due to Covid-19 that has caused distress and many of them have come to the streets. Keeping this in mind, we have taken a decision to give ₹1 lakh to those BPL families if anyone has died due to Covid-19, one per family,” Yediyurappa said in Bengaluru on Monday.The compensation, Yediyurappa said, totalled to around ₹250-300 crore and the count of beneficiaries anywhere between 25000-30000.The state government has in total announced over ₹4000 crores worth of financial packages since last year to mitigate the hardships of those affected by the pandemic. But a significant number of these sections are yet to get any relief, adding to doubts if this time will be any different.The state government has at least twice said that they would conduct detailed death audits, but has so far yet to come out with any such report so far.According to official data, over 33,148 persons have died in Karnataka due to Covid-19 since the first death in India was reported in the state on March 11 last year.“The government claims that there are around 30,000 people who have died but the deaths could be double of that. There are those who died without oxygen, people who have died at home. But even going by official government estimates, only 25% are likely to benefit,” Ramalinga Reddy, senior Congress leader and working president of the party, told Hindustan Times.Karnataka has had around five weeks of lockdown-like restrictions which were intensified for nearly a month since the last week of April on account of a surge in new infections and rising deaths.There are over 10 million BPL card holders in the state, Reddy said, and the amount of ₹1 lakh serves as no relief as many of them have paid a lot more as hospital bills for treatment.In May last year, Yediyurappa announced a similar financial package of ₹1,610 crore which, among others, was aimed at providing ₹5,000 each to about 60,000 washermen, 2,30,000 barbers, 7,75,000 auto and taxi drivers among others.However, this time around there has been a sharp decline in the number of beneficiaries too, as per the official statements by the chief minister’s office.For instance, in the case of auto, taxi and maxi cab drivers, a one-time relief of ₹3000 has been announced for 2,10,000 beneficiaries from an estimated 7,75,000 beneficiaries last time around.A senior government official said that last time around the authorities took the entire number of registered persons but were unable to trace them.The problem of identification, registration and quantum of documentation, rights activists said, had already denied even the earlier announced benefits to several sections including domestic help.Geetha Menon from the Domestic Workers Rights Union, which represents over 7,000 people working in this profession, said that not a single member has so far been able to get the relief announced by the government.“The government has made it so difficult even to get this meagre amount,” Menon said.She said that the persons who are in this profession are asked to get certificates not from their employers but different officials, leading to demands for bribes.She said that the excessive documentation demands has led to the activation of the “shadow system” in which political leaders and others approach these workers and demand for ₹200-350 as commission to avail the benefit of ₹2,000.“At one time the Aadhaar was the main assumed ID by the government. Today, you are asked for a BPL card and many of us do not have these cards. Then you are asked for a birth certificate and many of our women do not even know their date of birth,” Menon said.She said that the death compensation is definitely going to impact their members as many of them do not even have BPL cards and it is not the lack of trying but due to bureaucratic hurdles.Other sections, mentioned as beneficiaries like barbers, construction workers and several other professions have people who are not registered with the authorities.Bengaluru, one of the biggest urban centres in the country, attracts migrant workers--blue and white collar--to the city and activists said that these people are entirely left out, leaving much of the so-called relief undisbursed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/no-clarity-yet-on-disbursement-of-rs-1-lakh-covid-death-relief-fund-101623840009881.html
16-06-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s tales: Pune rises from ashes as young Shivaji enters the scene||Shivaji Maharaj’s father, Shahaji Raje, fought the battle of a lone wolf. He dreamed of autonomy and an independent kingdom. His aspiration for independence and the contrasting political situation put him at the centre of conflict in western Deccan.In spite of his loyal service at the Mughal court, an important part of his jahagir was handed over to Fattekhan, the son of Malik Ambar, by the Mughals.Pune, his home jahagir was ransacked by Adilshahi sardars mercilessly. This left Shahaji Raje disillusioned. As he left the Mughal service to return to Nizamshahi, Nizamshahi was breathing its last. And yet, with sheer grit, Shahaji Raje protected Nizamshahi’s underage heir to the throne, against the joint forces of the Mughals and Adilshahi. He made Pemgiri near Sangamne his capital and continued to defend Nizamshahi for the next four years. Around the end of 1636, Nizamshahi rule ended after a bitter struggle and territory was distributed between the Mughals and Adilshahi. Shahaji Raje returned to Adilshahi and was awarded his original jahagir of Pune, Supe and Chakan pargana by Mohammad Adilshah II. However, as retribution of his actions, he was appointed to conduct the Karnataka campaign along with Adilshahi sardar, Ranadulla Khan, this far from his jahagir.As he could not administrate Pune, Shahaji Raje appointed his trusted official Dadoji Konddeo to accompany his elder wife Queen Jijabai and second son, Shivaji Raje, to govern Pune. In addition, Dadoji Konddeo was the Adilshahi subhedar of fort Sinhagad. A cavalry of 1,000 soldiers, was appointed for their assistance. Pune was in no condition to be inhabited in 1637, so Queen Jijabai and Shivaji Raje sought temporary residence at Kasba Khed (Shivapur) near Pune, at Bapuji Mudgal Narhekar Deshpande’s wada. Dadoji Konddeo was assigned the responsibility of training a young Shivaji in statecraft and military prowess. To resurrect Kasba Pune and the entire Mawal region was no easy task. People believed that the land was infested by ghosts and demons and were reluctant to inhabit it. Queen Jijabai and Dadoji Konddeo decided to conduct an auspicious ritual to purify the land. As per prescriptions of the shashtra, a king should sanctify polluted land by tilling it with a gold-tipped plough, yoking healthy bullocks with gold- tipped horns. This symbolic gesture was conducted to bring fertility and productivity back to the land. When this ritual was conducted by Queen Jijabai and Shivaji Maharaj, jahagirdars of Pune, under the guidance of Dadoji Konddeo, it instilled great confidence in the minds of the public. This meant that the Bhosale family would personally protect the locals and guard their land and interests.The Patils, Deshmukhs, Kulkarnis and village workers, assured of their safety, were brought back to Pune,. They were given the responsibility of agricultural development. Special offers were made to farmers and farm workers to cultivate the land. Agriculture taxes were exempted for five years. Dadoji Konddeo adopted Malik Ambar’s taxation model in a staggered manner, to be executed over three years. The entire land had to be inspected and was classified according to productivity. Eventually, one-fourth taxes were levied on agricultural produce. Several fruit orchards were promoted. Loans and discounts were offered to expedite redevelopment of the land. The “gav pandhar” or residential settlements, were newly laid down as per community preferences. The resettlement of Pune would not be possible without assured sources of water. Expansion of Pune as a city (and most medieval towns), has always been a function of water. In order to ensure guaranteed irrigated supply for newly cultivated lands, a dam was built on the old Ambil Odha (stream) which flowed from the south of Pune to the centre, to meet the Mutha river. A dam was built in a ‘C’ shape near Parvati and named “Seri-Parvatiche Dharan”. The dam was primarily for irrigation purposes and it submerged a large area extending from Sanas ground to the present-day Parvati water works. The remnants of the dam wall can still be seen over Ambil Odha today. Before construction of the dam, the Ambil stream was used by the Mahar community to wash animal hides which polluted the clean water. In order to avoid this, the community was awarded a separate space to process animal hides on the western side of Pune at the time. They were also awarded a space to the northeast of Pune behind Kalbhairav temple (present day Maharwada).The old temple of Ganesha, between Shitole wada and Honap Deshpande wada at Kasba peth, was in a terrible state when Queen Jijabai took charge of Pune. It had suffered great damage after the Adilshahi attack on Pune. Vinayak Bhat Thakar, who was in charge of the Ganesha temple during the Nizamshahi, performed the daily service discreetly, not to invite undue attention. Queen Jijabai ordered Dadoji Konddeo to rebuild the Kasba Ganpati temple and reinstated daily worship with great fanfare. The archival documents of the Thakar family inform us of annual grants given by Queen Jijabai. She also reinstated the Tambdi Jogeshwari temple near “Kale wavar”, at the present-day Appa Balwant chowk. The Bendre family was given a grant for the same. Kasba Ganpati and Tambdi Jogeshwari, along with Nava Kalbhairav, were recognised as the three main Gram devatas of Pune city. Dadoji Kondadeo ensured that the wildlife menace was reduced around the settlement by declaring awards for the hunting of wolves and wild boar. He was also responsible for establishing a peth in the village of Pashan, named after Jijabai, as Jijapur. Under Queen Jijabai’s governance and Dadoji Kondadeo’s supervision, Shivaji Maharaj started gaining experience in statecraft and governance. Queen Jijabai actively oversaw the judiciary functions of the pargana. Pune was finally resurrected from the ashes. These fertile grounds became the first cradle of the Maratha kingdom as a young Shivaji Raje walked his first steps on “Punyabhumi”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sutradharas-tales-pune-rises-from-ashes-as-young-shivaji-enters-the-scene-101623839651226.html
16-06-2021||Bangalore||Bangalore Talkies: Infighting in apartment complexes||This tiny virus has taught us many things. The illusion of control that we all thought we had about our lives has now been irrevocably shattered. It has showed us the extent of our own fallibility and how the rivers and animals that we once viewed as sacred and since desecrated with mutate and fight back in ways that we cannot even imagine.Who knew that a potent combination of a wet market along with the Chinese penchant for eating wild things could unleash this beast upon the world.The learnings will continue as the world emerges from the virus. Social distancing has created emotional distances and the mental health issues that will ripple out are hard to know or measure.For me, one of the lessons that this virus has taught is about normalcy. One person’s normal is another person’s outrage. This gets compounded in a residential community that can only enforce norms, not laws. Requests, not rules. In 1620, the French polymath Blaise Pascal said, “People are usually more convinced by reasons they discover themselves than by those found by others.” This applies to norms and rules surrounding this virus?Also Read | Bangalore Talkies: Have you exited a WhatsApp group lately?How has your community dealt with social distancing? Are all of your friends and neighbours on the same page? Not so in my community.Bengaluru in May, 2021 had the dubious distinction of being the top city in terms of active Covid-19 cases. In mid-May, we had close to 600, 000 active cases. As the city administration faltered, most apartment communities had to come up with rules of their own. And this is where the variety of responses to rules was on wide display.Take my own community. With 64 apartments, we are not especially large. During the lockdown imposed by the city government pretty much all through May, the volunteer committee that runs our building complex came up with what they thought of as a fairly sensible rule. They banned maids, drivers and other external service people from entering our community. This, I must add, was the norm in many large gated communities in Bengaluru. What happened was a display of the Indian mindset.Indians, as a rule, hate to be told what to do. This isn’t a uniquely Indian trait. Most people don’t like to be dictated to. The difference is that Indians are very creative and imaginative when it comes to breaking rules. Worse, they think that rules apply to everyone else except them.When maids were banned in our apartment, many of my neighbours who I thought I knew came up with novel ways to circumvent this rule.One spirited the maid into the basement in her car and into her apartment. Another fought with the security guards every morning, heaping abuse on them for preventing her maid from entering.A third announced that she would take responsibility if any person entering her home infected the community. This was the opposite of an idle threat. This was an idle responsibility.There was no way that this lady would take charge of our building in case her maid infected the rest of us. In the 1950s, social psychologist Leon Festinger came up with what he called the “theory of cognitive dissonance.”Humans hate to hold two thoughts that are in conflict with each other. So the household that cannot do without maids does not like to hear from their neighbours that these maids are carriers of infection. Their response – to double down and insist that they are right and the others are overreacting. The same applies to parents in a school, workers in a factory and employees in a company. How to protect a community then?When you have to rely on good faith and social norms to influence good behaviour, it becomes an exercise in persuasion. In India, social distancing is an alien concept. Our homes have fluid boundaries with people coming in and out.During Bengaluru’s lockdown, there were families in my community who decided to do without all help: no maids or drivers. And there were families who simply couldn’t do without external help. How to get these two extremes on the same page?In the birdwatching group that I am part of, there are members who believe that going for nature outings is okay as long as all members wear masks. And there are others who believe that such gatherings are very risky. Each to his own may work in normal circumstances but not when you are steering an unruly ship.Values are a nebulous thing. What might hold strong and true for you might seem strange and shifty to others. Do you eschew all outside food or do you order in and say that you will support local businesses? Both views have merit in this situation. Do you gather outdoors with a few friends or not? Do you vaccinate or not?What seems to work is the well placed question, the suggestion without aggression. As Abraham Lincoln once said, in order to persuade people, you have to first befriend them. If it worked for a man who had to heal and bring a country together, why not try it in your community?Shoba Narayan is a Bengaluru-based award-winning author.

16-06-2021||Mumbai||'No discrimination in allotment of black fungus drug’: Centre tells Bombay HC||The Centre on Wednesday told the Bombay high court that it has allocated Amphotericin B, used for treating mucormycosis or black fungus, on a need-based system and it has not discriminated against any state regarding its allotment including Maharashtra.The additional solicitor general Anil Singh told the high court that the allotment of the antifungal drugs to Maharashtra has been regular despite Amphotericin B being in short supply. He said that the Centre is trying its best to meet the demands raised by all the state governments, according to a report by news agency PTI. He was responding to a previous query raised by the high court where it questioned the Centre if its system of distribution of the antifungal drug was based on a system of ‘equitable distribution.’The high court was listening to several public interest litigations (PILs) on the management of resources related to the pandemic and Maharashtra government’s preparedness ahead of a probable third wave. around 15,000 vials of Amphotericin B to Maharashtra daily in the last few months. He also said that 140,260 vials have been delivered to Maharashtra in the second wave so far.“Nobody can dispute we are allocating as per drug availability in the country and the demands raised by states. The Centre is leaving no stone unturned to see that the drug is available in adequate quantity. A task force is constituted which is being monitored by the Supreme Court. We have granted licenses to six pharmaceutical companies to import the latest and most effective variant of Amphotericin B from a United States-based company,” Singh said.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, who appeared for Maharashtra, said the states’ current requirement is 17,500 vials per day. He also highlighted that the in-house production deal with pharma company Haffkine Bio will give the state 40,000 more vials of the drug between June 18 and June 30. Kumbhakoni said that Maharashtra saw 75 deaths in the past week due to mucormycosis. There are currently 7,511 active cases of black fungus in the state. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's advocate Anil Sakhre said that there are 282 active cases of black fungus in Mumbai.The court set the hearing on the plea for June 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-discrimination-in-allotment-of-black-fungus-drug-centre-tells-bombay-hc-101623837439512.html

She also slammed the SP for propagating lies about the issue and said that her party had suspended the MLAs a long ago.“SP is propagating lies about some BSP MLAs joining their party. We (BSP) had suspended them long back for conspiring with the SP against a Dalit leader to defeat him in the Rajya Sabha polls,” Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi, earlier in the day.The BSP chief also said that the SP specialises in politics of hate, manipulation, malice and casteism and with the help of the media had said that the BSP MLAs have joined their party. “If the SP had been a little honest towards these suspended MLAs, it would not have kept them waiting till now. Because they know that if these BSP MLAs are taken, there will be rebellion and split in SP, by those who are eager to join BSP,” she further said in a subsequent tweet.Also read | Ayodhya land deal: Akhilesh Yadav asks Trust members to resignIn a series of five tweets, Mayawati explained her party’s stance and criticised the SP sharply regarding the incident.

16-06-2021||Mumbai||Marathi actor Mayuresh Kotkar gets bail 2 days after arrest for Facebook post||Thane: Marathi actor Mayuresh Kotkar got bail on Wednesday, two days after he was arrested for making alleged derogatory comments against Maharashtra urban development minister Eknath Shinde and his family over the naming of the upcoming international airport in Navi Mumbai. His lawyer B Sonawane said, “Court has granted bail on Wednesday to Kotkar. The argument happened on Tuesday, but the court reserved the order; and on Wednesday, he is out on bail.”Mayuresh Kotkar, who has acted in some Marathi serials and films, was arrested on Monday under Section 505 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for publishing a statement with the intent to provoke and cause violence between communities, police had claimed explaining his arrest. However, it was criticised by opposition leaders in the state.Kotkar allegedly used defamatory language against minister Eknath Shinde and his parents while questioning the minister’s suggestion to name the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport after Shiv Sena founder and patriarch Balasaheb Thackeray, who passed away on November 17, 2012. Kotkar was demanding that the airport be named after Dinkar B Patil, a former parliamentarian from Maharashtra and a senior member of Peasants and Workers Party of India, who passed away on June 24, 2012. Last week, local villagers protested against the proposal by forming a 12-km-long human chain and threatened to lay a siege on the Konkan Bhavan in Navi Mumbai on June 24 over the issue. Kotkar also supported the protests.Shiv Sena corporator Yogesh Jankar, who filed the police complaint against Kotkar, said use of “objectionable or defamatory” language for any person or his family was not acceptable.“There should be some limitations while arguing or posting anything on social media. Therefore I came forward to lodge a complaint,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/marathi-actor-mayuresh-kotkar-out-on-bail-in-derogatory-fb-post-case-101623835930280.html

We didn’t step out, and did a lot of online shopping. We were comfortable and didn’t need too much... But now that it’s opening up, I must say that the New Gurgaon is better planned, has wide roads and open spaces. I’ve been wanting to shift from Mumbai to Gurugram because of this, as the houses are bigger, the roads...everything is. But my work is in Mumbai, so I can only come here spent time with family during breaks.”Kunal Kapur: We’ve access to top hospitals, doctors on call Chef Kunal Kapur is of the opinion that Gurugram handled the pandemic “pretty well”. But, it could have been better! He opines, “Gurugram being one of the new cities in India is beautifully planned and laid out. There is a certain sense of space. I wouldn’t say that’s the case of entire Gurugram, but most of the newly developed Gurugram; whether it’s office, eateries or home. We have access to some top hospitals, and doctors on call. The ease of staying at home and yet working and coupled with good doctors, and school which adapted to a curriculum which was online for kids and engaging them so that education doesn’t get hampered..It’s got a lot of to do with people, area infrastructure. The flip side was that the doctors were overwhelmed, over worked. People of Gurugram also came forward in extending a helping hand to people in need, in terms of supplying food, medicines or supporting each other through different Whats App groups, and where could one find plasma. Looking out for each other was special.” Anshuman Jha: There is definitely room for improvement Actor Anshuman Jha says, “I had three friends’ family reaching out to me from Gurugram, during the month of May, to help them find hospital beds. I had to request Sonu Sood if there is an availability. So there’s obviously more to do; so its great that Gurugram ticks the boxes for Covid times but there is definitely room for improvement. Health care needs to be people centric and patient centric, not capital centric. Maybe Gurugram can lead the path in that direction. It will be even better to have air quality and lifestyle habits mapped into this and have Gurugram as the most suitable city at all times, and not just during Covid times!”Ravinder Singh: RWAs played an important role in getting vaccination Author Ravinder Singh says: “In the entire NCR, the kind of load Delhi would have taken...Gurugram is far better off. It’s a cluster, a millennium city. Given the fact that it comes in a different state, it’s tiny and has got multiple hospitals to take care of the population, vis-à-vis Delhi or any other big city. We are better off in comparison to Delhi, Noida. The real important factor for me was unlike Delhi, Gurugram is a ‘society culture’. During Covid, the entire management was quite functional. For example RWAs played an important role in getting vaccination or RT-PCR test done, camps were organised so one didn’t have to go to hospitals, and even security guards came into action. We laid out an entire process how delivery folks will come, how maids or cooks will come. There were really workable and practical solutions. Gurugram is a society oriented place to live vis-a-vis any other city.”Vijender Singh: In Gurugram, people followed Covid guidelinesElated to see the praise coming for his place of residence, boxer Vijender Singh says, “It’s really nice to see this (recognition). People are educated there and know what to do and what not to do (with respect to rules). In Gurugram, people followed guidelines very well. That’s why they the city is being referred to the most suitable to live during Covid-19.” Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-era-gurugram-touted-as-most-suitable-to-live-101623832856929.html
16-06-2021||Delhi||Lost parent to Covid-19? These Delhi-NCR tutors will teach you for free||When a child looses a parent, it’s not just his/her innocence but also his crucial years of education that get affected. And that’s what the pandemic has inflicted on a many children, who have lost either one or bother parents to Covid-19. Here’s where some good Samaritans have stepped up to play the role of tutors for these kids. A Delhi-based educator, Priyanka N Srivastava is one such kind soul who is providing free of cost education to the children who have lost their parents to Covid and even those young adults who are unable to afford tuition classes since their parents have lost their jobs. Having tied up with NGOs to teach subjects such as science, maths, and chemistry, to such children, she says, “Humko two months ho gaye hain classes chalate hue. Chahe maid ke bachche ho ya peon ke, it doesn’t matter, one is just a student for me. Anybody can join these classes, bas padne ki ichcha honi chahiye! I wanted to personally help school students who are lacking a source of education because of having lost their parents or due to financial constraints. Sessions saare online hain. And we also have counsellors associated with us, to help such kids according to their needs.” While the government authorities are launching various nationalised schemes to sponsor the education of children who have suffered personal loss due to the deadly virus, there are teachers such as Gurugram-based Nitin Yadav, who feels responsible to contribute his bit to the society in his capacity. “This April, we launched an initiative called Free Economics and Business Studies Classes, for all the students who have lost the earning member of their family. The initiative is to waive off the burden of tuition fees from these students, so that their education doesn’t suffer due to the financial crunch,” explains Yadav, adding, “This step was taken to support students’ education during these trying times. The motivation behind the idea was a student from my current batch who lost one of his parents to Covid. Thinking of all such students, I wanted contribute his share to the society as an educator and hence, birthed the idea of waiver for classes.” Yadav is also encouraging the educators to come forward to help students get through these times beyond teaching. And there’s Rima Chainani, who lost her husband to Covid-19, and started a foundation wherein she’s providing online classes to Delhi-NCR based students, in commerce, economics and business studies. “I wanted to use my her knowledge to help the children,” says Chainani, adding, “I’ve been in this field for 10 years now, teaching 10th and 12th. I thought let me help children who have lost their parents or children who can’t afford classes belonging to marginalised class. I see so many people around me fighting Covid-19; losing their only earning member of the family. There are so many struggles one has to go through. I thought let me use my education, and whatever is my financial capacity to help people. I started off with children who can afford the tuitions fee, so that the money can be utilised for helping out others, who can’t afford. I’m now in the process of connecting with NGOs who are working for the same cause, since they are in the field and can help me out. The fund generation has started, and I hope to help as many as I can.” Author t@Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/lost-parent-to-covid-19-these-delhi-ncr-tutors-will-teach-you-for-free-101623831792949.html
16-06-2021||Delhi||Being social again: Are you vaccinated? It’s new normal!||For normalcy is slowly returning, but things have changed and how, especially after the second wave of Covid-19 in 2021. One can’t think of stepping out without masks (usually more than one), sanitisers and the likes. And this has led a panic and/or anxiety seep in those who are trying to get back to their social life, while following the drastically altered norms of ‘new normal’. Questions like ‘Are you vaccinated yet?’, ‘How many doses of vaccination have you received?’, ‘Let’s get a RT-PCR test done before meeting’ seem to have become part of routine, everyday conversations. Paralympian Deepa Malik, who is based in Gurugram, recently met her friends after ages. And her checklist included shots of vaccine, an anti-body test, temperature and oxygen levels, a negative RT-PCR test, and a limited gathering of six people only. Phew! So much to plan a ‘safe’ get together? “My friend, who was the host, is diabetic and had been low because of frozen shoulder. We felt she needed to meet up. And I believe that ‘vitamin friends’ is a special ingredient for mental well-being. But Covid has taught to celebrate lil joys keeping safety in mind. The idea is to be with each other and celebrate our health. So though we hadn’t been able to meet for a long time — as we were waiting for everyone to get vaccinated — but the day we decided to show up to this meet-up, we all got out RT-PCR test done in the morning of the meeting,” she recalls. But apprehensions before meeting people has set in, thanks to months of staying in, and fear of contracting the virus or getting yet another bad news. Utkarsha Bansal, a Delhi-based college student, shares how flying kisses is history and double masking is the new normal, just like checking the vaccination status of friends before meeting them. “Despite the relaxation in the lockdown, I haven’t stepped out of my house more than once. With the speculation of the third wave, I personally feel this is the time people need to be even more careful. Most of the city’s population can’t afford the luxury of staying indoors and not working. So, the relaxation in the lockdown were inevitable. However, for those of us who are privileged, the risk of stepping out should not be taken even after getting vaccination. The vaccine reduces the risk of one getting severely affected due to Covid-19, but it doesn’t guarantee full protection. So the risk of getting infected persists. I’ve faced the wrath of the virus once and wouldn’t do anything to put myself at risk again. I can’t get vaccinated before I complete 30-40 days of recovery. But I would surely confirm the vaccination status of my friends before I meet them in these times,” she adds. The pandemic has not only forced the human race to put their lives on hold, it has subsequently changed the course of socialising. “Today, one can clearly notice many people practising isolation and cutting off their social ties. Talking about going out, I’ve had only few chances to do the same as mostly all communication, personal or with university and other organisations has been transformed to virtual. Of course if I get a chance to go out with friends, a prime concern would be the status of their as well as my vaccination,” says Yashi Vijayvergiya, another college student. Panicking before socialising? Here’s a tip from expert“Panicking and being anxious simply means that you are over thinking about a particular topic,” says psychological counsellor and therapist Komel Chadha, adding how people are deriving comfort with digital communication more than physical interactions. She adds: “After seeing surge in the number of deaths during the second wave, expectation of normalcy hardly gets seen. People are still trusting digital mode, in fact many are trying to develop more comfort with it. The biggest challenge is the comfort that has already developed by working from home for more than a year now. People have started creating happiness within four walls. For example, if I’m anxious about an upcoming future event, simply means I am making too many images of something that is about to happen in my mind. If you want to control it, you have to be more mindful — reduce to the number of images you create in your mind about that event — and should rather see visuals of making it more successful, then the anxiety will get controlled.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8For more stories follow Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/being-social-again-are-you-vaccinated-it-s-new-normal-101623831012084.html
16-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai housing society vaccine scam: 2 held as residents suspect 'fake' shots||Two people have been detained in connection with the vaccine scene that unfolded in Mumbai's Hiranandani Estate Society after the residents on Tuesday raised suspicion over the Covid vaccine dose that they got at a vaccination camp held at the residential complex on May 30. A police complaint was filed by the residents at Kandivli police station after the resident spotted several irregularities in the entire process. None of them developed any side effect after being administered with the vaccine dose.Here is what happened?The residents' welfare association got in touch with some people who organised the vaccination camp at the society complex, as the government has now allowed residential societies to organise camps vaccine camps. The residents were informed that they will receive the shots from Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Andheri. But as they have started receiving the vaccine certificates, they found that their vaccines came from Nanavati Max Super Speciality, Lifeline hospitals and NESCO jumbo centre.None of them had registered on Co-Win app before being inoculated. They were registered after vaccination as they received calls asking for the Co-Win OTP. Following this, they received their certificates which were full of wrong information.-We were later told that the jab was given by a Shivam Hospital, while some said it was from a private agent. -Another point of doubt is that not a single member showed any side effects of the vaccine. Not 1 out of 400?The hospitals apparently involved — Nanavati Max Super Speciality, Lifeline hospitals and NESCO jumbo centre — denied any role. They also clarified that they did not issue those certificates and NESCO jumbo centre, for instance, is run by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and hence its vaccines are free. But it also clarified that it does not have the permission to provide vaccines to residential societies.The residents of the society paid for the vaccine shots and some of them have plans to travel abroad. Now they are not sure whether they received Covishield or glucose water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-housing-society-vaccine-scam-2-held-as-residents-suspect-fake-shots-101623828636797.html
16-06-2021||Mumbai||How Mumbai, India's most crowded city, beat the odds and the Covid-19 pandemic||When Covid-19 arrived in India, few places looked as vulnerable as Mumbai. But a year on, South Asia's most crowded city has surprised many by tackling a vicious second wave with considerable success.Gaurav Awasthi even travelled hundreds of kilometres from his home on the outskirts of Delhi to get his ailing wife a hospital bed there, paying an ambulance more than a thousand dollars to drive 24 hours straight."I cannot ever repay my debt to this city," the 29-year-old told AFP, recounting an ordeal that saw him spend five days fruitlessly searching for a bed across several cities, including Delhi."I don't know if my wife would be alive today if it weren't for Mumbai's health facilities."Bodies in wardsThe bodies began turning up early in India's financial capital during the first wave of infections last year -- a man collapsing on a busy road, a rickshaw driver slumped over the wheel, a corpse lying in the street -- in a grim echo of the 1918 flu pandemic.By May 2020, Abhignya Patra was working 18-hour days at the massive Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, better known as Sion."It was non-stop," the 27-year-old anaesthesiologist told AFP.Patients' relatives described distressing scenes inside packed wards, with one man telling AFP he had to change his sick mother's diapers himself because staff were too overworked.A video shot inside Sion and widely shared on social media showed corpses wrapped in black plastic left on beds in a ward where patients were being treated.Every night, the city helpline fielded thousands of calls from desperate citizens, many with no chance of getting admitted to a publicly-funded hospital: Mumbai had just 80 ambulances and 425 intensive care units for a population of 20 million.'Chase the virus'Something had to change fast, said Iqbal Chahal, a no-nonsense bureaucrat who took over as Mumbai's municipal commissioner last May.New field hospitals added thousands of beds, private facilities handed over their Covid-19 wards to the government and 800 vehicles were turned into ambulances.But these efforts could not combat the swift rise in infections."We needed to chase the virus," Chahal told AFP.A proactive approach focused on 55 slums including India's largest, Dharavi, where a strict lockdown was accompanied by aggressive sanitisation of public toilets, mass coronavirus screening and a huge volunteer effort to ensure that nobody went hungry.All positive test reports in Mumbai were routed through "war rooms" manned by doctors who would triage cases and decide where to send the patient, irrespective of "whether he is a minister, a big shot or a slum dweller", Chahal said.Forward thinkingAs 2020 wore on, it looked like India might have miraculously beaten the pandemic and lockdown restrictions were eased.But in Mumbai, authorities didn't dismantle a single bed in the now-deserted field hospitals.This meant that when cases surged in March, the metropolis was much better prepared than many other Indian cities, where the health care system came close to collapse.In the capital Delhi and elsewhere, patients died outside hospitals and crematoriums were overwhelmed. But not in Mumbai.Despite having a much higher population density than many other cities, Mumbai has seen significantly lower mortality rates.The city still suffered close calls, Chahal said, recalling one night in April when six hospitals faced dire oxygen shortages, putting 168 patients at serious risk unless they were shifted to other facilities.Everyone survived."We always expected a second wave," Chahal said.'Wake-up call'Patra recalls getting calls from colleagues in Delhi desperately searching for medical equipment."As doctors, there is very little we can do in the absence of infrastructure," she said.Ruben Mascarenhas, co-founder of Mumbai-based non-profit Khaana Chahiye, said he would get dozens of messages every morning from people begging for oxygen and drugs -- but as the pandemic wore on, the requests mostly came from outside the city.He was, he says, "pleasantly surprised", but is "very cautious about celebrating yet."He is not the only one.An experienced marathon-runner, Chahal is already preparing for a third wave -- expected to hit children hard -- by stockpiling oxygen, building paediatric field hospitals and expanding capacity at public hospitals."This has been a wake-up call for us," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/how-mumbai-india-s-most-crowded-city-beat-the-odds-and-the-covid-19-pandemic-101623828813524.html

If the project proponent is avoiding giving data, there should be no difficulty in drawing adverse inference based on 'best judgement assessment', based on inferences from the circumstances."Indicative scale of compensation already stands approved by this Tribunal on the basis of expert Committee report. We also find that with regard to illegal cutting of trees the Forest Department has merely imposed some fine," the bench said.The tribunal had formed a joint committee comprising officials from the Central Pollution Control Board, Member Secretary, State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority, UP, state pollution control board, Central Ground Water Authority and Ghaziabad District Magistrate.The tribunal said that neither prosecution has been initiated, as required, nor adequate compensation recovered on the principle of restitution, based on value of the ecological services forgone forever."Accordingly, we direct the joint Committee, in coordination with any other expert/institution to take/recommend further remedial action. The statutory authorities may exercise their jurisdiction in the matter to comply with the rule of law and file a compliance report before the next date by e-mail," the bench said.The matter is posted for further consideration on September 23.The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by UP resident Mahakar Singh alleging illegal cutting of trees, extraction of groundwater and construction without the EC for the project of Wave City at Ghaziabad and High Tech City at NOIDA by real estate developers.The total project area of Uppal Chadha Hi Tech Developers Pvt Ltd (Wave Hi-Tech Township) is covered 4,494.31 acres in three phases."The first phase of project area having an area 1,671 acres, comprised of sector 1 to 7, which is covered only in Ghaziabad district. The second phase having a project area of 2,333 acres, in which about 80 per cent area is covered in Gautam Budh Nagar district and rest of the area in Ghaziabad district."The third phase having an area 490.31 acres covers almost equally in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar districts. As per information provided by the project proponent, total no of proposed units is 20,280, total units constructed as on March 15, 2021 is 5,777, Total units handed over to the customers 1,150, occupancy is 912," the committee told the NGT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ngt-calls-for-report-on-environmental-violations-by-real-estate-developer-101623828382847.html

However, no one was hurt as they rushed out of the house after detecting smoke. The fire department claimed to have brought the blaze under control within a couple of hours, but the cause of the fire was not known at this stage.At 8 am on Wednesday morning, the minister’s family comprising wife Deepa Manjhi, son Aditya and daughter Guriya noticed smoke billowing out of one of the rooms of the government flat and rushed out of the house, said a fire department official. Santosh Kumar Suman is son of former chief minister and the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) president, Jitan Ram Manjhi.“This is an old building, and I cannot really say what caused the fire,” Suman said.The fire started on the ground floor of the ministerial bungalow, located on Strand Road in Patna, and it burnt most articles such as clothes, furniture, electronic equipment and air conditioners before it was brought under control with the help of two fire tenders. It didn’t cause any injuries or casualties, the fire department said.“It happened in a room at the ministerial bungalow. Though we don’t know the exact reason, as of now, an air-conditioner is suspected to be the cause of the fire.

It now houses the administrative office of Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University (KSDSU).“Though the work was supposed to be completed last year, it was delayed due to a shortage of labourers triggered by Covid-19”, station manager Ashok Kumar Singh said, adding that it would finish soon. .The redevelopment work was launched three years ago during the tenure of the then Samastipur divisional railway manager (DRM) S K Jain, who earned praise for his redevelopment efforts including promotion of Mithila arts on stations.The Darbhanga junction now boasts of an escalator, lift, improved parking area, wider approach road and landscaping, a senior railway official said.

16-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A conscientious citizen||His professionalism doesn’t suggest that his stint with the city is ending. As the customer prepares to step inside the excellently maintained auto rickshaw, Som Pal politely asks him to stop. He picks up a large bottle filled with blue liquid, turns around on his driver’s seat, and generously sprays the liquid on the passenger’s seat in the back.It’s the sanitiser.He also sprays the metal railings that people tend to touch while entering the rickshaw. Mr Pal does it all with great concentration.Such attention to safety is rare among auto and cab drivers, even though they are expected to follow these pandemic-era protocols. This becomes more wonderful when Mr Pal says that he buys a 5 litre can of the sanitiser every fortnight, costing a steep ₹700.Why do it, when many other drivers are relaxed about it, and the income has anyway plummeted down since the pandemic began?Mr Pal searches for an answer. “People then trust me, and I feel safer because I don’t know if the previous passenger was infected with corona or not.”This afternoon, Mr Pal is waiting for business outside a closed educational institute in Vasundhara in Ghaziabad. The place would be teeming with auto rickshaws at all times, but right now his is the only one. “People are scared of the virus.”The area is crammed with multi-storey housing complexes. One large piece of open ground, that was empty all these years and in which kids would play cricket, has been barricaded—yet another housing complex is coming up. Mr Pal, who has been driving the rickshaw in the area for 8 years, reports that until two years ago auto rickshaw drivers would never have to wait for customers. “My regulars would have my number in their mobile phones and would call me before leaving their apartment.” But the cab apps are reducing the demand for autos, he says. “Their rates are not very expensive, and they are cars... we are just autos.”In his 30s, Mr Pal’s wife and kids live with his elderly parents in Fatehpur, UP. Both father and mother work as farmers—the family owns two beeghas of agricultural land. Mr Pal is so disillusioned with the auto rickshaw’s earnings these days that he has made a significant decision.“I’ve told my parents to rest at home and I’ll do the kheti (farming). I’m leaving soon.”And the city will lose a conscientious citizen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-conscientious-citizen-101623790062498.html

The rift in Congress is an internal matter. however, legislators are unable to meet the CMs,” he said. Taking a dig at the Amarinder Singh-led Punjab government, Thakur said, “In Punjab, the ventilators meant for saving lives of Covid patients were found in dustbins. Later, they sold vaccines to private hospitals.” On Congress MP Digvijaya Singh’s remarks advocating revocation of Article 370, he said, “Congress leaders are singing in chorus with the Pakistan media. Article 370 has been buried forever by the BJP government. If Congress is speaking the language of Pakistani journalists, then it is a traitor.”  Asked about the soaring inflation rate, the BJP leader said, “More inflation was seen during the Congress’ era. The market decides the rate of petrol and diesel. Whether it will be cheaper or expensive in future depends on the market.” Thakur, who was in Shimla to attend a meeting of BJP leaders, distributed approval letters to beneficiaries under the consumer contact programme. “Banks have sanctioned working capital loans of ₹75,426 crore under the ₹3 lakh crore emergency credit line guarantee scheme (ECLGS) for MSMEs, of which ₹32,895 crore has already been disbursed.”The scheme, under which the government offers full guarantee on up to 20% additional and collateral-free working capital loans, was rolled out from June 1 to soften the blow to MSMEs battered by the Covid outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-rajasthan-cms-management-of-covid-inept-anurag-thakur-101623787987522.html

16-06-2021||Other||Preparation for third wave: Sero survey to begin in Chandigarh, Panchkula this week||Preparing themselves for the anticipated third wave, health authorities in Chandigarh and Panchkula are all set to conduct a sero survey, which will help them determine the presence of Covid antibodies in people. The third survey will be different as children will also be screened.During the war-room meeting on Tuesday, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) director Dr Jagat Ram stated that sero survey of persons below the age of 18 will be useful for Chandigarh as this population has not been vaccinated and so the results of the sero survey could be useful in devising the future strategy for vaccinating this age group. He said such a targeted survey for the paediatric group has not been conducted anywhere in the country. With fears about the third wave hitting this unvaccinated population, the study could be used by public health experts in devising a strategy to fight the virus.“In the next two to three days, PGIMER is going to start the survey wherein around 2,700 children aged between 2 and 18 will be involved,” said Dr Ram. GMCH-32 director Dr Jasbinder Kaur said that they are preparing to screen over 1,200 adult population (18+) in the city. Panchkula health department has already started the training of its staff, as they are going to take samples of 400 people in the next two days. Panchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjeet Kaur said, “Sero survey is a kind of blood test, wherein blood samples are taken from randomly selected people and are tested for the presence of IgG (Immunoglobulin G) antibodies that determine a past infection due to the virus.”“It tells us how many people have been exposed to the virus and have developed immunity. The survey is important as it tells us how many people have acquired antibodies either via vaccination or by exposure to the virus,” she said.The seroprevalence in the first round, which was conducted in August, was found to be 6%. It increased to 11% in October. The experts are hoping it would be at least 50% this time.When asked how the survey will help plan for the third wave, Dr Kaur said: “It will help us in knowing the areas where people have not developed antibodies, hence, vaccination can be focused in those areas. We want to vaccinate as many people as possible before the third wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/preparation-for-third-wave-sero-survey-to-begin-in-chandigarh-panchkula-this-week-101623787507587.html

In the absence of the drug, doctors will have to use an alternative drug, posaconazole, which, as per experts, is effective but works slowly.As per protocol, hospitals send their drug requirement to director, health services, who further approaches the central government, which allocates the drug.Confirming that the drug is out of stock, Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, Chandigarh, said, “As per the latest update, we have been allocated 270 liposomal Amphotericin B and 140 conventional Amphotericin. But we have not received the delivery yet. Hopefully, we will get it in a day or two.”She said she has requested for over 2,000 injections, of which 1,600 injections have been given to GMCH-32 and 400 to PGIMER, which also gets its separate allocation from the Centre, Dr Kang said.GMCH-32 doctors are the most worried as there are 43 active black fungus cases in the hospital. Dr Sudhir Garg, medical superintendent, said: “We got the drugs today, but it was not sufficient. We do not have stock for tomorrow. We are hoping that the department gets the drug by morning.”Dr Surinder Singh, head of ENT department, who is managing the patients, said: “Liposomal Amphotericin B has less renal toxicity, which means it can be given in high dose, whereas toxicity of conventional drug is more, hence, it cannot be given in high dose. The efficacy of both the drugs is same, but conventional one, if given in high dose, impact kidneys.”“We do not have any of the two drugs for tomorrow, hence, we will have to switch to alternative drug, which is effective but acts slowly.”PGIMER is also dealing with shortage. PGI director Dr Jagat Ram said: “There is this daily struggle to procure the drug, but we have been managing.” He said the PGI has operated 225 black fungus cases, however, now the cases have started declining. Over the last two days, the cases have gone down from 15 a day to approximately 5 to 6.GMCH-32, which has seen 78 patients, including 30 from Chandigarh, has not reported any decline. Dr Jasbinder Kaur, director principal, said: “Earlier, there would be 35-36 active cases, but now the number is 43. There is no decline.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/black-fungus-drug-out-of-stock-in-chandigarh-101623787267573.html

16-06-2021||Chandigarh||High drama as NGO members get into spat with LIT chief||High drama was witnessed at the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) office in Feroze Gandhi Market on Tuesday after members of different NGOs had a heated argument with LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam over implementation of the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) orders, directing authorities to stop pouring concrete and installing interlocking tiles around a one-metre radius of trees.While members NGOs like Council of Engineers, Naroa Punjab Manch and Wake up Ludhiana accused the LIT chairman of using abusive language against the NGT and forcing them to move out of the office, Balasubramaniam accused them of misbehaving and putting unnecessary pressure on LIT officials.The NGO members, including Kapil Arora, Kuldeep Khaira, Simratpal Kalsi and Apinder Sodhi, also submitted a police complaint after they were forced to move out of the LIT office. Arora said that they had moved NGT against the illegal practice of pouring concrete and installing of interlocking tiles around trees, which damages the roots. The NGT had in March ordered the authorities to leave a one metre radius around the trees.“We had apprised the authorities of the orders. As the illegal practice is still prevalent in areas like BRS Nagar, Model Town Extension and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, we staged a peaceful protest outside the LIT office from 10.30am to 12.30pm on Tuesday. The authorities have even failed to remove concrete poured around trees in LIT’s office. The chairman, however, refused to obey the orders of NGT and used abusive language. He also forced us to leave the office premises, but we continued our peaceful protest.”. The protesting members stated that trees are not able to absorb water and other nutrients after concrete is poured around them. Further, the roots also get damaged, which makes them weak and they fall during thunderstorms and strong winds. Recently, around 80 trees got uprooted in different parts of the city due to strong winds. On June 11, NGOs had also protested against the MC over the issue.The members said that a complaint against the LIT chairman has been submitted with the NGT and a contempt petition will now be filed against the MC and LIT authorities, if they fail to act within a week.However, Balasubramaniam refuted the allegations and accused the NGO members of misbehaving and putting unnecessary pressure on the officials. “I have already issued the orders and we are leaving a one-metre space around the trees wherever possible. The NGO members were putting unnecessary pressure and demanding that the changes be made overnight, which is not possible, as it is a labour and capital intensive job. We are already working to encourage greenery in the city and a number of leisure valleys are being established, while these NGOs have never stepped in to promote greenery or save the environment.” Station house officer of division number 5 police station, Kuldeep Singh, said that no written complaint has been submitted by anyone and a police team was deployed at the spot to avoid any law-and-order situation||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/high-drama-as-ngo-members-get-into-spat-with-lit-chief-101623786968271.html

They said that many of them have received power bills to the tune of ₹5 to 15 lakh for the entire year. They added that they are already facing losses due to Covid-19 pandemic and even the PSPCL chairman has refused to speak to them. Five people will sit on the protest outside the PCPCL office everyday and if the authorities will do not roll back the penalties by Friday (June 18), then all the members will sit on protest outside the PCPCL office in Patiala, they added.Jaswinder Thakrul, president of the Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association, said, “We were forced to sit in protest after the chairman PSPCL refused to talk to us. For the last 15 months, the industry is facing a crisis due to the pandemic and now, the PSPCL has imposed penalties worth lakhs on a large number of businessmen. If the decision is not reversed, then we will gherao the PSPCL office in Patiala.” DS Chawla president of the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturing Association (UCPMA), said, “We have been running our factories for 24 hours to support the state government, provide employment and generate revenue. The PSPCL has imposed penalty on many businessmen for using more load than the sanctioned load of the entire year. Many of them have been framed for unauthorised use of electricity (UUE) cases, which is not right. Instead of charging penalty for the duration for which they have used power, the authorities imposed the charges for 12 months, which is not justified.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-bizmen-protest-against-pspcl-over-fines-for-extra-power-usage-101623786914144.html

16-06-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana dairy farmers’ body hikes milk price by ₹3||At the time when people are already reeling under the crises wreaked by the Covid pandemic, another jolt to them has come in the form of a hike in milk prices by the Ludhiana Dairy Farmers’ Association of Haibowal and Tajpur Road. The rate has been increased in all three categories of milk by ₹3 from Tuesday. The revised price of cow milk will now be ₹58 per litre, while the mixed milk will be available at ₹65 per litre. The buffalo milk will be available at ₹73, which earlier would cost ₹70. As per the association president, due to hike in diesel prices and cost of fodder, they were forced to increase the rate of milk. The price of diesel has seen an increment of ₹4.68 per litre and costs ₹89.6 per litre. Currently, there are 800 dairy farmers in Haibowal area and 1.5 lakh litre milk is daily supplied in residential areas, to restaurants, dhabas, and sweets shops. Paramjeet Singh, chairman of Haibowal Dairy Farmers’ Association, said, “Last year, due to the coronavirus outbreak, all dairy farmers had suffered losses following the closure of restaurants, sweets shops and dhabas. For the entire year, we did not increase the price of milk so that people don’t feel burdened. We were planning to increase the price by ₹5, but considering the prevailing situation, we decided to hike it by ₹3.”Out of 1.5 lakh litre daily production, 40% is supplied at doorsteps in residential areas and the rest is sent to commercial outlets. The president of Ludhiana Dairy Farmers’ Association, DS Oberoi, said, “In the last one year, the price of fodder has increased, and dairy farmers have been overburdened. The hike in fuel prices has been another reason for the latest increase in the rates of milk. Last year, due to the pandemic, the association had decided against increasing the price which is usually done in the month of March every year. In 2019, we had increased the price by ₹2 per litre.”Meanwhile, residents are upset with the latest decision of the association. Kapil Khurana, a resident of Haibowal Kalan, said, “Due to the pandemic, many people have lost their jobs and suffered losses in business. A hike in fuel price coupled with the revised price of milk is burning a hole in the pocket of a common man. For the last 20 years, we have been getting milk supply at home from dairy and a hike of ₹3 will affect our monthly budget.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-dairy-farmers-body-hikes-milk-price-by-3-101623786788673.html
16-06-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana cyber cell forms special teams to check child porn||The cyber cell has formed special teams to keep tabs on child pornography on social networking sites and messaging applications in an attempt to trace offenders in minimum time. The cyber cell uses IP address and IMEI number of devices to detect criminals. Though the cyber cell is dependent on US-based National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which keeps a check on such content shared in private groups and inbox, it also scans social networking sites to identify the offenders who post or circulate such content. Recently, the Ludhiana police had traced and arrested two persons for sharing objectionable content on Instagram, a photo and video sharing platform.Sub-inspector Jatinder Singh, in-charge of cyber cell -2, said NCMEC keeps a check on such content and informs the ministry of home affairs (MHA). “The MHA further informs states about such violations. The cyber cell of states then sends the cases to districts. Police trace the mobile phones of the accused with the help of service providers," he added. “Mostly youths share such content among their friends through WhatsApp groups and as private messages on social networking sites, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. As the police have no access to private messages being shared online, they are dependent on the agencies for information,” the cyber cell in-charge added. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said sharing child pornography is a punishable offence under Section 67-B (publishing or transmitting of material depicting children in sexually explicit act in electronic form) of the Information and Technology Act.The culprits will be punished on first conviction with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years and with fine which may extend to ₹10 lakh and in the event of second or subsequent conviction with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years and also with fine which may extend to ₹10 lakh.

16-06-2021||Chandigarh||Capt slams Oppn over charges of profiteering from vaccines||Rejecting the opposition’s allegations on supply of vaccines to some private hospitals and procurement of fateh kits as “politically motivated”, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said there was no question of the state government making profits amid the pandemic, which it was battling hard to save lives. Accusing the Akalis and AAP of spreading misinformation and weakening the state’s war against Covid by raising non-issues, Amarinder said they were making motivated hue and cry to push their electoral agendas with an eye on the 2022 assembly elections. “The state government has not indulged in any wrongdoing. Quick and unusual decisions have to be taken in an emergency war-like situation. All protocols were strictly followed and emergency rules were invoked to meet the crisis,” he said in a statement, terming media reports on alleged scams as sensationalism. The CM said he was with his officials 100% on these issues, adding that no amount of opposition hullaballoo can undermine the true intent of his government. He also took serious note of the large-scale gatherings being organised by the SAD against the state government in brazen violation of the Covid safety protocols and the curbs in place. “In their desperation for power, Sukhbir Badal and his party colleagues were endangering the lives of the people through such gatherings,” he said. He claimed that the 40,000-odd doses made available to some private hospitals was a one-time measure to provide some vaccination options to non-priority groups in 18-45 category. The hospitals were provided the vaccines at the price at which they were to buy from the manufacturers, he said, adding that since the decision was not being taken in the right spirit, it was withdrawn, but there was no question of any irregularity as the entire money went into the health department’s vaccination fund. Health secretary Hussan Lal said that of the 42,000 vaccines given to private hospitals, only 1,300 were used and the remaining had already been returned to the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-slams-oppn-over-charges-of-profiteering-from-vaccines-101623785587481.html
16-06-2021||Lucknow||Nishad party chief meets Nadda ahead of 2022 UP polls||Four days after meeting union home minister Amit Shah, Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (NISHAD) leader Sanjay Nishad, who has been camping in New Delhi since then, met BJP chief JP Nadda for the second round of seat-sharing talks in Delhi ahead of the 2022 UP polls on Tuesday.He was accompanied by his son Praveen Nishad, currently a BJP MP from Sant Kabir Nagar. The talks were held in the presence of BJP veteran and UP cabinet minister Sidharth Nath Singh who rushed to Delhi especially for the meeting of Nishad party leader whose party has a significant following among the riverine community of boatmen and fishermen in and around Gorakhpur.“The talks were successful,” Sanjay Nishad said over the phone from Delhi after the meeting and admitted he had put up the issue of “ucchit samman (proper respect)” to the community before the BJP leaders.Sanjay didn’t elaborate on what he meant by “ucchit samman” but Nishad party leaders were hopeful of community being accommodated in various corporations besides a cabinet berth.The Nishad leaders also discussed the issue of community being moved from OBC and be given benefits and reservations as scheduled castes and issued certificates as ‘majhwar’ – a term for riverine community of boatmen or fishermen listed in 53rd number in the SC list.Back in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Sidharth Nath had played a key role in ensuring that the Nishads went with BJP and called off their successful alliance with the Samajwadi Party which had with the support of BSP put up Praveen Nishad as a joint candidate against the BJP in the 2018 Lok Sabha by-poll from Gorakhpur and ensured BJP’s shock defeat.“We had cordial discussions with party chief on issues of Nishad community,” Sidharth Nath Singh said even as BJP chief JP Nadda tweeted pictures of his meeting with Nishad community leaders – a gesture that has been interpreted as a message that the BJP and Nishads would contest the 2022 UP polls in alliance.After 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Nishad party leadership, which has again been approached by the Samajwadi Party ahead of the crucial assembly elections, had complained of being neglected and was being wooed by the Samajwadi Party. On the other hand, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav has begun smaller parties like Mahaan Dal whose chief Keshav Dev Maurya said they would contest the 2022 UP polls with the Samajwadi Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/nishad-party-chief-meets-nadda-ahead-of-2022-up-polls-101623785348784.html
16-06-2021||Chandigarh||Congress has only itself to blame for crisis in Punjab||The Congress, which is treading cautiously in its attempt to resolve differences between chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and dissenters in Punjab, has itself to blame for the present crisis in the state unit. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who is now leaning on the three-member Kharge panel’s assessment and suggestions to end their squabbling, had set up two separate committees under former Union minister P Chidambaram and then All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge of party affairs in Punjab Asha Kumari in January 2020, for the implementation of promises made in the election manifesto and improve coordination between the party and the state government. But both these committee did not hold even one meeting in the past 17 months even though murmurs of discontent in a section of the party kept getting louder in the state. At the centre of the ongoing standoff between Amarinder and the dissenting group are a few key unkept election promises, including action in sacrilege and police firing cases, and annulment of power purchase agreements (PPAs), and the chief minister’s lack of accessibility and over-reliance on bureaucrats that had several ministers and legislators openly gripe at party forums and outside from time to time. The committee, which had Chidambaram as chairman and Amarinder, Asha Kumari, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja as members, was set up for “proper implementation” of the party manifesto for the 2017 assembly elections. The 11-member coordination group comprising Asha Kumari, Amarinder, Jakhar, Rajya MP Ambika Soni and cabinet ministers Charanjit Singh Channi, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Vijay inder Singla and Sunder Sham Arora among others, was also constituted following the dissolution of the pradesh and district Congress committees. These decisions were taken when discontent was already brewing in the party over the government’s handling of the Bargari sacrilege cases and the dominance of bureaucracy in the government. Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa was also breathing fire against Amarinder’s style of functioning and the advocate general and the latter met the party MLAs in groups to hear their grievances. “The discontent was building up and the signs were all there but nothing was done by these committees,” a senior Congress lawmaker said. When contacted, Jakhar, whose name figured in both the central committees as member, said he does not recall having received any message or letter regarding any meeting of the two committees. “The state affairs in-charge was the one authorised to convene meetings. I am not sure, but Covid-19 restrictions could probably be the reason for not holding any meeting,” he said. Harish Rawat, who replaced Asha Kumari as the state affairs in-charge in September 2020, did not respond to calls. The Kharge committee, which includes Rawat and former Delhi MP Jai Prakash Agarwal as members and had one-to-one meetings with 150 party leaders from Punjab in past two weeks, has, in its report to the Congress president, suggested keeping Amarinder in command, accommodating former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, revamping of the organisational set-up without further delay and giving due representation to all social groups, particularly Dalits, to strengthen the party ahead of next year’s state polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-has-only-itself-to-blame-for-crisis-in-punjab-101623785107478.html
16-06-2021||Chandigarh||Former Canadian Sikh minister ‘sorry’ for backing proposed anti-Muslim bill||TorontoA former Canadian minister of Punjab origin has publicly apologised for having supported in the past a proposed bill that would have banned Muslim women in the country from wearing the niqab, a face-covering veil, while taking their citizenship oath.Conservative Party MP Tim Uppal, a Sikh, was the minister of state for multiculturalism in the government of then PM Stephen Harper in 2015 when he had backed the controversial bill.His apology has come at a time when terror charges have been slapped on Nathaniel Veltman, a 20-year-old, who had mowed down four members of a Muslim family in the city of Hamilton in Ontario on June 6 in an act of Islamophobia.Uppal is currently an MP from Edmonton Mill Woods.Uppal’s mea culpa has come following the attack. In a Facebook post, he said he was the spokesperson for the proposed bill in 2015, but after his party was defeated in that year’s general election by the Justin Trudeau-led Liberals, he spoke with Canadians outside the “partisan political bubble” and realised “how this ban and other campaign announcements during the 2015 election alienated Muslim Canadians and contributed to the growing problem of Islamaphobia”.He posted, “When it came to these policies, I should have used my seat at the table to push against divisiveness that promoted the notion of the other. I regret not being a stronger voice and sincerely apologise for my role.”Referring to the Hamilton attack, he said it has been “a devastating week for many. We are mourning as a nation for a family that was so brutally attacked and destroyed by a terrorist”.The apology came as a federal prosecutor imposed terror charges on Veltman, who drove his truck over the family when they had been out for an evening walk. The charges were upgraded on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/former-canadian-sikh-minister-sorry-for-backing-proposed-anti-muslim-bill-101623784987358.html

The team will have five motorised boats and its personnel have been trained by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). The railways has identified vulnerable locations along the central line and the inflatable boats with all the safety equipment have been stationed at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), Kurla, Thane and Badlapur stations. The boats can be easily transported to any Western Railway (WR) station in case of an emergency. Each boat has a capacity of eight people. A mock drill on the rescue operation was conducted at Masunda Lake in Thane on Tuesday. The railways started the initiative this year in the backdrop of the 2019 incident, when an outstation train, Mahalaxmi Express, with 700 passengers on board, was stuck near Vangani station in heavy rains and floods,. Arun Kumar, Director General RPF, said, “The suburban rail is the lifeline of Mumbai, and hence there are various infrastructure upgradations made over the past few years by the railways to ensure that flooding does not take place. As part of this initiative, we have introduced the rescue boats and the team. Our first act in any emergency is to ensure passengers do not panic.” As these boats are inflatable it can be easily moved to any location wherever required for immediate response. Each RFRT team consists of one sub-inspector/assistant sub-inspector and six other staff. “So far, we have trained 15 personnel – 5 women and 10 men – and training is being provided to more RPF personnel. These teams will be available during monsoon from June to October every year. A detailed Standard operating procedure (SOP) has been prepared, that will also ensure better coordination among civil administration, GRP, disaster management authorities and control room,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR. The teams will continuously monitor the rainfall, especially during the days of high tide or when heavy rain is predicted by the meteorological department, and move to the location where flooding is reported. There are three alert marks developed by the railways: when the water level reaches four inches above rail level, the team will start preparation for movement and it will be called ‘blue alert’. When the team moves to the location where water level reaches five inches above the rail level, it will be orange alert. Red alert is when the relief operation begins when the train is held up at any location and the water is three feet high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cr-forms-team-procures-boats-for-relief-work-during-rain-101623784446697.html

Bajra was damaged due to the upper water table, prices of sugarcane have come down and we have only one option - to grow paddy. If we do not grow paddy, how will we pay our tractor’s loan amount and other expenses? We have not received a single amount for last year’s crop diversification,” said rebel farmer Praveen Dhankar, who was among these two dozen farmers.Jhajjar deputy director (agriculture) Inder Singh said Dhakla village has 3,445 acre land (1,400 of Dhakla village and rest of two hamlets that fall under this village).The villagers said that there are more than 350 active cultivators in the village, of which more than 70 people are in favour not to cultivate paddy this time, two dozen farmers want to grow water guzzler paddy and the remaining are mum on this issue.The 70-odd farmers are in favour of crop diversification as they are facing a waterlogging problem and their houses are damaged due to the upper water table.“Our agricultural land has been losing its fertility and if we will not switch over to other crops, then we won’t be able to grow crops after a span of five to seven years,” said a group of farmers led by Sant Ram, who are in favour of switching over to other crops.The state government had praised Dhakla farmers on June 11 for taking such initiative after two farmers, both former agricultural minister and BJP state president OP Dhankar’s active workers - Sant Ram and Jaipal Dhankar - had uploaded a video on the social media claiming that they have uprooted the paddy nursery in their fields after farmers of their village unanimously decided not to sow paddy this time. The duo urged farmers to go for crop diversification.Under ‘Mera Pani, Mera Virasat Yojana’, the Haryana government is providing ₹7,000 per acre incentives to farmers for switching from paddy to other crops such as cotton, bajra, maize, pulses and vegetables.This year, the government had also announced to give ₹10,000 per acre per year incentive to farmers for growing 400 trees per acre.Sant Ram said they have conducted panchayats six times in the village asking villagers not to cultivate paddy this time but a few farmers have been raising objections.“These farmers have prepared paddy nursery in their fields and are waiting to start paddy transplantation but we will not allow them to do so. How can 10-15 farmers go against the entire village’s decisions? If they do so, we will uproot their paddy plants. We are facing a waterlogging problem and our houses are damaged due to upper water table. We have asked these farmers to go for crop diversification,” he said.Supporting the government’s move, Jaipal Dhankar said they will not go against the decision taken by majority of farmers to not cultivate paddy this time.“We will keep our fields vacant and go for mustard crop in October. We had uprooted our nursery to support the government’s scheme,” he added.Meanwhile, a group of farmers, led by Ashwani alias Sonu Phogat, on Sunday turned rebel and announced that they will go for paddy transplantation.Showing his paddy nursery in his fields, Ashwani, said over 30 farmers have prepared paddy nursery and will go for its transplantation from June 26.“Last year, I was the only farmer, who had sown paddy on four acre but the villagers mounted pressure on me to clear the fields. They had provided ₹70,000 to me for the expenses and then I followed their decision and cleared my fields. I had grown bajra on 25 acre and the entire crop was damaged due to waterlogging. I had to suffer a loss of ₹6 lakh. This time I had sown sugarcane on 4 acre and will transplant paddy on 21 acre,” he added.Sewa Ram, who had taken 60 acre on lease, said he had suffered a loss of ₹10 lakh after he shifted to bajra.“People have political agendas have made announcements to fulfil their aspirations,” he said.Refuting farmers’ allegations that they have not received incentives last year for switching over to other crops from paddy, Jhajjar deputy director (agriculture) Inder Singh said they have given incentives to 120 farmers hailing from Dhakla village and others’ might had not get as they failed to fulfil all criteria.“This time under the Kheti Khaali –Fir Bhi Khushali scheme, the state government is providing ₹7,000 per incentive to farmers, if they do not grow any crop in their fields on which they have been sowing paddy for many years,” he said.“If anyone wants to grow paddy, we can try to convince them to switch but not punish them for it. No one can uproot any farmer’s paddy crop against their wishes,” he added.Meanwhile, BJP state president OP Dhankar refused to comment on this issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-at-loggerheads-over-paddy-transplantation-in-jhajjar-village-101623783672904.html

According to police officers, the signages will alert motorists about the police presence ahead on the road. “The project was approved to make visible policing more effective,” said a police officer. During the first and second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the personnel on patrol duty faced problems as they did not have facilities to change or relieve themselves. Therefore, such shelters were proposed to be set up.The police officers said that out of the 100 points, the one at Marine Drive promenade has received three shelters, while at Malabar Hill, there are four shelters. “The two areas are vast to man, owing to which they have received the maximum shelters, as more policemen are deployed in those areas for bandobast,” added the officer.Officers said that more such shelters are expected in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/100-shelters-for-cops-on-patrol-duty-in-mumbai-101623783667313.html

16-06-2021||Other||Bombay HC: No stay on screening test for medical graduates with foreign degrees||The Bombay high court (HC) has refused to grant a stay on Foreign Medical Graduate Exam (FMGE) screening test to be held on Friday, June 18, for thousands of students who have secured medical qualifications said to be at par with MBBS degrees from institutes outside India.A group of medical students had filed a petition in HC seeking a stay on the test as the syllabus consisted of curriculum of the entire MBBS programme instead of only the final year, which was posing a problem for them. The court prima facie held that as the exam was intended to test the knowledge acquired by the candidates over the entire undergraduate medical course, and as its criteria was approved by the Union government, National Medical Commission (NMC) (earlier known Medical Council of India) and the National Board of Examinations (NBE) in 2004, it was not staying the test. The court has, however, asked NMC to submit its response to the challenge on the legality of the criteria of the test and posted the hearing of the petition after two weeks. The division bench justice Nitin Jamdar and justice CV Bhadang, while hearing the petition by All India Medical Students Welfare Forum – a group of medical students from across the country – who were challenging the syllabus for the screening test, was informed by advocate Ashok Shetty that students who had completed their MBBS education from Russia and Kazakhstan among other countries, were facing problems as the exam consisted of curriculum of the entire MBBS programme and not the final year only. Shetty submitted that the forum was seeking interim relief by postponing the screening test till the grievances raised by them on the issue of its legality were addressed. However, advocate Ganesh Gole for NMC and NBE submitted that the grievances of the forum was unfounded as the screening tests had been conducted every year and thousands of students had cleared it and had been approved to start their practice. He also placed the minutes of the meeting held in June 2004 following a Supreme Court direction to decide on the criteria and content of the screening test. He added that the minutes were approved by the Centre as well as by the then MCI and NBE, and said that the screening test being conducted now was in consonance with the 2004 decision. Gole then sought time to respond to the issue of legality but urged the court not to postpone the test as the Delhi HC had last week rejected a similar plea which sought deferral of the exam due to the pandemic. He submitted that though there was no irregularity or illegality in the screening test, NMC would file an affidavit within two weeks, which the court permitted. After hearing the submissions the bench said, “Our prima facie reading of the minutes shows that the decision regarding the test was taken not to have syllabus at the level of postgraduate examination, as the difficulty level would be high. According to us, the scheduled test will be carried out to find out if students have acquired knowledge of earlier years of course to reach final year.”The court then observed that the criteria of the test from the minutes indicated that students would have to know the syllabus of the entire course and not only the final-year syllabus. In light of this, the court refused to grant any interim relief and posted further hearing after two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-no-stay-on-screening-test-for-medical-graduates-with-foreign-degrees-101623783487322.html

The three convicts – Mohammed Muzzammil, Mohammed Sadique and Mohammed Akram – have also been convicted for illegal possession of arms. The special court however, acquitted two other accused, Mohammed Iliyas and Mohammed Irfan, in the case. The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) had arrested the five accused in August and September 2012. The group was headed by Akram. The ATS had claimed that the five had links with LeT. The case was later transferred to NIA in June 2013. According to NIA, Akram went to Saudi Arabia on the pretext of seeking employment but met various operatives of LeT and Harkat-ul-Jihad-e-Islami (HuJI). The agency further claimed that during his stay in Saudi Arabia, Akram along with the other accused, hatched a conspiracy at Riyadh to carry out targeted killings of prominent Hindu leaders, journalists, politicians and police officers in various parts of India. To execute the conspiracy, Akram was returned to India and travelled to different part of the country such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Nanded. He was joined by the other accused. NIA claimed that Muzzammil and Sadique acted at Akram’s behest and had conducted reconnaissance (recce) of various monuments and people who they intended to target. The five accused were allegedly part of the module of the LeT operatives busted in Karnataka in 2012, where more than 20 people were arrested by the local police. In 2017, the accused had pleaded guilty claiming that they had already spent the period of minimum imprisonment as under-trial prisoners. However, the plea was rejected by the court on the grounds that the case was at a crucial stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-let-men-get-10-years-in-jail-for-conspiracy-to-eliminate-leaders-101623783367981.html

The zonal railway has sought suggestions and asked if passengers would prefer partial AC local trains along with first class and second class AC compartments inside the existing AC trains. The online survey, which mentions the details of AC train routes, seeks to know if the train could replace local services, if changes are required in the fare structures, and suggestions on operational timings during peak and non-peak hours and for improving the AC train services.According to CR officials, the feedback received from the passengers will be submitted to the railway ministry and be studied, and decisions regarding the AC trains will then be taken.“We want to understand what commuters want, their opinion on fare structure, introduction of first and second-class AC compartments and their preferred route choices. Changes will be made on the operations of the AC local trains after feedback is received,” said a senior CR official. CR introduced its AC train services between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Kalyan railway stations on December 17, 2020. The services were not popular as only 843 passengers travelled on it a month after the trains were introduced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cr-seeks-your-opinion-on-mumbai-s-ac-train-services-101623783252379.html

The next morning, he was shifted to modular ICU-cum OT complex.“After the boy tested positive for the virus, he was shifted to the trauma centre on June 10, since then his parents have disappeared and the address provided by them was found to be fake by police and PGIMS authorities,” they said.PGIMS Covid-19 nodal officer Dr SK Singhal said the child has almost recovered from the virus and is on very low pressure oxygen.“We are trying to find his parents. The boy is stable and is under doctors’ observation. We have lodged a complaint with the Rohtak police about the incident. Police had visited a village in Sonepat as per the address given by the parents but it was a fake address. The phone number provided is switched off since June 10. We suspect that the parents are migrant workers and have either migrated from here or are waiting to receive their boy after treatment,” Singhal added.Nurses and female doctors at the trauma centre said the boy was playful after being admitted but started becoming restless.“Taking care of the boy without his parents was difficult. He was scared of the staff wearing PPE kits. We brought toys to distract him,” a nurse, pleading anonymity, said.PGIMS medical superintendent Dr Pushpa Dahiya said they are waiting for return of the parents.“If his parents do not come back, we will hand him over to the Haryana State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (HSCPCR),” she added.PGIMS police station SHO Shamsher Singh said they had received complaint from PGIMS authorities that a couple had abandoned their child.“We had asked the Sonepat police to trace the parents, but the address provided at the hospital was fake.

16-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai housing society residents raise doubts over Covid-19 vaccination camp||A “vaccination camp” held on May 30 at a Kandivli housing society, Hiranandani Heritage, has left 400-odd beneficiaries concerned about its authenticity after they started receiving certificates from centres that were not supposed to be involved in the inoculation programme, along with incorrect dates. The police and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) are investigating the matter as all the three hospitals and a centre have denied their involvement with the camp. According to residents, they were charged ₹1,260 per dose of Covishield, which they said saw no side effects for any of the beneficiaries. A complaint has been filed by the residents at Kandivli police station.According to residents, the Hiranandani Heritage Residents Welfare Association (HHRWS), a managing body representing three buildings in the residential complex at Kandivli (West), arranged for a vaccination drive for its residents on May 30. The residents were informed that it was in association with Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Andheri. A total of 390 people got inoculated. But they weren’t registered on the centralised Co-WIN portal, as per the rules. After seven-eight days, the residents started getting messages about their vaccination certificates. But to their surprise, they were issued certificates from two private hospitals— Nanavati Max Super Speciality and Lifeline hospitals — and the civic-run NESCO jumbo centre, Goregaon, which does not even hold vaccination in societies. In addition to this, the dates of vaccination were incorrect on the issued certificates. They had paid the Rs1,260 fee between May 27 and 28, while enrolling for the camp. “We didn’t know the rules that on-the-spot registration is compulsory while taking the jab. So, we didn’t demand for spot registration on the Co-WIN portal. After seven-eight days, the beneficiaries started getting calls, seeking the Co-WIN registration OTP received on their phones. Then they received messages of the certificates,” said a resident from the society whose 34-year-old son took the jab. But when he downloaded his vaccination certificate, Nanavati Hospital was mentioned as the vaccinator. “In fact, his date of vaccination is recorded as June 12, which again indicates a spurious activity,” he added. However, the hospital issued an official statement, clarifying that they weren’t involved in the camp. “We wish to clarify that we have not conducted any vaccination camp at the said residential complex. We have informed authorities concerned and are lodging a formal complaint regarding the same,” read the statement. Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of NESCO jumbo centre, said no vials of Covishield have been sent out for the camp. “Firstly, we don’t vaccinate outside our centre. Secondly, being a civic-run centre, we don’t charge the public for the vaccination. If certificates have been issued in the name of NESCO, then how are the people being charged?” A senior officer from Lifeline Hospital, Malad also refuted any involvement in the camp. “After the residents got in touch with us, we also investigated the matter. Though the certificates are real, we didn’t issue those,” said the officer. Many of the residents haven’t received their vaccination certificates yet. “We agreed for the vaccination as it was claimed that it would be done in an association with Kokilaben Hospital. But on the day of vaccination, we were being told that due to staff shortage, they arranged for vaccinators from a nearby private hospital,” said another resident. Dr Santosh Shetty, chief executive officer of Kokilaben Hospital, said, “I am aware of the incident. But we don’t know anyone who got in touch with us for the vaccination. We aren’t filing a police complaint so far as the certificates issued to the beneficiaries don’t mention the name of our hospital.”The residents also said that no one has complained of the usual side effects of fever, body aches or other physical discomfort, which is surprising and hence they suspect the genuineness of the vaccine. “There are doubts about whether we were actually given Covishield or was it just glucose or expired/waste vaccine,” a software engineer Neha Alshi wrote in a Twitter thread. Some residents are even planning to take a spike antibody test to check if it was actually Covid-19 vaccine. No FIR yet, but investigation is underwayThe HHRWS has filed a complaint with Kandivli police station about the matter and demanded investigation of the matter. According to the complaint’s copy, they had arranged the vaccination camp through a person named Pandey, who claimed to be the sales representative of Kokilaben Hospital. Another person named, Sanjay Gupta, who was the coordinator for the camp, did not provide receipts for the payment for vaccines. Later, he had asked the association to make payment to the third person, Mahendra Singh, who had arrived at the end of the vaccination camp. When the members from the Management Committee of Associations (MCA) of the society asked about the certificates, they were being asked to wait for three-four days. “If the vaccine is found to be spurious, the people who got vaccinated will have a medical emergency to deal with. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the whole episode so that such fraudulent activities are not repeated at other places,” the complaint of association states.Police have started their investigation into the matter and recording statements of the organisers. When contacted Vishal Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (zone 11) said that they were verifying the written complaint received by them. “We have not registered an FIR yet. We are verifying the complaint,” said Thakur. Another police officer said that the agent involved in the case had claimed that he had received the doses from Kokilaben Hospital, but had actually used vaccination doses from a few other hospitals, which were surplus or unused and gave the society members certificates from some other hospitals. “The certificates are being verified. We cannot reveal any names at this stage as an FIR has not been registered yet,” said the other officer.Meanwhile, the BMC has also initiated an inquiry into the matter. They have asked their department to find out two major concerns— how the vials were procured and how the names of the hospitals were updated on the Co-WIN portal. They have also sought the issued certificates to check for its verification. “At present, we don’t know much about the issue. We will hold our own investigation into the matter to check how the vials were procured and the authenticity of the data uploaded on the Co-WIN portal,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.Kandivali MLA Yogesh Sagar raised concern over the allegations and demanded stringent action against the culprits. “There are guidelines that need to be followed. If people are vaccinated on May 30, then why would they get inoculation on another day? This would also reflect on the overall figures of vaccination maintained centrally,” he said.

As per the detailed project report (DPR), 396 pillars each will be installed by the Haryana and UP governments in 10 villages of Karnal district alone.Officials working on the project said that a total stretch of about 370km along Yamuna (from Yamunanagar to Gurugram district in Haryana and Saharanpur to Aligarh district in Uttar Pradesh) will be covered.This will help resolve disputes over thousands of acres in 234 villages of both the states.Gaurav Singh, project head of the Survey of India, said, “The demarcation from both the sides in Karnal’s Barhi Kalan village has been completed and work on installation of pillars has been started.”“A meeting will soon take place to start work on the project in other districts and this will cover around 370km of Yamuna belt in both the sides as per the Dikshit Award, 1975 (Haryana and Uttar Pradesh Alternation of Boundaries),” he said.However, no deadline has been fixed yet to complete the project.Farmers hailed the move and said that this was a long-pending demand of farmers from Yamuna belt in both states.“In lack of defined boundaries, we had to face problems as our land is located on both sides of the river. But this move will help end the dispute,” said Ishwar Singh, a farmer from Chogawan village in Karnal.Earlier, officials of the revenue department, especially in Indri tehsil, faced problems as consolidation of land could not take place in some villages and the work of drone mapping could not be completed in villages along the Yamuna belt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pillars-to-mark-haryana-up-boundary-along-yamuna-course-101623783128841.html

The commissioner has directed all cops that instead of asking injured person to first get medical report from hospital (to become eligible to file an FIR/cognisable offense), the police should first help them with an ambulance to safely reach a hospital as soon as possible for medical aid. Policemen found not adopting this approach and procedure, would face departmental action.In his order, CP has stated that it was observed by the top brass of the police force that if an injured person visits police station to file a complaint, police officers do not help the person get treatment. His order stated, “Henceforth, the police shall first issue the injured person a memo for medical examination, make entry in the police station diary and then send a police constable along with the injured person to the government hospital and proceed with the legal procedure after the treatment.”In 2019, a victim of an assault case had visited Chembur police station in injured state. The police first filed an FIR and while going to hospital the complainant suffered a heart attack and died. The case was recently discussed in a meeting headed by Nagrale. Dr Ruchi Sinha from TISS said, “This is a sensitive, pro people, proactive decision, but would need a lot of administrative support. An ambulance will not be available at police stations 24x7. Secondly, while transporting the injured en route to the hospital from the police station if something happens to the person, protocols have to developed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-top-cop-be-sensitive-towards-injured-complainants-101623782707975.html
16-06-2021||Mumbai||Family alleges Air India negligence as pet dog dies on landing in Mumbai||A family from Kolkata that flew to Mumbai on June 11 for an eye surgery of their 22-month-old dog, who suffered from entropion, have alleged negligence by Air India, as the pet, declared “fit to fly” while being taken to the cargo area of the aircraft, died on landing in Mumbai. AI has refuted their claims. Entropion is an abnormality of the eyelids in which the eyelid rolls inward that often causes the hair on the surface of the eyelid to rub against the cornea resulting in corneal ulcers, perforations or pigment developing on the cornea, which can interfere with vision. “I have lost my brother, I hope no other dog travels by Air India,” said 16-year-old Pratyusa Banerjee. Banerjee’s parents alleged that Gultu, of Chow Chow breed, died as a result of the airline’s negligence – first, because the aircraft had an oxygen pressure issue and second, they were informed about Gultu only after reaching the domestic terminal, losing time. Banerjee said after a very rough landing at T2 on June 11, they were first made to go to the international cargo terminal to fill forms, following which they headed to the domestic terminal to get Gultu. As it was raining profusely that day, moving from international terminal to domestic cargo took time. “After Gultu was handed over to us, his body was warm and we consulted the vets who asked us to give him oxygen support and a cardiac injection. However, since nothing was available at the terminal, we rushed Gultu to Crownvet, a Worli- based clinic, but were informed that he died around 45minutes before,” said Banerjee. “Why don’t they (airport) have a vet or an assistant for any kind of emergency related to animals when they know that an airline flies animals as cargo? The situation would have been totally different if Gultu had been attended to immediately,” said Banerjee. “According to the vet, Gultu could have been revived if he was given immediate oxygen and cardiac vial at the airport.” Pets can travel with Air India only if the sender meets all requirements detailed in the Carriage of Pet policy, including providing the cage with prescribed dimension. “In this case, all documents, including indemnity bond, were submitted and necessary criteria met to the satisfaction of both the airline and consignor. In fact, two pet dogs had travelled in the cargo of the same flight AI 676 from Kolkata to Mumbai that day. One of the two dogs had landed fit and fine. The other pet was unfortunately declared dead after arrival. Evidently, no issue related to oxygen was involved in the incident. Live cargo, like pets, are always delivered ahead of other cargo goods from the hold and this time too there was no exception,” said airline spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/family-alleges-air-india-negligence-as-pet-dog-dies-on-landing-in-mumbai-101623782706631.html

In a bid to find a “permanent solution” to this issue, Shinde said, “Every municipal area must prepare a cluster plan for redevelopment of dilapidated buildings in their city. If cluster redevelopment isn’t possible, you must suggest the steps that could be taken as per government policies. As there is a problem of dilapidated building arises in every monsoon season, transit camps should be built in every municipal area for temporary shelter for citizens living in such buildings, for which funds should be provided.” According to a statement from the minister’s office, all municipal commissioners attributed the delay in redevelopment of dilapidated buildings to issues between the owner and occupants, and legal issues over the redevelopment. Last week, a four-storey structure collapsed on a two-storey building in Malwani area of Malad, killing 12 people, including eight children. The structure that collapsed was an illegal building, with only the ground floor sanctioned; the other three were illegal. In May, a five-storey building in Ulhasnagar collapsed, killing seven people. In August 2020, a five-storey building collapsed in Mahad in Raigad district killing 11 people. 36% work of Mumbai coastal road project completed: BMCAround 36% of work of the 10.58km-long Mumbai coastal road project has been completed, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials informed chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a review meeting held on Tuesday.

16-06-2021||Mumbai||Maratha outfits to begin their quota stir in Maharashtra from Wed||Demanding that their quota in government jobs and education be restored immediately, Maratha community outfits will begin statewide agitations from Wednesday. Initially, the protests will be staged in five cities, beginning with Kolhapur on June 16. Later, silent protests will be held at Nashik, Aurangabad, Amravati and Raigad. The outfits have also planned a long march from Pune to Mumbai, if their demands are not met by August. Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, a BJP Member of Parliament (MP), who is a descendant of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji, will lead the protests. On May 5, the Supreme Court quashed the 12% and 13% reservation given in education and jobs to Maratha community under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018. The five-judge bench also refused to refer the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment, setting a 50% cap on reservation, to a larger bench for reconsideration. The state plans to file a review petition in the SC challenging the verdict. It had appointed a committee headed by retired high court judge Dilip Bhosale to study the ruling and suggest a way forward. The committee in its report has recommended the government to move a review petition. Virendra Pawar, one of the convenors from Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM), said they have decided to cover all regions of the state in the beginning. “We will be covering all regions by holding protests at Kolhapur (western Maharashtra), Nashik (north Maharashtra), Aurangabad (central Maharashtra), Amravati (Vidarbha) and Raigad (Konkan),” Pawar said. “The protests will be staged at a gap of around a week as we also need some time to make the arrangements. If our demands are not met till then, we have also planned a long march from Pune to Mumbai. People from the community will cover the entire distance between Pune and Mumbai on foot. It may happen by the first week of August,” he added. The first silent protest at Kolhapur will be held at Shahu Samadhi Sthal, resting place of well-known social reformer Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj, who was also a descendant of King Shivaji. Last time, a huge silent protest was held in Mumbai on August 9, 2017, demanding reservation and justice to a minor girl from Maratha community, who was raped and brutally killed at Kopardi in Ahmednagar district of western Maharashtra. The convenors are also mulling to organise a long march (between Pune and Mumbai) around the same time. Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati has been mobilising the community by holding various meetings of Maratha outfits and leaders across political spectrum. On Saturday, he visited Kopardi in Ahmednagar district to meet the victim’s family and demanded the case be fast-tracked. Kopardi incident became the emotional connect for the Maratha community across the state, which also triggered a large-scale agitation for justice to the victim along with their old demand of reservation to the community. He then visited the of residence Kakasaheb Shinde, a 28-year old Maratha youth in Aurangabad district, who committed suicide by jumping into Godavari river in July 2018. He was the first youth who committed suicide demanding reservation, after which a few more youths from the community ended their lives for the demand. On Monday, he met Udayanraje Bhosale, another descendant of the Maratha king, who expressed strong support for Maratha reservation. The meeting took place in Pune. “We have invited all MLAs and MPs (from the district) to participate in the silent protest to be held tomorrow. We have also decided not to speak a word on Wednesday. Let the public representatives clear what they feel,” Sambhajiraje said in Kolhapur on Tuesday.Many political leaders across political parties are likely to participate in the silent protest. It includes rural development minister Hasan Mushrif (NCP), minister of state for home Satej Patil (Congress), minister of state for health Rajendra Patil Yadravkar (Independent), Kolhapur MP Sanjay Mandlik (Shiv Sena), Hatkanangale MP Dhairyasheel Mane (Shiv Sena), Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi chief Prakash Ambedkar, Jansurajya Shakti Party chief Vinay Kore, Congress MLA (Kolhapur) Ruturaj Patil etc.“Mushrif, Satej Patil and all MLAs from Kolhapur district will participate in the silent protest,” said Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister on Tuesday. “We are trying to find a positive way out of the situation and had asked the community leaders to discuss it with the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, however, they decided to go ahead with the agitation,” he told reporters in Pune.Bhosale said, “I am with Sambhajiraje and have extended my full support to his efforts in getting reservation for the Marathas. We have only one demand and that is reservation for Marathas.” He asked politicians from all parties to hold a special assembly session on the issue of Maratha reservation as soon as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-outfits-to-begin-their-quota-stir-in-maharashtra-from-wed-101623782586662.html

With the locals alleging lack of safety barricades around the construction site, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has ordered an inquiry into the matter and demanded a report on the safety measures and the ongoing work in 24 hours. The Wagle Estate police have arrested civil contractor Abhijeet Boradkar, 37, for negligence. The deceased, Prasan Deulkar, was a resident of Yashodhan Nagar in Thane and recently shifted to Diva. The TMC has suspended a junior engineer of sewage department, Vijay Lokre, who was responsible for supervising the work. Senior police inspector, Wagle Estate police station, DS Dhole, said, “Deulkar had come to stay at his friend’s place on Monday. He was returning at around 6am to Diva when he failed to see the trench as there were no sufficient barricades or signages and fell into the nullah. We received a call from residents around 6am after which the rescue operation was conducted by the Regional Disaster Management Cell (RDMC) of TMC and fire brigade officials. We have sent his body for post-mortem.”Additional commissioner of TMC, Ganesh Deshmukh, in his order, said, “The one-member inquiry set up in the issue will give a report on the name of the company carrying out the work, cost of the project, name of the person in-charge of the day-to-day progress, if enough safety measures were undertaken and the cost under which the project was funded. The inquiry will also focus on finding the exact reason for the accident.” Pradip Pawar, 28, resident of Wagle Estate staying just 20m away from the spot of the accident, said, “The drainage work has been going on for the past one month without installing any indicators around the work. Just near the spot, there is a public toilet. Security guard of that toilet and an auto rickshaw driver were passing through the place and saw a man along with his bike had fallen in the drain. They called me and later we informed all officials.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-biker-falls-into-trench-dug-up-for-work-in-thane-dies-101623782526656.html

16-06-2021||Lucknow||Street food bounces back, in-car dining picks up!||After the relaxation of partial corona curfew in the city on weekdays, the fastest trend to bounce back was the street food outing. As the dine-in is still not permitted, so food lovers are going for their favourite delicacies on takeaway mode and relishing them in their vehicles as well as at the roadsides. Popular food joints like Moti Mahal, Madhurima, Royal Café, Bajpai Kachori, Keval’s tea, Tunday Kababi, Ranjan Café and many more are just providing take-ways. But foodies are seen savouring them in disposable packing standing nearby. “Chai, samosa and bun-makkhan if you take back home then there is no point! We went to Sharma Chaai expecting to get chai-samosa in kulhad and plate but since we just got the packing, we consumed it on bench in the park opposite to the joint,” says Manish Tripathi, a self-confessed ‘chai-baaz’. At Bajpai Kachori shop long queues are back and they are categorically asking people to eat there but puri-lovers can be seen enjoying piping-hot delicacies near the food joint. On bhel-puri, batasha, poha and ice-cream carts and tea stall people can be easily spotted relishing delicacies. “Ab zindagi to chalni hi hai,” says a bhel-puri seller near Press Club. Near fast-food joints on high street, a good number of people are seen picking stuff from takeaways and eating near-by. Kushagra Pandey of Goldmine Rovers Café confirmed, “We are not allowing anyone to eat or park vehicle opposite our café but a lot of them ask to serve in disposable packing and consume in their cars parked away from the cafe. I hope later this week or by next week government will allow dine-in at half capacity as we all have suffered huge losses.” As per latest government orders, dine-in will start from Monday and guidelines will be issued soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/street-food-bounces-back-in-car-dining-picks-up-101623781867298.html

Deputy commissioner of police (east) Priyanka Kashyap said, “The income tax department has been informed about the recovery of the cash. The arrested man’s links with betting operators based in foreign countries, such as Dubai, are being probed.”The man has been identified as Sanjeev Rathore, a mechanical engineer originally from Uttar Pradesh, who was living in an apartment in IP Extension for the past three years.Kashyap said keeping pace with the changing technology, betting operators, like Rathore, who are well versed with the nuances of modern day technology, provide a wide number of choices to aspiring betters. “He provided a window of gambling to any one, sitting in any corner of the world, to place bets on any ongoing game around the globe,” said the DCP.“The betters taking his service had the option to place bets on football, tennis, rugby matches sitting in the comfort of their homes with complete safety and anonymity without the need for making any phone calls in this regard,” she added.Police said Rathore was operating on various online apps such as Sky, Ice, Gold and Diamond specially developed for betting purposes. The betters could download the same from Google Play Store and Apple Store. However, Rathore provided the user IDs and passwords only after receiving a hefty payment and commission, said police.“Being tech-savvy, Rathore had been maintaining an online book, keeping a record of all such transactions for the ‘ease’ of his clients. All dealing was being done in cash. The betters always had the option of redeeming the winning bets in cash from Rathore, which necessitated the need to keep such a large amount of cash at home,” said Kashyap.The police said they are investigating the case further to ascertain the entire network, of which Rathore was a key member, and identify other players.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rs-3-5-crore-cash-seized-from-online-betting-racket-operator-in-east-delhi-101623780907850.html
16-06-2021||Delhi||Bail for Delhi riots accused: Friends and family call it a victory for democracy||Family members and friends of student activists Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal, and Asif Iqbal Tanha, who was granted bail by the Delhi high court on Tuesday in the Delhi riots case, described the order as a “big victory for democracy” and said their faith in the judiciary has been “restored”.The three student activists were booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for allegedly instigating the February 2020 riots in north-east Delhi which broke out in the backdrop of protests against and in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act, which left 53 people dead and more than 400 injured.Both Narwal and Kalita, members of women collective Pinjra Tod, were arrested on May 29 last year on the charges of allegedly hatching a conspiracy along with the other co-accused to orchestrate the riots. Tanha was arrested in May 2020 for allegedly being part of a “premeditated conspiracy” behind the riots.While Devangana and Natasha are MPhil students at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Tanha is pursuing BA (Hons) in Persian from Jamia Millia Islamia.A bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani, while granting bail to Kalita, said, “We are constrained to say, that it appears, that in its anxiety to suppress dissent and in the morbid fear that matters may get out of hand, the State has blurred the line between the constitutionally guaranteed ‘right to protest’ and ‘terrorist activity’. If such blurring gains traction, democracy will be in peril.”Also Read | Right to protest is not a terror act: Delhi high courtTerming the court’s order as a “big victory for democracy”, Devangana’s mother Kalpana Deka Kalita said she had mentally prepared herself for “a long battle”.“It was a big shock for us when she was arrested last year and charged under the UAPA. When I read about the UAPA, we started preparing ourselves and Devanagana for a long battle. There were instances when we would get really worried about her, but she has shown exceptional strength and courage. We knew that she was not guilty since the very beginning. She was just protesting. We are so happy that this has been proved in the court today. It’s a big victory for truth and democracy,” Kalpana said over a phone call from Dibrugarh in Assam, adding she will soon visit Devangana in Delhi.Even as the three student activists were granted bail by the court, they were not released from the jail on Tuesday due to some pending paperwork, said their family members and friends.Natasha’s younger brother, Akash Narwal said if had bail order came a month earlier, she could have spent some time with her father who recently passed away after contracting Covid-19. “I am really grateful that the court has issued such a strong order. It is a victory for democracy. But it is just tragic that it did not come a month early. It’s still difficult to process that she could not speak to him or meet him one last time. This was the first thing that came to my mind, when I got to know about the court’s order.”Tanha’s mother Jahan Ara, who is currently in Jharkhand, said her faith in the judiciary has been restored after the high court order on Tuesday. “It has been a tough year for the entire family. There has not been a day when I was not worried about his safety and well-being in jail. My son is a normal student who wants to study and do something good in life. He was falsely implicated in the case, and I am so glad that the court has acknowledged it. I will soon leave for Delhi. I can’t wait to give him a hug,” she said.Pinjra Tod, the outfit to which both Devangana and Natasha are associated with, also issued a statement welcoming the court’s decision. “We look back at this past year of struggle and what it has a cost — the loss of freedom for Devangana and Natasha and the trials and tribulations of their friends, family, and comrades. We remain inspired by the sheer strength that they and so many others have shown in the face of vicious criminalisation and the onslaught of the state, we send our regards to their family members running from pillar to post to prove their innocence. We reiterate our demand for the release of all political prisoners and the dropping of fabricated conspiracy charges,” they said.Several other student groups, including AISA and Students’ Islamic Organisation of India (SIO), also issued statements welcoming the court’s order and demanding the release of other student activists who are currently in jail and charged under the UAPA.The Delhi Police have decided to challenge the high court order.“We are not satisfied with the interpretation of the provisions of UAPA by the high court in a matter concerned with grant of bail. We are proceeding with filing of a special leave petition before the Supreme Court,” said DCP Chinmoy Biswal, spokesperson, Delhi Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bail-for-delhi-riots-accused-friends-and-family-call-it-a-victory-for-democracy-101623780907226.html
16-06-2021||Delhi||Israeli embassy attack: NIA declares ₹20L to trace suspects||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday released the pictures and videos of two suspects who, according to people familiar with the development, allegedly placed a bomb outside the Israeli embassy at Dr A P J Abdul Kalam Road in New Delhi on January 29 this year. The agency has also announced a reward of ₹10 lakh each for information on the two suspects, who appear to be in their late 20s or early 30s, and are seen roaming near the blast site in the videos.Officials said the visuals to the two suspects are the first major lead in the case.Investigators handling the case told HT that “the suspects, carrying a black bag, were roaming near the Israeli embassy and a lane parallel to Dr A P J Kalam Road half an hour prior to the blast which occurred at 5.11 pm that day”.While no one was hurt in the blast, intelligence agencies had confirmed that it was a terror attack.According to the two videos and pictures released by agency, the suspects removed the jackets they were wearing within a gap of 15 minutes and appear to be waiting on the main Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road.NIA officials are confident that “these two kept the low intensity improvised explosive device (IED) fitted in a beverage can which was attached with a tiny timer, before placing it near a palm tree on the pavement at Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road”.They added that the photos and videos were retrieved from several terabytes of CCTV footage and data examined over the last five months.The explosion coincided with the anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between India and Israel on January 29, 1992.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured the Israeli government that perpetrators will be brought to justice.Israel had said that Iran was behind the attack, a claim confirmed by Indian intelligence agencies in February, attributing it to three reasons – the attack fell on “the 29th anniversary of India-Israel’s diplomatic relation”; the letter left at the site seeking to avenge the killings of Iran Quds Commander Qassem Soleimani and Abu Mehdhi Al Muhandis, in a US drone attack in January 2020, and the Iranian nuclear physicist Dr Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who died in a car bomb attack in Iran in November 2020; and known bitter relations between Iran and Israel.As first reported by HT, a team of Mossad agents had also come to India to discuss the leads with NIA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/first-lead-in-israeli-embassy-attack-nia-issues-pics-of-two-suspects-who-placed-bomb-announces-reward-101623780846534.html
16-06-2021||Delhi||As rains approach, Delhi steps up measures to check dengue||Fearing the spread of vector-borne diseases like dengue, chikungunya and malaria once the monsoon begins, the municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) have launched fumigation and anti-larval medicine spray drives, along with conducting regular inspections at households across the city to prevent mosquito breeding.According to the authorities, the agencies have started surveying households, government and private offices, and educational institutions to check mosquito breeding. Over 2,000 challans have been issued to violators so far, they added.On May 24, the Delhi high court initiated a public interest litigation on the mosquito menace in the Capital and said, if not contained, it would add to the existing problems stemming from the Covid pandemic.According to data provided by the three civic bodies, 31 dengue cases have been reported till June 12 this year, while only 19 cases were reported during the same period last year. The total number of dengue cases last year was 1,072 while it was 2,036 in 2019. No fatalities from dengue have been reported so far.The Capital has also reported only four cases of chikungunya and eight cases of malaria till June 12 this year, while 11 cases of chikungunya and 29 malaria cases were reported during the same period last year.Jai Prakash, mayor of North MCD, said the civic body is spraying anti-larva medicine and regularly conducting fumigation at construction sites, government offices, hospitals, police stations, DTS bus depots, fire stations, education institutions, other private and government offices. “We have also ordered filling of ditches to prevent water accumulation... We will also release Gambusia fish at such locations as it feeds on mosquito larvae. In addition to awareness campaigns, our domestic breeding checkers are also inspecting households too,” said Prakash.Gyanesh Bharti, commissioner of South body, said he has issued instructions, with special emphasis on unauthorised colonies and JJ clusters. “The public health department of the SDMC has contacted 1,157 RWAs and sent over 5 lakh messages to sensitise people. DBC workers have inspected over 18 lakh households. We have sent 2,580 legal notices and issued challans to 625 people,” said Bharti.Mayor of East MCD Nirmal Jain said the civic body is carrying out fumigation. “We have also issued 153 challans,” he said.Doctors said that so far they haven’t received any dengue patients.“But once monsoon showers begin, the mosquito breeding will start and there will be cases of dengue. Currently, most of the fever cases are of Covid-19,” said Dr Srikant Sharma, consultant of internal medicine at Moolchand hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-monsoon-approaches-mcds-take-steps-to-check-dengue-malaria-101623780786585.html
16-06-2021||Delhi||AAP MP Sanjay Singh’s house vandalised||The home of Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh in Delhi’s high-security North Avenue area was vandalised, and his nameplate blackened by unidentified men, ostensibly for alleging corruption in the purchase of a piece of land in Ayodhya by the Ram temple trust. Two of the alleged attackers were caught by Singh’s supporters, and handed over to the police.In his complaint to the police, Singh said he was talking to some people in the lawn around noon, when four-five unidentified men reached there and started shouting slogans “Sanjay Singh ko goli maaro (shoot Sanjay Singh)” and “Sanjay Singh murdabad”, and moved towards the gate , where they defaced the name plate with black ink.Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said a case was registered. “Nobody suffered any physical injury. We have registered a case under sections pertaining to disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant, as well as defacing public property, and arrested the two men. Further investigation is on.”The police declined to share details about the arrested persons, and did not divulge if they were associated with any political party or organisation.On Sunday, Singh alleged that Champat Rai, the general secretary of Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, purchased 1.208 hectares of land worth in Ayodhya’s Bag Bjaisi village for ₹18.5 crore just 10 minutes after the land was sold for ₹2 crores in another deal. He alleged it was a scam perpetrated with the help of trust member Anil Mishra, and sought a probe into the matter by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate.The temple trust denied all allegations, saying the land deal was done in a transparent manner. Champat Rai said the land at Bagh Vijeshwar in Ayodhya was purchased at ₹1,423 per sq feet – lower than market rates. He said that the ₹2 crore deal dated back eight years -- between the property’s previous owners and the ones the trust bought the land from -- but was not registered until now.On Tuesday, Singh tweeted that he will continue to raise the issue. “My house has been attacked. Listen carefully, BJP supporters, no matter how much hooliganism you indulge in, I will not allow the funds collected for constructing the Ram temple to be stolen even if I am killed,” the MP tweeted.Reacting to Singh’s claims, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor called it a “scripted drama”.“Yesterday (Monday), he (Sanjay Singh) tried to malign Ram Mandir construction, today (Tuesday) he claimed an attack on his house. Everything is a scripted drama,” Kapoor tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aap-mp-sanjay-singh-s-house-vandalised-101623780726574.html

The accounts were used for receiving money from investors and routing it further to other accounts managed by the syndicate’s masterminds based in China, said police.The other two arrested men, identified as Ibrahim (25) and Ram Ujagar (50), were “dummy directors” of different shell companies launched solely for the purpose of operating the cheating racket. The three were arrested between June 10 and June 13 from different areas in west and southwest Delhi, said the officers investigating the case.“The company secretary (Kohli) was directly in touch with the Chinese nationals. She had met two-three of them when they had visited India earlier this year. She created 36 shell companies in five to six months, appointed employees and fulfilled other procedures for opening bank accounts and obtaining online payment gateways. The details of the companies and the accounts were further shared with the masterminds in China. Ibrahim worked with her and was also in touch with the Chinese nationals,” said a senior investigator, who did not want to be named.With this, the total number of arrests made in the cheating case has reached 15. “At least a dozen people, including five to six Chinese citizens who are the masterminds of the racket have been identified but are yet to be arrested,” said police.In a press conference held on June 9, deputy commissioner of police (CyPAD) Anyesh Roy had said the Delhi Police busted a nationwide fraud syndicate operated by Chinese nationals had duped over half a million investors after offering them lucrative returns on an online multilevel marketing campaign through their two “malicious mobile applications” Power Bank and EZPlan.The Power Bank app was available on Google Play Store, while the EZPlan app was available on the website www.ezplan.in. “The fraudsters posted the schemes on social media and offered to double the invested amount in 24-35 days. The apps also offered returns on an hourly and daily basis and had investment options starting from ₹300 to several lakhs,” said Roy.While details of 11 arrested fraudsters were shared in the conference, a 40-year-old owner of a Noida-based telecom company dealing in international SIM cards and internet data packs was arrested a day later for allegedly supplying 27 pre-activated Indian SIM cards to the Chinese nationals. The names of the company secretary and the two dummy directors emerged during the investigation and interrogation of the 12 arrested people, said investigators.Police said the footprint of the syndicate was confirmed in West Bengal, Delhi-NCR, Uttarakhand, Bengaluru, Odisha, Assam, and Surat. Nearly ₹11 crore accumulated by the group was blocked in various bank accounts and online payment gateways that were being operated by the members of the syndicate based in India and China. Around ₹97 lakh was recovered from two arrested chartered accountants, one of whom has been identified as Avik Kedia, who formed over 110 shell companies for Chinese fraudsters to route the money through multiple bank accounts, said DCP Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/150crore-online-fraud-three-more-arrested-in-racket-floated-by-chinese-101623780666534.html
16-06-2021||Delhi||DU admissions: Decision on CBSE Class 12 evaluation awaited||While the cancellation of the Class 12 board exams has left a question mark over how Delhi University admissions will be conducted, the varsity has decided to keep the admission process online for the second straight year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Though the rest of the modalities -- including the evaluation process to be determined for Class 12 by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and other boards is yet to be worked out -- one thing appears certain: the university will continue to skip trials to admit students under the sports and extracurricular activities (ECA) quotas.Officials from the Union education ministry and DU also hinted on Tuesday that the varsity may adopt the Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET) for admissions this year. The problem, however, is that CUCET process and format has not been finalised yet.“We have almost decided to conduct sports and ECA admissions on the basis of merit certificates only since it won’t be possible for the university to conduct trials this year as well... knowing that some part of the country might be under lockdown at the time of the process and it will be unfair to the students,” said Rajeev Gupta, chairperson of DU admissions.He added that DU was still waiting for clarity from CBSE on the evaluation of Class 12 results (the board is expected to submit its formula to the Supreme Court on Thursday).“While the admissions will be fully online, it is difficult to make any decision about the changes in the admission process at a time when CBSE and other state boards are yet to decide their evaluation criteria. We have to be as inclusive as possible so we will wait till maximum states announce their evaluation plans and date of declaration of results for class 12 students,” Gupta said.In DU colleges, 5% of supernumerary seats are reserved under sports and ECA categories collectively in each course.Over 60,000 students take admission across 60 plus colleges in DU every year. The university receives maximum number of applications from Delhi, with around 80% students passing from the CBSE board every year.The Union government had on June 1 cancelled the Class 12 exams in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and said the CBSE would come up with a “well-defined objective criteria” in a time bound manner to assess the students. A 13-member panel has been constituted by CBSE to devise and recommend the evaluation process.Officials at DU said they were planning to come up with a Plan B in case the university was not satisfied with the CBSE’s evaluation criteria. DU acting vice-chancellor (V-C) PC Joshi said, “We are waiting for CBSE to announce the criteria so that we can sit and brainstorm. We need to dissect the evaluation process and see if it will be at par with the criteria adopted by other state boards as well.”Joshi, who is also a member of the Centre’s CUCET committee, said that a common entrance test was the best option in the present scenario. “It can bring students from across the education boards at one level. In case DU is not satisfied with the evaluation criteria adopted by CBSE, from where we receive the maximum number of students, we can give 100% weightage to CUCET scores. Otherwise, it will become a big challenge for DU to take admission only on the basis of Class 12 marks,” he said.According to officials and members of the CUCET committee, the entrance exam, which will be conducted by he national testing agency (NTA), will be held online.Officials at the ministry of education suggested that CUCET may get a nod this year. “The government is seriously considering introducing CUCET this year in line with the NEP (National Education Policy), 2020. A final call is expected soon in this regard,” said a senior official who asked not to be named.DU’s admission committee is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to discuss matters related to the admission. “There should be a screening process in case we have to admit students only on the basis of Class 12 marks since these will be the marks allotted using alternative criteria. We just cannot rely on them solely. We will discuss this option soon with the administration,” said a member of the committee.Several experts and students have earlier said that even as a common entrance exam is the best possible solution in the present scenario, the government should avoid introducing any changes in the admission process amid the pandemic. Some students, however, said that they would prefer entrance exams.“Many students might not get as much marks as they would if CBSE class 12 exams had happened. In such a case, many deserving students may be left behind. It’s better if the government conducts a common entrance exam. However, they should inform students well in advance,” said Arpit Sharma, a class 12 student at Bal Bharti School.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/du-admissions-decision-on-cbse-class-12-evaluation-awaited-101623780607281.html
16-06-2021||Delhi||Half of govt vaccination centres for 18+ group shut, says AAP MLA Atishi||Half of the government vaccination centres for people in the 18-44 age group closed down on Tuesday and the remaining half will shut the next day if stocks were not replenished, AAP MLA Atishi said and appealed to the Centre to “carry forward” the vaccination for the category.“As offices and markets are reopening, the young segment will venture out more, and therefore, it was important that they would get vaccinated. Our drive for the 18+ years category was picking up pace, but for lack of doses, it has slowed down again,” she said.In the government’s vaccination bulletin issued online on Tuesday, Atishi said the position is “quite comfortable” for people aged 45 and above, and over 50% eligible people in this group have been vaccinated.She said for people aged 45 and above, as on June 15 morning, 795,000 doses were available, of which Covaxin doses will last for 22 days and Covishield doses for 43 days.On June 14, a total of 60,734 vaccine doses were administered, taking the total number of doses given till date to 6,150,931, according to the bulletin.For healthcare workers, frontline workers and 45 and above age group, 784 centres are running at 626 locations, while for the 18-44 group, 64 centres across 36 locations were earmarked, the bulletin said.Talking about the Delhi government’s “Jahaan vote, wahaan vaccination” drive, Atishi said around 66,000 people in the 45+ age group have been vaccinated since June 8 since the programme was launched that involves sending booth level officers to every household and convincing the beneficiaries in the said age group to take the shot against Covid-19.The initiative involves setting up temporary vaccine sites in polling booths across the city. It is a four-week exercise under which 70 municipal wards are chosen every week. Delhi has around 280 wards. The aim is to increase vaccine coverage for beneficiaries in the 45+ age group.“During the door-to-door drive, we came across a large number of people who were hesitant to take the vaccine. We can cover more beneficiaries in the 45+ age group only by increasing vaccine coverage among the younger age group (18-45 years). At this stage, vaccine stocks for the 45+ group is not a problem. We are running out of stocks for the 18-45 group. We hope that the crisis gets resolved soon,” Atishi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/half-of-govt-vaccination-centres-for-18-group-shut-says-aap-mla-atishi-101623780486478.html

The inoculation drive is being undertaken with the help of NGOs Bosco- UNHCR and United Sikhs.“In pursuance of guidelines and directions of Health and Family welfare,...a special vaccination site has been set up especially for refugees, who don’t have any valid identity card in India,” additional district magistrate (ADM) of West Delhi stated on Monday. “As the entire world is battling the Covid-19 pandemic, it is also important to promote vaccination and vaccinate as many people possible. It will not only ensure prevention of super spreader sites in future but also ensure adherence to all regulatory requirements,” read the statement issued by the ADM.As per UNHCR data, 40,859 refugees and asylum seekers of different nationalities are registered under UNHCR’s mandate in India. The number of refugee and asylum seekers from Myanmar, Afghanistan, and other countries of origin registered with UNHCR India stood at 210,419, 16,333, and 3,477 respectively as of 31 January this year.Narender Taank, nodal vaccination officer, said anyone with a valid refugee identity card could visit the centre for vaccination. “Anyone who falls in the refugee category and possesses a UNHCR identity card is eligible for vaccination here. We are collecting data of such individuals through NGOs and carrying out a special drive to identify such refugees who do not have valid documents,” said Taank.He said the vaccination drive was being undertaken for the greater good since the aim was to cut virus spread. “The site is located in West Delhi but any refugee from across the city can avail of the vaccination facility on producing their refugee card. We will enrol and vaccinate them. Our aim is to ensure no one is left out,” said Taank, adding that the response to the drive has been quite good s far.Pritam Singh, who is among the five directors of United Sikhs in India, said the outfit was helping in vaccinating Afghan Sikh refugees. “We had sought approval from the government for vaccination of Afghani Sikhs. The passport works as a valid document for them. We are trying to vaccinate as many people as we can,” said Singh.Sabber Kyaw Min, founder of Rohingya Human Rights Initiative, said at a time when people across the country, regardless of their nationalities, are worried about getting infected, vaccination for all is a must. “Some Rohingya refugees living in Vikaspuri got the vaccine at the Tilak Nagar site on Monday with the help of UNHCR’s implementing partner. We are awaiting an update on the vaccination process for refugees living in other parts of the city,” said Sabber.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-sets-up-special-vaccination-centre-for-refugees-in-tilak-nagar-101623780307055.html

16-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi accident: 2 killed, 3 hurt as speeding car hits e-rickshaw in Daryaganj||Two people, including a 35-year-old woman, were killed and her husband and two minor children injured after the e-rickshaw they were travelling in was hit by a speeding car near Delite Cinema in central Delhi’s Daryaganj on Monday night, said police.The car driver who fled the spot after the mishap was chased by a biker, who intercepted the car at a police picket near Jama Masjid--more than a kilometre away from the accident spot. The car driver and another occupant of the car were caught with the help of police personnel deployed at the picket, said police.The deceased have been identified as Reshma and Tujeeb (41), the e-rickshaw driver. Police said the couple and their two children were going towards Delhi Gate in an e-rickshaw when a speeding white Hyundai Verna hit the vehicle from behind and dragged it onto the walkway outside Delite Cinema around 10.30pm on Monday. The rickshaw was mangled after it crashed into the concrete bollards on the walkway. All the five occupants of the e-rickshaw were critically injured.“While Reshma and Tujeeb died on the spot, local residents rushed her injured husband and two children to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. All three were unconscious when they reached the hospital. The doctors, however, revived them and saved their lives,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.The condition of Reshma’s husband Amzad Khan (40), and their children--a 14-year-old daughter and an eight-year-old son--is stable and they are out of danger, said police.Jasmeet Singh, deputy commissioner of police (central), said, the car driver fled the spot, took a left turn and drove towards Jama Masjid. A biker, who saw the mishap, followed the car. “As the car slowed down at a police picket, the biker intercepted it and brought his vehicle in front of the car, forcing it to halt. The biker alerted the police personnel at the picket about the mishap. The driver and another occupant of the car were caught and brought to the Daryaganj police station along with their vehicle,” said Singh.“Both the occupants of the car were heavily drunk. We arrested them for rash driving and culpable homicide not amounting to murder under IPC Sections 279 and 304. While the car driver was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, the other man was booked because instead of helping the injured persons, he influenced the driver to flee from the spot,” said Singh.The arrested have been identified as Basant Kumar, the car driver, and his friend Darshan Lal. Police said both are residents of Bagdola village near Dwarka Sector-8 and car mechanics by profession. “The Verna car involved in the mishap belonged to Kumar’s customer, who had given it to him for repairs. The ownership of the car, whose registration number is of Haryana, is being established,” said the DCP.Several locals had gathered at the accident spot and outside the hospital after they learnt about the mishap. Police personnel were deployed to ensure law and order, given that the victims and the occupants of the car were from two different religious communities. However, no untoward incident was reported and the locals left after senior police officers assured them of strict action against the culprits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-accident-2-killed-3-hurt-as-speeding-car-hits-e-rickshaw-in-daryaganj-101623780188520.html
16-06-2021||Pune||Pune district’s death toll up by 2,191 as state health dept reconciles data||Pune district’s death toll due to Covid-19 shot-up by 2,191 deaths as the state health department began the process of reconciling the numbers. On Monday, the state health department reported a total of 15,643 Covid-19 related deaths in Pune district. This, seven days ago on June 7, was 13,452.A total of 2,191 deaths have been added, of which, only 288 were earlier reported within 24 hours. With 2,191 deaths added to Pune district’s death toll, over a seven day period, the district can be said to have been recording an average of 313 deaths every day due to the infection. These deaths include those that were not reported within 24 hours, but were added later, even after a period of one year. The reconciliation process is still ongoing and the stark difference between the state and district data shows that the district has a higher case fatality ratio (CFR) than what has been reported so far.The process of reconciling the records is still ongoing and the state department in its daily note has mentioned that the report is prepared based on figures provided by authorised laboratories on Central government’s Covid-19 Portal. Because the availability of figures is an on-going process, the cumulative numbers are subject to change. The state government has recently been criticised for under-reporting deaths due to Covid-19. However, the stark difference in reporting deaths between multiple government agencies continues. On Monday, while the state government reported a total of 15,643 deaths due to the infection, on the same day, the district health office reported 17,454 deaths, a difference of 18,11.As more deaths are added to the district’s death toll, Pune now has the second highest number of Covid-19 deaths in the state, accounting for 13.88% of the state’s death toll of 112,696. Mumbai with 17,439 fatalities tops the list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-district-s-death-toll-up-by-2-191-as-state-health-dept-reconciles-data-101623778088082.html
16-06-2021||Pune||Pune district has most number of “black fungus” cases in state - 1,216||As per the state health department, Pune district has reported 371 new mucormycosis cases, which takes the progressive count of these “black fungus” cases in the district to 1,216; the highest in any district in the state. A week ago, the district’s count stood at 845 cases. Mucormycosis, a fungal infection, has become a problem for the country, with those having recovered from Covid-19 being affected the most. As of Monday, the state has reported a total of 7,359 mucormycosis cases, of which 16.52% of the cases are from Pune district alone. As per the state mucormycosis report, a week ago, Pune had the second-most number of mucormycosis cases, at 845. With more than 300 new cases since, the district now has the highest number of fungal infection cases in the state. Pune is followed by Nagpur with 1,184 cases. Of the 1,216 mucormycosis cases reported in the district, 253 have been cured, 85 deaths have been reported, and 875 are active cases undergoing treatment. Three patients took a discharge against medical advice. Pune has reported over a million progressive Covid-19 cases as of Monday, which could possibly have resulted in the higher number of mucormycosis cases say experts. Dr Rohini Kelkar, consultant, Clinical Microbiologist and Specialist at Metropolis Healthcare, said, “There has been a surge in the number of Covid cases in Pune because of the second wave of the pandemic. Mucorales are ubiquitous and the spores are found in the environment in decaying vegetable matter, in outdoor air, and in air-conditioning ventilation systems. We inhale thousands of spores daily. The factors that allow the fungus to cause infection in “Rhino-orbito-cerebral” mucormycosis are diabetes in two-thirds of the cases, steroid treatment in 80% and Covid alone in 33% of the cases.”“The incidence of this infection is 70 times higher in India and the fungus is resistant to high temperatures. There are 38 species of Mucorales that cause infection. The common fungus in this instance is Rhizopus arrhizus. The other common agents are Rhizomucor, Leichthemia, Apophysomyces , Saksenaea and Cuninghamella,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-district-has-most-number-of-black-fungus-cases-in-the-state-1216-101623778027826.html

Currently, Pimpri-Chinchwad are under level 3 of the state’s guidelines for easing of Covid norms, with a positivity rate of 5.2%.“We are expecting the positivity rate to be under 5% by Friday. The restrictions were imposed in the market to bring down the positivity rate. Once the positivity rate is under control, relaxations will be provided to traders,” said Vikas Dhakane, additional commissioner, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC).Traders had protested against the P1/P2 regulation for shops being allowed to open, which worked similarly to the parking system. Only shops on one side of the street are allowed to be open on days with odd dates, and the other side opens on days with even dates.“We have been told to keep shops open on an alternate day basis. We met members of the civic administration and they have urged us not to protest till Friday. We are expecting to get permission to open all the shops from Saturday,” said Shrichand Aswani, chairman, Pimpri Merchant’s Federation, an umbrella body of 17 traders’ associations from the Pimpri market.While this rule applies to Pimpri market, other market areas like Kalewadi, Bhosari and Chinchwad were excluded from the odd-even rule.“I did not get the logic of the civic body’s odd-even rule. How will you control footfall by keeping shops open on alternate days. With only a few shops open, the rush increased and footfall remained the same,” said Aswani.Dhakane added, “Pimpri market is a wholesale market. We had also imposed the odd-even rule in Ajmera market. The whole initiative was taken to bring the positivity rate down.”Neeraj Lakhani, who runs a footwear shop in Pimpri market said, “I don’t think the rush of public was less in the market, even with even-odd rule in operation. It a loss for traders, as shops are open only thrice a week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pcmcs-odd-even-rule-for-shops-being-open-likely-to-be-lifted-if-positivity-rate-drops-below-5-101623778026358.html

The plan is to teach them via different ways, instead of only using a blackboard. The focus is on getting them involved in various activities where they can learn joyfully instead of mugging,” said Piyush Shah, a Jai Ganesh volunteer.The three-hour session will be run in a Gujarati school in Budhwar peth, from Monday to Friday.“Teaching these students is not the same as teaching urban children. Many basic etiquettes and manners need to be ingrained before we take them to the academic syllabus. Most of them are not used to sitting in one place, so bringing some educational games and explaining things is important,” said Vasudha Vadke, cultural head, Aaryans World School, Katraj.Volunteers aim is to teach these children basic English in one year so they can perform small skits by June 2022.“Activities-based education is very important, due to the socio-economic background of these children,” said Prasad Bhadsawale, a librarian.“Teaching students in a natural environment and introducing them to colours by giving them various flowers in their hands or different colour stones will make learning activity interesting for them. We plan to design the academic syllabus in a unique way for these children,” said Sarika Agadnyan, a master of social work, and president of the Divya foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/social-group-to-run-education-programme-for-children-of-sex-workers-in-budhwar-peth-101623778027129.html

The prison has no active cases.Of the total of 28,630 under-trials and 5,185 convicts in 46 major prisons, 5,573 under-trials and 2,017 convicts have been vaccinated. Therefore, of a total prison population of 33,815, apart from 41 active cases, 7,590 inmates have been vaccinated.The vaccination at the prisons began at least four months ago. In a nation-wide attempt to decongest prisons, inmates were given an opportunity to apply for emergency parole or temporary bail in two cycles corresponding to the two waves of Covid-19. So far, 1,511 inmates have been released through temporary bail and 188 on emergency parole, according to prison data.When asked how the priority groups for vaccination are decided, Sunil Ramanand, additional director general of police, Prisons, Maharashtra, said, “It has been done as per the rules of the government.

He was sent to judicial custody on Tuesday, following six days police of police remand.According to the police, the warder was identified as Jasvinder Singh of Sirsa, who was posted at the Nimka jail in Faridabad. The police recovered ₹1.11 lakh and jewellery worth ₹5 lakh from his possession.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that Singh is a habitual offender and used to target locked houses of police personnel. “He is a habitual drinker, gambler and drug addict. He started committing crimes to fund his addiction. He was suspended from service after his arrest, but was reinstated. Despite being arrested from Kaithal last year and spending six months in jail, he did not mend his ways and again started striking locked houses in Police Lines,” he said.The police said that Singh joined the prison department as a jail warden in 2003 and lived with his wife and 10-year-old son at the official residence inside the jail premises.Sangwan said that Singh started committing burglaries in early 2019 and in 2020, he was arrested in Kaithal district. He was suspended and sent to jail. After six months, he was released on bail and was allowed to resume his duty as a jail warder. “He has been involved in over a dozen of thefts, three in Faridabad, one in Gurugram followed by one each in Hisar and Jind,” he said.The crime investigation unit of Gurugram tracked him while investigating an incident on December 3, 2020, wherein he was found to have broken into the residence of a head constable while wearing his police uniform.The head constable, Rakesh Kumar, was away with his family when the incident took place. Singh used to take only cash and jewellery, the police said.Almost after six months, the crime unit of Sector 17 recover leads based on CCTV footage and arrested Singh from Faridabad. During the investigation, it was revealed that he used to sell the jewellery to goldsmiths in Hisar and Sirsa.Sangwan said the suspect took advantage of his khakis, as it was similar to that of the police. He was never questioned by the guards and easily made entry to Police Lines. “He managed to enter and exit Police Lines easily, without any suspicion.

Prime minister Johnson's Downing Street office said it would not engage with every allegation made by Dominic Cummings, who left the office late last year.In a blog posting, Cummings intensified his criticism of Johnson and health minister Matt Hancock over their handling of the pandemic, less than a month after accusing the government of being responsible for thousands of avoidable Covid-19 deaths.Despite questioning Johnson's fitness for his role as prime minister and castigating the government's fight against Covid-19, Cummings' criticism has yet to seriously puncture the British leader's ratings in opinion polls.In his posting on Wednesday, Cummings posted screenshots of the conversations, which he said were with the prime minister, in which Johnson responded to Cummings' complaints about the slow progress of Hancock's efforts with the words "Totally (blanked expletive) hopeless".Cummings said people should ask Johnson why he had kept Hancock in his position if he thought so little of him.Johnson's spokesman said he had not asked the prime minister directly about the new allegations, and declined to comment on the authenticity of the exchange."I don't plan to engage with every allegation made. The prime minister has set out that we will hold a public inquiry next year, the health secretary has given hours of evidence to the parliamentary committee and I have taken a number of questions on this issue previously," he told reporters."Our focus is on recovering from the pandemic, moving through the road map, distributing vaccines and delivering on the public's priorities."'CRACKERS'The deputy leader of the main opposition Labour Party, Angela Rayner, said the "questions raised today go to the heart of the prime minister’s direct and personal responsibility for the UK’s shocking death toll".In seven hours of questioning by a parliamentary committee last month, Cummings had said it was "crackers" that Johnson was prime minister and aired particular disdain for Hancock, accusing him of repeatedly lying in government meetings.Hancock rejected the allegations and some in the Conservative Party say that Cummings has an axe to grind after being forced from his post.But in his latest blog, Cummings goes into how he remembers day-to-day decisions and underlines his criticism of the prime minister, who he accused of taking things offline "as soon as things get 'a bit embarrassing' ... before shouting 'forward to victory', doing a thumbs-up and pegging it out of the room".He again said Johnson wanted to leave office, saying he "had a clear plan to leave at the latest a couple of years after the next election".Johnson's spokesman quoted the prime minister's words when similar allegations were raised, calling them "utter nonsense".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/totally-hopeless-boris-johnson-lambasted-his-health-minister-ex-adviser-says-101623858667534.html

Biden was addressing a press conference after the high-stake historic meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday. Biden says he told Putin he will always raise issues of 'fundamental human rights,' including Navalny, jailed Americans.Pressing hard on human rights and making it a key highlight of his address, Biden said "human rights is always going to be on the table"."How could I be the president of the United States and not speak out about human rights? It's not just about going after Russia, but it about who we are," Biden said. On being asked about what happens if opposition leader and critic of Russian government Alexei Navalny dies, Biden warned of devastating consequences. Biden said there is no substitute for face-to-face meeting between two leaders. Biden underlined the discussions during his first summit with Putin as "positive", but warned his Russian counterpart that Washington would not tolerate interference in US democracy."The tone of the entire meeting... was good, positive," Biden told reporters after the summit in Geneva, stressing though that he "made it clear that we will not tolerate attempts to violate our democratic sovereignty or destabilise our democratic elections and we would respond."On the other hand, Putin countered the conversation and defended Navalny's prison sentence. Deflecting repeated questions about mistreatment of Russian opposition leaders, Putin highlighted the domestic turmoil in the US, including the Black Lives Matter protests and the January 6 Capitol insurrection.Marking a key development, the Russian President Putin, who addressed the reporters first among the two leaders said he and US President have agreed in a “constructive” summit to return ambassadors to their posts, lowering tensions and beginning consultations to replace the last remaining treaty between the two countries limiting nuclear weapons.Putin said there was “no hostility” during the talks that wrapped up more quickly than expected.Stretching for a little over three hours with just one break in between, the summit saw the two global leaders agreeing in principle to begin consultations on cybersecurity issues, even though Putin continued to deny US allegations that the Russian government was responsible for a spate of recent high-profile hacks against business and government agencies in the United States and around the globe.The two sides had said they expected to meet for four to five hours but spent less than three hours together, including an opening meeting with just the two presidents and each one's top foreign aide.Biden and Putin plunged into the face-to-face talks Wednesday at a lush lakeside Swiss mansion, a highly anticipated summit at a time when both leaders say relations between their countries are at a low point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-no-agenda-against-russia-but-for-america-after-summit-with-putin-101623862585221.html
16-06-2021||World||Putin satisfied with Biden’s ‘killer’ comment explanation; diplomats to return||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said that the Kremlin and Washington have agreed to return ambassadors to each other's capitals after they were withdrawn earlier this year. Speaking at a news conference after meeting with US President Joe Biden in Geneva, Putin said the ambassadors will return to their posts and take up their functions, adding that the question of when the diplomats would return to their post is a “purely technical one.”US-Russia relations have deteriorated for years, and the strained bilateral ties further soured when Biden said he thought Putin was a "killer". Biden’s remark prompted Russia to recall its ambassador to Washington for consultations. The United States recalled its ambassador in April. Putin also said that he was satisfied with Biden’s explanation over “killer” comments.Also Read | Chaos at Biden-Putin summit as US, Russian reporters yell, shove to enter roomBiden and Putin met at a stately 18th-century mansion in Geneva for a high-stakes summit amid heightened tension between the two rival nations. Their official meetings were broken into two rounds and ended earlier than initially predicted by officials. Both sides had played down the prospect of any major breakthroughs at the summit and the two leaders had decided to hold separate press briefings, unlike the last meeting between Putin and former President Donald Trump after their summit in Helsinki.On the question of the recent spate of cyberattack cutting across sectors in the United States, Putin said the two countries are going to begin consultations on cybersecurity. “We believe that cyberspace is extraordinarily important. In general, and in particular for the US, and to the same extent for Russia,” he said. However, Putin claimed that Russia was also a victim of cyberattacks.“We encounter this every year...In the US, I don't think that the US administration is particularly interested in organising that or looking into it. All they do is make insinuations. What we need is expert consultations between us. We agreed to that, in principle, Russia is prepared for that,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-satisfied-with-biden-s-killer-comment-explanation-diplomats-to-return-101623861785854.html

In February, Navalny was given a 2 1/2-year prison term for violating the terms of a suspended sentence from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that he dismissed as politically motivated.Speaking Wednesday after a summit with US President Joe Biden in Geneva, Putin said Navalny received his due punishment for violating the terms of his probation, adding that he was aware that he was facing a prison sentence when he returned to Russia.“He deliberately moved to be arrested,” Putin said, sticking to his habit of not mentioning Navalny by name.Last week, a Moscow court outlawed the organisations founded by Navalny by labeling them extremist, the latest move in a campaign to silence dissent and bar Kremlin critics from running for parliament in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alexei-navalny-deserved-prison-sentence-says-putin-101623861027837.html

But during the Covid-19 pandemic it fell into disrepair and collapsed in March.Members of the affected communities, such as the Huinchiri, decided to rebuild the 30-meter (98.43 ft) long bridge in the traditional Incan style: by weaving it.Teams of workers, starting from both sides of the ravine and balancing on giant main ropes that had been stretched over the river, worked towards the center putting in place smaller ropes as barriers between the handrail ropes and the walkway's floor."Last year because of the pandemic, it wasn't strengthened ... That is why at the beginning of this year the bridge fell," said Cusco Regional Governor Jean Paul Benavente."But now it is like an answer to the pandemic itself. From the depths of the Peruvian Andean identity, this bridge is strung up across the Apurimac basin and we can tell the world that we are coming out if this little by little."Also Read | Peru: Artist portrays pain and suffering from Covid-19 pandemic in 100 drawingsIn 2013, Unesco recognized the skills and traditions associated to the reconstruction of the Q'eswachaka bridge as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.Peru is rich in ancient treasure.

More than 500 years of a paradox in time. The Q'eswachaka, this Incan living bridge, is really an expression and cultural manifestation," added Benavente."This is community, in this particular case, the Huinchiri community from the Quehue district is currently working to string up this bridge that connects villages, but that also connects traditions and connects culture."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/peruvians-re-weave-500-year-old-incan-string-bridge-frayed-in-pandemic-101623852715412.html

Nasa flight engineer Shane Kimbrough and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet exited the space station and set their spacesuits to battery power at 8:11am ET (5:41pm IST), marking the start of a six and a half hour spacewalk to install the first two of six ISS Roll-Out Solar Arrays (iROSAs).The new solar arrays had arrived at the station in the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft as part of the company’s commercial resupply services mission to the station. Nasa said that though the current solar arrays are functioning well, they have begun to show signs of degradation since they were designed for 15-year service life.The US space agency live-streamed the spacewalk as the astronauts from Nasa and ESA worked to replace the solar arrays. In a 40-second clip shared by Nasa, ESA astronaut Pesquet can be seen using a Pistol Grip Tool (PGT) to break bolts on the carrier housing the new solar arrays, with a breathtaking view of Earth in the background.“Breathtaking views from today's spacewalk as astronauts @Thom_astro and @astro_kimbrough continue their work to install and deploy the first of the new solar arrays,” tweeted International Space Station from its official handle.An amazing view of @Thom_Astro using a Pistol Grip Tool (PGT) to break bolts on the carrier housing the @Space_Station's new solar arrays. @Astro_Kimbrough is at a different worksite routing harnesses for a future task. pic.twitter.com/3iUUbCNqQ2Also Read | Nasa says newly-discovered exoplanet could have water clouds and a ‘tail’The original solar arrays were deployed in December 2000 and have been powering the space station for more than 20 years.

16-06-2021||World||In first summit with Biden, Putin sees 'a lot of issues'||With deep disagreements likely and expectations of solving them low, US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin sat down in a lakeside Geneva villa on Wednesday for their first summit since Biden took office.Both have said they hope their talks can lead to more stable and predictable relations, even though they are at odds over everything from arms control and cyber-hacking to election interference and Ukraine.Putin and Biden shook hands on arrival before going inside."Mr President, I'd like to thank you for your initiative to meet today," Putin said, sitting next to Biden, adding: "U.S. and Russian relations have a lot of issues accumulated that require the highest level meeting."Biden said they would try to determine areas of cooperation and mutual interest. "It is always better to meet face to face."Aides had earlier downplayed hopes for the summit."We're not expecting a big set of deliverables out of this meeting," a senior U.S. official told reporters, saying the leaders were expected to talk for four or five hours."I'm not sure that any agreements will be reached," said Putin's foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov.The first round of talks - which included Biden, Putin, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov - lasted almost two hours, officials said.Talks resumed after a break, with Moscow's ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, who was recalled to Russia in March, among those present.Relations between Moscow and Washington have been deteriorating for years, notably with Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, its 2015 intervention in Syria and U.S. charges - denied by Moscow - of meddling in the 2016 election that brought Donald Trump to the White House.They sank further in March when Biden said he thought Putin was a "killer", prompting Russia to recall ambassador Antonov to Washington for consultations. The United States recalled its ambassador in April.The senior US official said the United States was looking at "areas where working together can advance our national interests and make the world safer".Peskov said the two presidents would "need to determine how to proceed with the heads of the diplomatic missions", according to Russian news agencies.While the issues may be vexing, the immediate surroundings of Villa La Grange, an elegant mansion set in a 30-hectare (75-acre) park overlooking Lake Geneva, will be serene.The summit perimeter was under heavy police guard.ARMS CONTROLArms control is one domain where progress has historically been possible despite wider disagreements.In February, Russia and the United States extended for five years the New START treaty, which caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads they can deploy and limits the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them.The senior US official said Biden would also define areas of vital national interest where Russian misconduct would bring a response. Biden signed an executive order in April giving Washington wide latitude to impose sanctions on Moscow.In a sign of the strain in ties, the talks will not include any meals, and Putin, 68, and Biden, 78, are expected to hold separate news conferences rather than a joint one."No breaking of bread," said the senior US official.Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat, told Reuters Putin wanted Russia to be treated with respect, as members of the Soviet Politburo were in the 1960s-1980s, with "a symbolic recognition of Russia's geopolitical parity with the US"."In exchange, they (Moscow) would be willing to cut back on some of the loony stuff," Frolov said. This might mean "no poisonings, no physical violence, no arrests/kidnappings of US and Russian nationals; no interference in domestic politics".Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center think-tank, set the bar low for Wednesday's talks."The principal takeaway, in the positive sense, from the Geneva meeting would be making sure that the United States and Russia did not come to blows physically, so that a military collision is averted," he said.In contrast to Trump, whose 2018 summit with Putin in Helsinki included a meeting accompanied only by interpreters, Biden and Putin are not expected to have any solo dealings.Standing beside Putin in Helsinki, Trump refused to blame him for meddling in the 2016 US election, casting doubt on the findings of his own intelligence agencies and sparking a storm of domestic criticism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-first-summit-with-biden-putin-sees-a-lot-of-issues-101623855256490.html

It remains unclear whether they will do a prisoner exchange deal, though Putin said beforehand he was open to one.Here are some of the individuals who could be freed if such a swap was agreed.Paul Whelan, 51Washington has demanded the release of Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine convicted of espionage last June and sentenced to 16 years in jail. Whelan has denied spying and says he was set up in a sting operation.Moscow said that Whelan, who holds US, British, Canadian and Irish passports, had been caught red-handed with classified information in a Moscow hotel room where agents from the Federal Security Service detained him on Dec. 28, 2018.Whelan said he was in Russia for a wedding and on holiday and set up by a Russian man he thought was a friend.Whelan, who is being held in a high-security prison eight hours drive from Moscow, denounced the proceedings against him last June as a "sham trial". Russia has sent mixed signals as to whether it would be ready to free him in a deal.Also Read | Biden, Putin shake hands to kick off Geneva summit. Top 5 issues likely to be discussedTrevor Reed, 29The United States has criticised the trial of Trevor Reed, another former U.S. Marine jailed for nine years last July, as the "theater of the absurd" and lacking serious evidence.Russia convicted Reed, a student at the University of North Texas, of endangering the lives of two police officers who had detained him in August 2019 when he grabbed an officer who was behind the wheel of a car, causing the vehicle to swerve dangerously.Reed said he could not remember the events because he was drunk when detained after leaving a party in Moscow, but denied the charge in court after hearing what he said was the flimsy evidence presented during the trial and the investigation's failure to obtain video evidence that could prove his innocence.In comments which upset his family, Putin, in an NBC interview before the summit, described Reed as "a drunk" and "a troublemaker.""As they say here, he got himself shitfaced and started a fight. Among other things, he hit a cop," said Putin.Viktor Bout, 54The United States is holding Viktor Bout, a Russian arms trafficker serving a 25-year prison sentence for plotting to sell missiles to people he thought were Colombian rebels.Bout, subject of a book called “Merchant of Death” and inspiration for a film “Lord of War” starring Nicolas Cage, was arrested in Thailand in 2008.US authorities said he had agreed to sell arms to US undercover agents posing as Colombian guerrillas planning to attack American soldiers.Bout, who protested his innocence, was convicted in 2011 and Russia has long sought his release.He is now in a prison in Marion, Illinois, and only eligible for release in January 2030.Also Read | Chaos at Biden-Putin summit as US, Russian reporters yell, shove to enter roomKonstantin Yaroshenko, 52Russia has long urged Washington to release pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, who is serving 20 years in the United States for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the country.

"The health situation is improving faster than we had anticipated, everywhere in mainland France."Across the Channel in Britain, whose vaccination programme is far ahead of France's, a plan to lift most remaining restrictions has been put back a month to July 19 because of the rapid spread of the Delta variant of the virus, which is more infectious, can render vaccines less effective against mild disease, and may put more unvaccinated people in hospital.The variant accounts for the bulk of new infections in Britain, but French Health Minister Olivier Veran said on Tuesday it only represented 2-4% of confirmed cases in France.He warned that if the Indian variant became dominant in France, it could lead to another wave of infections.Castex said pressure on French hospitals had decreased significantly. The number of people in intensive care units was down by 116 to 1,952 on Tuesday, according to health ministry data.France's seven-day moving average of new cases, which was above 40,000 two months ago, stood at 3,500 on Tuesday. French health experts say the pandemic can be considered under control if the rate is below 5,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-starts-returning-to-normal-after-covid-19-outbreak-ends-night-curfew-101623849704101.html

16-06-2021||World||'Two great powers': Biden, Putin plunge into hours of talks||With stern expressions and polite words before the cameras, President Joe Biden and Russia's Vladimir Putin plunged into hours of face-to-face talks Wednesday at a lush lakeside Swiss mansion, a highly anticipated summit at a time when both leaders agree that relations between their countries are at an all-time low.Biden called it a discussion between “two great powers” and said it was “always better to meet face to face.” Putin, for his part, said he hoped the talks would be “productive.”The meeting in a book-lined room had a somewhat awkward beginning — both men appeared to avoid looking directly at each other during a brief and chaotic photo opportunity before a scrum of jostling reporters.Biden appeared to suggest that he can take the Russian leader at his word, nodding his head when asked by a reporter if Putin can be trusted. The White House later sent out a tweet insisting that the president was “very clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgment to the press generally.”Putin ignored shouted questions from reporters, including if he feared jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.The two leaders did shake hands — Biden extended his hand first and smiled at the stoic Russian leader — moments earlier when they posed with Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who welcomed them to Switzerland for the summit.The two are expected to meet for four to five hours of wide-ranging talks.For months, they have traded sharp rhetoric. Biden has repeatedly called out Putin for malicious cyberattacks by Russian-based hackers on U.S. interests, a disregard for democracy with the jailing of Russia's foremost opposition leader and interference in American elections.Putin, for his part, has reacted with whatabout-isms and obfuscations — pointing to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol to argue that the U.S. has no business lecturing on democratic norms and insisting that the Russian government hasn't been involved in any election interference or cyberattacks despite U.S. intelligence showing otherwise.Now, the pair are meeting for the first time face-to-face as leaders. In advance, both sides set out to lower expectations.Even so, Biden said it was an important step if the United States and Russia were able to ultimately find “stability and predictability" in their relationship, a seemingly modest goal from the president for dealing with the person he sees as one of America's fiercest adversaries.“We should decide where it’s in our mutual interest, in the interest of the world, to cooperate, and see if we can do that," Biden told reporters earlier this week. “And the areas where we don’t agree, make it clear what the red lines are."Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that no breakthroughs were expected and that “the situation is too difficult in Russian-American relations.”“However, the fact that the two presidents agreed to meet and finally start to speak openly about the problems is already an achievement," Peskov said several hours before the summit's start.Arrangements for the meeting were carefully choreographed and vigorously negotiated by both sides.Biden first floated the meeting in an April phone call in which he informed Putin that he would be expelling several Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against dozens of people and companies, part of an effort to hold the Kremlin accountable for interference in last year’s presidential election and the hacking of federal agencies.Putin and his entourage arrived first at the summit site: Villa La Grange, a grand lakeside mansion set in Geneva’s biggest park. Next came Biden and his team. Putin landed in Geneva on Wednesday shortly before the scheduled start of the meeting; Biden — who was in Europe for a week of meeting with allies — arrived the day before.The three spent a moment together in front of the cameras, but only Parmelin made remarks.Biden and Putin were first holding a relatively intimate meeting joined by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Each side will have a translator.The meeting will then expand to include five senior aides on each side.After the meeting concludes, Putin is scheduled to hold a solo news conference, with Biden following suit. The White House opted against a joint news conference, deciding it did not want to appear to elevate Putin at a moment when the president is urging European allies to pressure Putin to cut out myriad provocations.Biden sees himself with few peers on foreign policy. He traveled the globe as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and was given difficult foreign policy assignments by President Barack Obama when Biden was vice president. His portfolio included messy spots like Iraq and Ukraine and weighing the mettle of China's Xi Jinping during his rise to power.He has repeatedly said that he believes executing effective foreign policy comes from forming strong personal relations, and he has managed to find rapport with both the likes of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom Biden has labeled an “autocrat,” and conventional politicians like Canada's Justin Trudeau.But with Putin, who he has said has “no soul," Biden has long been wary. At the same time, he acknowledges that Putin, who remained the most powerful figure in Russian politics over the span of five U.S. presidents, is not without talent. Biden this week suggested that he is approaching his meeting with Putin carefully.“He’s bright. He’s tough," Biden said. “And I have found that he is a — as they say...a worthy adversary."The White House held on to hope of finding small areas of agreement.No commitments have been made, but according to the senior administration official, there are hopes that both sides will return their ambassadors to their respective postings following the meeting. Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, was recalled from Washington about three months ago after Biden called Putin a killer; U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan left Moscow almost two months ago, after Russia suggested he return to Washington for consultations.Both ambassadors will be in Geneva during Wednesday's meeting.Biden administration officials say they think common ground can be found on arms control. International arms control groups are pressing the Russian and American leaders to start a push for new arms control by holding “strategic stability” talks — a series of government-to-government discussions meant to sort through the many areas of disagreement and tension on the national security front.The Biden team will press its concerns on cybersecurity. In recent months, Russia-based hackers have launched alarming attacks on a major U.S. oil pipeline and a Brazil-headquartered meat supplier that operates in the U.S.The Russian side has said that the imprisonment of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is an internal political matter and one area where Putin won't engage Biden. But the senior Biden administration official said there “is no issue that is off the table for the president," suggesting Navalny will come up.The meeting is sure to invite comparisons with President Donald Trump's 2018 meeting with Putin in Helsinki, where the two leaders held a joint news conference and Trump sided with Russian denials when asked whether Moscow had meddled in the 2016 presidential election.Biden has prepared for his one-on-one by reviewing materials and consulting with officials across government and with outside advisers. Aides said the level of preparation wasn't unusual. Biden, in a brief exchange with reporters upon a rriving in Geneva on Tuesday night, sought to offer the impression that he wasn't sweating his big meeting.“I am always ready,” Biden said.___Associated Press video journalist Daniel Kozin contributed reporting—-This story has been corrected to show that Geneva is not Switzerland's capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-great-powers-biden-putin-plunge-into-hours-of-talks-101623847417987.html

There was no word of Israeli casualties.The incident follows a rise in tensions after a Jewish nationalist march in Jerusalem on Tuesday drew the launch of incendiary balloons across the Gaza border and retaliatory Israeli air strikes.The Israeli military said the Palestinian woman "attempted to ram into a number of IDF (Israel Defence Forces) soldiers" near the Palestinian village of Hizma, northeast of Jerusalem."After the car-ramming attempt, the assailant exited her vehicle with a knife drawn ... The soldiers responded with fire towards the assailant and neutralised her," the military said in a statement.There has been a rise in violent incidents in the West Bank in recent weeks.Last Thursday, Israeli special forces killed an Islamic Jihad militant and two Palestinian security men in an exchange of fire in the northern West Bank city of Jenin.Two Palestinians were killed in separate incidents on Friday and Saturday, the first during a clash with Israeli troops in the West Bank and the second while wielding a knife at military checkpoint near Jerusalem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinian-woman-shot-dead-in-west-bank-after-attempted-attack-israeli-army-101623841063352.html

Top 5 issues likely to be discussed||US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday shook hands at a stately 18th-century mansion in Geneva, kicking off a high-stakes summit amid heightened tension between the two rival nations. Opening the summit, Putin said he hopes for a 'productive' meeting, while Biden stressed 'it is always better to meet face to face.'"I know you've been on a long journey and have a lot of work," Putin said."Still the US and Russia...relations have a lot of issues accumulated that require the highest level meeting and I hope that our meeting will be productive," he added.Ahead of the meeting, Putin said last Friday that Russia’s bilateral relationship with the US has hit its nadir, noting that Biden is a “radically different” person than his predecessor, Donald Trump. During a press conference after the G7 summit in England, Biden admitted that the bilateral ties with the Kremlin are at a low point.US-Russia relations have deteriorated for years, particularly after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, its intervention in Syria, and the alleged interference in US elections, a charge Moscow has denied. The strained bilateral ties further soured when Biden said he thought Putin was a "killer", prompting Russia to recall its ambassador to Washington for consultations.Also Read | '5 hours, no meals': What Biden-Putin marathon summit maybe likeBoth sides have played down the prospect of any major breakthroughs at the summit and the two leaders won’t hold a press conference standing side-by-side. When asked about why the US president didn’t choose to stand side-by-side with Putin and call out Russia’s disruptive actions, Biden said that it is not a “contest about who can do better in front of a press conference to try to embarrass each other.”"We're not expecting a big set of deliverables out of this meeting," a senior US official told reporters, saying the duo are expected to talk for four or five hours.Here are the top 5 issues Biden and Putin are expected to discuss:Cyberhacking: Launched by criminal syndicates based in Russia, the recent spate of ransomware attacks cutting across sectors in the US has been one of the most critical issues for the Biden administration. The US president is expected to underscore Washington’s plan to respond to such attacks.Election interference: A landmark report by the US intelligence community claimed that the Russian government meddled in the 2020 presidential elections, detailing a massive disinformation push in favour of Donald Trump. In October last year, Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said that Russia had obtained voter information ahead of the presidential elections to influence public opinion. While Russia has dismissed these reports, Biden is likely to raise the concern with Putin during the marathon meeting.Also Read | Joe Biden suggests 'autocrat' Putin's Russia might be weaker than it seemsHavana Syndrome: More than 130 US officials have been impacted by the “mysterious” episodes that precipitated unexplained brain injury known as ‘Havana syndrome’, according to a New York Times report. The officials afflicted by Havana syndrome include US diplomats, spies and defence officials who were on overseas assignments. Quoting sources in the Pentagon, the report hinted at the possible involvement of Russian military intelligence agency GRU behind some of these episodes. The issue may come up during the summit.Ukraine: The issue of Ukraine is also likely to come up as a recent military build-up in the area around eastern Ukraine triggered a strong response from the West. The United States had then warned of “consequences”. White House press secretary Jen Psaki had said at a daily briefing that the US was in close consultation with its allies in the region over Russia’s troop movements.Human Rights: According to a CNN report, Biden will raise the issue of human rights but it is not confirmed whether the US president would discuss the opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who was poisoned in a flight and was later jailed in Russia following his return from Germany after receiving treatment in Berlin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-putin-shake-hands-to-kick-off-geneva-summit-top-5-issues-to-come-up-101623844946855.html
16-06-2021||World||Large methane leak detected over South Africa coal mining region||A cloud of methane was detected by satellite near coal mines in South Africa, drawing attention to a lesser-known environmental risk that comes from using the dirtiest fossil fuel.The potent greenhouse gas — methane traps roughly 84 times more heat than carbon dioxide in its first two decades in the atmosphere — was emitted at an estimated rate of 65 metric tons an hour on May 10, according to Kayrros SAS. The Paris-based analytics company found the leak by parsing European Space Agency satellite observations. It was the worst plume of methane Kayrros detected in the data over Africa this year.The cloud was spotted about 125 kilometers (78 miles) east of Johannesburg in an area where Sasol Ltd. has several coal mines as well as chemical and fuel operations. Sasol said it didn’t record any elevated methane levels that day and that emissions from its mining operations “are highly diluted and dispersed over a wide geographical area.” Anglo American Plc said its open-cast Isibonelo mine located nearby is “highly unlikely to emit the levels” estimated by Kayrros.While coal is falling out of favor as an energy source because of the large amount of CO₂ generated as it’s burned, mining the fossil fuel also causes methane emissions because companies sometimes release the gas trapped underground to lower the risk of explosions. Methane can continue leaking after mines have been closed or abandoned. The industry is expected to generate about 10% of methane emissions caused by humans by the end of the decade, according to the Global Methane Initiative. The problem can be mitigated if miners capture the gas and use it for power generation, coal drying or as supplemental fuel for the boilers, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It makes sense for companies to take the extra steps because they help boost production and increase revenues. That’s especially true in South Africa, which still depends on coal to generate more than 80% of its electricity.If the May 10 release lasted an hour at the rate estimated by Kayrros it would trap roughly the same amount of heat as about 260,000 cars driving at 60 miles an hour, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. The satellite data didn’t show the duration of the leak.The estimated rate correlates with a 3% concentration of methane in the air, Sasol said. The company immediately shuts down operations when any of its sensors register a level of 1% due to the highly combustible environment. Sasol said its analyzers didn’t record readings greater than 0.05% on average that day. South Africa’s Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries didn’t respond to queries about the event.Kayrros also found two other plumes in the vicinity on May 27, which it estimated had emissions rates of more than 40 tons of methane per hour.The findings are the latest in a series of leaks that have been spotted in countries including Canada and Bangladesh. Scientists are just beginning to pinpoint the biggest sources of methane and existing data isn’t yet globally comprehensive. Observations from space can be seasonal due to cloud cover, precipitation and varying light intensity. Satellites can also have difficulty tracking offshore emissions and releases in higher latitudes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/large-methane-leak-detected-over-south-africa-coal-mining-region-101623837006359.html

In an article shared on WeChat, China’s state-run news agency Xinhua compiled more than 10 tweets ridiculing the US embassy announcement about donation, and wrote, "Would this be selected for the Worst Public Relations Award of the Year?"The US and China have been competing for global influence by garnering goodwill from vaccine donation commitments to desperate governments amid a global shortage. While the United States announced large scale vaccine donations after administering Covid shots to the majority of its adult population, China got a head start by donating domestically made vaccines to emerging countries.Last week, US President Joe Biden pledged to donate 500 million doses of Pfizer Covid vaccine to 92 low- and lower-middle-income countries and the African Union, on top of 80 million doses it has already pledged to donate by the end of June. The White House said it will be the largest-ever purchase and donation of vaccines by a single country.Also Read | Joe Biden says US to donate 500 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, urges global leaders to joinOn Monday, the US Embassy to Port of Spain said on Twitter that its Covid-19 vaccines donation to Trinidad and Tobago includes 80 vials of Pfizer shots.

The unnamed Australian woman said that the rape occurred when she, along with a group of her friends, was visiting New York City to celebrate New Year’s Eve in 2015, reported Bloomberg as part of a wider investigation into safety standards of the vacation rental company.The victim and her friends picked up the keys to the Airbnb property, popular with tourists in New York where most short-term rentals are illegal, from a nearby shop, according to Bloomberg. The report suggests that a stranger, identified by police as 24-year-old Junior Lee, allegedly raped her at knifepoint after she had returned to the property on her own following the new year celebration.Police caught the suspect and found three incriminating items, including a set of keys to the apartment. Lee, who has been charged with predatory sexual assault, has pleaded not guilty but remains in custody. After the alleged attack, safety agents at Airbnb relocated the victim in a hotel, flew her mother overseas from Australia and offered to cover any health or counselling costs, reported Bloomberg.Also Read | Airbnb CEO says travel never going back to the way it was before pandemicThe duplicate keys retrieved from the suspect posed a particular problem for Airbnb and since the attack, the company, according to BBC, has not overhauled its rules on keys and where the apartment hosts may leave them.Bloomberg said that Airbnb wrote a check for $7 million to the victim in one of the biggest payouts the company has ever made and, as part of the settlement, the Australian woman cannot blame or sue Airbnb or the apartment host.However, Airbnb spokesperson Ben Breit, in a statement to New York Post, insisted that the survivors of sexual assault can speak freely about their experiences as part of the settlements the company has reached, including the Manhattan case.“We proactively reached out to the NYPD after the attack to offer our assistance for their investigation, and we helped get her into a hotel. The priority for our company and our executives was supporting the survivor and doing right by someone who had endured trauma,” the New York Post quoted the representative as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airbnb-paid-tourist-7-million-after-she-was-raped-in-new-york-rental-report-101623835413383.html
16-06-2021||World||North Korea: Kim warns of 'tense' food situation, longer Covid lockdown||wNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned about possible food shortages and urged the country to brace for extended Covid-19 restrictions as he opened a major political conference to discuss national efforts to salvage a broken economy.The North’s official Korean Central News Agency also said Wednesday that Kim called for discussions on how the North should deal with the “current international situation,” though it did not mention any specific comments from Kim about the United States or South Korea.North Korea has so far ignored the allies’ calls to resume nuclear negotiations that have stalled for two years following the collapse of Kim’s ambitious summitry with former President Donald Trump, It was derailed by disagreements over exchanging relief from crippling U.S.-led sanctions with denuclearization steps by the North.The North’s economy has deteriorated amid pandemic border closures, which choked off trade with China, while devastating typhoons and floods last summer decimated crops.Monitors assessing the situation in North Korea have yet to see signs of mass starvation or major instability, but some analysts say conditions could be aligning for a perfect storm that undercuts food and exchange markets and triggers public panic. The Korea Development Institute, a South Korean government think tank, said last month the North could face food shortages of around 1 million tons this year.During the plenary meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee that opened Tuesday, Kim urged officials to find ways to boost agricultural production, saying the country’s food situation "is now getting tense.”KCNA said Kim also “set forth the tasks for the state to maintain perfect anti-epidemic state” — suggesting North Korea would extend its pandemic lockdown despite the stress on its economy.While the report was short on specifics, the party meeting does provide more clues about how serious food and consumer goods shortages are becoming in North Korea, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul.“Extended pandemic border restrictions are taking a toll on the economy as price and exchange rate indicators appear to be worsening,” he said.Experts widely doubt North Korea's claim that it has not had a single Covid-19 case, given its poor health infrastructure and porous border with China, its major ally and economic lifeline.Kim had called for the party meeting to review national efforts to rebuild the economy in the first half of the year. While addressing “unfavorable” conditions and challenges on Tuesday, Kim also expressed appreciation over what he described as improvements, claiming that the country’s industrial output rose 25% from last year, KCNA said.The report said the Central Committee meeting will continue but did not specify until when.North Korea held its first ruling party congress in five years in January, when it laid out development plans for the next five years. At that meeting Kim urged the country to be resilient in their struggle for economic self-reliance, He also called for reasserting greater state control over the economy, boosting agricultural production and prioritizing the development of the chemical and metal industries.Experts say those sectors are crucial to revitalizing industrial production that has been undercut by sanctions and the suspension of imports of factory materials amid the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-kim-warns-of-tense-food-situation-longer-covid-lockdown-101623834542418.html

But more are staying single and those who marry are having fewer children.The average number of children born to a resident female, who has been married, aged 40 to 49 years dropped to 1.76 in 2020, from 2.02 in 2010.The median age of the resident population, which includes citizens and permanent residents, increased to 41.5 years in 2020 from 37.4 years in 2010, the latest census showed.Authorities have also been accelerating immigration restrictions since the 2011 general elections when the ruling People's Action Party polled a record low share of the popular vote, hurt by citizens' anxiety over an influx of foreigners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-records-slowest-decade-of-population-growth-rate-since-1965-101623830390363.html
16-06-2021||World||5 fuel rods broken in Taishan nuclear power plant, no radiation leak: China||A Chinese nuclear power plant near Hong Kong had five broken fuel rods in a reactor but no radioactivity leaked, the government said Wednesday in its first confirmation of the incident that prompted concern over the facility's safety.Radiation rose inside the No 1 reactor of the Taishan Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong province but was contained by barriers that functioned as planned, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment said on its social media account.The Hong Kong government said it was watching the plant and asking officials in Guangdong for details after its French co-owner on Monday reported increased “noble gases” in the reactor. Experts said that suggested fuel rods broke and leaked radioactive gas produced during nuclear fission.Noble gases such as xenon and krypton are byproducts of fission along with particles of cesium, strontium and other radioactive elements.“There is no problem of radioactive leakage to the environment,” the ministry statement said. It said radiation in the reactor coolant increased but was within the “allowable range."The protective envelope on about five of the reactor's 60,000 fuel rods is damaged, the ministry said. It said such damage was inevitable due to manufacturing and other problems and was well below the level the facility was designed to cope with.The ministry said regulators would oversee measures to control radiation levels within the reactor but gave no details.The Taishan plant, which began commercial operation in December 2018, is owned by China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group and Electricite de France. A second reactor began operating in September 2019.They are the first of a new type called European Pressurized Reactors designed by Framatome, of which Electricite de France is the majority owner. Two more are being built in Finland and France.The ministry denied a report by CNN that regulators increased the level of radiation allowed outside the power plant to avoid shutting it down. The ministry said regulators reviewed a report about higher radiation levels in the reactor.China is one of the biggest users of nuclear power and is building more reactors at a time when few other governments plan new facilities because the cost of solar, wind and other alternatives is plunging.Chinese leaders see nuclear power as a way to reduce air pollution and demand for imports of oil and gas, which they deem a security risk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-fuel-rods-broken-in-taishan-nuclear-power-plant-no-radiation-leak-china-101623829743874.html
16-06-2021||World||Defence minister should be fired, Canada’s opposition demands||Canada’s opposition has demanded that defence minister Harjit Sajjan either resign or be removed from his post by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as an institutional crisis related to sexual misconduct in the military continues to roil the country.Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, leader of the opposition Erin O’Toole said the military was “literally falling apart” under Sajjan’s watch and he should “do the honourable thing and resign”. The Conservative Party leader also described Sajjan as an “incompetent minister” who has lost the confidence of the military.That demand came after controversies over sexual misconduct in the military continue to trouble Sajjan. The latest episode involved major-general Dany Fortin who was removed in mid-May from his position as vice-president for logistics and operations with the Public Health Agency of Canada, due to an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct that occurred three decades earlier. Fortin had led Canada’s vaccination programme after being seconded to the PHAC last November. Now, his lawyers have filed a case in a court alleging improper interference into the military chain of command with Sajjan, health minister Patty Hajdu and Trudeau, along with the senior-most bureaucrat in the country, the Clerk of the Privy Council, taking the decision for political reasons.As Fortin’s legal team challenged the government, lieutenant general Mike Rouleau, the second-in-command in the Canadian Armed Forces or CAF, resigned after it was discovered he went golfing with retired general Jonathan Vance, the former chief of staff. In fact, the entire controversy started with reports of Vance’s alleged sexual misconduct. Vance resigned in January amidst allegations of impropriety of a sexual nature and is facing an investigation.Sajjan has come under severe criticism in this matter after the military ombudsman of the time revealed that the defence minister was informed of the then CAF, Vance’s alleged “improper conduct” with a subordinate in 2018. In May, an adviser to Trudeau testified before the House of Commons defence committee that she was aware of the allegations. There were accusations that Sajjan did not act against Vance due to their long relationship, as they both served together in Afghanistan.Vance’s successor admiral Art McDonald stepped aside less than a month-and-a-half into his term as he also faces an investigation by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service.Sajjan has defended himself, as he continued to do on Tuesday. When confronted with O’Toole’s harangue, he said, “We take all allegations very seriously, as I did and brought the immediate information to the appropriate officials.”Those explanations have done little to dampen criticism of Sajjan in the media and by the opposition, as O’Toole tweeted on Tuesday, “The behaviour of minister Sajjan is disgraceful to the institution we both once served. He has covered up sexual misconduct in the CAF and has lost the respect of members of the CAF. It’s time for the prime minister to show some leadership and fire his defence minister.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defence-minister-should-be-fired-canada-s-opposition-demands-101623823389547.html

He added that the country aims to get two-thirds of residents their first dose by early July, provided supplies arrived as planned.Singapore recently doubled the gap between doses in order to allow more people to get their first jabs of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. All Singapore citizens age 12 and above are currently eligible to book vaccine appointments, and the last remaining group -- non-citizens 39 and under -- will be able to register for their jabs in the coming weeks, the government has said.“Vaccination remains a key enabler and its ability to help Singapore re-open safely can only be felt when we can collectively achieve a high level of population coverage for vaccination,” the Ministry of Health said in a statement June 10. “Further relaxations such as for group and event sizes, capacity limits, distancing requirements, mask-wearing and travel will be introduced when a sufficient proportion of the population has been fully vaccinated, especially for those who are vaccinated.”While the government has not explicitly stated what those vaccination reopening triggers will be, it expects half of the population to be fully vaccinated by August and 75% fully vaccinated by October.“We are now vaccinating about 49,000 doses on a daily basis. And we have the capacity to maintain this acceleration of our vaccine rollout provided our supplies are steady and continue to arrive,” Singapore Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said at a press briefing last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-singapore-nearly-50-residents-vaccinated-says-health-ministry-101623819371960.html
16-06-2021||World||China to launch spaceship with 3 astronauts on June 17||China is expected to launch a manned spacecraft with three astronauts on board at 9.22 am on Thursday from the Gobi desert, an official at the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said.The Shenzhou-12 - Divine Vessel in Chinese - manned spaceship will be launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, the CMSA announced on Wednesday.On board will be three male astronauts, Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo, chosen after a rigorous array of tests.The three astronauts will be taken into space for the construction of China’s space station, the Xinhua news agency said. “After entering orbit, the spaceship will conduct a fast automated rendezvous and docking with the in-orbit space station core module Tianhe, forming a complex with the core module and the cargo craft Tianzhou-2.”The astronauts aboard Shenzhou-12 will be stationed in the core module and remain in orbit for three months.The Shenzhou-12 crew will live on Tianhe, “Harmony of the Heaven”, a cylinder 16.6m long and 4.2m in diameter.Tianhe is the first module that will eventually form China’s own three-module space station, which it began building in April.Shenzhou 12 will be the third of 11 missions to complete China’s space station.The planned three-month stay would break China’s record of 30 days, set by the 2016 mission – China’s last crewed flight - of Chen Dong and Jing Haipeng to a prototype station.Of the three astronauts, two are considered veterans in China’s space travel history.Nie, 56, will board the Shenzhou-12 manned spacecraft for his third flight, following his first during the Shenzhou-6 mission in October 2005 and second flight of Shenzhou-10 in June 2013.Liu, 54, will join Nie in the upcoming mission after his first trip to space in September 2008 during the Shenzhou-7 spaceship mission.Both Nie and Liu were fighter pilots with People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force.The third crew member, Tang Hongbo, 46, was selected from the second batch of astronauts in 2011.“China selected its first batch of 14 astronauts in the mid-1990s. Since 2003, it has sent six astronauts into space, including Yang Liwei, the country’s first astronaut, and Zhai Zhigang, who carried out China’s first space walk in September 2008,” Global Times reported.The backup crew members for the Shenzhou 12 mission include one woman astronaut - Wang Yaping, who was part of the Shenzhou-10 mission in 2013.On May 30, a cargo spacecraft carrying supplies including food and equipment docked with China’s first space station’s key module Tianhe as part of the preparation for the station to host three astronauts this month.The unmanned Tianzhou-2, or “Heavenly Vessel” in Chinese, docked with Tianhe (the key module).The launch and docking of Tianzhou-2 was carried out a month after Tianhe, the first part of the space station Tiangong, “Heavenly Palace” in Chinese, was launched.In late April, China sent to space Tianhe, the management and control hub of Tiangong, the permanent space station, which it plans to complete by 2022 as part of its ambitious space programme.The Tianhe, which was sent to orbit by a rocket, can provide electricity and accommodate three astronauts for up to six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-launch-spaceship-with-3-astronauts-on-june-17-101623817149264.html
16-06-2021||World||Internal dissensions, estranged army and economic crisis spell trouble for Imran Khan||The pandemonium in Pakistan National Assembly (PNA) during a debate on budget on Tuesday with treasury and opposition benches hurling objects and shouting expletives reflects the inability of the Imran Khan government to stem the rising political chaos in the country.Even though the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) government is unlikely to face any credible political threat from either opposition alliance PDM or PML-N, which itself is embroiled in an internal tussle, it is the infighting within the ruling party coupled with economic crisis and rampant corruption which are weighing the ruling party down.Senior politician from Pakistan's Punjab province, and a key member of the PTI, Jahangir Tareen, broke away from the ruling party in May, forming his own splinter group with around 35 like-minded lawmakers from national and provincial assemblies. Tareen, who has been implicated in a corruption case, is considered close to the country's military junta. A businessman and sugar tycoon, Tareen is known to have wooed many a politicians to join Khan’s party, helping him win the elections that made him the prime minister in 2018.Another worrying factor for PM Khan is the involvement of members of the government in the Rawalpindi Ring Road scam. It has been alleged in local news reports that billions of dollars were made in property deals as part of the project since its conception in 2017. This has severely dented the credibility of Imran Khan’s anti-corruption crusade and the promised vision of Naya Pakistan.Despite all this, the Pakistan government put the current opposition leader in the National Assembly, Shahbaz Sharif, on a no-fly list. Sharif had a court order allowing him to travel abroad for medical reasons. Investigation agencies have also been directed to reopen a decade-old corruption case against Sharif brothers, which had been decisively closed by the court. Shahbaz Sharif has served as chief minister of Punjab and has close ties with the military.Apart from this, spiralling inflation, cries of misgovernance and growing unpopularity of the PTI government has put strains on the military's relationship with Imran Khan.The government's claims about a 3.9% growth rate of the country's GDP has been challenged by the opposition and has called it fraudulent. Fact is that Pakistan’s economy continues to be bogged down with repayment pressures on account of external debt as a result of which Islamabad has sought restructuring of USD 3 billion debt from China and the circular debt of the power sector includes USD 1.3 billion arrears of the Chinese power companies.To add to the discomfort of the Imran Khan government is the internal security situation with increasing terror activities - mainly in Balochistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Sindh and Punjab. Baloch insurgents continue to attack security forces, their alleged informants and workers of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor project. Sunni terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba/Jamaat-ud-Dawah, Jaish-e-Mohammed and their affiliates continue to operate freely in public with impunity.Khan has made counter moves to consolidate his political standing by scuttling the military's efforts to engage the opposition and even whipping public sentiments on relations with India in direct contravention of the Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s nuanced efforts to tone things down between the two countries. As a result, hybrid arrangement remains in a state of suspended animation and the military's stake in Imran Khan is steadily declining with diminishing returns.What caused a serious dent in the relation between the military and the civilian government is the ruling dispensation's showcasing of success stories in the foreign policy sphere such as the May 7-9 visit by Imran Khan to Saudi Arabia on the invitation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The visit was held under the watchful eyes of Pakistan army chief General Bajwa, who reached Saudi Arabia earlier on May 4, but the fact was underplayed.There was also a lot of noise in the local media over Islamabad’s pro-active role in support of Palestine in the Israel-Palestine conflict. On the other hand an important meeting between Pakistan NSA Moeed Yusuf and US NSA Jake Sullivan in Geneva was played down despite the fact that the former offered special economic incentives to US in a bid to reach out to the Biden administration. The early withdrawal of US and NATO forces from Afghanistan will be a major concern for Islamabad as the cross border attacks in KP and Balochistan are likely to increase as both the Taliban and the Afghan government are going to battle it out for Kabul on Durand Line. The spill-over of the forthcoming battle for Kabul will add to instability in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/internal-dissensions-estranged-army-economic-crisis-spell-trouble-imran-khan-101623812883632.html

She undertook the historic flight in 1963.Tereshkova became a national heroine at the tender age of 26 when she made that flight.She was born to Vladimir Aksyonovich Tereshkov, a sergeant in the Soviet Army, and Yelena Fyodorovna Tereshkova in Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia, on March 6, 1937.Tereshkova’s father died in the Finnish Winter War during World War II, when she was two years old. After that, her mother moved the family to Yaroslavl, seeking better employment opportunity and took up a job at the Krasny Perekop cotton mill.Tereshkova enrolled at school in 1945 at the age of eight. In 1953, she left school and began working but continued education by correspondence courses.Tereshkova developed interest in parachuting quite early and trained in skydiving at the local aeroclub, making her first jump at age 22, on May 21, 1959.Thanks to her training in parachuting, Tereshkova was among the five women who were selected for the cosmonaut programme in 1961. After Yuri Gagarin’s historic space trip, the Soviet government was keen to send women to space. And Tereshkova fitted the bill.She attended an extensive 18-month programme wherein the candidates learned the nuances of space travel.She was chosen to pilot Vostok 6. Cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky took off on Vostok 5 on June 14, 1963 and two days later, Tereshkova too blasted off.She logged more than 70 hours in space and made 48 orbits of the Earth. On June 19, 1963, Tereshkova’s spacecraft re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere and she successfully parachuted for 20,000 feet.A few years ago, Tereshkova expressed her willingness to make a one-way trip to Mars. She said that Mars is her favourite planet. The Russian cosmonaut had been part of the group who studied the possibility of going to the Red Planet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/june-16-when-valentina-tereshkova-became-first-woman-to-go-to-space-58-yrs-ago-101623811629095.html

The University of Illinois-Chicago received $40 million from the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.“Ms. Scott’s extremely generous donation will advance the lives of students who are poised to make great contributions to our city, our state and our world,” said UIC Chancellor Michael D. Amiridis. "Her gift is a vote of confidence in the mission of public higher education and in UIC.”City College officials say the money is the largest single private donation ever given Kennedy-King. The donation is part of $2.7 billion given to 286 organizations by Scott.Forbes Magazine has reported Kennedy-King College, which serves a largely African-American student body, is considered one of the top 10 community colleges in the country as determined by Academic Influence.“We are dedicated to realizing the full potential of each one of our talented students,” said Kennedy-King College President Greg A. Thomas, adding college officials are deeply grateful to Ms. Scott for the gift.Located in Chicago’s South Side Englewood neighborhood, Kennedy-King serves nearly 5,000 students, offering culinary and hospitality, construction technology and creative arts classes.The donations announced Tuesday is the third round of no-strings-attached, major philanthropic gifts Scott has made. Scott’s wealth, estimated by Forbes at roughly $60 billion, has only grown since she divorced from Bezos in 2019 and walked away with a 4% stake in Amazon. She has pledged to give away a majority of her wealth during her lifetime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-ex-wife-scott-gives-millions-to-2-chicago-colleges-101623803332129.html

Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future state that would include the West Bank and Gaza.Prior to Tuesday's march, Israel beefed up its deployment of the Iron Dome anti-missile system in anticipation of possible rocket attacks from Gaza.But as the marchers began to disperse after nightfall in Jerusalem, there was no sign of rocket fire from the enclave.The procession was originally scheduled for May 10 as part of "Jerusalem Day" festivities that celebrate Israel's capture of East Jerusalem.At the last minute, that march was diverted away from the Damascus Gate and the Old City's Muslim Quarter, but the move was not enough to dissuade Hamas from firing rockets towards Jerusalem, attacks that set off last month's round of fighting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-carries-out-airstrikes-in-gaza-first-time-since-end-of-last-month-s-fighting-101623802972017.html

During the sitting of the House, members of the treasury benches created chaos on the floor and even abused other parliamentarians, according to a video of the incident. The proceedings of the lower house were adjourned by the Speaker after the incident.The chaos broke out when Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president and Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif addressed the House.According to the video, which is now going viral, Sharif was greeted by jeers, slogans and whistles from the treasury members as soon as he started speaking."Imran Khan Niazi promised 10 million jobs. Where are those jobs?" asked Sharif. "Where are the USD 300bn that was supposed to be brought back to the country from abroad?"Continuing to lash out at the government, he said that PM Imran Khan's claims of eliminating corruption from Pakistan were hollow."Pakistan is suffering from the worst form of corruption today," he said. "No act of posting or transferring someone these days is done without an element of corruption these days," added Shahbaz.He criticised the government's budget, saying that it had failed to provide relief to the masses from unemployment and inflation, Geo News reported citing the video.The lawmakers were then seen fighting on the floor of the House and throwing copies of the budget.After this, the proceedings of the House were adjourned for the day. "The Sitting of the National Assembly has been adjourned to meet again on Wednesday, the 16th June, 2021 at 2:00 p.m," National Assembly of Pakistan wrote in a tweet.The budget was presented by Pakistan finance minister Shaukat Tarin earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chaos-breaks-out-in-pakistan-parliament-over-imran-govt-s-budget-proposals-101623800726946.html

Korea's Kim says food situation 'tense' due to pandemic, typhoons||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said the country's economy improved this year but called for measures to tackle the "tense" food situation caused by the coronavirus pandemic and last year's typhoons, state media said on Wednesday.Kim chaired a plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party's central committee on Tuesday to review progress on major policies and craft measures to resolve economic issues, according to the official KCNA news agency.The committee set goals and tasks to achieve its new five-year economic plan outlined at its previous session in February, including increased food and metal production.Kim said the overall economy had improved in the first half of the year, with the total industrial output growing 25% from a year before, KCNA said.But there was "a series of deviations" in the party's efforts to implement the plans due to several obstacles, he said, singling out tight food supplies."The people's food situation is now getting tense as the agricultural sector failed to fulfil its grain production plan due to the damage by typhoon last year," Kim said.The party vowed to direct all efforts to farming this year and discuss ways to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, KCNA said.Kim called for steps to minimise impacts of natural disasters as a lesson from last year and key to attain this year's goal.In January, Kim said his previous five-year economic plan had failed in almost every sector, amid chronic power and food shortages exacerbated by sanctions, the pandemic and floods.He also the protracted pandemic required the party to step up efforts to provide food, clothing and housing for the people, KCNA said.North Korea has not officially confirmed any Covid-19 cases, a claim questioned by Seoul officials. But the reclusive country has imposed strict anti-virus measures including border closures and domestic travel restrictions.COVAX, a global initiative for sharing Covid-19 vaccines with poor countries, has said it will provide nearly 2 million doses to North Korea but the shipment has been delayed amid protracted consultations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/n-korea-s-kim-says-food-situation-tense-due-to-pandemic-typhoons-101623799848963.html
16-06-2021||World||Joe Biden names big tech critic Lina Khan as FTC chair||President Joe Biden named Lina Khan chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, an unexpected move that puts one of the most prominent advocates of aggressive antitrust enforcement against US technology giants in charge of the agency.News of Khan’s appointment came hours after the Senate confirmed her for a seat on the FTC by a vote of 69-28. She will take over the agency from Acting Chairwoman Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who has been a commissioner for three years and had been expected by some to be tapped by Biden to lead the agency permanently.Khan’s elevation to chairwoman marks her rapid rise to the top of US antitrust enforcement. Currently a professor at Columbia Law School, just a few years ago she was a law student at Yale University. Now the 32-year-old is in charge of one of two agencies responsible for policing competition in the US The other is the Justice Department’s antitrust division.“It is a tremendous honor to have been selected by President Biden to lead the Federal Trade Commission,” Khan said in a statement after she was sworn in. “I look forward to working with my colleagues to protect the public from corporate abuse.”As chairwoman, Khan will need a majority of the five-member agency to make enforcement decisions, but she will have significant control over the staff who conduct the agency’s competition and consumer-protection investigations. She will join two Democrats -- Slaughter and Rohit Chopra -- who have long sought to pursue a more aggressive antitrust agenda.Khan rose to prominence with a 2017 research paper on Amazon.com Inc. that she wrote as a law student at Yale University. The paper casts the online retail giant as a harmful monopoly and argues that the company employs practices that should provoke a rethink of antitrust enforcement in the US.Her work put her at the forefront of an anti-monopoly movement known as the New Brandeis School that says the traditional playbook for policing mergers and anticompetitive conduct has failed, leading to concentrated economic and political power across the economy.Once on the fringes of antitrust thinking, support for breaking up tech firms and calls for overhauling antitrust laws have gone mainstream. Last week, House lawmakers introduced a series of bills that would put new restrictions on how tech firms operate and in some cases force them to exit certain businesses.Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who called for breaking up tech companies when she was campaigning for the Democratic nomination for president, praised Khan’s appointment, calling her a “fearless champion for consumers.”“Consolidation is choking off competition across American industries,” Warren said in a statement. “With Chair Khan at the helm, we have a huge opportunity to make big, structural change by reviving antitrust enforcement and fighting monopolies that threaten our economy, our society, and our democracy.”Still, Khan has her detractors. When she first emerged as a possible candidate for the FTC, Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah called her views on antitrust “wildly out of step with a prudent approach to the law.”Tech-funded advocacy organizations were quick to criticize Khan’s confirmation. NetChoice, whose members include Amazon and other tech companies, accused Khan of “antitrust activism” that it said will politicize the FTC and harm America’s economic exceptionalism.“Khan has a strong career in persuading the American left of her proposed reforms to antitrust law, but the job of an FTC commissioner is to enforce antitrust laws as they are, not as the commissioner wishes they would be,” Carl Szabo, NetChoice’s general counsel, said in a statement.Slaughter said she looked forward to working with Khan to ensure “that markets work for all people.”Khan’s nomination in March and the appointment of her Columbia colleague Tim Wu as White House adviser on competition policy signaled President Joe Biden was preparing to take a tougher approach to antitrust enforcement. But nearly five months into his administration, Biden has yet to nominate a leader for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, which shares antitrust enforcement with the FTC. Biden didn’t announce his intent to name Khan chairwoman when he nominated her.Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, which would consider Biden’s choice for the antitrust division, said in an interview that she hopes the administration nominates someone for the position soon.“The fact they put in Tim Wu and Lina Khan really shows that they’re interested in seriously taking on these issues,” she said.The FTC’s Democratic majority with Slaughter, Chopra and Khan may be short-lived. Biden nominated Chopra to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He is still awaiting Senate confirmation after the Senate Banking Committee in March split on his nomination along party lines.At her confirmation hearing, Khan told lawmakers that antitrust enforcers need to scrutinize the power that large technology companies have over digital markets, from app stores to online journalism. She called out the dominance that Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have over app stores on mobile devices, saying terms like Apple taking 30% of the revenue earned by some developers can’t be justified.“The source of the power is the fact that you have basically these two main options, and so that gives these companies the power to really set the terms in this market,” she said. “Certain terms and conditions really lack any type of beneficial justification.”After law school, Khan worked at anti-monopoly think tank Open Markets Institute and as an adviser to Chopra at the FTC. She was also counsel to the House antitrust committee, which last year concluded an investigation of Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook Inc.Khan was one of the authors of the panel’s report on the investigation, which accused the tech firms of abusing their roles as gatekeepers in the digital economy and in the process eroding innovation, entrepreneurship, privacy and consumer choice. It also included a series of recommendations for reforms to antitrust laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-names-big-tech-critic-lina-khan-as-us-ftc-chair-amid-antitrust-probe-101623799829365.html
16-06-2021||World||'Lawless... now pitied around world': Trump on Texas-Mexico border ahead of visit||Former US president Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he will visit the US border with Mexico in a move to contrast his tough stance against immigration with successor Joe Biden's more humane approach.Trump said in a statement that he would join Texas Governor Greg Abbott to visit "our nation's decimated southern border" on June 30."The Biden administration inherited from me the strongest, safest, and most secure border in US history and in mere weeks they turned it into the single worst border crisis in US history," he said."We went from having border security that was the envy of the world to a lawless border that is now pitied around the world."Trump is taking advantage of data showing the Biden administration, promising a more humane approach to migrants fleeing poverty and violence in Central America, has struggled to fend off hundreds of thousands attempting to cross the border in recent months.From March to May more than 530,000 people were apprehended and pushed back into Mexico after attempting to cross without legal immigration papers, according to the Customs and Border Protection.There is no official estimate on how many did get through, but the sheer number of attempts suggests a rise in successful crossings, CBP officers have said.And Republicans have sought to damage Biden's popularity by highlighting what they call a crisis at the border.Abbott meanwhile announced that he would resume building a Trump-planned wall along the border after Biden stopped the project.Texas "will do what Biden REFUSES to do - protect our citizens along the southern border," Abbott tweeted Tuesday.Trump's announcement was the latest sign that, since leaving the White House on January 20, Trump intends to keep challenging the Democrat by holding out the possibility of running again in 2024.With a strong sway over the Republican voter base, Trump has flexed his influence since leaving office, appearing at a major Republican conference in February, and joining a local candidate's event in North Carolina and a party fundraiser in Florida since then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawless-now-pitied-around-world-trump-on-texas-mexico-border-ahead-of-visit-101623798118860.html

16-06-2021||World||New study says Covid was in US in Dec 2019||At least seven people in five US states were infected with the coronavirus weeks before those states reported their first cases, a new government study has shown.The development came at a time when the US death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic surpassed 600,000, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.In the study, participants who reported antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 were likely exposed to the virus at least several weeks before their samples were taken, as the antibodies do not appear until about two weeks after a person has been infected, the researchers said.The results build on findings from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that suggested the virus may have been circulating in the US in late December 2019, before the first Covid-19 case was detected on January 19, 2020. The positive samples came from Illinois, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and were part of a study of more than 24,000 blood samples taken for a National Institutes of Health research programme between January 2 and March 18, 2020.The WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus warned on Monday that Covid-19 was moving faster than the vaccines, and said the G7’s vow to share a billion doses with poorer nations was simply not enough.Meanwhile, AstraZeneca said its antibody cocktail was only 33% effective in preventing Covid symptoms in people exposed to the virus as part of a study to find a way to tackle the virus.In Pakistan, taking a cue from Punjab province, the Sindh government has announced it will block the mobile SIM cards of those who refuse to take the Covid-19 vaccines, according to a media report on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-study-says-covid-was-in-us-in-dec-2019-101623794072494.html
16-06-2021||World||Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin face off in Geneva||Buoyed by days of partnership-building sessions with allies, US Joe Biden arrived in Geneva on Tuesday for the most tense part of his first European tour as president - talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Biden is seeking to restore European ties that were strained under former president Donald Trump, who dismissed the value of Nato and other US alliances and sought out Putin.Biden this week held long days of meetings with leaders at G7, Nato and US-EU summits, where he secured joint communiques expressing concern over Russia and China, and then helped preside over a breakthrough agreement easing a US trade dispute with Europe.Biden’s Wednesday meeting with Putin is his most highly anticipated. He has called Putin a “worthy adversary” and has said he is hoping to find areas of cooperation. But he’s also warned if Russia continues its cyberattacks, “we will respond in kind”.According to an administration official granted anonymity to disclose internal discussions, Biden is hoping to find some areas of agreement with Putin, including returning envoys back to Washington and Moscow. Both countries are now without a senior diplomat.Before Biden left Brussels, US officials announced a major breakthrough with the European Union in a 17-year trade dispute centered on rival subsidies for aircraft manufacturers.The two sides reached terms on how much of a government subsidy each can provide for its aircraft manufacturing giant - Boeing in the US and Airbus in the EU. The announcement came as Biden met European Council president Charles Michel and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-face-off-in-geneva-101623793641564.html
16-06-2021||World||Joe Biden nominates 9 envoys to high-profile ambassador postings||President Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled picks for several high-profile ambassadorial postings, tapping career diplomats steeped in foreign policy experience — as well as political allies and aviation hero ”Sully” Sullenberger.The picks include former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar as ambassador to Mexico and former Deputy Secretary of State Tom Nides as ambassador to Israel. Retired airline pilot C.B. ”Sully" Sullenberger, most famous for negotiating the emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River with no fatalities, has been named to serve as US representative on the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization.The announcement comes as Biden is on the tail end of an eight-day European trip that included stops in the United Kingdom for a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders and Belgium for a gathering of the 27 NATO countries and the US-EU summit. The trip culminates in Geneva on Wednesday with a highly anticipated meeting with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, where the leaders are to discuss rising tensions between their countries.As a candidate, Biden declined to rule out appointing political donors to ambassadorships or other posts if he was elected. But he pledged that his nominees, regardless of their contributor status, would be the “best people” for their posts — suggesting he would move away from former President Donald Trump’s heavy reliance on political appointees and rely more on the State Department’s well of career foreign service officers.More than 43% of Trump’s ambassadorial appointments were political appointees, compared with 30.5% for Barack Obama and 31.8% for George W. Bush, according to the American Foreign Service Association. Biden hopes to keep political appointments to about 30% of ambassador picks, according to the White House.“Nobody, in fact, will be appointed by me based on anything they contributed,” Biden promised last year.All the nominees must receive Senate confirmation before they can assume their roles.Biden's other picks include:—Julie Jiyoon Chung, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, to serve as ambassador to Sri Lanka.—Sharon Cromer, who currently serves as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission Director at the U.S. Embassy, Accra, Ghana, to serve as ambassador to Gambia.—Troy Fitrell, currently the director of the Office of West African Affairs at the State Department, to serve as ambassador to Guinea. He has served as deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassies in Ethiopia and Mauritius, as deputy director of the Department’s Office of Southern African Affairs, and as deputy director of the Office of International Security Cooperation in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.—Marc Ostfield, a 30-year veteran of the State Department, to serve as ambassador to Paraguay. Ostfield is currently the ombudsman of the State Department.—Julianne “Julie” Smith, a former Obama administration national security aide currently serving as a senior adviser to the Secretary of State, to serve as permanent representative on the NATO council. She served as deputy national security adviser to Biden when he was vice president.—Cynthia Telles, a clinical professor in the department of psychiatry at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, to serve as ambassador to Costa Rica. Telles also was a prominent fundraiser for the Biden White House campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-nominates-9-envoys-to-high-profile-ambassador-postings-101623787992843.html
16-06-2021||World||Joe Biden to pick Lina Khan for US Federal Trade chair: Report||President Joe Biden will name Lina Khan, an antitrust researcher who has focused on Big Tech's immense market power, to chair the US Federal Trade Commission, sources said on Tuesday.Khan, who was confirmed to the FTC as a commissioner on Tuesday with strong bipartisan support, is respected by progressive antitrust thinkers who have pushed for tougher antitrust laws or at least tougher enforcement of existing law.Khan, who most recently taught at Columbia Law School, was on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, and helped write a massive report that sharply criticized Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc for allegedly abusing their dominance.The decision to tap her followed the selection of fellow progressive and Big Tech critic Tim Wu to join the National Economic Council.She joins the commission as the federal government and groups of states have an array of lawsuits and investigations into Big Tech companies. The FTC has sued Facebook and is investigating Amazon. The Justice Department has sued Alphabet's Google.In 2017, she wrote a highly regarded article, "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox," for the Yale Law Journal which argued that the traditional antitrust focus on price was inadequate to identify antitrust harms done by Amazon.In addition to antitrust, the FTC investigates allegations of deceptive advertising.On that front, Khan will join an agency which is painfully adapting to a unanimous Supreme Court ruling from April which said the agency could not use a particular part of its statute, 13(b), to demand consumers get restitution from deceptive companies but can only ask for an injunction. Congress is considering a legislative fix.Khan previously worked at the FTC as a legal adviser to Commissioner Rohit Chopra, Biden's pick to be director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-pick-lina-khan-for-us-federal-trade-chair-report-101623787928031.html
16-06-2021||World||Wall Street ends lower, jittery investors eye Fed report||Wall Street's main indices ended lower on Tuesday, as data showing stronger inflation and weaker US retail sales in May unnerved investors who were already jittery as they await the results of the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.Assurance from the Fed that rising prices are transitory and falling US Treasury yields have helped ease some concerns over inflation and supported US stocks in recent weeks. All eyes are now on the central bank's statement at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.Data showed an acceleration in producer prices last month as supply chains struggled to meet demand unleashed by the reopening of the economy. A separate report showed US retail sales dropped more than expected in May."There was a bit of a reaction to the economic data we got, which, for the most part, shows that the economy is starting to wean itself off stimulus, the recovery is slowing down a little, and inflation is continuing to grow," said Ed Moya, senior market analyst for the Americas at OANDA."We're seeing some very modest weakness, and it'll be choppy leading up to the Fed decision. Right now, the Fed is probably in a position to show they are thinking about tapering, but they're still a long way from actually doing it."The Fed is likely to announce in August or September a strategy for reducing its massive bond buying program, but will not start cutting monthly purchases until early next year, a Reuters poll of economists found.The benchmark S&P 500, the blue-chip Dow Jones and the tech-focused Nasdaq have all gained so far this year, largely driven by optimism about an economic reopening.However, the S&P 500 has been broadly stuck within a range, despite recording its 29th record-high finish of 2021 on Monday, versus 33 for all of last year.Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 91.92 points, or 0.27%, to 34,301.83, the S&P 500 lost 8.29 points, or 0.19%, to 4,246.86 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 101.29 points, or 0.71%, to 14,072.86.The majority of the 11 major S&P sectors slipped. The energy index rose as oil prices hit multi-year highs on positive demand outlook.The communication services sector ended lower, having hit a record intraday high earlier in the session.In corporate news, Boeing Co gained after the United States and the European Union agreed on a truce in their 17-year conflict over aircraft subsidies involving the planemaker and its rival Airbus.Having slumped 19% on Monday, Lordstown Motors Corp shares rallied after comments from the electric truck manufacturer's president on orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wall-street-ends-lower-jittery-investors-eye-fed-report-101623787431976.html
16-06-2021||World||California, first to shut in pandemic, fully reopens||California, the first state in America to put in place a coronavirus lockdown, has turned a page on the pandemic.The nation's most populated state lifted most of its restrictions Tuesday, meaning no more state rules on social distancing or capacity limits at restaurants, bars, supermarkets, gyms, stadiums or anywhere else.And masks — one of the most fraught symbols of the pandemic — are no longer mandated for vaccinated people in most settings, though businesses and counties can still require them.Gov. Gavin Newsom celebrated the milestone by hosting a lottery-style selection of 10 winners who will get $1.5 million each simply for being vaccinated. It was the grand finale to the nation’s largest vaccine incentive — $116 million in Covid-19 lottery jackpots and cash card giveaways.“Finally we are here, June 15th, to turn the page," Newsom declared from a stage at Universal Studios Hollywood during festivities to mark what he called the “full reopening” of the state's economy.The Democratic governor pointed to the more than 40 million doses of vaccine administered and the resulting plunge in cases as the reason for the reopening.“Foundationally, that's why we're here today,” Newsom said.Just in time for summer, California wants to send the message that life is getting much closer to normal. The economy is fully reopened for the first time in 15 months and people can largely return to pre-pandemic lifestyles.Fans can cheer maskless at Dodgers and Giants baseball games. Disneyland is opening to all tourists after allowing just California residents since April. People can pack indoor bars and nightclubs from the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles to the Castro in San Francisco.Tourism was among the hardest-hit industries during the pandemic and now wants to make up for a lost time.“In terms of our incredible cities, our iconic attractions, the industry is ready to roll out the red carpet to visitors in California, around the nation and even the world," said Caroline Beteta, president and CEO of Visit California.Pandemic highs and lows saw California go from being a success story to the U.S. epicenter of the virus. As the first in the country to impose a statewide lockdown in March 2020, California’s businesses were just starting to reopen last June when cases started rising and restrictions were imposed again.By summer's end, a darker reality set in as California hurtled toward a deadly winter surge. Shutdowns, curfews and harrowing images from overwhelmed hospitals became the norm as the state set records almost daily for infections and deaths.More people tested positive for the virus in California (3.8 million and counting) and more people died (63,000 plus) than anywhere else in the country, although the nation’s most populous state had a lower per capita death rate than most others.California now has one of the lowest rates of infection in the country, below 1%. That dramatic drop in infections combined with an increasing number of vaccinated residents — over 70% of adults have had at least one dose — led Newsom to announce in April that most Covid-19 restrictions would be lifted June 15.The reopening doesn’t necessarily mean people will immediately flock to places and events they once packed or that businesses will opt to return to full capacity immediately. But a palpable feeling of anticipation has replaced the anxiety, frustration and sadness that ushered in summer 2020.For Angie Barragan, who was born in Los Angeles and visited last week from Las Vegas, so many things that were once normal feel new, awkward and amazing: strolling in public without a mask, socializing for the first time in ages.“It’s kind of learning how to be a human again,” she said as she shopped and strolled on LA's historic Olvera Street, a restored Mexican marketplace once clogged with tourists. “But it’s great to be among people.”The reopening doesn’t mean the pandemic is over, Newsom has repeatedly stressed as an explanation for retaining his statewide emergency declaration.Some public health measures will stay for “megaevents.” People attending indoor concerts, sporting events or other large gatherings of more than 5,000 people will have to show proof that they are vaccinated or have a recent negative Covid-19 test. Those going to outdoor events with more than 10,000 people are “strongly encouraged” to do the same.While fully vaccinated people will no longer be required to wear masks in most places, those who are unvaccinated are expected to, but it won’t be enforced. Businesses have three choices: operate on an honor system, require customers to show proof of vaccination or require everyone to cover their face.Many question if the honor system will work, including the California Nurses Association, which said the new rules essentially call on businesses and essential workers to be the vaccination police.“This is not a sound public health strategy," said Sandy Rending, a president of the association, which is calling on people to keep masks on indoors and in crowds.For now, masks are still required in places like public transit, airports, health care settings and indoor school classes.While applauding the reopening, some business owners said ever-shifting mask rules are confounding.“We’re excited — and a little confused,” said Tom La Torre, owner of Sabella & La Torre Restaurant at Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco, a tourist haven that transformed into a ghost town during the pandemic.Until now, his restaurant was limited to 50% capacity.“That will be nice to fill the place up. However, we are still confused about the mask mandate,” La Torre said.It’s also unclear if people will come.For Rita Torres, a retired university administrator in Oakland, the last 15 months were “mindboggling.” She has missed dancing at live concerts and hugging her girlfriends at weekly happy hours. But for her, the reopening is just another day.“Deep down, I want to rejoice,” Torres said, but she’s going to take it slow. “Because it’s kind of like, is it too soon? Will we be sorry?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-first-to-shut-in-pandemic-fully-reopens-101623786433271.html
16-06-2021||World||Chinese man commits $20 million fraud on coronavirus aid programs, pleads guilty||A Chinese man who prosecutors say tried to get $20 million in federal aid for distressed businesses pleaded guilty Tuesday to two criminal charges.Muge Ma entered the plea in Manhattan federal court to bank fraud and aggravated identity theft, admitting the fraud that authorities say he carried out from his luxury Manhattan condominium.Judge Richard M. Berman noted that it was the first hearing conducted in his courtroom since the coronavirus forced a shutdown of most in-court proceedings in March 2020.Ma, 37, has remained incarcerated as a flight risk since his May 2020 arrest, when prosecutors said he had applied to at least five banks for over $20 million in government-guaranteed loans from the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. The programs were intended for businesses harmed by coronavirus shutdowns.Authorities said he falsely claimed to be paying hundreds of employees millions of dollars in wages through two companies he controlled. To support the claims, he submitted fraudulent bank, tax, insurance and payroll records and provided banks with links to websites that described the companies as “global,” prosecutors said.They said he also falsely asserted that he was a U.S. citizen, though he did have lawful permanent resident status.“In truth, Ma appears to be the only employee of either company and he had no legitimate claim to the funds for which he applied,” U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a release.“Small businesses are facing uncertainty and unprecedented challenges, the least of which should be opportunists attempting to loot the federal funds meant to assist them,” she added.According to prosecutors, a bank approved and disbursed over $800,000 in loan funds for one of Ma's companies, although the money was frozen during the investigation. They said another $650,000 in loans had been approved and a $10,000 loan advance had been provided.A sentencing agreement with prosecutors that Ma signed Tuesday recommends he be sentenced to between six and seven years in prison, including a two-year mandatory prison sentence on the aggravated identity theft charge. Sentencing was scheduled for Sept. 22.Ma's plea deal with prosecutors contained language that made it seem that Ma's deportation was very likely, if not mandatory, but his lawyer, Peter Katz, told Berman that the words were common in legal documents, regardless of the crimes.“In our opinion, he won't be," Katz said of deportation. Still, he added: “He understands it is a possibility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-man-commits-20-million-fraud-on-coronavirus-aid-programs-pleads-guilty-101623785434073.html

Between 3,000 and 3,500 police and other forces are being deployed in the usually sleepy Swiss lakeside city.The authors represented among the thousands of books at the villa include Charles Pictet de Rochemont, a Swiss diplomat who prepared the Swiss declaration of permanent neutrality - itself likely a factor in the choice of Geneva for the summit.(Reporting By Steve Holland and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Writing by Arshad Mohammed in Saint Paul, Minn.; Editing by Howard Goller)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-hours-no-meals-what-biden-putin-marathon-summit-maybe-like-101623778049680.html
16-06-2021||World||AstraZeneca antibody cocktail fails to prevent Covid-19 in large trial||AstraZeneca said on Tuesday a late-stage trial failed to provide evidence that its Covid-19 antibody therapy protected people who had contact with an infected person from the disease, a small setback in its efforts to find alternatives to vaccines.The study assessed whether the therapy, a cocktail of two types of antibodies, could prevent adults who had been exposed to the virus in the past eight days from developing Covid-19 symptoms.The therapy, AZD7442, was 33% effective in reducing the risk of people developing symptoms compared with a placebo, but that result was not statistically significant — meaning it might have been due to chance and not the therapy.The Phase III study, which has not been peer-reviewed, included 1,121 participants in the United Kingdom and the United States. The vast majority, though not all, were free of the virus at the start of the trial.Results for a subset of participants who were not infected to begin with was more encouraging but the primary analysis rested on results from all participants."While this trial did not meet the primary endpoint against symptomatic illness, we are encouraged by the protection seen in the PCR negative participants following treatment with AZD7442," AstraZeneca Executive Vice President Mene Pangalos said in a statement, referring to the polymerase chain reaction tests which diagnose Covid-19.The company is banking on further studies to revive the product's fortunes. Five more trials are ongoing, testing the antibody cocktail as treatment or in prevention.The next one will likely be from a larger trial testing the product in people with a weakened immune system due to cancer or an organ transplant, who may not benefit from a vaccine.TARGETED ALTERNATIVESAZD7442 belongs to a class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies which mimic natural antibodies produced by the body to fight off infections.Similar therapies developed by rivals Regeneron, Eli Lilly and GlaxoSmithKline with partner Vir have been approved by US regulators for treating unhospitalised Covid patients.Regeneron is also seeking US authorisation for its therapy as a preventative treatment.European regulators have recommended antibody treatments by GSK, Celltrion, Eli Lilly and Regeneron for used in early-stage patients who are at risk of progressing to severe Covid-19. The EU watchdog made the endorsement to support the use by member states ahead of an EU-wide marketing authorisation.But the AstraZeneca results are a small blow for the drug industry as it tries to find more targeted alternatives to Covid-19 inoculations, particularly for people who may not be able to get vaccinated or those who may have an inadequate response to inoculations.The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker, which has faced a rollercoaster of challenges with the rollout of its Covid-19 vaccine, is also developing new treatments and repurposing existing drugs to fight the virus.AstraZeneca also said on Tuesday it was in talks with the US government on "next steps" regarding a $205 million deal to supply up to 500,000 doses of AZD7442. Swiss manufacturer Lonza was contracted to produce AZD7442.Shares in the company were largely unchanged on the London Stock Exchange.The full results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal, the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-antibody-cocktail-fails-to-prevent-covid-19-in-large-trial-101623782052267.html
16-06-2021||World||US Covid deaths at 600,000 equal to 2019 cancer toll in America||The US death toll from Covid-19 topped 600,000 on Tuesday, even as the vaccination drive has drastically brought down daily cases and fatalities and allowed the country to emerge from the gloom and look forward to summer.The number of lives lost, as recorded by Johns Hopkins University, is greater than the population of Baltimore or Milwaukee. It is about equal to the number of Americans who died of cancer in 2019. Worldwide, the Covid-19 death toll stands at about 3.8 million.The milestone came the same day that California and New York lifted most of their remaining restrictions, joining other states in opening the way, step by step, for what could be a fun and close to normal summer for many Americans.“Deep down I want to rejoice,” said Rita Torres, a retired university administrator in Oakland, California. But she plans to take it slow: “Because it’s kind of like, is it too soon? Will we be sorry?”With the arrival of the vaccine in mid-December, Covid-19 deaths per day in the US have plummeted to an average of around 340, from a high of over 3,400 in mid-January. Cases are running at about 14,000 a day on average, down from a quarter-million per day over the winter.The real death tolls in the US and around the globe are thought to be significantly higher, with many cases overlooked or possibly concealed by some countries.President Joe Biden acknowledged the approaching milestone Monday during his visit to Europe, saying that while new cases and deaths are dropping dramatically in the US, “there’s still too many lives being lost,” and “now is not the time to let our guard down.”The most recent deaths are seen in some ways as especially tragic now that the vaccine has become available practically for the asking.More than 50% of Americans have had at least one dose of vaccine, while over 40% are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.But demand for shots in the US has dropped off dramatically, leaving many places with a surplus of doses and casting doubt on whether the country will meet Biden's target of having 70% of American adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4. The figure stands at just under 65%.As of a week ago, the US was averaging about 1 million injections per day, down from a high of about 3.3 million a day on average in mid-April, according to the CDC.At nearly every turn in the outbreak, the virus has exploited and worsened inequalities in the United States. CDC figures, when adjusted for age and population, show that Black, Latino and Native American people are two to three times more likely than whites to die of Covid-19.Also, an Associated Press analysis found that Latinos are dying at much younger ages than other groups. Hispanic people between 30 and 39 have died at five times the rate of white people in the same age group.Overall, Black and Hispanic Americans have less access to medical care and are in poorer health, with higher rates of conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. They are also more likely to have jobs deemed essential, less able to work from home and more likely to live in crowded, multigenerational households.With the overall picture improving rapidly, California, the most populous state and the first to impose a coronavirus lockdown, dropped state rules on social distancing and limits on capacity at restaurants, bars, supermarkets, gyms, stadiums and other places, ushering in what has been billed as its “Grand Reopening” just in time for summer.Disneyland is throwing open its gates to all tourists after allowing just California residents. Fans will be able to sit elbow-to-elbow and cheer without masks at Dodgers and Giants gamesIn New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that 70% of adults in the state have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and he announced that the immediate easing of many of the restrictions will be celebrated with fireworks.“What does 70% mean? It means that we can now return to life as we know it,” he said.He said the state is lifting rules that had limited the size of gatherings and required some types of businesses to follow cleaning protocols, take people’s temperature or screen them for Covid-19 symptoms. Businesses will no longer have to restrict how many people they can allow inside based on the 6-foot rule.For the time being, though, New Yorkers will have to keep wearing masks in schools, subways and certain other places.Massachusetts on Tuesday officially lifted a state of emergency that had been in effect for 462 days, though many restrictions had already been eased, including mask requirements and limits on gatherings.The first known deaths from the virus in the US were in early February 2020. It took four months to reach the first 100,000 dead. During the most lethal phase of the disaster, in the winter of 2020-21, it took just over a month to go from 300,000 to 400,000 deaths.With the crisis now easing, it took close to four months for the US death toll to go from a half-million to 600,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-deaths-at-600-000-equal-to-2019-cancer-toll-in-america-101623780749035.html
16-06-2021||India||Cops quiz Mithun Chakrabory over poll speeches||Kolkata: Actor Mithun Chakraborty, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on March 7 , was questioned by the Kolkata police on Wednesday morning in connection with a case in which he has been accused of advocating violence through his campaign speeches during the recent West Bengal assembly election. The complaint was lodged on May 6 by a Kolkata resident , Mrityunjay Pal, alleging that the 71-year-old national award-winning actor used a monologue from one of his popular Bengali movies in which his character described himself as a cobra whose one bite could kill anyone. The lines, “Ami joldhorao noi, bele borao noi... ami ekta cobra: ek chobolei chhobi (I am not a harmless snake, I am a pure cobra: one bite and you are dead),” came from the 2006 movie Abhimanyu. In the same speech on March 7, Chakraborty mouthed another controversial dialogue from his 2006 superhit Bengali movie MLA Fatakeshto: “Marbo ekhane…laash porbe shoshane (I will thrash you here and you will end up at a crematorium).” The FIR alleges that such speeches played a role in inciting post-poll violence in the state. Last week, Chakraborty moved the Calcutta high court through his lawyer, seeking quashing of the charges, but the court allowed the police to question him virtually. Officers from the Maniktala police station questioned Chakraborty for around 45 minutes. “It was done during a video conference,” said Mrinal Kanti Mukherjee, officer-in-charge of Maniktala police station. He refused to divulge details. The allegation against the actor comes at a time when the BJP has alleged that the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) is sponsoring post-poll violence in the districts. Chakraborty, formerly a Rajya Sabha MP of TMC, joined the BJP at the party’s first rally at the historic Brigade Parade Grounds on March 7 where Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a mammoth crowd. He picked up the BJP flag from top leaders an hour before Modi arrived. Chakraborty used the controversial monologue in his speech on that day. It was heard again in the districts. Chakraborty campaigned extensively, leading as many as three roadshows on some days. The BJP allotted a chopper for him. TMC won the election with 213 seats while the BJP , which was hoping to win over 200, did only 77. Speculations over Chakraborty joining the BJP started on February 16 when Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat had a 90-minute meeting with the actorin Mumbai. At that time, Chakraborty had told the media that the meeting had been due for around two years and had nothing to do with politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-quiz-mithun-chakrabory-over-poll-speeches-101623868091375.html

He was inducted into J Jayalalithaa’s council of ministers as Tamil Nadu’s information technology minister, a post that he continued to hold till 2019 when he was sacked after he took on his new boss, then chief minister chief minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami over cable television subscription tariff.According to the prosecution, Manikandan was introduced to the actor, a Malaysian citizen, in May 2017 when she was working with the Malaysian Tourism Development Organisation. The prosecution told the court that Manikandan promised to marry her after divorcing his wife and the two stayed together in Chennai and New Delhi and travelled together. The accused impregnated her thrice, forced her to abort and continued to have sexual intervource with her in a forceful and brutal manner, the prosecution alleged.Manikandan has denied the allegations, insisting that the actor filed the First Information Report against him after “several attempts for compromise” did not succeed since he didn’t accept what he described as her “extortionist demands”.“Further, the time of the complaint, especially after the change of Government clearly shows that the defacto complainant is not aggrieved but has lodged a false complaint only with an ulterior motive to extort money,” Manikandan’s lawyer told the high court, insisting that their relationship was consensual.In his ruling, Justice Qudhose dealt at length on what constitutes consent to a sexual act and of consent given after being assured of a marriage. “On a prima facie consideration, we cannot rule out the perpetration of fraud by the petitioner (the accused) by falsely promising the defacto complainant that he will marry her in order to quench his lust for sex,” the judge said in its order, citing verdicts of the Suoreme Court.“In the case on hand, the petitioner has been charged with a heinous crime,” the court said. “If granted anticipatory bail at this preliminary stage, that too for offence of grave nature involving a woman, the investigation may get delayed as there is every possibility that the petitioner with his influence and affluence may scuttle the investigation,” the court ruled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-arrest-shield-for-aiadmk-s-ex-minister-accused-of-rape-by-malaysian-national-101623867913032.html

The people cited above said Chowdhury started reading a suo-motu statement which was critical of the Centre’s response to the second wave. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders Jagdambika Pal and Janata Dal (United) MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh said that the reading of a statement is not in line with the rules.The leaders were also opposed to taking up the Covid-19 vaccination for discussion. Following the argument, Chowdhury said if the panel feels these issues are inappropriate, he is ready to resign. The NDA MPs later suggested that the broader purpose of the PAC is to audit the revenue and the expenditure of the Union government and also to examine the audit report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) after it is laid before Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-pac-meet-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury-clashes-with-nda-mps-over-covid-19-related-issues-101623866955921.html
16-06-2021||India||Only 4.09% fully vaccinated healthcare staff across Apollo Hospitals got Covid-19||Only 4.09% of the healthcare workers who had received both the doses of their vaccine developed a subsequent coronavirus infection, according to data from 43 units of Apollo Healthcare across India. Among those who had received only one shot of the vaccine, 5.14% got the infection. The data also showed a higher rate of infection among the healthcare workers who were administered the Indian variant of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, Serum Institute of India’s Covishield. 4.32% of the people given Covishield developed an infection afterwards in comparison to 3.85% among the group administered Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. Of the 1,355 who developed an infection, only 90 were hospitalised with three people needing ICU care, showing that severe disease after vaccination is rare. The infection on average happened six weeks after they received a shot. The data of 31,621 healthcare workers was collected between January 16 when the vaccination drive was rolled out and May 30. Of them, 81.9% were fully vaccinated and 18.1% had received only one dose. “This study period covered the second wave and the maximum infections occurred in April and May 2021. Despite the high infection rate in the community during this period, the vaccinated HCWs were protected.” said SV Kiran, senior vice president and head - Human Resources, Apollo Hospitals Group in a release. The proportion of fully vaccinated healthcare workers developing an infection at Apollo Group was much lower than what has been reported from public hospitals like Lok Nayak and associated Maulana Azad Medical College or Christian Medical College Vellore. A study from a Delhi hospital that has been treating only Covid-19 patients for over a year saw an 11% infection rate in vaccinated health care workers. The researchers of the study say that the higher rate of infection was likely a function of exposure to the virus at the hospital that has been treating only Covid-19 patients. The study from Christian Medical College-Vellore found 9.6% of completely vaccinated health care workers contracted the viral infection as against 27.2% of those who were unvaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-4-09-fully-vaccinated-healthcare-staff-across-apollo-hospitals-got-covid19-101623866772216.html

16-06-2021||India||'Remdesivir was distributed from BJP office to save lives': Gujarat MLA to HC||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Harsh Sanghavi told the Gujarat high court on Tuesday that Remdesivir injections were made available by Bharatiya Janata Party leaders to needy patients in Surat and Navsari in south Gujarat between April 10 and 12 on grounds of "compassion and humanity" and to "save a number of lives", news agency PTI reported.The MLA was defending himself against charges of hoarding and illegally distributing the antiviral drug. It was distributed with the "sole intention of compassion and humanity" as injections were "urgently required to save a number of lives", he said in an affidavit submitted in the court.It was during the peak of the second wave of the pandemic, in April and May, that the MLA was found in possession of the Remdesivir viles. It was also the time when the whole country faced a severe shortage of the drug which is used to treat serious Covid-19 patients, as its demand was high.Rejecting the charges levelled against him by Gujarat Congress leader Paresh Dhanani as a political stunt, the BJP legislator said a total of 2,506 vials of the injection were procured from a distributor on payments made on bills. It was only after proper verification of documents concerned at the BJP office in Surat that the vials were made available to patients, he said. Charges of hoarding and illegal distribution of the drug were "absolutely false, frivolous, baseless and made without verifying the correct facts," Sanghavi said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe "distribution" was done in accordance with the procedure established by law, and was in no case an "illegal, irregular or unlawful" act, the BJP legislator further clarified.Dhanani had filed the PIL in the HC seeking an independent inquiry against Sanghavi and Lok Sabha MP and Gujarat BJP president CR Paatil for “illegal and unauthorised distribution of Remdesivir injections” from the BJP's office in Surat.Paatil, who is yet to file his affidavit, was given a week by the court on Tuesday to do so. The court also made it clear that "no further time will be granted." The matter will come up for further hearing on July 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remdesivir-was-distributed-from-bjp-office-to-save-lives-gujarat-mla-to-hc-101623855380630.html
16-06-2021||India||Cabinet clears corporatisation of OFB, to be split into 7 entities||The Union Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday cleared the corporatisation of the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) -- India’s main producer of weapons and military equipment --- to boost its efficiency and competitiveness in a long-awaited reform in the country’s defence manufacturing sector, top officials familiar with the developments said. The OFB, which controls 41 ordnance factories, will be split into seven government-owned entities that will produce ammunition and explosives, vehicles, weapons and equipment, troop comfort items, opto-electronics gear, parachutes and ancillary products, said one of the officials cited above, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Ordnance factories are currently engaged in the production of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, mine protected vehicles, bombs, rockets, artillery guns, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes, small arms, clothing and leather equipment for soldiers. “The restructuring will transform the ordnance factories into productive and profitable assets, deepen product specialisation, boost performance and improve quality, cost efficiency and accountability,” said a second official. He said it was a big step towards achieving self-reliance in defence manufacturing. The government expects the seven new professionally-managed entities - likely to come up by the year-end – to increase their share in the domestic market through better capacity utilisation and also tap new export opportunities. “The new structure will help overcome various shortcomings in the existing OFB set-up by eliminating inefficient supply chains and provide these companies incentive to become competitive. It will boost their autonomy too,” said the first official. During the last two decades, various high-level committees have underlined the need to improve the functioning of the OFB and making its factories vehicles of self-reliance for the country’s defence preparedness. Defence minister Rajnath Singh described the decision to corporatise the OFB as a “historic one.” “It is also a big decision from the point of view of national security,” Singh said. The factories controlled by the board employ at least 70,000 people who have been against the move to corporatise it. Three federations of defence civilian employees of the OFB gave a joint strike notice last August against the government’s plans to corporatise the board. The workers’ federations called off their proposed countrywide strike last year after a reconciliation meeting. Singh said there would be no change in the service conditions of the OFB employees and the government was committed to safeguarding their interests. All OFB employees (Group A, B and C) from different production units will be transferred to the corporate entities on deemed deputation for an initial period of two years without changing their service conditions as government employees, Hindustan Times has learnt. “The pension liabilities of the retirees and existing employees will continue to be borne by the government,” said the second official cited above. An empowered group of ministers (EGoM), constituted under the defence minister last year, will oversee the board’s corporatisation and also take decisions on other related matters, the official added. An internal army assessment last year flagged concerns about faulty ammunition and armament supplied by the OFB causing army casualties and bleeding the exchequer. It said 403 accidents over the previous six years resulted in the deaths of 27 soldiers and a loss of ₹960 crore. “Lack of accountability and poor quality of production result in frequent accidents. This results in injuries and death of soldiers. On an average, one accident takes place per week,” the note said. The OFB reacted to the army’s assessment as factually incorrect. In 2017, the government took action against 13 defence ministry bureaucrats from the Indian Ordnance Factories Service for the repeated failures of the ordnance factories to meet the shortfall in ammunition and poor quality of products. The Comptroller and Auditor General has also raised questions about the quality of products supplied by the OFB and its overall performance in its reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-clears-corporatisation-of-ofb-to-be-split-into-7-entities-101623856153716.html

I can’t tell that to an officer from outside who comes and goes,” said Sofi, who has also contested elections to local bodies in the past. “Khan responded in Urdu, saying ‘what are you saying we are all Indians here’ which gave the DC (deputy commissioner) a wrong impression that we were talking about her. It was not the case,” he said.Ganderbal deputy commissioner Krittika Jyotsna, an IAS officer from Uttar Pradesh, took offence to the remark at the programme. Krittika Jyotsna and her husband, Rahul Pandey, who is posted with the Raj Bhavan as the director of information, came to Jammu and Kashmir in February this year on inter-cadre deputation from Uttar Pradesh. Jyotsna could not be reached for her response.A police report said that Jyotsna stood up from her seat and “strongly objected” to Sofi’s comments at the June 10 outreach programme, according to PTI. Sofi was summoned and booked by the police under Section 153 of the penal code the same night for allegedly promoting enmity between different groups.Sofi was granted bail on Saturday but stayed in custody after the police invoked sections 107 and 151 under which a person can be placed under preventive detention on the directions of an executive magistrate if there is an apprehension of breach of peace.Many political leaders and parties had strongly criticised Sofi’s arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-trying-to-make-a-point-says-kashmiri-man-arrested-for-offending-iasofficial-101623855371415.html

The report has approximated the underreporting for the entire state and concluded the likely number of deaths due to Covid in Tamil Nadu may be between 108,721 and 126,841 against the reported number of 12,943.“There was no other major disease or cause that could have led to this drastic increase in deaths during this time other than Covid-19,” said Arappor Iyakkam founder Jayaram Venkatesan.Also Read | ‘Will set party straight’, says Sasikala in clipThe report said only six of the hospitals uploaded month-wise death certificates online and they represented all regions of Tamil Nadu. The report has also analysed the daily data on fatalities at the hospitals in 2019, 2020, and 2021 from January to May.The report said the number of death certificates issued at these hospitals in April and May was 4,437 and 3,261 for 2019 and 2020. The number has increased to 11, 699 this year.The report said there has been an increase of at least 8,438 deaths in April and May this year, compared to these months in 2020. The report said Covid-19 related deaths at the six hospitals during the same period by the health department were just 863.The second Covid-19 wave peaked in May in Tamil Nadu. A lockdown was imposed in the state on May 10 to check the wave. The state has begun opening up in a staggered manner from Tuesday.The report said the increased mortality is directly proportional to the rise in the cases during the second wave. “Therefore, the increased numbers (of fatalities) in April and May compared to previous years are most likely due to Covid and its complications,” the report said. It added the number of likely deaths due to Covid-19 and its complications in these six hospitals are between 7,262 and 8,438 in April and May. “Given the government has consistently underreported (deaths) in each of the hospitals, it could be attributed that this phenomenon exists throughout the state as well,” the report said.State health minister M Subramanian said they do not need to hide Covid-19 deaths and questioned what they will achieve by underreporting. “...We have been following ICMR guidelines for certifying Covid-19 deaths.” He said they do not want to dismiss the report, so they are directing an investigation in these hospitals. “We only want to be transparent.”Also Read | Covid-19 has created an ‘ecosystem’ of innovation in India: Kiran Mazumdar-ShawThere have been reports of underreporting of deaths also from other states. Dr A Rathinavel, the dean of Government Rajaji Hospital (Madurai), which is one of the six hospitals, denied underreporting of deaths. “We are 100% following ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) guidelines (on Covid mortality),” he said.The hospital issued 3,152 certificates for deaths in April and May out of which only 172 were attributed to Covid-19. “The swab test of a person has to be positive for the death to be certified as Covid-19 related,” said Rathinavel.Subramanian last week cited ICMR guidelines and said even if a patient is positive at the time of admission to a hospital and turns negative before death, it will not be considered as a Covid-19 fatality.Coimbatore Medical College Hospital dean A Nirmala said they certify causes of death after analysing every individual patient and not by just following guidelines. “Every day, our panel of doctors meets to analyse the deaths. Deaths can be due to incidental Covid which we brand as fatalities due to other causes. For instance, an incidental death is directly due to other causes such as uncontrolled hypertension, kidney disease. While treating that cause we have to take a swab. If it turns positive but the patient does not have Covid-19 related symptoms, it will be reported as death due to other causes. Just because people are infected, it does not mean they are dying due to Covid-19 alone.”The Coimbatore hospital issued 3,464 death certificates in April and May out of which only 323 related to Covid-19.Arappor Iyakkam said it has sent the report to chief minister MK Stalin and Subramanian while asking the government to provide data on deaths at hospitals and homes compared to the previous years for the state.The NGO said it carried out the exercise to help families avail compensation announced by the government in cases of Covid-19 deaths. “Underreporting can cause a huge problem for thousands and thousands of families who require documentation to avail compensation,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-deaths-could-be-8-9-times-official-count-in-tnngoreport-101623850451114.html

The Government of Gujarat has transferred 375 acres of land in Saragvada village on lease for 99 years at a token rate to MoSPW."The complex will be showcasing the thousands of year old maritime strength of India," said Culture Minister Prahlad Patel.Renowned architect Hafeez Contractor has been selected as the Principal Project Consultant to prepare a master plan and requisite design and engineering documents for inviting EPC tenders and project management consultancy.NMHC would be developed in an area of about 400 acres with various unique structures such as the National Maritime Heritage Museum, lighthouse museum, heritage theme park, museum-themed hotels, maritime-themed eco-resorts and maritime institute among others which would be developed in a phased manner.The unique feature of NMHC is the recreation of ancient Lothal city, which was one of the prominent cities of the Indus valley civilization."NMHC is to be developed as a first of its kind in the country dedicated to the legacy of the maritime heritage of India, to showcase India's rich and diverse maritime glory," Mansukh Mandaviya, the Minister of MoPSW said during the signing ceremony.The museum is set to be completed in three years from the date the project commences.As a part of the museum, 14 galleries have been proposed to exhibit the evolution of India's maritime heritage during various eras.Key galleries include mythologies and wilderness of Indian Ocean, Harappans: The Pioneer Master Seafarers, Indian Ocean: an Interactive Sphere, India's contact with the Roman World: The Quest for the Spice, Trade, Commerce and Cultural Interaction with China and South-East Asia.Other notable galleries that have been proposed are Age of Emporia Contact, Landing of Vasco da Gama/The Arrival of the Europeans, Maratha Naval Power, Emergence of Indian Navy, Maritime Traditions of Gujarat, Traditional Ship Building and Navigation Techniques of India, Heritage of the Coastal Communities of India and Indian Shipping: Post Independence (Shipping Industries, Sagarmala, contemporary Ports, Port Association of India).It is also proposed to have a pavilion for each coastal states and union territories at NMHC to showcase the artefacts and maritime heritage of the states and union territories.The Culture Ministry will facilitate the fundraising for NMHC through National Culture Fund (NCF). The services of NCF shall be used to receive funds by way of grant, donation, CSR and foreign contribution.Artefacts from Lothal and Dholavira will also be displayed at the NMHC complex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/museum-dedicated-to-india-s-maritime-history-to-come-up-in-gujarat-101623845059813.html
16-06-2021||India||‘May 2021 is as horrific as November 1918, during the influenza pandemic’||The Age of Pandemics author Chinmay Tumbe, who studied death registrations in five states, found they exceed by at least 10 times the official toll from the second wave of Covid-19. Tumbe, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about his study amid reports of underreporting of Covid-19 deaths. Edited excerpts:What did you find when you looked at the data from Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Madhya Pradesh?If you just look at four states...Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu...from January 1 to roughly May 31, (they) cumulatively and collectively recorded over half a million excess deaths. More than 500,000 excess deaths as compared to...46,000 deaths, which were reported of Covid. Now, that is a large difference if you multiply 46,000 to 10, you get 460,000. So, this is a factor of more than 10. Now, not all excess deaths need to be of Covid... but if you plot a monthly or annual distribution chart of deaths in India for the last 50 years, you see very little variation from month to month in general in non-pandemic times. One of the things that pandemics do is precisely increase death substantially. That is why pandemics are so dangerous. So, if you look at any state government chart, you will see very little variation across months, even across years. Obviously, as the population is growing, fewer deaths will grow which poses some trend line.Also Read | The growing urban bias of India’s vaccination driveNow when you get numbers from Madhya Pradesh or Andhra Pradesh, where you see more deaths in May. ...May 2021 is as horrific as November 1918, hundred years back during the influenza pandemic...because I’ve looked at those numbers as well...that’s precisely the kind of spikes that you’ve seen in the data when you see for the last 20 years...months are reporting the same death rates, and then suddenly you see three or five times more.So, it’s clearly the signature of the pandemic... these 500,000 excess deaths...are not accidents. They’re definitely related to the pandemic. It could be, of course, that some of these deaths are of people who got a heart attack and could not get to the hospital in time because there’s a lockdown or the hospitals were full of other patients. So, there’s obviously some diversion of resources that have claimed deaths. But there’s no doubt that the bulk of this is Covid, and especially because of massive deaths in rural areas on a per capita basis.Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh are much more rural than Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. You’re seeing a much higher excess deaths per capita ratio. What this also tells you is because we are counting Covid dead only. ...a lot of people who simply didn’t have testing facilities can never be counted as a Covid death, even if they actually got Covid. So, this is an important point to keep in mind and that is why excess deaths is a very powerful metric...it’s a very horrifying statistic because these four states comprise 300 million people. That’s about the size of the US.And you’re seeing deaths which are about the same as were reported for the US, which is about half a million deaths. So, all this while people say, you know, India’s death numbers are not very high, and you can discount it because on a per capita basis they are very low. Unfortunately, now what we’re finding is that on a per capita basis, India ranks very badly for the data that is available.The thing that strikes immediately is that 10 times figure. Now I know that you’ve just studied four or five states. But is it, if we extrapolate, that means that at the moment 370,000 death figures could be actually 10 times more?I think you have to break down wave one and wave two. So, what we should be doing is ideally look at 2020 and 2021 very differently. So that 370,000 figure you said is basically about, let us say, 210,000 for this year. Right. And 150,000 or 170,000 deaths as reported for the first year. Now there is some work that suggests that the underreporting factors in the first year were very low. You know, because these underreporting factors themselves vary from state to state. ...It will also vary from wave to wave. So, I don’t think we should be applying this factor of 10 to 370,000.Could you apply it to, say 200,000 for wave two? I’m focusing right now on wave two because that is where really the pandemic hit us very hard. And so, if we just focus on wave two, how plausible is 10 times as an all-India factor?We still have data from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and so many states to come, where the underreporting factors are, in my view, definitely going to be substantially more than what we’re seeing for Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. So, while obviously, one has to wait for the eventual data, clearly, this is going to be now a lower bound for an all-India factor and that is why it’s very horrific. So, I wouldn’t multiply 10 with 370,000 of the overall deaths so far. But if you want to multiply 10 with, say, 180 or 200,000 deaths of wave two, because my analysis is only for wave two, that is 2021. That’s the kind of number you see.Also Read | Ajit Singh: Face of Jat politics in UP and champion of farmers’ rightsSo, whereas earlier, I was placing a lower bound estimate of 1,000,000 excess deaths based on just the stuff I’ve done on Gujarat, which is only 5% of India. Now we have more data for a longer period, so I’m revising that lower bound from 1 to 1.5 million.So how are you calculating this? Just to be sure, because, you know, when the Economist came out with its data and said the other factor was five to seven times the government suggested data, the government immediately pushed back saying, no, it’s wrong. Would you like to explain your particular study, which has looked at particular states, what is the data that you are going by yet?The data comes from the civil registration system. This is where the deaths are registered. Think of it as when somebody dies, you get a death certificate issued. So, all those death certificates are counted. And so, we have a process called death registration. Obviously, this varies from state to state. In some states, virtually every death is registered while in some states, it is less. But the fact is that this is one of the most scientific ways to calculate deaths to give some sense of how much the pandemic really hit. I mean, you can’t just think that nobody died of Covid in India if you supposedly did not have a testing mechanism. Think of the 1918 pandemic. They didn’t have any testing mechanism. They in fact used more common sense and said if a person died of fever in October-November 1918, it must be a very high chance that it was influenza which we are not doing.You’re saying you have to test positive to be counted as Covid dead. And then there’s an ICMR protocol on how you deal with comorbidities, which is one classically many states are using for underreporting and so on.Also Read | Ownership patterns prevent intervention to repair monumentsBut my point is that a lot of India does not have access to testing facilities, especially in rural India. So, if you go with a strict approach to ICMR protocol, we are missing a huge part of the deaths. We basically have to assume that if deaths are going up by five times in May, it means that most of it is likely to be Covid, and it’s quite likely that none of those people actually tested for it because the testing facilities were not there in the first place.So, this data that we are using comes from death certificates and I would say, it is probably one of the most scientific methods to do.There is another method... the intercensal growth rate method, which is using census data. And so, you might ask, but look, the bodies floating in the Ganga, they never left a death certificate. Even those deaths could be estimated to a certain extent. When the next census is conducted, we can find the shortfall in certain age cohorts.If you compare 2001 to the next census, you can find out how many people are missing in villages and so on. And that is why that is an additional method to calculate deaths. So, for example, I did this for the 1918 pandemic, the first estimate was six million, and this was based on something like fever, which was actually a better way to understand the severity than now. But that six million figure was revised again by various researchers and now the number is 20 million.So, the underreporting factor at that time was three, which is lower than what it is now because people use a very simple idea of fever, just a fever. Today, we have a very stringent norm to be classified as Covid dead; you have to be tested positive then you should have died because of Covid. So, it’s a very stringent claim. I think the government needs to just ensure that all the statistics which researchers have been asking the government to release for more than one and a half years now, should be open.If the government does want the scientific analysis of this, they just have to make all the registration statistics public, which is already there online. They just have to literally sign a document saying just go and make it public, and then it’s up to researchers to make the decisions.Tamil Nadu did not really have many excess deaths and it wasn’t really that much of a difference. Right? Does that show that perhaps they had a better way of counting their deaths and ascribing it to Covid than perhaps how the other states were doing it?Yeah, I think the difference in these four states is that if you look at Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, they have an urbanisation rate of 30%. If you look at Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, they have an urbanisation rate of 50%.Now, here is one speculation and one theory as to the numbers we’re seeing, the more urban the state, the lower the underreporting factor you’re likely to see. This is because there are going to be better testing facilities. People are going to be saved more because there are more hospitals, so that’s a simple reason.In wave one, the virus did not go to rural areas. Mumbai was a big problem last year. Thus, we can characterise wave one as predominantly urban-centric. But wave two has moved to rural areas where there are simply no testing facilities. And so that is why what we have observed, and that is why researchers have been trying for the last year asking to make the registration statistics visible. What is visible today are the Covid numbers that are being tested.Also Read | TMC wants to expand beyond Bengal. But it won’t be easyBut that’s a huge urban bias towards places that have testing facilities. So, imagine a state which has no testing available, but that doesn’t mean that nobody has died of Covid.Compared to the rest of the world, where do we stand in the underreporting?Oh, very bad. In wave two very, very bad, again. As I said, you have to separate out waves one and two, but there have been estimates for the US, for the richer countries, which, by the way, have been publishing these registration statistics on a very regular basis. Those studies are putting the underreporting factors from 1.5 to 2. That’s the kind of range. There’s a study that says that in wave one in India, the underreporting factor could be 2.2. In Mumbai, there are studies for 2020 where many places have a factor excess of 1.6. So that’s the kind of underreporting you would get in, you know, in normal times, in urban areas with good medical facilities, good testing facilities. These underreporting factors, however, are still very large. Just for these four states, if you’re getting a factor of 11 cumulatively, that’s one of the highest in the world, I would imagine.And explain to people who are just saying, you know, why does it matter so much? I mean, people are dying. They’re going to die anyway. Why is it important to know exactly how it stands or know the exact number of people who died? What would you say to them?There are two reasons. One is, if we know the places which have been hit very hard, that’s precisely the places where we need to invest more if at all there is a third wave coming. Because now what we need to do is a plan for the next wave. So, we need to firstly get a sense of which are the districts of India which were caught up and that’s what these numbers are going to tell us, not the official numbers. The official numbers tell you districts, you know, with virtually zero deaths, but huge excess mortality. So, one it helps you in better planning for the next wave or two. Second thing is that, If we make these numbers publicly available regularly, we can actually start identifying when the wave is going to pick up because then we have an addition. We just don’t have the numbers. We have just this excess death number to see if it’s going up in precisely those places that don’t have the facilities. We can then start diverting resources and give a simple example, we can use the official Covid numbers for that oxygen allocation.Now, just think of it as saying that actually more oxygen was technically required in Madhya Pradesh, it has huge relevance. This is not just an academic matter. It’s a matter which can save lives and that’s why we need to publish these statistics as soon as possible.Apart from more transparency of publishing in all the deaths that happen, is there anything else that we need for better covid management?I think, broadly put, there are maybe two or three things that you can do better than what we are doing. One is in terms of investing in tracking new mutations. I think why wave two was so different was primarily because of this strain and we do not track the mutations very well. This is also a lesson from past pandemics. So, investment in understanding the strain varieties that are in the public. Increasing testing capacity, even more, would be the second while the third is to ramp up the facilities. Hopefully, there’s no third wave, but if it is, you know, you don’t want to be in the same situation that we faced in the second wave. What people are now saying is, you know, the first wave, nobody expected and now people are saying again in the second wave that nobody expected. Then, I don’t know which way people are going to expect. The idea should be to now ramp up as much as possible, before a third wave if at all it materializes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/may-2021-is-as-horrific-as-november-1918-during-the-influenza-pandemic-101623849671033.html

Chodankar's statement comes ahead of the four-day visit of All India Congress Committee (AICC) observer Dinesh Gundu Rao, who will arrive in Goa on Thursday to work on reorganising the party. "The central leadership will take a decision on alliance after consulting local leaders, cadres and taking people's opinion,” Chodankar said. When asked about the Goa Forward Party's willingness for a pre-poll alliance with the Congress, he said the party's state has nothing to do with the decision on an alliance, it will only provide inputs. Chodankar had tendered his resignation from the post of GPCC president, after the party's defeat in Zilla Panchayat election, which is yet to be accepted by the party high command. The Congress has a “strong presence” in 30 (out of 40) Assembly constituencies and can add four to five more constituencies to its kitty in the coming days, the party leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-congress-chief-says-central-leadership-to-decide-on-pre-poll-alliances-101623847956690.html

A 12-year-old lion, named Pathmanathan passed away at about 10.15 am on Wednesday, a statement from the zoo indicated. The samples of the lion tested positive for the coronavirus infection on June 3 as per a report of the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal. “The lion was under intensive treatment since then,” the zoo’s statement read. The lion was housed in the lion safari area of the zoo.Earlier, on June 3, a 9-year-old lioness, Neela died in the same zoo after a Covid-19 outbreak among Asiatic lions was reported. Nine lions had tested positive for the infection in the zoo at that time. Senior vets from the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (TANUVAS) are supervising the treatment. Following this, as a precautionary measure, samples from 28 elephants from the Theppakadu camp in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve were collected and sent for Covid-19 testing last week. As preventive measures and for appropriate treatment, the Vandalur Zoo is taking the help of Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology which is an approved animal SARS CoV-2 virus sequencing centre to sequence this variant of the virus for better understanding of zoonotic transmission. The Tamil Nadu government had closed all zoos from April 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-lion-dies-of-covid-19-in-vandalur-zoo-near-chennai-101623848830887.html

Whoever is going against the party's law can't be accepted. Action has been taken against those who went away from abiding law of AIADMK," he said.In an audio clip released by Sasikala's Personal Assistant Karthikeyan yesterday, Sasikala said, "I will definitely come to save AIADMK party because its cadres are important for me. It's time now to come forward and I'll do it. Sure, when I'll come, good things will happen."On June 14, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) expelled sixteen of its party functionaries who interacted with VK Sasikala.This comes after the Legislature Party meeting had passed a resolution calling for actions against those who spoke to Sasikala, a close-aid of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa. The party also expelled party spokesperson V Pugazhendi, stating that the leader was against the party.AIADMK, in its statement earlier termed Sasikala's telephonic conversations with its cadre as "drama" and stated: "The party will never destroy itself for the desires of one family."Earlier, on May 30, Sasikala had dropped enough hints of returning to active politics after the Covid-19 pandemic. In an audio clip of a phone conversation between Sasikala and one of the party cadres, which has gone viral on social media, the leader was heard confirming her plans of her return into politics.

16-06-2021||India||TMC wants to expand beyond Bengal. But it won’t be easy||West Bengal chief minister (CM) and Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief Mamata Banerjee’s plans to contest polls in other states with a target to win assembly elections has triggered questions about the limitations of regional parties beyond their regions, whether TMC will able to break the pattern, and the possible areas of its expansion.The CM’s nephew and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, who is seen as the driving force behind the expansion plan, announced on June 8 that his party will set up units in other states with the sole aim to win elections and face the BJP head-on. He said, “If we go to any state we will not do so only to win one or two seats. We want to be the platform of choice for people of that state.”He did not specify any region but, on Tuesday, a senior TMC leader said, “We are exploring the possibility of contesting in some big states rather than eyeing the smaller ones first.”Buoyed by the resounding victory over the BJP in Bengal, the TMC has renewed its contract with Indian Political Action Committee, or I-PAC, the company launched by election strategist Prashant Kishor — the renewed contract will cover the crucial 2024 Lok Sabha polls in which Banerjee wishes to see her party playing a bigger role in national politics. Kishor has, on paper, left I-Pac to let his team function on its own. Top TMC leaders told HT that Kishor will play a different role from now on, though this wasn’t specified.To political observers, the TMC’s announcement is ambitious as no regional party has so far been able to form government outside the state it is based in.Of regional parties beyond their regions Regional parties have had limited success outside their regions. Take a few examples:The Delhi-based Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has legislators in Congress-ruled Punjab. But this has been its only substantial success. It has fought elections in over a dozen states since 2013, a feat no other regional party has tried to match in this period, without the electoral dividends it had hoped for.Also Read | Kolkata Police question Mithun Chakraborty over election speechThe Uttar Pradesh-based Samajwadi Party (SP) has two members each in legislative assemblies in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Bihar’s main Opposition party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), has one legislator in the adjoining state of Jharkhand.Bihar’s ruling party, the Janata Dal (United), or JD(U), is the second largest party in BJP-ruled Arunachal Pradesh where it has seven MLAs. Though it is an ally of the BJP at the Centre, the JD(U), in 2019, contested against the BJP in Arunachal Pradesh where the assembly has 60 seats.The TMC itself is limited by geography. In Manipur, the TMC bagged seven assembly seats in 2012 but subsequently lost its ground to the Congress and BJP. The party won one seat in Assam in 2001 but never resurfaced. Among other states in the country, the TMC has a unit in Left-ruled Kerala.An eye on Tripura TMC leaders, who did not want to be quoted, said the leadership has its eyes on Tripura where Bengali-speaking people constitute a sizeable part of the population and the TMC still has a unit.With 60 seats in the assembly, Tripura goes to the polls in 2023 along with Meghalaya, Nagaland, Mizoram, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Telengana. The TMC has no presence in the other states.States that go to the polls in 2022 are Manipur, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat. The TMC has no presence in these states as well.And so Tripura may well be the only state where the party can realistically hope to make a dent. Bengal TMC leaders said Mukul Roy, who left the BJP, where he was a national vice-president, and returned to the ruling party last week, played the key role in building the TMC’s base in Tripura by breaking the Congress.“Under Roy’s leadership, Sudip Roy Barman, who was Leader of the Opposition in the assembly during the Left regime and who is the son of former Congress chief minister Samir Ranjan Barman, left the Congress and joined TMC along with five MLAs in 2016. Barman left and joined the BJP with his followers in 2017 when Roy switched sides. Roy may be entrusted with the task of rebuilding the organisation,” a senior TMC office-bearer said on condition of anonymity.Also Read | Former TMC leader sends legal notice to Suvendu Adhikari over tweetsAfter Roy joined the BJP, the TMC had put Sabyasachi Dutta, the former mayor of Salt Lake township in the eastern outskirts of Kolkata, in charge of the Tripura unit but he, too, joined the BJP after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Ashish Lal Singh, the son of Tripura’s first chief minister Sachindra Lal Singh, heads the TMC state unit right now.Manik Saha, the BJP’s Tripura state unit president, said the TMC is free to try its luck but the efforts will be futile.“The TMC tried twice to win elections in Tripura but failed. On those occasions, people believed that the TMC supremo would overthrow the Left government. They had faith and the situation was conducive. Some Congress MLAs, who are now in the BJP, joined the TMC. But ultimately nothing materialised. The ground realities in Tripura and Bengal are quite different now. In a democracy, every party is free to contest polls but I don’t think the TMC can fulfill its dream,” said Saha.Leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), who ruled Tripura from 1978 to 1988 and again from 1993 to 2018, said the TMC’s base in the state eroded drastically after a mass defection to the BJP and efforts to reverse the process may not work.“The TMC is running a dictatorial government in Bengal, just like the BJP in Tripura. No other party is allowed to work. I doubt if people will accept this. Moreover, TMC never enjoyed the support of the Tripuris, the biggest tribal community,” said CPI(M) state secretary Gautam Das.Kolkata-based political science professor Udayan Bandopadhyay said, “The TMC can make a breakthrough in Tripura only if there is an exodus from the BJP. It has to win the trust of tribal voters as well. Biplab Deb came to power by using the anti-incumbency factor. The CPI(M) is still alienated from the people although Manik Sarkar was a good chief minister.”The views of allies and adversariesThe TMC’s decision has sparked contrasting responses from its political friends and adversaries.SP and RJD leaders, who recognise Mamata Banerjee as an ally against the BJP, told HT that they welcome the TMC’s decision to emerge as a bigger force at the national level.SP vice-president Kiranmoy Nanda, a close aide of former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, said, “It is only natural that TMC will now try to expand in other states. It formed units in the Northeast in the past. Mamata Banerjee’s victory was the outcome of a challenge people across India posed before the BJP. The SP not only supported her but campaigned for her in Bengal. Jaya Bachchan led roadshows. Like us, the BJP took the Bengal polls as the most crucial contest. If a third force emerges under Banerjee’s leadership, we will welcome it.”Also Read | ‘Where are your 25 MLAs?,’ TMC MP Banerjee asks BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari“Our sole target is to defeat the BJP. If Abhishek Banerjee wants to expand the TMC to other states, he has our best wishes. We want a strong anti-BJP platform that will focus on the plight of youths, essential needs of people and of course, secularism,” said Shyam Rajak, RJD national general secretary. President of the RJD’s Bengal unit, B P Rai, said, “We supported the Left Front for decades. But Tejashwi Yadav (son of Lalu Prasad Yadav) met Mamata Banerjee before the polls and severed ties with the Left although we were not given a seat to contest.”But regional parties on the other side of the divide are skeptical.JD(U) spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan, however, described the TMC’s target to win assembly polls in other states as impractical.“One can understand that the TMC is excited but this is an unrealistic ambition that can lead to misunderstanding among regional parties. As far as becoming part of a national alliance is concerned, Prashant Kishor is making his efforts. However, no viable alternative is possible without the Congress or BJP. The federal front has no future because people did not accept such alternatives in the past. It will be wrong to think that the TMC’s victory, no matter how big, can make it acceptable in other states,” said Ranjan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-wants-to-expand-beyond-bengal-but-it-won-t-be-easy-101623846850772.html

People know your real face,” he said. He said RSS does not have the moral courage to register itself and does not have the decency to pay income taxes.Also Read | ‘Rahul Gandhi must answer’: Minister on fuel price hikes in Congress statesHe cited the alleged commission demands in Jaipur and added this was the situation in states where they are not in power. “...imagine what they would be doing in states where they are in power,” Khera said.

He questioned how much of these funds have been transferred to the Trust overseeing the temple construction. Khera accused the RSS of befooling three generations of Indians.Rajasthan BJP media-in-charge Vimal Katiyar accused Congress of making the allegations based on fake video and audio recordings to defame the BJP and its ideological fountainhead, the RSS. He hit out at the Congress and said it has no right to talk about Lord Ram because it allegedly refused to acknowledge his existence. “...they (Congress) have been against the building of the Ram Mandir, which is a symbol of devotion and faith for Indians,” Katiyar said. He added they did not raise funds for the temple and that it is for the Trust to do so. “And no one is asking not to audit the Trust.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-hits-out-at-rss-accuses-it-of-corruption-101623845770762.html

16-06-2021||India||Bihar Raj Bhawan begins appointment process for VCs in varsities||Raj Bhawan in Bihar has initiated the process for appointment of vice chancellors for two universities and the pro-VC for one university, raising hopes that the rampant ad hoc situation in the state varsities may end in the coming months. At present seven of the state’s 17 universities are without VCs and eight under additional charge, as one VC has been asked to go on leave.OSD-Judicial at the Raj Bhawan Vinod Tiwari said that the process of appointments in all the universities was underway. “The appointments will be made as per the required process. It is the domain of the Chancellor,” he added.The ad hoc appointments in Bihar’s higher education sector has developed a unique pattern, with continuing experiments and frequent reshuffles on key positions for one reason or the other, which has affected the long-term vision of institutions at a time when the new education policy (NEP) has gradually started unfolding.Since July 2019, when Phagu Chauhan assumed the charge of Bihar Governor, (he also happens to be Chancellor of state universities), the state institutions have been increasingly under interim charge of vice chancellors, registrars, financial advisors and finance officers due to frequent resignations, removals and reshuffles, besides the uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Though appointments to key positions remained held up, except for the time ahead of Assembly elections when six vice chancellors and seven Pro-VCs were appointed to fill vacant positions after a long delay, removals and reshuffles have continued.The much-hyped experiment with Brigadiers as the registrars of universities to bring in discipline, which was initiated during the tenure of former Governor Satyapal Malik, has been done away with, with many officials with Army backgrounds removed before time to hand over charge of multiple universities to professors even from affiliated colleges. Earlier, professors from affiliated colleges never held the post of registrar.The result was that not only VCs, but registrars are also holding multiple charge. If one VC is holding charge of four universities, another VC of three and yet another of two universities, there is a registrar from an affiliated college holding charge of three universities and another two registrars holding charge of two universities each. This is also evident in the case of college principals.“The situation is strange, as even in rampant ad hocism there is a pattern. There is a race even to grab interim positions, which often results in frequent changes even in makeshift arrangements. When one VC and registrar is not capable of handling even one university properly, which is evident in more ways than one due to the apparent mess on campuses, how and why should one person be given charge of 3-4 universities and then be reshuffled frequently. If one is not competent at one place or indulges in wrong practices, there should be accountability fixed. Even appointment of such officials should be under question,” said Prof NK Choudhary, social activist and former head of economics in Patna University.In the last couple of years, at least half a dozen VCs either resigned or were asked to go by the Chancellor midway through their tenure, the latest being Veer Kuer Singh University (Ara) VC Devi Prasad Tiwari. There are also a couple of other VCs facing charges and inquiry, but one of them has still got additional responsibility. Even P-VCs were asked to quit. The same happened with several registrars and finance officers. In a recent case, the registrar of Magadh University, Vijay Kumar, was removed, while the finance officer resigned and the financial advisor was transferred after their joint complaint to the Chancellor regarding a tender and the pressure on them. The Raj Bhawan also took cognisance of the complaint and public interest litigation has also been filed in the Patna High Court.Former director of AN Sinha institute of Social Studies and social analyst DM Diwakar said that so many removals of incumbents to key positions by the Chancellor’s office within a short span of time meant that the appointment process was not able to bring in the right people. “This calls for serious thinking at the highest level. If officials are removed on corruption charges, mere removal should not be the end of it. Besides, attempts should be made to appoint the right people and due precaution must be taken before hand,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-raj-bhawan-begins-appointment-process-for-vcs-in-varsities-101623845050782.html
16-06-2021||India||Mehul Choksi booked for destruction of evidence in CBI's fresh charge sheet||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on June 10 filed a fresh charge sheet against diamantaire Mehul Choksi and 21 others in Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam in which the fugitive has been charged with destruction of evidence for the first time.The agency’s charge sheet claims Choksi, in connivance with officials of PNB, got 165 Letters of Undertaking (LOUs) and 58 FLCs (Foreign Letters of Credit) issued fraudulently in 2017 causing loss of ₹6,097 crore ($952 million) to the bank and then indulged in a cover-up.The supplementary charge sheet charges Choksi under sections 201 (destruction of evidence), and cheating, criminal conspiracy and prevention of corruption act.Officials familiar with developments said the latest charge sheet will be shared with authorities and court in Dominica to boost India’s deportation plea. HT has accessed a copy of the charge sheet.Apart from Choksi, 21 individuals and companies are named in the charge sheet, including retired deputy manager of PNB Gokulnath Shetty, single window operator Hanumant Karat, former managing director of Allahabad Bank Usha Ananthasubramaniam, former executive directors of PNB KV Brahmaji Rao and Sanjiv Sharan, former general manager of the bank Nehal Ahad, former vice president of Choksi’s Gitanjali Group Vipul Chitalia, and several companies.The charge sheet says, “In December 2017, Mehul Choksi visited Hong Kong and met dummy directors of Hong Kong-based supplier entities (controlled by him) and told them that problems are going on in India related to his company – Gitanjali Group and that they might have to face Enforcement Directorate (ED) enquiries.”“This shows that Mehul Choksi had prior knowledge about the impending criminal proceedings. Hence, he fled the country on January 4, 2018, with dishonest intent, to evade the process of law”.Choksi also told his companies’ dummy directors in Hong Kong that they must apply for Thailand visa as the operation in Hong Kong would be closed, the charge sheet adds. “He got them (dummy directors) shifted to Bangkok in February 2018, when fraud came to light, and persuaded them not to visit India to face investigating agencies.”CBI has stated it is further investigating the bogus LOUs and FLCs issued in favour of Choksi’s companies in 2014, 2015 and 2016. It is suspected that total 347 bogus FLCs were issued between 2014 and 2016.The investigators, during raids in 2018, recovered records of fraudulent LOUs and FLCs transactions maintained in the Google drive by Vipul Chitalia at the behest of Mehul Chinubhai Choksi, which have been included in the charge sheet.CBI has said it is also probing alleged diversion of another ₹942 crore by Choksi’s companies, including Asmi Jewellery India Ltd as well as the role of chief internal auditor of PNB, Brady House branch, Bishnubrata Mishra.The premier agency, as reported by HT, filed an affidavit in Dominica HC saying that Choksi is a fugitive from justice, the chief conspirator and main beneficiary of the PNB scam, and is yet to join investigations despite repeated summons. It has claimed that there is string, oral and documentary, evidence against the businessman in $950 million scam.The government, while seeking his deportation to New Delhi, has also informed the Dominica high court last week that Choksi is still an Indian citizen and needs to face the law here.Choksi went missing from Antigua and Barbuda, where he is a citizen, on May 23. He was found in Dominica the next day and has since been charged with illegal entry into the Caribbean country. His lawyers, Vijay Aggarwal, Wayne Marsh, and his wife, Priti Choksi, have alleged he was abducted and taken to Dominica.Reacting to the CBI’s latest charge sheet, Vijay Aggarwal said on Wednesday, “This supplementary charge sheet after three years shows that it is only an attempt to cover up anomalies that the defence has pointed out in first charge sheet. Moreover, addition of section 201 of IPC (destruction of evidence) is not legally tenable as a document becomes evidence only after filing of the court, and the allegations are of a period much prior to even First Information Report (FIR).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksi-destroyed-evidence-says-cbi-in-fresh-charge-sheet-filed-last-week-101623844630712.html

Camping in New Delhi, Paswan in his first interaction with the media after the rumblings in his party began on Sunday, also targeted his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras for his non-co-operation. “During the Bihar assembly polls, and even before that and after the poll results were announced, some people particularly those belonging to JD(U) had been continuously trying to break the party. We contested the assembly polls with full support of the party,” he said and alleged, “My uncle (Paras) did not play any role in the election campaign. Some of my party MPs kept themselves busy.” Without pointedly naming Nitish Kumar, Paswan alleged that the JD(U) first caused a division between Dalits and Maha Dalits in Bihar and had now targeted the LJP. “They want to divide and rule,” he said. The LJP leader said people including party leaders connived against him when he was ill. “I tried to talk to my uncle but was unsuccessful. I tried to keep my family and party together,” he added. Refusing to budge from his post, Paswan said that he had been elected as party president as per the constitution of the party. “The leader of the house is decided by the parliamentary committee and not by the MPs. I have been informed that they have removed me from the post of president. A party president is only removed in case of death or if he resigns,” argued Paswan. He also made it clear that he was not going to buckle under pressure. “It’s going to be a long-drawn legal battle and the people of Bihar are with me,” he said. Earlier, in the day, Paswan wrote a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla questioning his decision to appoint Paras as the leader of the LJP Parliamentary Party. “Since Article 26 of the Constitution of the LJP empowers the central Parliamentary Board of the party to decide who would be the leader of the party in the Lok Sabha, hence the decision announcing Pashupati Kumar Paras, MP, as leader of LJP in the Lok Sabha is contrary to that provision of the constitution of LJP,” Paswan wrote in his letter to the Speaker. He requested the Speaker to review the decision and issue a new circular in his favour.The newly-elected president of the party, Pashupati Kumar Paras got a tumultuous welcome by party leaders. “Decision on party president will be taken on Thursday,” he said on arrival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/they-want-to-divide-and-rule-chirag-paswan-blames-jd-u-for-split-in-party-101623842950737.html
16-06-2021||India||Ram Mandir: Sanjay Singh releases new papers, says old agreement was cancelled||Challenging BJP spokespersons' claims regarding what the Opposition is terming as Ram Temple 'land scam', Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh on Wednesday presented new documents regarding the land deal in which land worth ₹2 crore was purchased by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust at over ₹18 crore within 'minutes'. Taking part in television debates over the issue, BJP spokespersons claimed that the land agreement was done over a decade, as also 'confirmed' by Sultan Ansari and Ravi Mohan Tiwari. Hence, the allegations of price change in minutes are baseless.Sanjay Singh on Wednesday said the previous agreement was cancelled before the new agreement was made in March 2021 and hence the defence that the price has increased over a period of time does not hold water. A day after his Delhi residence allegedly came under attack for his Ram Temple allegations, the MP said, "No matter how many times you attack me, I will continue to raise my voice against the corruption committed in the name of Lord Ram..if there is anything that is posing as a roadblock to the construction work, it is the embezzlement of the fund. AAP too wants Ram Temple construction work to be completed soon."What is the Ram Temple land controversy?Ram Temple Trust head Champat Rai bought this land in question from Ravi Mohan Tiwari and Sultan Ansari at ₹18.50 crore. Minutes before, Tiwari and Ansari bought the land from Kusum Pathak and Harish Pathak at ₹2 crore. Both the transactions took place in front of the same witnesses and minutes apart. Out of this ₹18.5 crore, ₹17 crore was paid through RTGS. The land measuring 1.208 hectares is located in Bag Bjaisi village under Sadar tehsil of Ayodhya district.What did Ram Temple Trust say?The Trust said that the land was purchased at the rate of ₹1,423 per Square Feet, which is much less than the actual market rate in Ayodhya. "For the same land, agreements were made between different parties many times starting since 2011 but due to some reasons they never matured," the Trust said. It also said that nine individuals, including three Muslims, were involved in the agreement.What are Sanjay Singh's new allegations?Revealing the names of the nine people, Sanjay Singh claimed that Ravi Mohan Tiwari was not among them. His name has been included in the agreement made in March 2021, after cancelling the earlier agreement. Since the earlier agreement was cancelled, the AAP MP said, the original owner of the land Harish Pathak and Kusum Pathak could sell the land directly to the Trust, without Ravi Mohan Tiwari and Sultan Ansari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-wants-ram-temple-to-be-completed-soon-sanjay-singh-presents-new-documents-101623841640396.html

16-06-2021||India||Kolkata Police question Mithun Chakraborty over election speech||The Kolkata Police on Wednesday questioned actor Mithun Chakraborty, who campaigned for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after joining it ahead of the March-April West Bengal polls, for about 45 minutes via video conferencing for allegedly “preaching violence” in his speeches.Mrinal Kanti Mukherjee, a local police officer, confirmed the questioning but refused to elaborate.There was no immediate comment from Chakraborty or the BJP.Mrityunjay Pal, a Kolkata resident, lodged a complaint against Chakraborty on May 6, saying the actor used a monologue from one of his popular Bengali movies in which his character describes himself as a cobra whose bite can kill anyone. Last week, Chakraborty moved the Calcutta high court seeking quashing of the case. But the court allowed the police to question him virtually.Also Read | Former TMC leader sends legal notice to Suvendu Adhikari over tweetsChakraborty joined the BJP at a rally in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He used the monologue in his speech on that day and repeated it again later.Chakraborty campaigned extensively and led as many as three road shows on some days. The BJP even allotted him a chopper for campaigning.The Bengal elections were among the most keenly contested recently with Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah leading the BJP from the front. Trinamool Congress (TMC) swept back to power by winning 213 seats while the BJP bagged only 77. Tensions between the two parties have continued with the BJP accusing TMC workers of their involvement in post-poll violence. The Central Bureau of Investigation arrested four politicians including two ministers last month on corruption charges. The four were later released on bail even as the TMC linked the arrests to BJP’s vendetta politics for losing the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-police-question-mithun-chakraborty-over-election-speech-101623841091068.html
16-06-2021||India||TN underreported Covid deaths in 6 TN hospitals: NGO||Deaths that are due to Covid and its complications is likely to be 8.4 times to 9.8 times more than the number of Covid-19 deaths declared by the state government in six hospitals, according to a report from Chennai-based Arappor Iyakkam -- a movement started for transparent and accountable governance.In its report, released on Tuesday, Arappor Iyakkam analysed death data from six government hospitals in Tamil Nadu and found that the number of deaths has drastically increased in April and May, compared to the same months in the past three years, suggesting a gross underreporting of Covid-19 deaths.“Deaths due to Covid are likely to be underreported at least 8.4 to 9.8 times in these six hospitals,” says the report.“There is no other major disease or cause that has led to this drastic increase in deaths during this time other than Covid-19,” says Jayaram Venkatesan, founder of Arappor Iyakkam.Tamil Nadu has reported 12,943 deaths in April and May this year (as of 13 June, some deaths from previous months are reported belatedly in health bulletins, which are accommodated in the report). “Approximating the same underreporting factor of 8.4 to 9.8 times for the entire state, the likely number of deaths due to Covid in Tamil Nadu may be between 108,721 and 126,841 against the reported number of 12,943,” the report said.The group chose six hospitals for their analysis, Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai, Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College and Hospital, Trichy, Government Vellore Medical College, Government Medical College and Hospital, Karur, Government Hospital Headquarters Tiruppur. The report said that only these six hospitals had uploaded month-wise death certificates online, and they represented all regions of Tamil Nadu. The report uses daily data for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 from January up to May.Death data from the six hospitals revealed that the total number of death certificates issued in April and May combined are 4,437 and 3,261 for 2019 and 2020, respectively. This has increased to 11, 699 this year.The report found that there has been an increase of at least 8,438 deaths in April and May together compared to the same months in 2020. However, the total number of deaths of patients declared as Covid-19 victims during the same period by the daily medical bulletin of Tamil Nadu’s health department is only 863 in these six hospitals.The second wave started in April this year and began peaking in May in Tamil Nadu. After the hotspot of Chennai saw a peak up until the third week of May, the virus hit the district and hinterlands, and cases began rising in the southern and western districts of the state. That was also the time when the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) won the assembly elections on May 2 and formed the government on May 7. The state went into a lockdown on May 10 and has begun opening up staggeringly from Tuesday. “The increased mortality is directly proportional to the rise of the second wave of Covid. Therefore, the increased numbers in April and May compared to previous years are most likely due to Covid and its complications,” the report said.The analysis concluded that the number of deaths is likely due to Covid-19 and its complications in these six hospitals is likely between 7,262 and 8,438 in April and May this year. “Given that the government has consistently underreported in each of these hospitals, it could be attributed that this phenomenon exists throughout the state as well,” the report said.The hospitals have denied that it is a case of underreporting. “We are 100% following only ICMR guidelines,” said Dr A Rathinavel, dean, Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai. The hospital has issued 3,152 death certificates in April-May this year, out of which only 172 were declared as Covid-19 deaths. “The swab test has to be positive to be certified as a Covid-19 death.” The state health minister M Subramanian had last week reiterated this as the ICMR guideline that even if a patient is positive at the time of admission and turns negative before their death, it will not be considered a Covid-19 death. Forms 4 and 4a of the ICMR guidelines are for the treating doctors to record the underlying cause, contributing factors and immediate cause. WHO provides codes such as U07.1 for Covid deaths and U07.2 for probable Covid deaths.In Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, 3,464 death certificates were issued in April-May this year, out of which only 323 were declared as Covid-19 deaths. “We certify a cause of death after analysing every individual patient and not by just following guidelines,” says the dean of the hospital, Dr A Nirmala. “Every day, our panel of doctors meet to analyse the death. Deaths can be due to incidental Covid, which we brand as death due to other causes. For instance, some deaths are directly due to other causes such as uncontrolled hypertension, kidney disease. While treating that cause, we have to take a swab. If it turns positive, but the patient doesn’t have Covid-19 related symptoms, it will be considered a death due to other causes. Just because the person is infected, it doesn’t mean they are dying due to Covid-19 alone.”The report has been sent to chief minister M K Stalin and health minister Subramanian. The report asks the government to come out with death numbers at hospitals and homes compared to the previous years for the entire state. The exercise was carried out to help eligible families avail compensation announced by the government in case of Covid-19 death. The report highlighted Covid-19 patients whose cause of death was declared as other reasons such as viral pneumonia, who cannot avail compensation. “Underreporting can cause a huge problem for thousands of families who require documentation to avail compensation,” the report said. Last week, a PIL was filed with the Madras high court regarding accurate reporting of Covid-19 deaths for receiving compensation. It sought a report on the issue from the state and the union government on the case.“We don’t have any necessity to hide Covid-19 deaths,” Subramanian said. “What are we going to achieve by underreporting? My opinion is that only if we show the true number of Covid-19 deaths, will people have a combined feeling of fear as well as awareness. We have been following ICMR set guidelines for certifying Covid-19 deaths. However, we don’t want to dismiss the report, so we are directing an investigation in these hospitals. We only want to be transparent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-underreported-covid-deaths-in-6-tn-hospitals-ngo-101623840130782.html
16-06-2021||India||Now, English medium must in Andhra colleges||Hyderabad The Andhra Pradesh government on Tuesday made English the medium of instruction in all undergraduate colleges in the state, doing away with Telugu as the medium , with effect from the ongoing academic year 2021-22, in a move that it said was aimed at improving the prospects of students. Andhra Pradesh is the first major state or Union Territory in the country to do this. An official release from the department of higher education said the decision to do this in all government, private and government-aided degree colleges was taken at a recent meeting held by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. A notification issued by the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education (APSCHE) on Tuesday said all private unaided and aided degrees colleges offering Telugu medium courses should submit proposals for conversion into English medium between June 18 and 28. However, the colleges can continue to have Telugu as a language course in the curriculum, the notification said. The Jagan government planned to make English the medium of instruction in all government schools , from the primary level, in 2020-21 itself, but the decision was struck down by the Andhra Pradesh high court in April last year. The issue is now pending before the Supreme Court. It is likely that the order on colleges will also be challenged. According to the department’s official release, the government strongly feels that making English the medium of instruction at the undergraduate level will enhance the career prospects of graduates. Out of over 262,000 students who started college education in the state in 2020-21, only 65,981 enrolled in Telugu medium colleges. Of these, 24,007 students opted for BA, 16,925 BCom and 24,960 BSc , according to the state government. The government said a majority of BSc students will be looking for job opportunities in various parts of the country and abroad. Similarly, a large number of BA and B Com graduates prefer getting into sales and marketing, apart from journalism and research. “It is essential that these students pursue their undergraduate courses in English. The transition from Telugu medium to English Medium will be easier at the graduate level,” the official release said, adding that it will also introduce spoken English courses at various levels in the undergraduate courses.  Professor S Prasanna Sree, chairperson of board of studies at Andhra University, Visakhapatnam, said it was a bold decision to make English the medium of instruction at the graduate level. “It is essential to have higher education in English because it makes the students globally competitive. At the same time, the government should not ignore the native language of the students and (must) promote it as one of the subjects,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-english-medium-must-in-andhra-colleges-101623840129855.html

On Wednesday, 44 persons succumbed to the infection, taking the total Covid fatalities to 3,432.Officials in the health department said the government is planning to vaccinate all the eligible beneficiaries. So far, over 8.9 million people have been given at least one dose while more than 1.2 millions are fully vaccinated. “The state government plans to raise the daily vaccination target to 300,000 so that those eligible can be vaccinated before the onset of a possible third wave. Everything, however, depends upon vaccine availability,” said nodal officer for Covid vaccination, Dr Bijay Panigrahi.To be sure, while overall vaccine supplies may be there at the state level, individual vaccination centres may run out of stock on account of how the states manage their replenishments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-relax-lockdown-partially-from-june-17-101623840071613.html

In India, the vaccine is named as Covishield and is produced by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII).Rahul Gandhi, who has been the most vocal critic of the Centre’s response to the pandemic, has time and again criticised it over its vaccination policy. On May 28, he said vaccination is the only permanent solution to combat Covid-19 and only a minuscule percentage of the country’s population was inoculated. He also pointed out that if vaccination continues at the present pace, the entire population will be only inoculated by 2024.Also Read| Covishield: Govt says extending gap to 12-16 weeks was a unanimous decisionCiting a report from news agency Reuters on his Twitter handle, Gandhi said on Wednesday the country needs quick and complete vaccination against the viral disease and not the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) usual brand of lies and rhyming slogans to cover up the vaccine shortage caused by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led central government. “GOI’s constant attempts to save the PM's fake image are facilitating the virus & costing people’s lives,” Gandhi added.India needs quick & complete vaccination- not BJP’s usual brand of lies & rhyming slogans to cover-up vaccine shortage caused by Modi Govt’s inaction. GOI’s constant attempts to save PM’s fake image are facilitating the virus & costing people’s lives. pic.twitter.com/UUeRpDabSDThe Reuters report which Gandhi referred to, stated the Centre increased the gap between two doses of Covishield from 12 to 16 weeks on May 13 without the agreement of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTGAI). The Centre said that the NTGAI recommended the move. But three of the 14 core members of the advisory group dismissed this claim and said the NTAGI did not have enough information to make such a recommendation.Echoing the claims of the three NTAGI members , M.D. Gupte, a former director of the state-run National Institute of Epidemiology, told Reuters on Tuesday that the NTAGI supported increasing the interval between two doses of Covishield to 8 to 12 weeks- the gap which is also advised by the World Health Organization (WHO). Gupte added the advisory group had no data with regard to extending the time interval beyond 12 weeks.Also Read| Didn't back increased interval between Covid-19 vaccine doses: NTAGI scientistsHowever, Dr NK Arora, the chairman of NTAGI, said on Wednesday the decision to increase the gap between two doses of Covishield to 12-16 weeks is based on fundamental scientific reasons adding there was no dissent when this decision was taken.“We have a very open and transparent system where decisions are taken on a scientific basis. The Covid Working Group took that decision, with no dissenting voice. This issue was then discussed threadbare at an NTAGI meeting, again with no dissenting notes. The recommendation was that the vaccine interval has to be 12 - 16 weeks,” Dr Arora told ANI.More than 260 million beneficiaries have been vaccinated against the Covid-19 disease in India till now, data from the Union health ministry showed. Of these, 2,800,458 were inoculated in the last 24 hours.

16-06-2021||India||BSY hints at further easing of Covid curbs||Bengaluru: Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa on Tuesday indicated the possibility of announcing more relaxations in lockdown restrictions in the coming days as the state continued to register a dip in Covid-19 cases. “After analysing the situation today and tomorrow, we will look into - what is to be done, with the situation improving, and what all to be relaxed further- and we will do it,” Yediyurappa said in Bengaluru. On Tuesday, the state reported 5,041 cases, taking the overall tally to 2,777,010. With 115 deaths, the toll rose to 33,148. For the first time in over two months, Bengaluru’s daily infection count dropped below 1,000 as it recorded 985 new Covid-19 cases.“Covid cases fell below 1,000 in Bengaluru for the first time in two months. Cases in Karnataka fell to 5,041. The positivity rate in the state fell to 3.8%. Daily deaths fell to 115. Total tests today at 1.32 lakh,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education, said on Tuesday.According to officials, the government is deliberating on which sectors should be relaxed in the coming days so as to ensure a phase-by-phase reopening of the state.Gaurav Gupta, chief commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body), said it is necessary to lift the curbs in a phase-wise manner. “If everything is opened all together, then it is possible that things can go out of control. That’s why we have to keep the practical situations in mind and open in a phase-by-phase manner,” he said.Small hotels, including darshinis or self service restaurants, which continue to remain shut, depend largely on dine-in customers and their business has been largely hit due to the takeaway rules, people aware of the developments said.The chief minister’s decision for additional relaxations in lockdown curbs comes a day after the state government eased restrictions in 19 districts, including Bengaluru, amid a steady decline in new Covid-19 infections in these regions.As per latest guidelines, industries and private enterprises are allowed to reopen with 50% capacity among other provisions. The government also extended the duration of shops selling essential goods, permission for autos and taxis to ply with maximum two passengers, among others.Last week, Yediyurappa had said that the restrictions would, however, continue in 11 districts of the state with a high positivity rate till June 21. The eleven districts where strict lockdown measures have continued are Chikmagalur, Shivamogga, Davangere, Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, Hassan, Dakshina Kannada, Bengaluru Rural, Mandya, Belagavi and Kodagu.The Karnataka government had initially announced 14 days ‘close-down’ from April 27, but subsequently imposed a complete lockdown from May 10 to May 24, as cases continued to spike. Citing lockdown yielding results and experts’ advice, it was further extended till June 7 and then again till June 14.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsy-hints-at-further-easing-of-covid-curbs-101623839889833.html

For the last few days, these calls were being made to leaders asking them to make statements against the Punjab CM, to criticise his leadership. The caller also assured the leaders that he would take up the case with the Congress High Command if they act accordingly. All these calls were made in the name of Prashant Kishor, the principal advisor to the chief minister.A criminal case under sections 416, 419, 420, 109, 120-B of the IPC and section 66-D of the IT Act 2000 has been registered at PS Division no. 6, Commissionerate of Police, Ludhiana against the unknown callers, news agency ANI reported.Punjab troubleThe development comes amid troubles mounting up in the Congress leadership in Punjab owing to the disagreement between Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu. A three-member Congress panel was set up to end the factionalism in the Punjab Congress, which submitted its report to Sonia Gandhi. The panel, led by senior Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge, Harish Rawat, JP Aggarwal, reportedly pitched for the accommodation of Sidu in the leadership.Controversy over Prashant Kishor in PunjabIn 2017, Prashant Kishor had handled the Congress poll campaign. In March 2021, Kishor was appointed as the principal advisor to Amarinder Singh, ahead of Punjab Assembly Election 2022. There were speculations that Prashant Kishor will play a decisive role in ticket distribution, which the chief ministers dismissed and clarified that Prashant's role is advisory, not executive.Election strategist Prashant Kishor who had strategised for PM Modi in 2014 recently said he wanted to quit this business. The decision was announced soon after Trinamool and DMK's victory in the state assembly elections.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defame-amarinder-singh-prashant-kishor-s-impersonators-incite-punjab-leaders-case-registered-101623834702413.html

There was also no immediate response from Twitter.An official separately told HT that Twitter will be considered an intermediary once it follows the new Information Technology (IT) rules. The official said Twitter will no longer be protected from penal action under Section 79 of the IT Act, which absolves social media firms of liability for third-party content, if it did not do so.Also Read | Govt says Twitter not entitled to safe harbour, experts argue otherwiseThe Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules were notified in February. They require significant social media intermediaries, which have five million users or above, to appoint a chief compliance officer, nodal officer and grievance redressal officer. Until Wednesday, Twitter was the only major social media firm that had not shared the details of the compliance. WhatsApp, Facebook and Google shared the details in May.Twitter on Tuesday said it has appointed the interim chief compliance officer and the details of the appointment will be shared directly with the ministry. The decision came after the government gave Twitter one last chance to comply with the new rules as the microblogging platform did not make immediate appointments of key personnel, mandated under the new guidelines.Twitter assured the government last week that it is in the advanced stages of finalising the appointment of the chief compliance officer and would submit additional details within a week.Twitter this month conveyed to the government that it was “committed to complying with the new rules”, even as it raised concerns regarding the safety of its employees in the country and intimidation by the police. It sought a week to comply with the new guidelines after the government issued it an ultimatum saying Twitter would have to face “unintended consequences” including losing its legal protection from criminal liability for user content.The guidelines also require companies such as Twitter, WhatsApp, and Facebook to change how they regulate content and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.Twitter and the government have had disagreements over content takedown orders and the company’s actions against prominent people linked to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party for violation of its terms of use.Against this backdrop, the new IT rules hardened the stand-off last month, with Twitter earlier asking for three months to comply, raising concerns over the “core elements” of the norms, and flagging potential threats to the safety of its employees after a visit by the Delhi Police.The new rules have been contested by several parties, including WhatsApp which has argued that the traceability provision mandated in the guidelines would violate end-to-end encryption.Raman Chima, Asia Pacific policy director, Access Now, a digital civil rights organisation, said the government does not have the sole authority to device how intermediaries are able to make use of the legal protection granted to them by Parliament. “Whether the government’s rules are constitutional and whether partial or incomplete compliance impacts this legal immunity provided in law will ultimately be decided by judges, and not just by the executive branch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-stand-off-with-govt-twitter-shares-details-of-interim-compliance-officer-101623834855522.html

Politicians, ministers from state government, and elected representatives participated in the march led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati from Shahu Samathi Sthal, the resting place of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj in Kolhapur. Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati said similar protests will be held in Nashik, Aurangabad, Amravati, Raigad in the next few days and a march from Pune to Mumbai in August if the demands are not met by then. Calling it an apolitical platform, Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati also appealed to the protesters to remain silent while public representatives addressed them. He demanded immediate steps by the state government to restore the reservation and extend its benefits to the community. The state government, in turn, has invited the MP for a round of talks with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and senior Cabinet ministers on Thursday.

He has also demanded that elected representatives from all parties push the quota demand in the coming monsoon session of the state assembly.Minister Satej Patil said that the state government was positive about the demands and has already started taking steps towards their resolution. “The state government is ready to hold talks with the community leaders. I invite Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati for a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and other senior ministers on Thursday. We are very positive over the steps that need to taken by the state government,” he said.On May 5, the Supreme Court quashed 12% and 13% quota to Marathas in education and jobs respectively under Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act 2018. The state government is planning to file a review petition in the apex court as recommended by a committee of retired high court judge Dilip Bhosale constituted to study the ruling and recommend a way forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maratha-outfits-begin-silent-protest-for-quota-govt-invites-leaders-for-talks-101623833651191.html

He also ordered the deputy commissioners (DCs) to carry out vulnerability mapping at the block level as more people are testing positive for the viral disease in smaller towns and rural areas of the state.The directions were issued at a review meeting chaired by Sarma late on Tuesday.Nearly five million beneficiaries have been vaccinated in Assam till now of which 3,983,642 have received the first doses and 967,589 have received both doses, according to government data. On Tuesday, only 62,052 beneficiaries were inoculated against 78,923 on Monday.“The DCs must thereafter earmark priority-vaccine areas, which will stem the spread of the infection to villages and tea gardens,” Sarma said and urged officials to come up with district-specific strategies to achieve 100 per cent vaccination.Three days back, the state government had asked all its employees who have been fully vaccinated to join work from June 14. Employees will have to follow all Covid-appropriate behaviour in the office premises.“In order to ensure smooth functioning of government offices, all the employees of Government of Assam who have received both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine are hereby directed to attend office from 14/06/2021 regularly,” general administration department commissioner and secretary MS Manivannan said in the order.Assam on Tuesday recorded 3,415 new cases and 34 more deaths, taking the caseload and death toll to 466,590 and 4,028 respectively.

Govt clarifies as RTI doc goes viral||Does Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research, contain serum of the newborn calf? As an RTI document shared by Congress's Gaurav Pandhi has gone viral, the government dismissed such "twisted and misrepresented" facts. Calf serum is involved in the process of developing the vaccine but the finished product does not contain calf serum, the government claimed, adding that this is the standard process of preparing Vero cells and a similar procedure is used across the world. This is also the process used for decades in Polio, Rabies and Influenza vaccines."Newborn calf serum is used only for preparation/ growth of Vero cells. Different kinds of bovine and other animal serum are standard enrichment ingredient used globally for Vero cell growth. Vero cells are used to establish cell lives which help in the production of vaccines. This technique has been used for decades in Polio, Rabies, and Influenza vaccines," the government said.Explained: Why there are demands to cut the gap between two Covishield dosesAfter the growth, these Vero cells are washed with water and buffer. And the washing process gets repeated multiple times which effectively remove calf serum from the vero cells. Then these cells are infected with Coronavirus for the development of the vaccine.During the time of the growth of the virus, the Vero cells are completely destroyed and then the virus is killed and purified. From that inactivated virus, the vaccine is developed. "Hence, the final vaccine does not contain newborn calf serum at all and the calf serum is not an ingredient of the final vaccine product," the government clarified.What was the necessity of the clarification?Congress's Gaurav Pandhi on Tuesday shared an RTI document which answers a question — Does the process of making Covaxin involve FBS (fetal bovine serum). The reply said, "As per information provided by the firm, newborn calf serum is used in revival process of Vero cells which is used for the production of the Coronavirus during the manufacturing of Covaxin bulk vaccine.In an RTI response, the Modi Govt has admitted that COVAXIN consists Newborn Calf Serum .....which is a portion of clotted blood obtained from less than 20 days young cow-calves, after slaughtering them. THIS IS HEINOUS! This information should have been made public before. pic.twitter.com/sngVr0cE29Terming it heinous, Pandhi wrote, "In an RTI response, the Modi Govt has admitted that COVAXIN consists Newborn Calf Serum .....which is a portion of clotted blood obtained from less than 20 days young cow-calves, after slaughtering them. THIS IS HEINOUS! This information should have been made public before."Why Covaxin uses calf serum and not CovishieldCovaxin is developed from a live, inactivated Coronavirus. Oxford vaccine, Covishield, on the other hand, used a chimpanzee common cold viral vector, which delivers the code that allows our cells to make the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.What does Bharat Biotech say?Bharat Biotech too has issued a statement and clarified that this practice is neither new nor hidden. “Newborn calf serum is used in the manufacturing of viral vaccines. It is used for the growth of cells, but neither used in the growth of SARS CoV2 virus nor in the final formulation. Covaxin is highly purified to contain only the inactivated virus components by removing all other impurities.”Listing out the name of the publication, the company said, "The usage of new born calf serum was transparently documented in the following publications since the last 9 months."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/does-covaxin-production-involve-cattle-govt-clarifies-as-rti-docu-goes-viral-101623830699624.html

16-06-2021||India||Govt says Twitter not entitled to safe harbour, experts argue otherwise||Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday said Twitter has “deliberately” chosen not to comply with the new social media and intermediary guidelines even as officials said the company will lose its legal protection from penal action for third party content over the non-compliance.“There are numerous queries arising as to whether Twitter is entitled to safe harbour provision. However, the simple fact of the matter is that Twitter has failed to comply with the Intermediary Guidelines that came into effect from the 26th of May. Further, it was given multiple opportunities to comply with the same, however it has deliberately chosen the path of non-compliance,” Prasad wrote on Twitter.Prasad defended the guidelines and said they were brought to counter the menace of fake news. “The culture of India varies like its large geography. In certain scenarios, with the amplification of social media, even a small spark can cause a fire, especially with the menace of fake news. This was one of the objectives of bringing the Intermediary Guidelines,” he said.Prasad called it astounding that Twitter, “which portrays itself as the flag bearer of free speech”, has chosen the path of “deliberate defiance when it comes to the Intermediary Guidelines.” He hit out at the company for “arbitrarily” deciding which posts to mark as “manipulated media”.Also Read | Twitter loses legal protection, fails to comply with new IT rules: OfficialTwitter has flagged posts by several ruling Bharatiya Janata Party leaders that accused the Congress of defaming Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Prasad said what happened in Uttar Pradesh was “illustrative of Twitter’s arbitrariness” in fighting fake news. “While Twitter has been over enthusiastic about its fact checking mechanism, it’s failure to act in multiple cases like U.P. (Uttar Pradesh) is perplexing as well as points towards its inconsistency in fighting misinformation,” Prasad said. ”If any foreign entity believes that they can portray itself as the flag bearer of free speech in India to excuse itself from complying with the law of the land, such attempts are misplaced.”Prasad was apparently referring to the posting of an allegedly manipulated video of an elderly Muslim man’s assault in Uttar Pradesh. The Uttar Pradesh Police have registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Twitter, news portal wire.in, and seven others for allegedly inciting rioting and promoting enmity between religions by promoting the video. Twitter has been named in the FIR for allegedly failing to prevent the video from going viral and helped in its promotion and circulation.Prasad’s comments came hours after an official told HT that Twitter will be considered an intermediary once it follows the new Information Technology (IT) rules. The official said Twitter will no longer be protected from penal action under Section 79 of the IT Act, which absolves social media firms of liability for third-party content, if it did not do so.“Now, if there is a case in court, Twitter cannot seek safe harbour under the Information Technology Act. In any case, filed after May 26, Twitter cannot say it is an intermediary and claim exception,” the official said, requesting anonymityThe Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules were notified in February and came into force on May 25.The official said, as a gesture of goodwill, the government gave Twitter extra time to comply with the rules. But Twitter has failed to meet even its own deadline of a week to make the appointments as per the new rules, the official said. The official added that details of the compliance officer’s appointment were yet to be shared with the government.Raman Chima, Asia Pacific policy director, Access Now, a digital civil rights organisation, said the government does not have the sole authority to device how intermediaries are able to make use of the legal protection granted to them by Parliament. “Whether the government’s rules are constitutional and whether partial or incomplete compliance impacts this legal immunity provided in law will ultimately be decided by judges, and not just by the executive branch.”Digital advocacy rights group Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) said the “so-called intermediary status” is actually a technical qualification as per criteria under Section 2(1)(ua)(w) of the IT Act. “As per Section 79, intermediaries are immune from liability/penalty if they comply with legal takedown requests of user posts from courts & public authorities. As we explain, this is threatened by the IT Rules, 2021,” IFF tweeted. “Even if we presume that the IT Rules are legal and constitutional, where alleged non-compliance is for appointment of officers etc., when companies like Twitter are prosecuted, courts will decide if it is an intermediary and not the government.”IFF added that there is no power or process for the grant or revocation of an intermediary status. “There is no immediate penalty which flows from non-compliance beyond loss of immunity determined by Courts on evidence and legal submissions,” tweeted IFF.Also Read | Twitter loses intermediary status: What does it mean for Twitter and its users?Twitter on Tuesday said it has appointed an interim chief compliance officer and the details of the appointment will be shared directly with the IT ministry.

But they do not often get timely support from ASI due to ownership patterns. Some of the sites are under the control of the Waqf Board, which is in charge of Muslim endowments, or privately owned. While ASI officials say the body is bound by jurisdictions, heritage experts argue it should not shirk the responsibility of heritage protection on account of ownership patterns.Experts have called for a wider approach so that conservation does not suffer from the ASI washing its hands off monuments that need critical intervention.Fatehpuri Masjid is among the monuments that have fallen into disrepair over the years in the absence of conservation support.Mufti Mukarram Ahmed, the imam of Fatehpuri Masjid, said the 371-year-old mosque has not been repaired in over 50 years. “The minarets and the red stonework have never been assessed for repairs. Earlier this month, a lattice piece from the mosque fell off due to the impact of rain and wind. The corridors need urgent attention. One can even see the minarets bending,” said Ahmed, highlighting the condition of the mosque that dates back to the 1650s.Some years back, Ahmed wrote to the Union minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi highlighting the dire need for repairs but to no avail. Ahmed said repairs were last undertaken by the ASI on the directions of local Parliament member Kapil Sibal in 2012-13. “ASI undertook some work, but the process was mired with obstacles. The work was abandoned before completion,” said Ahmed.Seeking urgent intervention, he said that ASI, Waqf Board, Central Waqf Council, or the tourism ministry could intervene to stop the deterioration of the mosque. “One should not shirk the responsibility of conservation simply because the mosque is a place of worship. The mosque is historically crucial and a monument of national importance. Its significance should not be reduced because the Waqf is the custodian,” said Ahmed.Mehfooz Mohammad, section officer of Delhi Waqf Board, cited the established mechanism and added stakeholders of heritage mosques and places should approach them if there is a need for repairs. “We are the nodal agency and will either rope in experts or route requests to the ASI,” said Mohammad.The Waqf Board does not have the wherewithal, or the expertise needed for undertaking conservation efforts.“As a special case, Jama Masjid has been repaired by the ASI over the years. The Waqf Board is also responsible but has not paid much attention to the concern. The board does not always have funds to undertake such exercises,” said Bukhari.He added despite the immense potential for tourism, monuments did not always get the attention they deserved due to a cumbersome conservation process. “The greater the attention that we give to our heritage, the better potential it will have. The country will benefit if we are able to salvage our heritage. The government should pay attention to the concerns,” said Bukhari.Holistic conservation neededHistorian Swapna Liddle said it is crucial for bodies such as the ASI to undertake a more nuanced and wider conservation approach. Liddle added it did not make sense for the ASI to restrict itself to only places that were under its protection. “I do not see why the ASI is only interested in buildings it owns. If there is a building of national importance, it does not matter who owns it. If we continue to follow this approach, it gives out a message that any building owned by an institution or trust is not worth saving. This should not be the case. Even if it is a religious building in use, we need to protect and preserve it.”She said there was a policy lacuna that needed to be filled for timely conservation efforts. “A proper policy is needed for heritage that is privately or institutionally owned... Bodies like the ASI need to take responsibility in partnership with the owner,” said Liddle.DN Dimri, former ASI joint director-general, said that while the ASI was bound by restrictions, a committee could be constituted for addressing conservation needs at Jama Masjid and other monuments that were not centrally protected by ASI. He said that since conservation was an ongoing process, it needed to be prioritised. He advocated a comprehensive management plan that could be put in place for timely intervention. “It could help to have a committee comprising members of the Waqf Board, ministry of culture, ASI, and other domain experts who can work towards a holistic conservation approach for Jama Masjid and other such places. Work can be undertaken in a phased manner under the purview of this committee,” said Dimri.He said at times, one could not determine the damage that structures sustained without undertaking proper assessments. Such issues could be addressed by timely checks. “It is true that a holistic conservation management plan is required to chart the current status of monuments and areas facing threat. One needs to determine the nature of short-term and long-term threats that the structure might face so that adequate steps can be taken before deterioration,” said Dimri.Conservation is keyDimri called for a need to examine waqf properties from the conservation point of view and suggested that all monuments under the body be assessed to find out their condition. “All major monuments that are with the waqf board can at least be assessed as part of a preliminary survey so that a detailed management plan can be created for vulnerable monuments. This can help us to determine which place needs immediate support and which needs a long-term approach,” said Dimri.Liddle said the fear that ASI might take over buildings needed to be stemmed. “Since the ASI only protects places it owns, people end up believing that any intervention from the ASI would mean that it will manage and take over the premises. Institutions start seeing ASI’s role as interference when it is conservation.”An ASI official, who did not wish to be named, said that the agency did not have jurisdiction over heritage properties that were under the custodianship of the Waqf Board. “ASI does not take cognisance unless a request is placed through proper channels. When monuments or places that are not under our jurisdiction write to us, it takes time to get necessary approvals. A lot of paperwork is involved. Funds are also an important component. Our priority remains to take care of centrally-protected monuments,” said the ASI official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ownership-patterns-prevent-intervention-to-repair-monuments-101623826389832.html
16-06-2021||India||‘Twitter got several opportunities to comply with IT Rules’: Ravi Shankar Prasad||Union information and technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday justified Twitter losing legal protection in India, saying that the social media giant failed to comply with the new IT guidelines despite being given multiple opportunities.Also Read | Twitter loses legal protection, fails to comply with new IT rules: Official“There are numerous queries arising as to whether Twitter is entitled to safe harbour provision. However, the simple fact of the matter is that Twitter has failed to comply with the Intermediary Guidelines that came into effect from the 26th of May. Further, it was given multiple opportunities to comply with the same, however it has deliberately chosen the path of non-compliance,” Prasad posted on his account on Koo, which is touted by many as the Indian version of Twitter.Also Read | Twitter loses intermediary status: What does it mean for Twitter and its users?Further justifying the action, the minister said that in a country like India, with the amplification of social media, “even a small spark can cause fire”, adding that this was one of the many reasons why the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules were notified. “It is astounding that Twitter, which portrays itself as the flag bearer of free speech, chooses the path of deliberate defiance when it comes to the Intermediary Guidelines,” he added.Prasad also termed as “perplexing” what he said was Twitter’s failure to address the grievances of users by refusing to set up its processes as mandated by the law of the land. Alluding to an FIR filed against Twitter, among others, in Uttar Pradesh, he posted, “What happened in Uttar Pradesh was illustrative of Twitter’s arbitrariness in fighting fake news. While Twitter has been about its fact-checking mechanism, its failure to act in multiple cases like Uttar Pradesh is perplexing and indicates its inconsistency in fighting misinformation.”He also remarked that Indian firms doing business in the USA (where Twitter is headquartered) or in any other foreign country follow the local rules but the same cannot be said about Twitter in India.“The rule of law is the bedrock of Indian society. India’s commitment to the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech was yet again reaffirmed at the G7 summit. However, if any foreign entity believes they can portray themselves as the flag bearer of speech in India to excuse itself from complying with the law of the land, such attempts are misplaced,” Prasad further said.Also Read | India a natural G7 ally: PM at summitThe minister also posted the same statements on his Twitter account.This latest development comes despite Twitter naming a compliance officer, albeit on an interim basis, one of the several conditions it has to follow under the new guidelines. The rules were announced on February 25 and social media companies were given three months, or May 25, to ensure compliance. Twitter, which is now the only mainstream platform to lose legal immunity in India, was engaged in a faceoff with the Ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), which Prasad heads, over the rules.Also Read | Interim compliance officer named: TwitterThe loss of legal protection means that Twitter can now be prosecuted under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for content posted by a user on the platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-got-several-opportunities-to-comply-with-it-rules-ravi-shankar-prasad-101623825396449.html

16-06-2021||India||Twitter loses intermediary status: What does it mean for Twitter and its users?||Twitter became the first US-based social media platform to lose legal protection in India, following a series of events that amplified the disagreement between the government and the social media platform. Twitter, however, continues to maintain its cooperative stance and has said that it is making every effort to comply with the new guideline.What this means for TwitterTwitter will now be held responsible for tweets, data hosted by it. It will not be considered as a platform hosting something that somebody has tweeted, but it will be editorially responsible for the posts.According to an ANI report, Twitter has been named in an FIR filed by the Uttar Pradesh Police in connection with an incident in Ghaziabad. So, Twitter is not immune to criminal charges for what somebody posts on the platform. Its top executives may now be questioned for any content that the authorities feel unlawful, inflammatory etc.If there is any charge against Twitter, then it will be liable for any punishment under any law, including the Indian Penal Code.If Twitter decides to comply with the IT rules, it may again come under the legal cover of a third party.What does Section 79 of the Information Technology Act 2020 say?An intermediary will be exempted from liability for any third-party information, data or communication link made available or hosted by it. It will be exempted if the function of the intermediary is "limited to providing access to a communication system over which information made available by third parties is transmitted or temporarily stored or hosted".The exemption is provided if the intermediary does not initiate the transmission, select the receiver of the transmission and select or modify the information.Will Twitter users be affected? Will Twitter be banned?No, the withdrawal of the intermediary status does not mean either of the two. There will be no impact on Twitter users.Why Twitter lost the legal coverIT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Twitter has failed to comply with the intermediary guidelines which were introduced on March 25 and came into effect on May 26. Twitter was given multiple opportunities but it "deliberately" chose to not comply. On India's mico-blogging platform, the minister posted his statement and said Twitter chooses to flag content "only when it suits".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-loses-intermediary-status-what-does-it-mean-for-twitter-and-its-users-101623824196154.html

The questioning was held virtually after an FIR was registered in Maniktala against Chakraborty.The complaint claimed that Mithun Chakraborty incited post-poll violence through his election speeches.Also Read: Bengal witnessed worst post-poll violence since Independence, says governorThe Calcutta high court had on Friday directed Chakraborty to provide his e-mail address to the state so that he can make himself available for questioning through video conferencing.The national award-winning actor had moved court last week for quashing the case filed against him.At the hearing on Friday, Chakraborty told the court that he had just uttered popular dialogues from his films. The actor claimed that the utterances of such film dialogues were only recreational and that he is innocent and in no way connected with any offence as alleged by the complainant.The complaint against Chakraborty had portions from his speech where he used dialogues like "marbo ekhane lash porbe shoshane (Will hit you here and the body will land in the crematorium)" and "ek chobole chabi (one snake bite and you will turn into a photograph)" at a rally in Kolkata after he joined the BJP on March 7.Also Read: ‘Not defections but violence will weaken BJP unit in West Bengal’The complaint alleged that these dialogues were a cause for post-poll violence in the state.

16-06-2021||India||Bengal gears up for 3rd Covid wave; earmarks 10k hospital beds for kids, moms||The West Bengal government has started earmarking beds in various hospitals to treat children up to 12 years of age, in case the third wave of Covid-19 later this year. A senior official said that as children, with mild to moderate symptoms, may have their mothers accompanying them, around 10,000 general beds will be earmarked for women and pediatric cases. “Many scientists are of the opinion that children may be affected more in number during the next wave of Covid-19. State government has planned to protect the children by escalating inpatient Covid facilities for the younger group,” said a state government order issued on Monday. To be sure, India’s top experts have clarified that there is no evidence to assume that the third wave will hit children harder. “If we look at the data, and compare both the Covid-19 waves, children are usually protected as the numbers are fewer. Even if they get infection, the disease is usually mild...there is no indication that in the third Covid-19 wave, children will be more impacted,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).“There could also be another theory that says since kids aren’t exposed much yet, in the next wave there’s a possibility that proportionally they may get more affected by virtue of greater exposure,” he added.Meanwhile, Bengal is setting aside around 350 Sick Neonatal Care Unit (SNCU) beds for mild to critical cases among infants up to three months of age . Another 1,300 Pediatric ICU (PICU) beds are being arranged at adult Covid centres also. “In Kolkata, around 10 hospitals have been identified in which around 240 beds in PICU will be arranged. Another nine SNCU units in the city have been identified where 45 beds will be set aside,” said the official cited above. Doctors and nurses posted in such units will be trained to handle severe and critically ill paediatric patients. “Do’s and don’ts are being prepared for mothers and caregivers who will be staying with the children. Such training would be completed by July. Supply of equipment, installation and demonstration of gadgets would be done by August,” the official said. The daily count in the state during the second wave hit a peak on May 14 with 20,846 cases. Data shared by the state health department, however, shows that the number of cases is steadily dropping and was at 3,268 on June 15. The number of deaths reported has also dropped below 100 now. “Going by the experience of some other countries such as UK and Canada, we expect the third wave to hit sometimes around October-November,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-gears-up-for-3rd-covid-wave-earmarks-10k-hospital-beds-for-kids-moms-101623822971234.html

Premised upon the centrality of ASEAN, India supports the utilisation of ASEAN-led mechanisms as important platforms for the implementation of our shared vision for the Indo-Pacific," he added.Stating that the sea lanes of communication are critical for peace, stability, prosperity and development of the Indo-Pacific region, the Minister said developments in the South China Sea have attracted attention in the region and beyond."India supports freedom of navigation, overflight, and unimpeded commerce in these international waterways. India hopes that the Code of Conduct negotiations will lead to outcomes that are in keeping with international law, including the UNCLOS and do not prejudice the legitimate rights and interests of nations that are not a party to these discussions," he saidChina claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea and has overlapping territorial claims with Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan.Beijing's "nine-dash line" territorial claim covers 90 per cent of the 3.5-million-sq. km South China Sea, despite the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague ruling against the claim in 2016.Last week, ASEAN and China agreed to expedite the resumption of negotiations on the code, which were halted by the pandemic.China and Asean started negotiations in 2013 on a supposedly binding code of conduct to regulate maritime behaviour in the strategically important waterway that is claimed by China as well as ASEAN members such as Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.Speaking at the virtual meeting, Singh said India shares a deep connect with ASEAN and has continued its active engagement in many areas contributing to regional peace and stability, particularly through ASEAN led mechanisms, such as East Asia Summit, ASEAN Regional Forum and ADMM-Plus."The India-ASEAN strategic partnership has been strengthened by virtue of flourishing cultural and civilizational links and enhanced people-to-people cooperation. India continues to attach importance to ASEAN centrality and unity in ensuring peace and stability in the region," he said.Terming terrorism and radicalisation as the "gravest threats" to peace and security, the Minister said that India remains committed to combating financing terrorism as a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)."India shares global concerns about terrorism and believes that in an era when networking amongst terrorists is reaching alarming proportions, only through collective cooperation can the terror organisations and their networks be fully disrupted, the perpetrators identified and held accountable, and strong measures are undertaken against those who encourage, support and finance terrorism and provide sanctuary to terrorism," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-calls-for-free-and-open-indo-pacific-at-key-asean-meet-101623820514789.html
16-06-2021||India||Explained: Why there are demands to cut the gap between two Covishield doses||The gap between the two doses of Covishield has become a contentious issue in India as many experts have now cast doubt over India's latest decision to extend the gap between the two doses of Covishield to 12 to 16 weeks from six to eight weeks. According to a Reuters report, some scientists of the government panel did not back the decision to expand the gap, which the government on Wednesday refuted and asserted that it was a unanimous decision. But why does the gap matter so much? What is the controversy all about? And why are there demands to now narrow down the gap? Here is all you need to know.Why does the gap matter?The gap between the two shots matters because that's how the vaccine works. The first shot increases antibodies while the second shot is a booster one. If the second shot is delayed, the first shot gets more time to work. In April, Public Health England said the vaccine efficacy increases when the interval is 12 weeks. The United Kingdom also overcame the surge caused by the Alpha variant keeping the gap at 12 weeks.Why are there new demands to reverse the gap?Two-three days after India increased the gap between the two Covidhsield doses, new studies emerged claiming that the single dose of Covishield gives only 33 per cent protection, not 65 to 85%, which was estimated earlier. Several countries are now reducing the gap once again.From 4 weeks to 4-6 weeks to 12 to 12 to 16 weeks: govt clarifiesIn a detailed statement, the chairman of the National Technical Group on Immunisation, Dr NK Arora said all this decision to change the gap between the two doses have been based on studies available at hand.The first decision to keep a gap of four weeks between the two doses of Covishield was based on the bridging trial data. "Initial studies on Covishield were very heterogeneous. Some countries like the UK went for a dose interval of 12 weeks when they introduced the vaccine, in December 2020. While we were privy to this data, when we had to decide our interval, we went for four weeks interval based on our bridging trial data which showed good immune response. Later we came across additional scientific and laboratory data, based on which after six weeks or so, we felt we should increase the interval from four weeks to eight weeks, since studies showed that vaccine efficacy is about 57% when it is four weeks and about 60% when it is eight weeks.” Dr Arora said.Will India now reduce the gap between the doses of Covishield?The government has said whatever decision is taken, paramount importance will be given to the health and protection of the community. “Covid-19 and the vaccination are very dynamic. Tomorrow, if the vaccine platform tells us that a narrower interval is better for our people, even if the benefit is 5% - 10%, the Committee will take the decision on the basis of merit and its wisdom. On the other hand, if it turns out that the current decision is fine, we will continue with it," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-why-there-are-demands-to-cut-the-gap-between-two-covishield-doses-101623818989591.html

Check guidelines for tourists||Taj Mahal, which was closed for two months due to the raging second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, is set to reopen from today. It was first closed on March 17 last year during the first wave of the pandemic. It reopened on September 21, 2020 with several restrictions.However, the historic monument in Uttar Pradesh’s Agra was again closed on April 16 this year as the country witnessed its worst health crisis due to the second wave and was adding a record surge in daily cases and deaths.Here are the guidelines which are to be followed by people visiting Taj Mahal:1. Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh said on Tuesday that only 650 people will be allowed inside the monument at one point of time in order to ensure all Covid-protocols are followed. Teams will be deployed to monitor the crowd at all times, he added.2. Taj Mahal will be sanitised three times a day, superintending archaeologist, ASI, Agra Circle, Vasant Kumar Swarnakar told news agency PTI on Tuesday.3. Only online booking will be allowed and no ticket counter in the premises will be open, Swarnakar said. Meanwhile, Agra district magistrate Singh said people can only book five tickets via one phone number.4. It is mandatory for all visitors to wear masks. They will be thermal screened at the gates of the monument and would be sanitised before entering.5. Swarnakar added that visitors will have to follow social distancing and they are not allowed to touch any object inside the monument. He also advised visitors should also carry their own water bottles and hand sanitisers.On Monday, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) issued an order where it allowed all centrally protected monuments, museums and sites to re-open from June 16.

16-06-2021||India||Twitter loses legal protection, fails to comply with new IT rules: Official||Twitter will be considered an intermediary once it follows the new Information Technology (IT) rules and it will no longer be protected from penal action under Section 79 of the IT Act, which absolves social media firms of liability for third party content, if it did not do so, a government official said on Wednesday.“Now, if there is a case in court, Twitter cannot seek safe harbour under the Information Technology Act. In any case, filed after May 26, Twitter cannot say it is an intermediary and claim exception.”The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules were notified in February and came into force on May 25. The official said, as a gesture of goodwill, the government gave Twitter extra time to comply with the rules. But Twitter has failed to meet even its own deadline of a week to make the appointments as per the new rules, the official said. The official added that details of the compliance officer’s appointment were yet to be shared with the government.Twitter on Tuesday said it has appointed an interim chief compliance officer and the details of the appointment will be shared directly with the IT ministry. The decision came after the government gave Twitter one last chance to comply with the new rules as the microblogging platform did not make immediate appointments of key personnel, mandated under the new guidelines that came into effect on May 26.Also Read | Interim compliance officer named: TwitterTwitter assured the government last week that it is in the advanced stages of finalising the appointment of the chief compliance officer and would submit additional details within a week.A Twitter spokesperson on Tuesday said the company continues to make every effort to comply with the new guidelines and is keeping the IT ministry apprised of progress at every step of the process. Twitter this month conveyed to the government that it was “committed to complying with the new rules”, even as it raised concerns regarding the safety of its employees in the country and intimidation by the police. It sought a week to comply with the new guidelines after the government issued it an ultimatum saying Twitter would have to face “unintended consequences” that can involve it losing its legal protection from criminal liability for user content.The guidelines require companies such as Twitter, WhatsApp, and Facebook to change how they regulate content, appoint nodal officers for compliance and grievance redressal, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.Twitter and the government have had disagreements over content takedown orders and the company’s actions against prominent people linked to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party for violation of its terms of use.Against this backdrop, the new IT rules hardened the stand-off last month, with Twitter earlier asking for three months to comply, raising concerns over the “core elements” of the norms, and flagging potential threats to the safety of its employees after a visit by the Delhi Police.Google, WhatsApp and Facebook have shared the details of the officers with the government. The new rules have been contested by several parties, including WhatsApp which has argued that the traceability provision mandated in the guidelines would violate end to end encryption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-loses-legal-protection-fails-to-comply-with-new-it-rules-official-101623817509418.html

This implies that reported new cases will halve in 7 days, under the assumption that the growth rate remains constant. As of June 14, the estimated Reproduction number Rt for Punjab stood at 0.69, significantly below one. Newly reported Covid-19 cases are likely to decline to about 210 per day by June 28," she added, according to news agency PTI.Mahajan also said that while number of Covid-19 cases are low, there are indications that the growth rates of cases, while negative, have recently reversed direction from their downward paths in Fazilka, Jalandhar, and Shahid Bhagat Singh Nagar.Here are the latest guidelines:5.District authorities have been asked to determine opening timings of non-essential shops, including on Sunday, on the basis of the local situation, while ensuring that crowds are avoided. They shall also continue to ensure strict implementation of all the extant directives of MHA/state government on Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, including social/physical distancing, wearing of face masks etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-to-unlock-from-today-check-latest-guidelines-here-101623816114573.html
16-06-2021||India||Covishield: Govt says extending gap to 12-16 weeks was a unanimous decision||A day after three members of the Centre's expert group on vaccines, National Technical Advisory Group on Innumnisation (NTAGI), reportedly claimed that they did not support the decision of widening the gap between the two doses of Covishield vaccine to 12 to 18 weeks, the government on Wednesday clarified that there was no dissent regarding the decision. Chairman of the expert group NK Arora said the working group agreed unanimously to increase the gap between the doses from eight weeks to 12 weeks. “We have a very open and transparent system where decisions are taken on scientific basis. The Covid Working Group took that decision, with no dissenting voice. This issue was then discussed threadbare at an NTAGI meeting, again with no dissenting notes. The recommendation was that the vaccine interval has to be 12 - 16 weeks," Dr Arora said.Also Read: Didn't back increased interval between Covid-19 vaccine doses, says NTAGI scientistsWhat is the controversy?The controversy is regarding the gap between the first and the second dose of the Covishield vaccine. On May 13, India increased the gap between the doses to 12 to 16 weeks, following in the footsteps of the United Kingdom and several other countries. The decision was backed by real-life findings which initially showed that the cover offered by the first dose stays long.Now more recent studies have revealed that the protection is not as much as it was estimated earlier. Hence, countries are again coming back to 8-12 week gap between the two doses of Covishield.A Reuters report quoted a former director of the National Institute of Epidemiology, MD Gupte, who claimed that the government's expert panel did not agree to increase the gap to 12 to 16 weeks at one leap. It agreed to widen the gap to 8-12 weeks, as advised by the World Health Organization. "Eight to 12 weeks is something we all accepted, 12 to 16 weeks is something the government has come out with...This may be alright, may not be. We have no information on that," he told Reuters.Reports of disagreement among experts regarding various aspect of the Covid-19 pandemic and its handling is not new. Shahid Jameel, a top Indian virologist, who was heading Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium reportedly quit the group over a disagreement, though he did not give any reason for his decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-govt-says-extending-gap-to-12-16-weeks-was-a-unanimous-decision-101623816878425.html

16-06-2021||India||Assam relaxes curfew in districts with declining Covid-19 cases||Assam government on Tuesday announced a fresh set of guidelines including shortening of curfew hours in districts where Covid-19 cases have declined considerably and warned districts with rising number of cases with harsher curbs if situation didn’t improve in a week. It also announced continuation of the existing ban on inter-district movement of persons and vehicles. The new guidelines will come into force from 5 am on July 16 and continue till 5 am of June 22.Health minister Keshab Mahanta, said urban areas with a positivity rate of 5% and above and rural areas with a positivity rate of 10% and above will be declared containment zones, only allowing for essential services. Earlier, district authorities were empowered to declare any urban or rural area with positivity rate of 10% or more as a containment zone.Kamrup (Metropolitan) district, which includes Guwahati, was rewarded with one extra hour of relaxation in curfew after it registered a sharp drop in the positivity rate.“In view of the drop in positivity rate, the curfew timings for Kamrup (Metropolitan) district have been changed from the existing 1 pm to 5 am daily to 2 pm to 5 am. Shops and business establishments, which were closing at 12 pm, will now have to down shutters at 1 pm,” Mahanta said.On Monday, the test positivity rate (TPR) in Kamrup (M) was 1.3% while the state recorded 2.52% TPR. This was in sharp contrast to May 8, when the district recorded 18.1% TPR compared to state-wide TPR of 8.84%.In South Salmara, Majuli, Bongaigaon, Chirang, Udalguri, West Karbi Anglong, Dima Hasao and Charideo districts, which recorded less than 400 new cases daily in the past few days, the new curfew timings would be from 5 pm to 5 am daily with relaxation for 12 hours.However the minister cautioned Cachar, Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Sonitpur and Nagaon districts since they have shown an increasing trend in the number of Covid cases in the past few days. “...Existing measures would be implemented strictly and vaccinations increased in these districts. If the figures don’t show a declining trend by June 21, stricter measures including total lockdown might be enforced,” Mahanta said.In other districts, the existing restrictions i.e., daily curfew from 1 pm to 5 am and closure of shops and businesses at 12 pm will continue for the time being.As per an earlier order, all government employees who have taken both doses of Covid-19 vaccine resumed office from Monday. But the order won’t be applicable to pregnant women, those with children below five years and specially-abled employees.All religious places will continue to remain closed and gatherings of not more than 10 people will be allowed to perform last rites. Hotels and restaurants will be able to serve outside guests during non-curfew hours and after that home delivery will be allowed.Weekly markets will continue to remain closed. Pharmacies, hospitals and other emergency services have been kept outside the purview of curfew restrictions. Tea gardens and other industries will continue to operate as per the existing guidelines.Assam recorded 3,678 new Covid cases on Monday and 43 deaths. The positivity rate for the state stood at 2.52%.

16-06-2021||India||Spectrum allocation to help eliminate train collisions due to human error: Rlys||The five megahertz allocation of 4G spectrum to the railways will help eliminate train collisions due to human error through the Automatic Train Protection (ATP) System, the railway ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. The Union Cabinet last week allotted the spectrum to enable the country’s largest mass transport system to switch from its current 2G data network for better communications and operational safety.A switch to 4G is expected to enable real-time and faster operation of communication systems of the carrier. It will boost bandwidth and other technical parameters such as peak capacity.“These systems prevent collisions due to any human error by Loco Pilot. In order to improve safety, a decision has now been taken to provide ATP systems on Indian Railways (IR) in a Mission Mode. So far IR was dependent on foreign technology for ATP systems. IR with Indian firms has now successfully developed indigenous cost-effective technology for ATP – called Train Collision Avoidance System (TCAS),” the statement said.The statement said TCAS is being adopted under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan (Self-Reliant India).The statement said TCAS has been approved for 37,300 km covering important routes in the first phase. “The roll-out of TCAS will eliminate train collision due to human error and enhance speed potential of IR thereby reducing travel time.”The railways plans to invest around ₹55,000 crore for this modernisation of signalling and telecommunication.It plans to use the spectrum allocation to provide long-term evolution (LTE) based mobile train radio communication for seamless communication between its running staff, the traffic controller, and maintenance personnel to enhance safety and security.Railway Board member (infrastructure) Sanjeev Mittal said the project, which would considerably boost the safety of trains as well as movement across the network, will be completed in the next five years with an estimated investment of ₹25,000 crore. “The purpose of the LTE for Indian Railways is to provide secure and reliable voice, video and data communication services for operational, safety and security applications of the railways.”The system will help in the deployment of a modern cab-based signalling system with automatic train protection. It is expected to increase safety and throughput in train operation and also help during foggy conditions.The statement said LTE will be used for mission-critical voice communication with seamless connectivity in train operations between the driver, guard, station master, train traffic controller and maintenance staff. “It will also be used in monitoring limited video surveillance (live feed) through CCTV cameras in trains to enhance passenger security.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spectrum-allocation-to-help-eliminate-train-collisions-due-to-human-error-rlys-101623814089147.html
16-06-2021||India||Monsoon progress continues to be slow||Monsoon hasn’t progressed in the past couple of days mainly due to approaching mid latitude westerlies which have weakened the monsoon winds over northwest India.Monsoon has so far advanced into the entire peninsular India; east central; east and northeast India and some parts of northwest India. It progressed very quickly over most parts of the country in the span of only ten days mainly due to active monsoon circulation and formation of a low-pressure area over Bay of Bengal.“Due to approaching of mid-latitude westerlies winds, further progress of monsoon over remaining parts of northwest India is likely to be slow. The progress of monsoon is being monitored continuously and further update will be provided on daily basis,” IMD said on Wednesday in it’s bulletin.Also Read | Rain lashes various parts of Mumbai, ThaneThe northern limit of monsoon (NLM) continues to pass through Diu, Surat, Nandurbar, Bhopal, Nowgong, Hamirpur, Barabanki, Bareilly, Saharanpur, Ambala and Amritsar.A low pressure area which had formed over Bay of Bengal is lying over east Uttar Pradesh and adjoining Bihar while the trough is running from northwest Rajasthan to northwest Bay of Bengal across Haryana and southwest Uttar Pradesh.Under the influence of these systems, widespread rain with isolated thunderstorms and lightning is likely over most parts of east, central and northeast India during the next 4-5 days. Isolated thunderstorms and lightning is likely over most parts of northwest India during the next two days and decrease in rainfall activity thereafter, except over east Uttar Pradesh where fairly widespread rain is likely to continue during the next 4-5 days.Under the influence of an offshore trough, running from north Maharashtra coast to north Kerala coast, widespread rain with isolated heavy to very heavy rain, thunderstorm and lightning is likely over south Konkan, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala and Mahe during the next three days.“We are expecting a 7-10 days’ delay from now. There is no monsoon activity over west UP now. There is a trough (area of low pressure) in the westerlies which is affecting the easterly wind flow. Monsoon winds are reaching only up to east UP. We don’t expect progress in the next 7-10 days to the rest of northwest India. There may be some thunderstorm activity but moisture is very low,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.Last week, following monsoon’s rapid progress to some parts of northwest India, IMD had announced that it is likely to hit Delhi between June 12 and 15. The normal date for monsoon arrival in Delhi is June 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-progress-continues-to-be-slow-101623811868906.html
16-06-2021||India||Set up ‘buffer zones’ to stop border conflicts: Retd PLA colonel||India and China should establish “buffer zones” in potentially the most dangerous areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to prevent the festering border dispute from triggering an armed conflict like it happened at Galwan Valley a year ago, a retired People’s Liberation Army (PLA) officer has suggested.Calling it the “boldest step”, Senior Colonel (Retd) Zhou Bo of PLA said the setting up of buffer zones or areas where armed forces will not patrol could be an effective way to disengage.“Perhaps the boldest step might be to establish buffer zones in the most dangerous areas along the LAC. Without prejudicing their respective positions on the boundary question, this is the most effective way to disengage and prevent conflict,” Bo wrote for the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) in an article titled “China and India should look back to move forward on border impasse”.“Both sides agree they shall not follow or tail patrols of the other side in areas where there is no common understanding of the LAC. Building buffer zones is a step further. And it is possible, too,” Bo noted.“From the mountains around Pangong Lake, a de facto buffer zone has already been established after the mutual withdrawal of troops,” he pointed out referring to the disengagement of forces and armoured units by both sides on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February.The article marked a year of the first deadly clash along the boundary in decades, in which India said it lost 20 soldiers and China claimed to have lost four troops in the Galwan Valley area in a brutal hand-to-hand combat. India, however, maintains that the Chinese death toll was much higher.It triggered the worst chill in bilateral ties in recent history and large deployment of troops and heavy weaponry by both armies at the friction points in eastern Ladakh.India has consistently said that the Chinese troops were the first to trespass across the disputed boundary, triggering the faceoff and deaths of border troops on both sides.“A year after the shock of a fatal border clash, tensions remain high with no consensus on how to resolve the issues over an unverified LAC,” Zhou wrote.The disengagement process remains incomplete with diplomatic and military talks not leading to a breakthrough at friction points such as Depsang Plains, Gogra and Hot Springs in the eastern Ladakh sector. India maintains that bilateral ties were “very significantly damaged” by Beijing’s violation of border agreements and earlier this month, it asked for “speedy completion” of the disengagement process for complete restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas and facilitate the progress in bilateral relations. Beijing, however, in a statement issued on Tuesday, asked India to stop being suspicious of China and urged New Delhi to “work with Beijing to strengthen ties instead of working towards building obstacles”..Following the tension, Beijing was given the cold shoulder when it offered to help pandemic-devastated India; such resentment speaks volumes of the frosty relationship, he pointed out.“To prevent conflict, both sides should dust off previously agreed confidence-building measures and enforce the less-contentious ones,” he suggested.He suggested establishing hotlines for real-time communication, pointing out that China has military hotlines with Russia, the United States, South Korea and Vietnam.“India often uses its hotline with Pakistan. There is no reason the two immediate neighbours with territorial disputes should not have similar instruments,” he said.The former PLA officer acknowledged the complexity of the Sino-India border dispute.“The complexity of the China-India border dispute is daunting. Even the length of the border is not necessarily agreed on. China believes it is 2,000-km-long, while India believes it is 3,488-km,” he pointed out.At the same time, both countries should realise the futility of war, Zhou, who is also a senior fellow of the Centre for International Security and Strategy at Beijing’s Tsinghua University, indicated.“It is ridiculous if, in the 21st century, Beijing and New Delhi are still hijacked by a dispute that is a colonial remnant, not least because apart from this dispute, they have no outstanding problems with each other,” Bo said.“Gone are the days when India said “Hindi Chini bhai bhai,” Bo noted. “But China and India have every reason not to become foes. The border issue should not be a perennial curse. The two nuclear neighbours can ill-afford even a conventional war,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/set-up-lac-buffer-zones-to-stop-border-conflict-retired-pla-colonel-101623811029161.html

The state police have been firmly directed to bring to book all anti-socials and the Government remains committed to maintain the basic fabric of society and to uphold law and order."Also Read | Anti-defection law under spotlight amid Bengal political tussleThis comes after West Bengal Governor in a letter urged Chief Minister Banerjee to break her silence on post poll retributive violence and restore law and order.In a tweet, while making the letter public, Dhankhar said he called upon Banerjee to have an interaction on the issues mentioned in the letter at the earliest."With a heavy heart, I am constrained to observe your continued silence and inaction over post-poll retributive bloodshed, violation of human rights. outrageous assault on the dignity of women, wanton destruction of property, the perpetuation of untold miseries on political opponents- worst since independence and it ill augurs for democracy," he said in the letter.Dhankhar in the letter claimed that "in spite of drawing her attention to the enormity of situation, huge exodus of people in search of cover for life and destruction of property worth crores, there has only been stunning silence at Banerjee's end and she did not deem it necessary to even deliberate this grave human tragedy in any of the cabinet meetings so far.""Your studied silence, coupled with an absence of any steps to engage in rehabilitation and compensation to alleviate the unimaginable suffering of people, force an inevitable conclusion that all this is state-driven. Your stance is plunging the vast suffering populace in a state of hopelessness and helplessness. Such 'punitive' decimation of human rights and dignity shames democracy," the Governor said.Cornering West Bengal Police, he stated that the administration and police of the state, in "such alarmingly grim situation" were expected to act in a stern manner and according to law, however, nothing of the kind happened."Their role suffers from partisan stance as also the abandonment of lawful obligations... I beseech you to reflect and ponder over the premise of ongoing violence, i.e. -- 'punishing' and 'disciplining' those who 'dared' to vote out of volition and for the opposition," he said.Dhankhar noted that during his May 13-15 visits to poll violence-affected areas, people in Coochbehar, Nandigram and Ranpagli Camp in Assam narrated "heart-rendering tales and woes of arson, loot, rapes and killings apart from wanton destruction of property"."Madam Chief Minister, you will agree that such a scenario sounds death knell for democracy. How can people be made to suffer for exercising right to vote in democracy?" he asked, adding that he expected that Banerjee will brief him on the post-poll violence and Cyclone Yaas disaster."It will be greatly appreciated that keeping in view our respective constitutional positions, an interaction fructifies on these issues at the earliest. Am sure you will accord priority to this," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-govt-questions-guv-dhankhar-s-letter-to-cm-mamata-on-post-poll-violence-101623809167727.html

16-06-2021||India||Left parties' fortnight-long stir against fuel price hike begins today||The fortnight-long agitation of the Left parties against rising prices of fuel, essential commodities and medicines will begin from Wednesday. The protest will end on June 30 during which the parties will ask the Centre to roll back increased price of petrol and diesel and control the rates of other essential items.The Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, All India Forward Bloc, Revolutionary Socialist Party and Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)-Liberation issued a joint statement in this regard on Sunday."More assaults on people's livelihood are being mounted by this relentless rise in prices of all essential commodities. Instead of helping people to combat the ravages of the Covid health catastrophe, the Narendra Modi government hiked the prices of petroleum products by at least 21 times after the announcement of the results of the recent assembly elections on May 2, 2021," the parties said in the statement.This is leading to a cascading inflationary spiral with the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) rising to an eleven-year high, they further said.The Left parties also demanded that the central government must immediately give direct cash transfers of ₹7,500 per month for six months to all families not falling in the income tax-paying bracket.The protests will be carried out in accordance with the Covid-19 norms put in place by the government, the parties said.The prices of petrol and diesel have soared across India in the past few weeks, with both the fuels retailing at record prices in some cities. Rates have been increased across the country and differ from state to state depending on the incidence of value-added tax.The rising fuel prices drove the WPI inflation to reach to a record high of 12.94 per cent in May. This is the fifth straight month of uptick seen in the WPI-based inflation. In April, 2021, it hit double digit at 10.49 per cent.Inflation in fuel and power basket spiked to 37.61 per cent during May, against 20.94 per cent in April. Prices of crude petroleum and other fuels had crashed last year in May due to lockdowns across the globe which had caused demand to plummet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/left-parties-fortnight-long-stir-against-fuel-price-hike-begins-today-101623802967986.html

16-06-2021||India||‘Will set party straight’, says Sasikala in clip||A day after the dual leadership in the AIADMK expelled 16 party members for speaking to their ousted former interim general secretary V K Sasikala, new audio clips emerged on Tuesday where she reveals that everyone back-stabbed her and that she would have picked O Panneerselvam as chief minister before she went to prison in 2017. She also offers an explanation for her decision to step away from politics before elections and her determination to reclaim the party now.Sasikala’s team released nine audio clips of her telephonic conversations with party functionaries from across Tamil Nadu. “I have a responsibility. I am confident that I’d be able to set the party straight. My wish is that the AIADMK should be strong even if it turns 100 years. We would definitely bring Amma (Jayalalithaa) rule. I will meet all of you soon,” she is heard saying in one of the audioclips.Palaniswami and Panneerselvam who head the party as coordinators, and in the assembly as leader of opposition and deputy, were Sasikala’s loyalists who turned against her at different points. “Everyone back-stabbed me. There is no more space left on my back to be stabbed anymore,” Sasikala said. “But how can I be a mute spectator if they do this to cadres also?”Her statement is unexpected as at that point, Panneerselvam staged a dramatic revolt against Sasikala after he resigned as chief minister to make way for her. Palaniswami was in Sasikala’s camp and hence she picked him before leaving for Bengaluru to serve her four-year jail term as a convict in the disproportionate assets case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-set-party-straight-says-sasikala-in-clip-101623802554515.html

Devas challenged this order before the NCLAT, which issued notices to Antrix and others on June 7 and fixed the matter for hearing next on July 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-rejects-devas-plea-to-restrain-liquidator-101623796118210.html
16-06-2021||India||Ajit Singh: Face of Jat politics in UP and champion of farmers’ rights||Ajit Singh, the son of a former prime minister, a former Union minister who served under four prime ministers, and a seven-term member of Parliament, died of Covid last month.But his political legacy was more happenstance than choice. Son of north India’s tallest farm leader Charan Singh, Singh was pushed into abruptly swapping a 15-year-long career as a computer scientist in Silicon Valley to the dusty fields of Western Uttar Pradesh in 1987.“Dadaji [grandfather] was sick and there was a lot of pressure on him because there was a vacuum. There were a lot of tall leaders who were a part of getting him into politics and I don’t think he strategically thought about it,’’ said Jayant Chaudhary, who has now stepped into his father’s role as the president of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).Singh never talked about his sudden political plunge, but Jayant gauged his reluctance when it was the younger man’s turn. “Unlike other politician fathers, he actually discouraged me,” said Chaudhary.Also Read | The hidden legacy of Ajit SinghDespite his reluctance, Singh quickly overcame his initial unfamiliarity with the caste and faith-based politics of western UP and cultivated his father’s close associations with farmer groups.From 1987 to 2014, Singh forged key alliances with both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), getting the commerce and industry portfolio in VP Singh’s government in 1989 and then going on to serve in the PV Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh cabinets, delivering the crucial farmers’ vote from the Jat-Muslim belt to his ally.His run ended when Narendra Modi swept to power in 2014, raiding the RLD’s turf. Singh lost his traditional Baghpat seat to former police commissioner Satyapal Singh in an election that happened months after the 2013 Jat-Muslim Muzaffarnagar riots that killed 70 people and displaced 100,000.“It’s not that he didn’t lose an election before. It’s just that this time he knew that something had changed for good. And he saw it again in 2019,’’ said Jayant, referring to Singh’s narrow loss in Muzaffarnagar to the BJP’s Sanjeev Balyan.Since 2014, the RLD has been reduced from being a kingmaker in UP to a marginal player – going from a strike rate of winning five out of seven seats in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections to zero seat out of eight in 2014 and zero out of three in 2019. In the 2017 assembly elections, it won a single seat out of the 277 contested.Shortly after his first electoral loss in three decades, Singh got embroiled in a bitter standoff with the central government over his Tughlaq Road residence. Singh refused to vacate the bungalow, saying he wanted to convert it into a memorial for Charan Singh while the government said such conversions of Lutyens bungalows were banned under a 2000 law and that Singh was illegally overstaying. The authorities shut off water and electricity and Singh finally left for his Vasant Kunj farmhouse after 118 days. The faceoff left a bitter aftertaste. “He felt wronged. He felt many former PMs had their homes turned into memorials so why couldn’t he?’’ said former Haryana chief minister and close friend, Bhupinder Hooda. Their friendship was another thing Singh inherited: Charan Singh was close to Hooda’s father, former minister Ranbir Singh Hooda.The one thing Hooda remembers most about his “brother’’ is his laughter. “Once we were together and this person, who I can’t name, was with us and he’d just left one party. So Ajit Singh asked him -- what happened? That person said he kicked the party. I will never forget that he started laughing while saying: “Kick them! Kick them faster and harder!’’A seasoned politician, Singh knew that despite the poll reverses, the possibility of a comeback was always round the corner. The farmer protests, which broke out last year over three controversial agriculture bills, appeared to be an opportunity for just that.As the agitation intensified at Delhi’s borders, Singh toured western UP, hosting mahapanchayats and renewing contact with farm leaders. On January 28, when forces closed in on the Ghazipur protest site and power supplies were cut, farm leader Rakesh Tikait received a call from Singh. “He told me not to worry and he said that we should carry on our protest, he would support us. That meant a lot to us,’’ said Tikait. Hours later, he issued an emotional appeal that galvanised farmers in western UP, and RLD called for joint mahapanchayats with farm leaders across the region“From the beginning, he stayed true to farmers. Unlike other politicians, he didn’t go back and forth and will remain a lasting leader of the community,’’ said Tikait.Between then and April, when he contracted Covid, Singh remained politically active, addressing large rallies. Right before he died after two weeks in hospital on May 6, he believed that his voters were ready to welcome the RLD and his ideas, that the pain of Muslim-Jat violence was trumped by a common farmer identity. His son Jayant now hopes to carry on that vision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ajit-singh-face-of-jat-politics-in-up-and-champion-of-farmers-rights-101623792915099.html
16-06-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The Delta variant of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, B.1.617.2 is likely to become the dominant strain in the US, experts fear, much like it already has in the UK. Indeed, both the UK and Russia are among countries that are seeing a resurgence in cases on account of this variant which was first sequenced in India. After bottoming out at a little over 2,000 in the first week of May (the lowest since last September), the seven-day average of daily new cases in the UK, according to the NYT database, rose to 7,278 on June 14. In Russia, according to worldometers.info, the seven-day average of daily new cases was 12,363 on June 14, after bottoming out in the low 8,000s in early May, during a long plateau that followed the second wave of the pandemic in that country. Some experts are also of the opinion that it could become the dominant strain in most parts of the world, replacing Alpha, which was first sequenced in the UK. The numbers shouldn’t surprise anyone. Research by Public Health England has shown that Delta is 64% more infectious than the original strain of the virus that first emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. But while it is more infectious, research released earlier this week (again, by Public Health England) showed that two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine prevent hospitalisation in 96% of cases, and two doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford one in 92% of the cases. The vaccines, according to earlier research by PHE, were found to be 88% and 60% effective in preventing infection after two doses (and 33% effective in preventing it after one).On Monday, the UK also announced that it was reducing the gap between the two doses of vaccine for those over the age of 40 years from 12 weeks to eight weeks, a move aimed at countering the Delta variant (the country also delayed opening up further till July 19 on account of this strain). As I’ve said before in this column, India should now consider doing the same. The Delta variant is likely the dominant one in this country too (we can’t know for sure till we sequence enough viral genomes, which we aren’t doing). Still, the revelation that vaccines are highly effective in preventing hospitalisation, even in case of an infection caused by the Delta variant, is good news.On the subject of the Delta variant, there’s been a lot of buzz around a so-called Delta-plus variant, one that displays one mutation that was seen in Beta (B.1.351), which was first sequenced in South Africa, and which seems to have some ability to evade antibodies (the Gamma variant or P1 or B.1.1.248, first sequenced in Brazil also has a mutation that allows it to do this), but there hasn’t been much research around it yet.But there was more good news on Monday as well: research by scientists from Rockefeller University and Weill Cornell Medicine suggested that immunity against the Sars-CoV-2 virus was strong even a year after infection, and that infected people who received at one dose of the vaccine developed strong immunity even against the variants of concern. HT reported this study on June 15.This, the duration for which a prior infection or a vaccine (or both) offers protection against Covid-19 has been one of the fundamental questions of science related to the pandemic. Over the past few months, our ability to answer that question has improved. In May, Nature published a paper by scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis that showed that people infected with Sars-CoV-2 do, over time, develop memory plasma cells (resident in their bone marrow). Such cells typically offer long-lasting immunity against pathogens. For instance, in an instalment of this column last July, I wrote of a 2020 study by scientists at Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School and Singapore’s National Centre for Infectious Diseases that people infected in 2003 by Sars-CoV-1, which caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars), still possessed cells that remembered that virus and could protect them against it if required.It’s reasonable to assume that some of these immunological benefits are only available to those who have suffered a symptomatic infection (in keeping with the old adage, no pain, no gain), but this too is a question that science should be able to answer soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101623786602407.html
16-06-2021||India||NIA arrests two more in Mansukh Hiran case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on June 11 arrested two more persons in connection with the Antilia explosives scare case and the subsequent murder of Thane-based auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran.The accused have been identified as Santosh Atmaram Shelar and Anand Pandurang Jadhav, both residents of Kurar village in Malad (East), said an NIA officer. The duo is said to be close aides of a former Mumbai Police encounter specialist, but the NIA officer quoted above has refused to divulge the alleged roles played by the two in the Antilia and murder cases.Several cases of assault and rioting are registered against Shelar at Kurar and other police stations in north Mumbai. An officer said that the agency was on the lookout for him for more than a month. He was nabbed from Latur, while Jadhav was arrested from Mumbai.Shelar and Jadhav have been remanded in NIA custody till June 21 by the special NIA court in Mumbai.On February 25, a Mahindra Scorpio was found abandoned near Antilia – the south Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani – with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note addressed to the Ambanis.A case was registered with Gamdevi police station in connection with the incident. On March 5, Hiran – the owner of the SUV – was found dead in a creek near Mumbra, with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth and his face covered by a scarf. A separate case was then registered with Mumbra police in connection with the murder of the trader. NIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and the murder case on March 24. NIA subsequently took over both the cases and clubbed them for investigation purposes. The federal agency had previously arrested three Mumbai Police officers – Sachin Vaze, his colleague at the criminal intelligence unit (CIU) of the crime branch Riyazuddin Kazi and inspector Sunil Mane. NIA also arrested former police constable Vinayak More – a life convict in the fake encounter killing of Lakhan Bhaiya – and cricket bookie Naresh Gor, both of whom allegedly helped Vaze to execute the suspected murder.Vaze was originally in charge of the investigation of the Antilia case, but removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who had reported the SUV stolen on February 17. It subsequently emerged that Vaze had borrowed the SUV in November and returned to Hiran in early February.To contain the damage, the Maharashtra government transferred the then police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer subsequently wrote a letter to the chief minister, alleging that the then home minister Anil Deshmukh had instructed Vaze and some other Mumbai Police officers to extort ₹100 crore from bars, restaurants and hookah parlours, and when no action was forthcoming, he approached the courts.The Bombay high court eventually asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the matter, prompting Deshmukh’s resignation. Accordingly, the central agency registered an offence against Deshmukh and some others on April 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-arrests-two-more-in-mansukh-hiran-case-101623784626847.html
16-06-2021||India||Shah holds meet to review flood preparedness for monsoon||New Delhi: Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday held a high-level meeting to review the preparedness to deal with flood situations in the country during the monsoon. He also reviewed long-term measures for the formulation of a comprehensive and overarching policy to mitigate the perennial flood problems in the country, people aware of the matter said.During the meeting, Shah directed officials to strengthen coordination between central and state agencies to have a permanent system for forecasting floods and the rise in water levels in major catchment zones/areas, the people added.The Union minister also advised the Jal Shakti ministry to work out a mechanism for desilting of large dams, which will help in increasing dam storage capacity and flood control.The meeting comes a day after the ministry of earth science issued a statement predicting rainfall with isolated thunderstorms and lightning over most parts of east, central and northeast India over the next four to five days.According to a statement issued by the home ministry, Shah told the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Central Water Commission to use state-of-the-art technology and satellite data for more accurate weather and flood predictions. “He directed to give maximum publicity to various mobile apps related to weather forecasting like ‘Umang’, ‘Rain Alarm’ and ‘Damini’, developed by the IMD, so that their benefits reach the targeted population,” the statement added. The Union minister also directed the National Disaster Response Force to immediately hold meetings with the heads of the SDRF of flood-prone states.A large area in India is prone to flood in which the Ganga and the Brahmaputra are main flood basins and Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal are most flood-prone states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-holds-meet-to-review-flood-preparedness-for-monsoon-101623784266754.html
16-06-2021||India||Centre’s order on giving citizenship to refugees separate from CAA, SC told||The Centre has told the Supreme Court that its May 28 order delegating collectors of select districts to grant citizenship to non-Muslims from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh is distinct from the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) of 2019. While the former is merely a delegation by the Centre to consider applications of foreigners staying legally in India, the latter applies to illegal migrants, the government told the court.The government was responding to an intervention application filed in the apex court earlier this month by Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a political outfit that had earlier challenged the CAA. The application, drawn by advocate Haris Beeran, dubbed the May 28 order an “indirect” attempt to secure the purpose sought to be achieved under CAA, and sought a stay on it as it felt the government was trying to “circumvent” the apex court that had refused to stay the 2019 legislation on the Centre’s assurance that its rules were yet to be framed.The affidavit filed by the ministry of home affairs on Monday said, “The delegation of power vide notification dated May 28, 2021, is in respect of those foreign applicants who fulfil the eligibility criteria and who are in possession of valid documents like passports and Indian visa. It is submitted that the same would not be relatable to the legislative steps taken through the CAA which provide for a classification with a rational nexus and intelligible differentia.”The government further explained that the notification does not violate the right to equality of any citizen under Article 14, as a foreigner of any faith having a valid residential permit to stay in India is free to apply for citizenship.“The existing law and procedure for acquiring citizenship of India is in no way sought to be amended through the impugned notification. It is submitted that any foreigner of any faith can apply for citizenship of India at any time. The central government shall decide that application as per law and rules,” the affidavit stated.On Tuesday, a vacation bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian adjourned the hearing in the matter by two weeks after senior advocate Kapil Sibal appearing for IUML sought time to file a response to the Centre’s affidavit. Attorney general K K Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, agreed to the deferment.The Centre informed the court that the May 2021 notification does not add or modify the eligibility criteria applicable to foreigners and such notifications delegating power to the district collectors have been issued from time to time by the central government in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2016 and 2018.The government claimed that the order has been issued under Section 16 of the Citizenship Act which allows the government to delegate its powers to grant citizenship by registration or naturalisation to district collectors. It also gave examples of past instances when this was done.In 2004, an amendment to the Citizenship Rules delegated the power to grant Indian citizenship by registration to Pakistani nationals of Hindu community displaced due to the 1965 and 1971 wars. In 2016, using its power under Section 16 of the Citizenship Act, the Centre delegated district collectors of 16 districts and home secretaries of seven states to process citizenship applications of legal migrants belonging to six specified minority communities of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh — Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians — for a period of two years. Later in 2018, this delegation of powers was extended till further orders.The Centre recently received requests from other states and districts having a sizeable number of such legal migrants staying within their territories. So, it decided to further delegate its power to grant citizenship to eligible categories of foreigners to collectors of 13 districts — four in Gujarat (Morbi, Rajkot, Patan, Vadodara), five in Rajasthan (Jalore, Udaipur, Pali, Barmer, Sirohi), two in Chhattisgarh (Durg, Balodabazar), Faridabad in Haryana, and Jalandhar in Punjab. Additionally, home secretaries of Haryana and Punjab were also given this power.At present, district collectors of 29 districts can exercise powers of the central government to grant citizenship to six categories of religious groups from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who are eligible under the Citizenship Act and Rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-order-on-giving-citizenship-to-refugees-separate-from-caa-sctold-101623784086752.html
16-06-2021||India||Army eyes faster mobility via dedicated rail corridors||The Indian Army said in a statement that it carried out its first trial run to move military hardware, including tanks, by rail along a dedicated freight corridor (DFC) in the country’s north, an approach that could, if expanded and implemented, allow the armed forces to swiftly transport equipment to shore up operational readiness, .The drill saw a military train transport vehicles and equipment from New Rewari in Haryana to New Phulera in Rajasthan on Monday.Such dedicated corridors will allow the armed forces to increase the pace of deployment of military hardware to areas where they are needed for operational reasons as freight trains will be able to clock average speeds of 75 kmph instead of the current 35-40 kmph, people familiar with the development said on the condition of anonymity.In some cases, freight travel time will be reduced by several days once the DFC ‘quadrilateral’ connecting Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata is ready, they added.The army carried out the drill in coordination with the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Ltd (DFCCIL) and Indian Railways.“Interactions by the Indian Army with all stakeholders including DFCCIL and Indian Railways will now assist in leveraging the DFC and allied infrastructure into the mobilisation matrix of the armed forces,” the statement said. Development of infrastructure at certain locations to support mobilisation and trials to validate the movement of defence-owned rolling stock cargo (wheeled or tracked vehicles) is being formalised, the people cited above said.“These trials were part of the ‘whole-of-the-nation approach’ for optimising national resources and achieving seamless synergy among various ministries and departments. This initiative would set in place processes to ensure that military requirements are dovetailed in the national infrastructure development at the planning stage itself,” the statement added.Experts said faster movement of military hardware would help.“In futuristic scenarios, there will be short-duration intense wars wherein speedy mobilisation will be an important element for build-up/switching of forces. It’s a very positive move,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).Movement of military hardware on regular freight routes is a cumbersome and time-consuming process, said one of the officials cited above.“Military movement on regular freight routes takes place at a snail’s pace…in some cases taking as many as seven to 10 days. With these successful trials, we are sure military equipment can be moved from Kolkata to Ludhiana in just 24 hours which, in rail terms, is rocket speed,” he said.A dedicated corridor speeds up transportation time as it does not involve halts. “Earlier, these trains usually had to take halts every 150 km. A huge amount of time will be saved as the DFC routes will not require stoppages,” said a second official.In May, freight trains on the DFC clocked a record average speed of 99.38 kmph, faster than the average speed of 80 kmph of the Rajdhani trains. Three trains ran at an average speed of more than 99 kmph, the fastest being on the 331-km New Khurja-New Bhaupur section of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC), which was opened for operations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 29, 2020.DFCCIL has been tasked with developing Indian Railways’ quadrilateral linking the four metropolitan cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata, commonly known as the Golden Quadrilateral. The overall project cost is pegged at ₹81,459 crore.In the first phase, the organisation is constructing the Western DFC (1,504 route km) and the EDFC (1,856 route km) spanning a total length of 3,360 route km. Route km refers to the distance between two points on the railway network, irrespective of the number of connecting lines.These corridors are targeted to be completed in phases by December 2021.EDFC will start from Sahnewal in Punjab and end at at Dankuni in West Bengal, passing through Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. WDFC, connecting Dadri in Uttar Pradesh to Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai will pass through Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Haryana....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-eyes-faster-mobility-via-dedicated-rail-corridors-101623784026730.html
16-06-2021||India||₹150 per Covaxin dose will not be sustainable in long run, says Bharat Biotech||Bharat Biotech has not sought indemnity from the central government against any adverse event caused by its coronavirus vaccine Covaxin, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. It also defended its differential pricing and said the “non-competitive rate” at which it provides the vaccine to the governments is unsustainable in the long run and the manufacturing cost has to be offset by pricing the vaccine higher in the private market. A whole virion inactivated vaccine, Covaxin is one of the three Covid-19 vaccines being used in the national Covid-19 immunisation programme. The company also said that the central government has directed it to keep supplies to the private sector under 10%.“As directed by the government of India, less than 10% of our total production of Covaxin to date has been supplied to private hospitals, while most of the remaining quantity was supplied to state and central governments,” the company said in a statement. In such a scenario, the weighted average price of Covaxin for all supplies is less than ₹ 250 per dose, the company said, adding that in the future, approximately 75% of the vaccine output will be supplied to the central and state governments while the remaining 25% will be supplied to private hospitals. The company has claimed that at least 40 million doses of Covaxin have been supplied to date, and newer versions targeting newer variants of the virus are also being developed. Explaining the new pricing policy, the company said the existing price of ₹150 per dose at which the vaccine is sold to the central government is non-competitive and unsustainable in the long run. So, a higher price in the private markets is required to offset part of the manufacturing cost. Currently, Covaxin is being sold to state governments at ₹400 per dose and at ₹1,200 per dose to private hospitals and institutions, which is significantly higher. Beginning June 21, doses will only be acquired by the Union government and private hospitals, and the Centre is expected to renegotiate prices.“This is purely due to fundamental business reasons, ranging from low procurement volumes, high distribution costs and retail margins among few others…,” the company said, urging the government to allow them to maintain differential pricing for the public and private sectors. The company has so far invested at least ₹ 500 crore at its own risk for product development, clinical trials and to set up manufacturing facilities for the vaccine. The support from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), its co-developer, was with respect to providing the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19), animal studies, virus characterisation, test kits and partial funding for clinical trial sites. In return for this support, Bharat Biotech will pay royalties to ICMR and the National Institute of Virology, based on product sales. According to people familiar with the matter, it is about 5% of the product sales.HT reached out to the health ministry but didn’t receive a response till the time of press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/150-per-covaxin-dose-will-not-be-sustainable-in-long-run-says-bharat-biotech-101623783186656.html
16-06-2021||India||Bengal post-poll violence: Victims file affidavit, say still facing ‘hostility’||West Bengal post-poll violence victims, who are seeking compensation from the Supreme Court, have filed an affidavit denying a statement by the state government that law and order was restored soon after the Mamata Banerjee-led government took control on May 3, adding that they were still facing “hostile attitude”.The violence, alleged to be orchestrated by people belonging to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), erupted soon after the announcement of assembly poll results on May 2. Several political workers belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were killed, their houses looted, with allegations of rape and torture also being levelled.Filing a response on Monday to the state’s affidavit, the petitioners, led by social activist Arun Mukherjee, attached affidavits of victims and copies of their complaints to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).The West Bengal government’s affidavit previously said that all displaced people referred in the public interest litigation being heard by the apex court were brought back safely to their respective homes with the help of state authorities. It termed the allegations made by the petitioners as “misleading” and “politically motivated”. It also mentioned a three-member committee formed by the high court to look into the issues faced by displaced people.In response, the affidavit filed by the petitioners said: “The claims made by the respondents (West Bengal government and police) with regard to status of internally displaced persons (IDP) is misleading… Though, after the request of the Governor, West Bengal and relying upon the order of the Calcutta High Court, they (IDPs) went back to their homes but they are facing the vindictive and hostile attitude of the local police, administration and Trinamool Congress (TMC) goons.”The victims said that “pavements to their homes are blocked, houses are being vandalized, ration and other essential items are denied to them by local shopkeepers and marketplaces due to the threat by TMC goons.” They also complained of inability to access health facilities, medicines due to “forced social ostracization” by hooligans in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-post-poll-violence-victims-file-affidavit-say-still-facing-hostile-attitude-101623783127354.html
16-06-2021||India||Sukhbir among 3 detained over protests against Punjab govt||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal was on Tuesday detained while leading a protest outside Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s farmhouse at Siswan on the outskirts of Chandigarh.Leading hundreds of party workers, Badal, the former deputy chief minister of Punjab, demanded the dismissal of state health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu and a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into alleged irregularities in the sale of vaccines and procurement of medical kits for Covid-19 patients.The opposition party also demanded that land acquisition for national highways be done at market rates and displacement compensation be offered to the affected landowners, and the pending dues under the post-matric scholarship scheme for scheduled caste (SC) students be released at the earliest.“If a storm rises, Captain (Amarinder Singh) will be unable to stop it. There is a scam in vaccination drive; there is a scam in the disbursal of Fateh Kits; there is a scam in scholarship for the SC community; and the land of farmers is also being acquired,” Badal said before being detained.The chief minister rejected the opposition’s allegations on supply of vaccines as “politically motivated”and said there was no question of the state government making profits amid the pandemic, which it was battling hard to save lives.“The state government has not indulged in any wrongdoing. Quick and unusual decisions have to be taken in an emergency war-like situation. All protocols were strictly followed and emergency rules were invoked to meet the crisis,” Singh said in a statement.Punjab Police also detained former state minister Bikram Singh Majithia and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) state president Jasvir Singh Garhi near Siswan T-point, where barricades were put up. The Akali Dal workers were joined by BSP activists as the two parties have forged an alliance in the run up to the 2022 assembly elections.Clashes broke out, and police resorted to the use of water cannons to disperse the protesters. The three leaders were booked under bailable provisions of the Disaster Management Act. Majithia said that an Akali worker also suffered injuries during the police action.The SAD has alleged that the price of Fateh Kits — medical kits containing medicines, consumables and oximeters that are given to Covid-19 patients — was jacked up repeatedly from ₹800 to ₹1,400 as the state government invited one tender after another even though the first was valid for six months.The opposition party also claimed that the government was involved in a vaccination scandal in which it sold vaccines to private hospitals at huge profit margins while allowing the latter to charge patients high rates.Addressing the protesters, Badal said that all Congress ministers involved in corruption will be booked if the SAD-BSP alliance is voted to power in 2022. “Balbir Sidhu was responsible for the drug de-addiction tablet scam, PPE kit scam, vaccine scam and Fateh Kit scam; Sadhu Singh Dharamsot was responsible for SC scholarship scam; and Sukhjinder Randhawa had indulged in the seed scam.”Badal also alleged that the chief minister had extended patronage to the sand and liquor mafia that caused a loss in excise revenue worth ₹6,500 crore apart from illegally mining sand worth hundreds of crores of rupees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sukhbir-among-3-detained-over-protests-against-punjab-govt-101623783006697.html
16-06-2021||India||SC closes proceedings in 2012 case against Italian marines||After nine years of twists and turns, the Supreme Court on Tuesday put an end to all legal proceedings in India against the Italian marines who killed two Indian fishermen off the coast of Kerala in 2012.The bench of justices Indira Banerjee and MR Shah gave quietus to civil and criminal proceedings pending against the two marines after noting that compensation of ₹10 crore for the families of the victims “can be said to be a reasonable amount of compensation” and “in the interest of heirs of the deceased”.“We are of the view that this is a fit case to close all the proceedings in India including criminal proceedings in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India,” the bench recorded in its 11-page order while ending proceedings against the two marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone.The top court said that the compensation money shall be transferred to the Kerala high court, which will monitor its disbursement to the victim families. The families of the two deceased fishermen have agreed to a compensation of ₹4 crore each in addition to the ₹2 crore already paid by the Italian government. The injured owner of the boat also consented to receiving damages of ₹2 crore.Citing the May 2020 order of the international arbitral tribunal that both India and Italy accepted, the court added that the Republic of Italy shall resume its criminal investigation into the fishermen’s shooting incident of 2012. “It is further directed that the Union of India, Republic of Italy and the State of Kerala shall cooperate with each other in pursuit of that investigation,” said the bench.After Tuesday’s order, civil proceedings pending before the Supreme Court and the Kerala high court as well as a criminal murder case pending before a special court in Delhi shall come to an end.The peaceful burial has followed an intense legal and diplomatic row that began on February 15, 2012 when the marines aboard Italian Vessel MV Enrica Lexie shot dead Valantine, 44, and Ajeesh Pink, 20, who were fishing off the coast of Kerala. The Kollam police registered a murder case against the marines and arrested the duo on February 19.While the marines and the Italy challenged the jurisdiction of the Kerala police by filing a writ petition before the high court in February, the families of the slain fishermen and the injured boat owner filed admiralty suit before the high court demanding compensation. A separate petition was also filed by Enrica Lexie before the high court seeking permission to continue the voyage with other crew members.In April 2012, the Italian government paid a compensation of ₹1 crore each for the deceased fishermen and ₹17 lakh for the boat owner in an out-of-court settlement. But the petition by Lexie was dismissed by a division bench of the high court compelling the shipping company to move the Supreme Court. On May 2, the Supreme Court allowed the vessel to sail away with all 24 crew members, subject to certain terms and conditions.To be sure, the criminal case continued against the marines and, on May 18, 2012, the Kollam police filed a charge sheet against the two, charging them with murder and attempt to murder. The writ petition filed by the marines along with their government failed before the high court which on May 29, 2012, affirmed the jurisdiction by the Kerala and the concerned circle inspector of police at Kollam.The marines and the Italian government then rushed to the Supreme Court, seeking protection under the United Nationals Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The Italian government asserted that India and Italy, having signed and ratified the 1982 treaty, must settle the dispute concerning the incident in question, in terms of the binding dispute resolution mechanism provided under the UNCLOS.The Italian government also claimed sovereign immunity for its marines but, by a judgment in January 2013, the Supreme Court dismissed this contention and upheld India’s criminal jurisdiction over the Marines. At the same time, the court clarified that Kerala had no jurisdiction to investigate into the incident since the incident had taken place over the Contiguous Zone that was in exclusive jurisdiction of the Union government.While the proceedings were then shifted to a special court in Delhi and the probe was handed over to the National Investigation Agency, the top court gave liberty to the Italian government to raise issues of UNCLOS at appropriate forum.Then came a phase of diplomatic tension when the marines, who were allowed by the top court in February 2013 to go to Italy for a brief period to vote in the general elections, did not come back, and Italy went back on its undertaking. As the court fumed over breach of undertaking by Italian ambassador Daniele Mincini, the Indian government restrained Mincini from leaving the country. Following diplomatic pressures, Italy returned the marines to India.In September 2014, Latorre sought permission to go back to Italy for medical treatment, and the court allowed it on the humanitarian ground. The initial period of four months was later extended from time to time.In July 2015, Italy took the case to International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, an independent judicial body under the UNCLOS, which asked both India and Italy to suspend all court proceedings and referred the matter to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, an intergovernmental organisation based in The Hague in Netherlands.On a joint request by both the governments, the Supreme Court suspended all proceedings against the marines by an order in August 2015.In May 2016, the apex court allowed the second marine, Girone, to leave for Italy. In September that year, the Centre told the Supreme Court it had no objection if the marines were allowed to remain in Italy until the arbitration proceedings before the tribunal were over, following which the court permitted their stay at home.In May 2020, the tribunal ruled that the marines enjoyed immunity since they were exercising official functions in their capacity as Italian state officials when the incident occurred. It, therefore, ordered India to stop criminal proceedings against them. At the same time, the tribunal held that Italy violated India’s right to navigation by firing at the fishing boat and said that the country would have to compensate India for loss of life and damage to property.On July 3, 2020, the Centre moved the top court, saying it had accepted the PCA’s ruling and wanted the proceedings to be closed. When the plea was taken up by the court in August 2020, it clarified that the proceedings could be closed only after the families of the victims were heard and given “adequate” compensation.Again, in April this year, the Supreme Court reiterated that the compensation money must be deposited in the registry of the court and the victims should agree to it before the proceedings could be ended. Last week, the court was informed that compensation of ₹10 crore for the families of the victims has been deposited. It had then reserved the order that was delivered on Tuesday, ending all proceedings in India against the marines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-closes-proceedings-in-2012-case-against-italian-marines-101623782947179.html
16-06-2021||India||Anti-defection law under spotlight amid Bengal political tussle||The demand for removal of an MLA and two MPs, all from West Bengal , from their respective legislative bodies has triggered the latest round of the political battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Trinamool Congress, bringing the focus back on the country’s anti-defection laws.BJP MLA Mukul Roy returned to the Trinamool Congress (which he left in 2017) on June 11, and the leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, the BJP’s Suvendhu Adhikari, himself a TMC man till December, has vowed to take the legal route if Roy doesn’t resign. Meanwhile, two sitting Trinamool MPs, Sisir Adhikari (Suvendu’s father) and Sunil Mandal joined the BJP from the TMC just ahead of the assembly election but are yet to resign as lawmakers.The rules for the disqualification of defectors is laid down in the Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. It says, a lawmaker shall be disqualified, “if he has voluntarily given up his membership of such a political party” or “if he votes or abstains from voting in such House contrary to any direction issued by the political party to which he belongs”.The BJP and Trinamool’s arguments, demanding the resignation of Ray, Mandal and Adhikari from their respective legislatures, lies primarily under the clause 2(a) of the tenth schedule-- “if he has voluntarily given up his membership of such a political party”.But the issue isn’t simply a matter of a person who leaves a party resigning.Abhishek Singhvi, the Congress’ top legal expert, said, “There is certainly going to be a legal battle ahead. Knee-jerk verdicts should not be attempted by the BJP or anyone else. The Tenth Schedule has to lead to detailed adjudication if and after a complaint is filed and the Speaker hears all sides.”The decision to expel a lawmaker under the defection laws is within the powers of the Speaker of the legislative body -- in this case the Speaker of the West Bengal Assembly, Biman Bandopadhyayand the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Om Birla. The laws give power to the Speaker to decide whether someone falls under the anti-defection laws or not.The speaker’s role in defection cases has become crucial as well as controversial. On several occasions, the Supreme Court has pulled up the Speaker for partisan behaviour. In 2019, the Supreme Court said there is a growing trend of Speakers of legislative bodies “acting against the constitutional duty of being neutral”; this was in a case where it upheld the disqualification of 17 rebel Karnataka MLAs who pulled down the JDS-Congress government.In recent years, there has been a growing demand from the Speakers themselves to redefine and perhaps limit their powers under the anti-defection laws should be curtailed. In two meetings of all Indian presiding officers, Rajasthan Speaker CP Joshi and some others put forth the view that political parties should decide who will be disqualified as Speakers come under intense pressure on defection issues, and often get criticised by the courts too.According to a member of the TMC, Roy is unlikely to resign, and wants to fight it out with the BJP over the defection laws even if it wants to ensure that Adhikari and Mandal are expelled from the Lok Sabha.Trinamool Congress functionaries said that its Lok Sabha floor leader Sudip Bandopadhyay spoke to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to appeal for the disqualification of Adhikari and Mandal. “Birla told us that he will soon form a committee to decide the issue,” the TMC leader said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antidefection-law-under-spotlight-amid-bengal-political-tussle-101623782946646.html
16-06-2021||India||Ram temple trust denies graft charge, gives detail of land deal||The trust overseeing the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya said on Tuesday that all land purchase deals were done transparently and dismissed allegations of corruption levelled by Opposition parties.The Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust tweeted details of all agreements of the 1.2080-hectare land in Ayodhya’s Bag Bijaisi since 2011. The body said that the land was in a “prime location” near the railway station and adjacent to a road that is likely to be widened and serve as the main approach road to the Ram temple.The trust said that nine individuals were involved in three separate deals over the last decade and added that the trust finally bought the land on March 18 at ₹1,423 per sq ft, lower the market rate.“All individuals were contacted and negotiated with. On receiving their consent, they all came and sat together to decide on their previous agreements,” said the trust.“As and when the previous agreements were finalised, the trust made the agreement with final owners of the land with immediate effect without losing any time. It was done quickly but in a transparent manner,” it added.The controversy broke out on Sunday after former Samajwadi Party MLA from Ayodhya, Tej Pratap Pandey, and AAP Rajya Sabha MP, Sanjay Singh, accused the trust of purchasing land worth ₹2 crore for ₹18.5 crore.In separate press conferences, the two leaders showed documents to allege that on March 18 this year, Kusum Pathak sold her land for ₹2 crore to Sultan Ansari and Ravi Mohan Tiwari, who then sold the land to the trust for ₹18.5 crore 10 minutes later.They also said that the circle rate (price per unit of land fixed by government ) of the plot was ₹5.79 crore. To be sure, land agreements are often struck at prices far above the circle rate. Since then, Opposition parties have demanded a judicial probe and the trust has dismissed the charges, saying the price of the land was decided between Pathak and Ansari-Tiwari in 2019 but the land was registered on March 18.In its response on Tuesday, the Trust said nine individuals were involved in the plot’s purchase deals over the last 10 years.On March 4, 2011, four men -- Mehfooz Alam, Javed Alam, Noor Alam and Firoz Alam --- signed an agreement with Kusum Pathak, her husband Harish Pathak and Mohd Irfan to sell the land for R1 crore, said the trust. The deal was valid for three years and lapsed on March 4, 2014.Then, on November 20, 2017, the same four people registered a sale deed to Kusum Pathak and Harish Pathak for ₹2 crore. The next day, Kusum Pathak and Harish Pathak entered into an agreement to sell the land to lchchha Ram Singh, Jitendra Kumar Singh and Rakesh Kumar Singh for R 2.16 crore, said the trust.This agreement was cancelled on September 17, 2019.The same day, Kusum Pathak and Harish Pathak signed another agreement to sell the same plot to Ichchha Ram Singh, Vishwa Pratap Upadhyay, Manish Kumar, Subedar, Balram Yadav, Ravindra Kumar Dubey, Sultan Ansari and Rashid Hussain for ₹2 crore. The validity of the agreement was three years.This agreement was registered to be cancelled March 18, 2021, said the Trust.“On 18.03.2021, Kusum Pathak and Harish Pathak sold land... by sale deed to Tiwari and Ansari...The consideration amount was Rs. 2 crore,” said the trust.The same day, Tiwari and Ansari entered into an agreement to sell this land to the trust for ₹18.50 crore. Payment of ₹17 crore was made as advance by online transaction, the trust added.“Nyas (Trust) was interested in purchasing this land but first wanted to finalise all the previous agreements so that ownership of the land may be cleared,” said the trust.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said all members of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust must resign till the issue related to the Ayodhya land deal and transactions are cleared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-temple-trust-denies-graft-charge-gives-detail-of-land-deal-101623782888391.html
16-06-2021||India||The growing urban bias of India’s vaccination drive||India’s massive vaccination drive is becoming skewed towards cities and towns, with the rural parts of the country being increasingly left behind , shows district-based vaccination data analysed by HT.A person living in urban India is at least 1.8 times more likely to receive a shot of the Covid-19 vaccine than their counterpart living in the rural hinterland — a matter of concern because around 65% of the country’s population currently resides in rural districts. The even more worrying trend is that the gap between the coverage of population between the two groups is currently the highest ever recorded, and continues to rise.Experts said that if this rural-urban gap continues to widen, then it risks hampering India’s goal of vaccinating 60-70% of the country’s population by the end of year, as a large majority of the population lives in villages.For the purpose of this analysis and to identify vaccination coverage in urban and rural pockets in the country, India’s 700-plus districts have been classified into three categories on the basis of population living in rural areas: urban (under 40% population living in rural areas), mixed (40%-60% rural population), and rural (over 60% rural population).According to the 2011 census estimates, the population share of entirely urban, mixed, and rural districts was 13.6%, 13.6%, and 72.8% respectively. Since there are no estimates available for the demographic distribution across districts by age to estimate their adult population (only those above 18 years of age are eligible for shots currently), the analysis has relied on overall projections of population by the Census of India. For the district-wise administration of jabs, the data has been sourced from Union health ministry’s Co-Win dashboard till June 14.When India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive is seen across these three groups of districts, the urban ones, expectedly, have had the largest proportion of people receiving jabs. Even though urban districts account for only 13.6% of India’s population, 27.2% of the residents of these districts have received at least one shot of the vaccine till Monday night. To be sure, it is entirely possible that some people from the villages, who are currently working in cities, are getting their shots there. In contrast, in rural districts, where 72.8% of India’s population live, only 14.7% of residents have been inoculated with one shot.Worse still, the contrast is becoming starker as the drive gathers momentum and expands.With 27.2% of urban residents having received a shot of the vaccine to 14.7% of those living in rural areas having received theirs, the comparison translates into an urban-rural vaccine coverage ratio of 1.8:1. In simpler terms, as things stood on June 8, a resident of urban India was 1.8 times more likely to receive a shot of the vaccine than someone living in rural parts of the country – the biggest gap in coverage since the start of India’s vaccination drive.On May 1, 14.9% of residents of urban districts had received jabs, while 9.4% of the rural population had been covered by at least one shot , an urban-rural coverage ratio of 1.6:1. On April 1, coverage of population in urban and rural areas was 5.3% and 4.1% respectively, translating to a coverage ratio of 1.3:1.Of the 29.6 million confirmed infections across India till Tuesday night, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard, 35% have been reported in urban districts, while 47% were in the country’s rural areas, and the remaining 18% were in mixed districts. To be sure, the proportion of reported cases in rural areas is likely skewed due to the lack of adequate testing facilities in the country’s hinterlands.“The majority of India still lives in rural parts of the country. And if rural areas are lagging behind in inoculation, and if this gap continues to grow, then it is a worrying trend because it can create a situation where our goal of vaccinating 60-70% of our population to achieve herd immunity by the end of the year will be hurt,” said virologist Dr Shahid Jameel, director of Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University.“And to address this gap, we have to understand the reason that such a gap is emerging. Is the reason that there are fewer vaccination centres or doses available in rural areas, or is that there more vaccine hesitancy there? I suspect the real cause may be a bit of both of these factors. Once the reason is clear, the government will be able to take remedial measures to fix this gap,” Dr Jameel said.Also Read | Sputnik covid vaccine more efficient against Delta variant: Study“While it is extremely unfortunate, but it isn’t surprising that urban India has greater access to vaccines. I have a suspicion that there a secondary contribution of the fact that vaccination-related information and messaging campaign are much more prominent in urban India as well. The third issue may be that such a large proportion of rural India is dependent on daily wages that it may not be easy for them to travel to primary health centres to get shots,” said Dr Satyajit Rath, immunologist and adjunct faculty of Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune.He added that when sets of communities with different proportions of immunised people live in close proximity, it increases the risk of more variants of the virus propping up. “If urban areas achieve say 75% vaccinations are rural India is left with 40% receiving shots, then what we’re doing is creating islands of highly immunised communities living in close proximity of large swathes of lower immunised communities where the virus is simmering in a slower rate of transmission. And when there are no travel restrictions between them, then the tide of infections will keep lapping against the urban islands of highly immunised people. And that would mean that the virus would get a prolonged exposure to vaccinated communities, which is basically increasing the likelihood of the arrival of relatively vaccine-resistant strains.”Abhishek Jha contributed to this report||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-growing-urban-bias-of-india-s-vaccination-drive-101623782827156.html
16-06-2021||India||Waited for one year but no clarity yet on Galwan clashes: Sonia||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday attacked the Narendra Modi government for not providing any clarity about the Galwan Valley clash between Indian and Chinese troops that took place on June 15 last year, leaving 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops dead.The Congress president said that her party has repeatedly sought information about the episode and details on what progress has been made by the government to return to the status quo ante before April 2020 along the friction points on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).“Having patiently waited for the government to come clean and inform the nation about the circumstances in which the unprecedented incident happened and reassure the people that the sacrifice of our brave jawans was not in vain, the Congress reiterates its concern that no clarity is yet available and the Prime Minister’s last word on the subject a year ago was that no transgression had occurred,” Gandhi said in a statement on the deadliest face-off between the Indian Army and the People’s Liberation Army in more than five decades.Gandhi also contended that the disengagement agreement with China has only worked entirely to India’s disadvantage. She urged the government “to take the nation into confidence and ensure that their performance is worthy of the commitment of our soldiers who are standing bravely and resolutely at the borders”.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also paid tributes to the 20 Indian soldiers killed in action. “I join a grateful nation in remembering the 20 brave jawans of the Bihar Regiment, including their commanding officer who tragically lost their lives in a confrontation with PLA troops in Galwan on the night of 15-16 June, 2020,” he said in an Instagram post.He also posted a video montage of his press conference from last year in which he had claimed that the Prime Minister did not fulfil his responsibility of protecting the sovereignty of India. “There are many questions that remain unanswered of that incident and many explanations this government owes to our people,” Rahul Gandhi said in the post.The BJP did not react to Gandhi’s statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/waited-for-one-year-but-no-clarity-yet-on-galwan-clashes-sonia-101623782707285.html
16-06-2021||India||LJP family feud: Both factions claim party||The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) appeared headed for split on Tuesday after a faction headed by Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras removed his estranged nephew Chirag Paswan as party chief, prompting Paswan’s loyalists to respond by stripping five rebel parliamentarians of the party’s primary membership.The party, which has six MPs but no MLAs, plunged into a crisis late Sunday night after five lawmakers rebelled against Paswan’s leadership and chose Paras as the new leader of the parliamentary party. The MPs met Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla on Monday, and the Lok Sabha secretariat recognised Paras as the parliamentary party chief hours later.On Tuesday, the Paras faction held an emergency meeting of the party national working committee at his residence. The leaders removed Paswan, who held the post since November 2019, as national president, and elevated senior vice-president Suraj Singh as working president. The meeting also decided to allow Singh to convene the party’s national council within five days to a new president. Party leaders said Paras was likely to be named the new LJP chief.“Chirag lacks experience so we supported Paras. Chirag was unable to catch the pulse of Bihar’s politics and made a big mistake, for which he and the entire party had to bear the brunt. Our best wishes are with Chirag Paswan… there is no rift in LJP,” said Khagaria MP Mehboob Ali Kaiser, one of the rebel lawmakers. He was referring to Paswan’s decision during the Bihar polls last year to fight alone and target the Janata Dal (United) despite being together in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).Almost immediately, Paswan’s camp struck back. At a hurriedly called executive committee meeting held at Paswan’s house, all five rebel MPs were removed from the party.A letter issued on the letterhead of Paswan and party general secretary Abdul Khaliq, and signed by Khaliq, said the five lawmakers – Paras, Kaiser, Samastipur MP Prince Raj, Vaishali MP Veena Devi, and Nawada MP Chandan Singh -- were stripped of the party’s primary membership with immediate effect.“A national executive meeting was held in which leaders participated physically and through virtual mode and it was decided to remove all the five MPs from the party. There is a process of doing things in a party. This will be called a betrayal,” said LJP Bihar unit working chief Raju Tiwari.“Those who are protesting against Pashupati Kumar Paras are bad elements who entered the party after Ram Vilas Paswan’s death. They will be removed soon. I am not calling Chirag Paswan a bad element,” LJP leader Shravan Kumar told news agency ANI.Paras’ meeting was attended by more than a dozen LJP leaders, including all five MPs, besides national vice-president Suraj Singh.Paswan’s meeting, on the other hand, was attended by half a dozen leaders, including party general secretary, while some joined through virtual mode, according to Raju Tiwari, a party leader belonging to Paswan’s camp.Earlier in the day, Paswan, who represents Jamui in the Lok Sabha, tweeted an old letter written to Paras dated March 29, in which he urged his uncle to take the responsibility of keeping the party united.“I attempted to keep together my family and this party founded by my father but I was unsuccessful. The party is like our mother and shouldn’t be betrayed,” tweeted Paswan, 38, in Hindi. His late father, former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, founded the party in 2000.The family feud sparked dramatic scenes in the Capital on Monday after Paswan, who is recuperating from Covid, drove to Paras’s house but was made to wait outside the gate for about 15 minutes. After failing to meet his uncle, Paswan left a letter that offered a compromise formula of making his mother Reena Paswan the party president.The fight for control of the party – which commands significant loyalty among Dalits in Bihar – is likely to move to the Election Commission, which will decide which faction is the genuine party and can be awarded the LJP’s bungalow poll symbol. Supporters of Paswan and Paras clashed at the party office in Patna with supporters of Jamui MP smearing black ink on posters of five rebel MPs.Paswan assumed charge of the LJP after his father died weeks before the Bihar elections last year. But relations between Paras and Paswan nosedived when the LJP decided to contest against the BJP-JD(U) alliance and Paswan accused Kumar of misgovernance and corruption. During the campaign, Paras praised Kumar but was forced to retract his comment, an incident that led to a bitter face-off between the two.The LJP took in many JD(U) rebels and damaged Kumar’s party in at least 30 seats, almost costing the NDA a victory, and resulting in the JD(U) posting its worst result in 15 years and emerging as a junior partner to the BJP. The LJP also performed poorly, winning just one seat. In April, the lone party MLA, Raj Kumar Singh, joined the JD(U).Paras’s effusive praise of Kumar has triggered speculation that the JD(U) was backing the rebels. Before the rebellion on Sunday night, Paras met JD(U) MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh, a close associate of Kumar. Singh, assembly deputy speaker Maheswar Hazari and member of legislative council Sanjay Singh met the five LJP MPs on Monday. In Delhi, speculation swirled of a possible Union cabinet berth to one of the LJP rebels.Party leaders said that the LJP was headed for a split. “Now, it will break. LJP is going to witness a repeat of UP saga of Mulayam Singh Yadav-Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav,” said DM Diwakar, former director of AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies, referring to a family feud in the Samajwadi Party ahead of the 2017 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljpfamily-feud-both-factions-claim-party-101623782646686.html
16-06-2021||India||Right to protest is not a terror act: Delhi high court||The Delhi high court on Tuesday granted bail to three student activists arrested for allegedly instigating the February 2020 Delhi riots, terming the charges against them “stretched”, “verbiage”, and “hyperbole” and saying that the state may have, by going after the protestors, blurred the line between the “right to protest” and “terrorist activity”.Delhi Police is likely to challenge the order in the Supreme Court.A bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani held that the foundations of this nation stood on surer footing than those likely to be shaken by a protest, however vicious, organised by college students who operated from the confines of a university.In three separate but similarly worded orders, the court granted bail to Jawarharlal Nehru University (JNU) students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, and Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha, noting that the allegations against them do not show that they committed any crime under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).“We are constrained to say, that it appears, that in its anxiety to suppress dissent and in the morbid fear that matters may get out of hand, the State has blurred the line between the constitutionally guaranteed ‘right to protest’ and ‘terrorist activity’. If such blurring gains traction, democracy will be in peril,” said the bench in the judgment granting bail to Kalita.The bench commented that “ the right to protest is not outlawed and cannot be termed as a ‘terrorist act’ within the meaning of the UAPA”.The three are set to walk out of the prison after more than a year’s incarceration in connection to the riots case. Both Narwal and Kalita, members of NGO Pinjra Tod, were booked in three cases and were arrested May 29 last year for allegedly hatching a conspiracy along with the other co-accused to orchestrate the riots.Communal riots broke out in north east Delhi in February, 2020, leaving 53 people dead and over 400 injured. Over 750 FIRs were filed in connection to the riots and several people were arrested. In September 2020, the police filed its first charge sheet running into 17,500 pages charging 15 accused of allegedly hatching a conspiracy to orchestrate riots. The charge sheet was filed under various sections including rioting, unlawful assembly, conspiracy, sedition, promoting disharmony between religions and relevant sections of the Epidemic Act.The specific charges against the three in this case were that they orchestrated the blocking of roads in the area. Narwal and Kalita have already been granted bail in the two other cases, which accuse them of unlawful assembly and inciting the riots. Tanha, has already received bail in the other case where he is an accused; that alleges that he was part of a “premeditated conspiracy” to orchestrate the riots.However, they were not released on Tuesday for want of verification of sureties by the trial court judge. “They are not coming out today as judge wants to verify sureties for their bail. We have been asked to come again tomorrow,” a statement from activist group Pinjra Tod, of which Narwal and Kalita are members said on Tuesday evening.The Delhi Police have decided to challenge the high court order. “We are not satisfied with the interpretation of the provisions of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act by the Hon’ble High Court in a matter concerned with grant of Bail. We are proceeding with filing of a Special Leave Petition before the Honble Supreme Court of India said DCP Chinmoy Biswal, spokesperson, Delhi Police.The high court, in its orders, has criticised the invocation of the anti-terror law against the student activists by the Delhi Police. “We are afraid, that in our opinion, shorn of the superfluous verbiage, hyperbole and the stretched inferences drawn from them by the prosecuting agency, the factual allegations made against the appellant do not prima facie disclose the commission of any offence under sections 15, 17 and/or 18 of the UAPA,” read one of the orders. The sections relate to involvement in activities with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity, integrity, security or ­sovereignty of India or with intent to strike terror.Citing the Supreme Court’s take on protests in 2018, in the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan vs Union of India and Anrcase, the court said that uprisings against governmental and parliamentary actions are legitimate; and though such protests are expected to be peaceful and non-violent, it is not uncommon for protesters to push the limits permissible in law“Even if we assume for the sake of argument, without expressing any view thereon, that in the present case inflammatory speeches, chakkajams (blockades), instigation of women protesters and other actions…crossed the line of peaceful protests permissible under our Constitutional guarantee, that however would yet not amount to commission of a ‘terrorist act’ or a ‘conspiracy’ or an ‘act preparatory’ to the commission of a terrorist act as understood under the UAPA,” the bench added.The bench was emphatic that there was “absolutely nothing” showing the possible commission of a terrorist act; or an act of raising funds to commit a terrorist act; or an act of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act.“Allegations relating to inflammatory speeches, organising of chakka jaam, instigating women to protest and to stock-pile various articles and other similar allegations, in our view, at worst, are evidence that the appellant participated in organising protests, but we can discern no specific or particularised allegation, much less any material to bear out the allegation, that the appellant incited violence, what to talk of committing a terrorist act or a conspiracy or act preparatory to the commission of a terrorist act as understood in the UAPA,” it said.Cautioning against the frivolously invocation of the “extremely grave and serious penal provisions” under UAPA, the court added that such an approach “would undermine the intent and purpose of the Parliament in enacting a law that is meant to address threats to the very existence of our Nation”.“Wanton use of serious penal provisions would only trivialise them... Where the court finds that an act or omission is adequately addressed and dealt with by the ordinary penal law of the land, the court must not countenance a state agency crying wolf,” the bench added.The court also said that it would be “a stretch” to “say that the protest affected the community at large for it to qualify as an act of terror.”Citing the delay in trial caused by the coronavirus outbreak, the court pointed out that it was hardly likely that the trial will proceed, much less conclude anytime soon, particularly when there were as many as 740 prosecution witnesses.“Should this court then wait until the appellant has languished in prison for a long enough time to be able to see that it will be impossible to complete the deposition of 740 prosecution witnesses in any foreseeable future, especially in view of the prevailing pandemic when all proceedings in the trial are effectively stalled? Should this court wait till the appellant’s right to a speedy trial guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution is fully and completely negated, before it steps in and wakes up to such violation? We hardly think that would be the desirable course of action,” it noted while granting bail to the trio.Considering the educational background, profile and their positions in life, the court said, there is no reason to suspect or apprehend that the accused were either a flight risk or that they will tamper with the evidence, the court added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/right-to-protest-is-not-a-terror-act-hc-101623782346615.html
16-06-2021||India||Don’t be suspicious, China tells India on Galwan anniversary||India needs to stop being suspicious of China and work with Beijing to strengthen ties instead of working towards building obstacles, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday, a year after deadly clashes in the Galwan Valley and months after New Delhi said bilateral ties were “very significantly damaged” by Beijing’s violation of border agreements.The two countries can gradually improve bilateral ties and promote pragmatic cooperation by managing the border issue and preventing differences from escalating into disputes, the Chinese ministry said in a statement exclusively shared with Hindustan Times in context of the deadly June 15 clash, which left soldiers on both sides’ dead.New Delhi has repeatedly dismissed Beijing’s attempts to blame India for the ongoing border tension in eastern Ladakh, saying China’s People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) troops illegally trespassed across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) last year in May.India’s external affairs ministry has also spelt out the Indian government’s position on the disengagement process, saying the LAC “must be strictly respected and observed as this is the basis for peace and tranquility in the border areas”.China, the statement said, urges India to cherish the hard-won situation of easing in the border areas and abide by the relevant agreements and preliminary meetings between the two countries and the armed forces; India should work with China and take practical actions to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas, it added.The rare acknowledgment that there’s a need to “improve ties” by the Chinese foreign ministry is an indication of the state of the relationship, which is at its worst in decades.“Hereby, I would like to stress that the two sides should stick to the strategic consensus reached by the leaders of both countries, unswervingly follow the right track of mutual trust and cooperation between neighbouring countries without following the wrong track of suspicion and the negative and (taking) retrogressive steps,” the statement from the foreign ministry spokesperson’s office said.As two major emerging economies, India and China should work towards joint development, move forward side by side instead of containing each other, and develop through cooperation instead of building obstacles against each other.At present, the statement said, the India-China border situation is generally stable, and the two sides have maintained communication through diplomatic and military means to solve the remaining issues concerning the western part of the border.A year later, the disengagement of troops is still not complete despite 11 rounds of military and seven rounds of diplomatic talks – under the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs – having taken place.The ministry said India and China should not make the differences on the boundary dictate overall bilateral ties. “The boundary dispute between China and India is an objective reality, but the boundary issue is not the whole story of China-India relations. It should be placed in the proper place of bilateral relations and managed effectively so as to prevent differences from escalating into disputes,” the statement said.New Delhi has told Beijing that given the seriousness of the Galwan Valley incident, it cannot be business as usual – and the border dispute cannot be swept under the carpet.Commenting on the state of bilateral ties, a Shanghai-based expert on India said both countries need to take a long-term look at the relationship. “Cooperation among our two civilised countries is neither a one-time deal, nor a short-term activity. For this reason, we should take a long-term view and conduct sustainable cooperation. No matter what difficulties and setbacks we may encounter, we should constantly promote mutually beneficial cooperation,” Wang Dehua, a South Asia expert at Shanghai Municipal Centre for International Studies, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-be-suspicious-china-tells-india-on-galwan-anniversary-101623782166566.html
16-06-2021||India||Jagan govt makes English medium compulsory at undergraduate level||The Andhra Pradesh government on Tuesday announced the compulsory introduction of the English medium at all the undergraduate colleges in the state, doing away with Telugu as the medium of instruction with effect from the academic year 2021-22, as per an official state release.“It is essential that these students pursue their undergraduate courses in English medium. The transition from Telugu medium to English Medium would be easier at the graduation level,” the official release said, adding that it would also introduce spoken English courses at various levels in the undergraduate courses.In the release, the department of higher education said the decision to make English medium mandatory at all the government, private and government-aided degree colleges was taken at a recent meeting held by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.A notification issued by the Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education (APSCHE) said all private unaided and aided degrees colleges offering Telugu medium courses should submit proposals for conversion of all Telugu-medium courses into English medium between June 18 and 28.However, the colleges can continue to have Telugu as a language course in the curriculum, the notification said.It may be mentioned that the Jagan government planned to make English medium compulsory in all the government schools from the primary school level in the 2020-21 academic year itself, but the decision was struck down by the state high court in April 2020. The issue is now pending in the Supreme Court.According to the official release, the government strongly feels that the introduction of the English mode of teaching at the undergraduate level would enhance the career prospects of graduates.Out of over 2.62 lakh students who have taken admissions into degree colleges across the state, only 65,981 students are admitted into Telugu medium courses during 2020-21. Of them, 24,007 students opted for BA, 16,925 for B Com and 24,960 for B Sc courses.“Now, these students have to convert themselves into English medium, as it would benefit them immensely,” the department said.It said a majority of B Sc students would be looking for job opportunities in various parts of the country and also abroad. Similarly, a large number of BA and B Com graduates prefer getting into sales and marketing, apart from journalism and research.Commenting on the state government’s decision, Professor S Prasanna Sree, chairperson of the board of studies at Andhra University, Visakhapatnam, said it was a bold decision to make English medium compulsory at the undergraduate level.“It is essential to have higher education in English medium because it makes the students globally competitive. At the same time, the government should not ignore the native language of the students and promote it as one of the subjects,” she observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-govt-makes-english-medium-compulsory-at-undergraduate-level-101623768126169.html
16-06-2021||India||When IT city was hub of arms innovation||While Bengaluru is known as the tech city today, not many know that Karnataka’s capital also has strong links to an engineering marvel that changed modern warfare forever – the rocket.According to historians, rockets find their origin on the road alongside Jumma Masjid and Taramandalpet in Bengaluru – the hub of the rocket project of 18th century ruler of Mysore Tipu Sultan. Military inventions such as Tipu Sultan’s rockets and Bangalore Torpedoes by the Madras Sappers, an engineer group of the Corps of Engineers of the Indian Army, speak volumes of Bengaluru’s history in military inventions.Even though the use of rockets in combat was perfected in Tipu’s labs in Bengaluru, this history was long forgotten. One of the first to rediscover it was India’s former president Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, who himself was hailed as ‘Missile man of India’. During a trip to the States of America in the 1960s, a painting in the lobby of NASA’s sounding rocket facility caught Kalam’s attention. The painting depicted one of the earliest usages of rocket on a battlefield.Later, in his book ‘The Wings of Fire’, Kalam wrote in detail about what he saw. “The painting caught my eye because the soldiers on the side launching the rockets were not white but dark-skinned, with racial features found in South Asia. It turned out to be Tipu Sultan’s army fighting the British. The painting depicted a fact forgotten in Tipu’s own country but commemorated here on the other side of the planet,” he wrote.The army of Tipu Sultan was the first to weaponise rockets. The ruler had created a designated force of nearly 5,000-strong men to operate rockets. Even though the Chinese and Europeans tried to make rockets soon after the invention of gunpowder, but according to historians, since they used bamboo to make rockets, the prototypes were not effective, and they were soon replaced by canons.However, in the late 1700s when Tipu and his father Hyder Ali began experimenting with rockets, they made a major change by using iron tubes instead of bamboo. Over the years, the rocket-making unit in Taramandalpet experimented with several models, before they were deemed battle-ready.Many historians believe that Tipu’s rockets could cover a range of up to 2 km, mainly because of the introduction of high-quality iron. The metal tubes filled with gunpowder were closed on one end, and on the other end a nozzle was provided to propel the rocket using the gases it emitted – a concept used even today.Tipu Sultan’s forces used rockets with great effect in the four Anglo-Mysore Wars. One of the first mentions of the effective use of metal rockets was in the battle of Pollilur during the first Anglo-Mysore war in 1780. The advancing British East India Company forces were repelled by the Mysore army using several rounds of rocket fire. Several officers of the British army were taken prisoners following this defeat.More than the number of casualties, the rockets were instrumental in creating panic among the enemies. One of the enemy commanders who faced the wrath of the rocket barrage was Arthur Wellesley, the first Duke of Wellington who later became the hero of Waterloo. During the fourth Anglo-Mysore war, while Wellesley was on a reconnaissance mission near a grove in Sultanpet in Srirangapatn, Tipu’s forces launched about a dozen missiles at a time at his troops, using wheeled carts with three or more rocket ramps.The designs at the time were such that swords were also incorporated in the rockets, which served a dual purpose. “The swords acted as a guidance mechanism, providing the rocket with stability during the flight, and towards the end of the flight, the swords became a weapon. The rockets used to tumble after losing thrust as it came down towards its target, killing or severely injuring the soldiers who came under it,” says Col Rajeev R, a retired engineering officer with the Indian army and military history enthusiast.The British, who suffered heavy losses because of these rockets, were quick to learn and adopt them into their arsenal. These were used in the battle of Waterloo and in the Anglo-American war, eventually finding a mention in the Star-Spangled Banner.Another invention that put the city’s name on the world map was the Bangalore torpedo, whose design, historians believe, was so perfect that even more than 100 years after its development, armies across the world continue to use this weapon. “The Bangalore attack” was a strategy used extensively during the World War II, especially during the D-Day landings.Bangalore Torpedo is a weapon system developed by engineers of the Madras Sappers (now called Madras Engineering Group) located next to Bengaluru’s Ulsoor in the late1910s. The weapon is a series of metal tubes with explosives that are around five feet long and are connected together, meant to clear obstacles on a battlefield.During the World War II, allied soldiers faced with a wall of fire during beach landings were unable to move ahead because of the barbed wires installed across along the beach. It was here, they used Bangalore Torpedoes.The original design of the weapon was put together by an army officer from the Madras Sappers, RL McClintock, who was then a major. The records of the first development of the weapon are present in a modest museum in today’s Madras Engineering Group (MEG) next to Ulsoor Lake in Bengaluru. ‘Annual record of 2nd Queen Victoria’s Own Sappers and Miners for 1912-1913’, talks about the trials of a weapon that was supposed to aid in trench warfare.The development of the weapon began when the British army felt the need for a weapon that can help soldiers fighting in World War I to clear barbwires near enemy trenches. Major McClintock, who was superintendent of instruction at Madras Sappers here in Bengaluru, was given the task to come up with a solution. The designs were tested and perfected over a period of five years.As per the records, still preserved by MEG, the material cost of the first design was 9 rupees, 10 paise and 5 annas.According to Mondial Defence Systems Limited, which supplies modern-age Bangalore Torpedoes to the US army, the design of the ‘Bangalore’ has changed little since its inception. It still remains a steel pipe filled with available explosive (compound B, TNT, RDX/Wax and the likes). “The action of clamping the pipes together in this fashion ensures end-to-end carryover of the explosive train. Modern safety considerations have pushed suppliers of the Bangalore to incorporate ‘insensitive munition’ to ensure better safety,” read a statement from the firm.In the years that followed World War I, the Americans were impressed by the success of the Bangalore Torpedoes and adopted them. Even though the design is more than 100 years old, The Bangalore Torpedo still remains in service with the British, US, Indian, Chinese, Canadian and Pakistani armed forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-it-city-was-hub-of-arms-innovation-101623523291610.html
16-06-2021||Today's||Crafting an Indian exceptionalism in technology policy||In March this year, just over two months into his term, United States (US) president Joe Biden made two appointments that confirm the change in America’s position on Silicon Valley’s technology behemoths. He announced that he intended to appoint legal scholar Lina Khan and Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia University, to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the National Economic Council respectively.That same month, Wu was appointed adviser to the White House on competition policy. Three months later, on June 15, Biden fulfilled his promise by appointing the 32-year-old Khan as chair of FTC.Both these former academics have been vocal critics of the unbridled power of technology giants such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple. Wu’s 2010 book, The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires, chronicled how the internet centralised power in the hands of corporates and Khan’s 2017 paper Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox triggered a rethink on conventional notions of what antitrust is.Also Read | Joe Biden names big tech critic Lina Khan as FTC chairThe appointments of Khan and Wu carry forward a trend that began at the end of the Donald Trump administration’s tenure, namely a shift in American technology policy from a light-touch approach to a more interventionist one. The former sought to support innovation by following a non-interventionist line that relied on free-market principles to maintain equilibrium in the technology sector. The latter is more disruptive and seeks to use antitrust to the check the concentration in digital markets as a means to encourage competition and foster innovation.A recent suit filed by FTC and some US states against Facebook for the alleged abuse of its dominant position to thwart competition highlights America’s new interventionist streak. If FTC successfully proves that Facebook violated antitrust laws, the judge presiding over the case can break up the internet behemoth.America’s decision to follow a more interventionist line against big tech might seem like it is following Europe’s lead on technology governance. However, beneath the veneer of similarity lie crucial differences.The European Union (EU)’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), among the world’s toughest data protection laws, is an ex-ante regulation. One study found that the strict standards of the GDPR prompts firms to “abandon products or product ideas” that are inherently irreconcilable with the regulation. It further found that it discourages entrepreneurial activity. Moreover, the single greatest gripe of start-up founders with the GDPR is the enhanced power of data protection regulatory authority to intervene in their affairs and levy fines. This is in contrast to the US which doesn’t have a similar law.For its part, India might read the US’s new approach as a move to break big tech. The reality, however, is that America’s actions are guided by its own strategic self-interest, for two reasons.First, it is nudging these Silicon Valley giants to invest their ever-burgeoning cash reserves to enhance the country’s technology supremacy. Evidence of this lies in the Biden administration’s recent proposal to tax only the top 100 global companies with revenues of at least $20 billion rather than explicitly opposing any taxation on big tech companies. Also Read | US rolls out major bills to clip Big Tech’s wingsSecond, it would much rather initiate the break up of big tech on its own soil, on terms tacitly pre-negotiated with Silicon Valley, to promote its hard power in digital markets. After all, why should it hand over a key lever of global influence to another government?In such a scenario, India should craft its own exceptionalism that serves its economic interests. The centrepiece of the Indian approach should be to foster a competitive environment that enhances consumers’ rights, rather than rely on regulatory solutions to do the same.Less regulation for greater consumer welfare seems counterintuitive. However, recent trends indicate that the entry of new players that offer users services which are more rights-centric than dominant platforms, tends to place an effective check on any potential abuse of market position. For instance, according to a report by Fast Company, Facebook’s announcement regarding a change in WhatsApp’s privacy policy in 2021 prompted millions to use Signal, a privacy-centric messaging app that does not store user data on any servers. The shift was particularly significant in India where Signal had only 1.6 million installs prior to the announcement. That figure ballooned to 23 million soon after Facebook notified users about the potential change on WhatsApp.The upcoming digital rights frameworks in India appear heavy-handed, and may not foster a competition-led rights protection regime. They are also riddled with overlapping regulatory ambits and costly compliance standards. India should therefore, consider calibrating these to lay the foundation of a unique digital governance framework. Its building blocks could include incentives to encourage the growth of homegrown, consumer-friendly challengers to big tech, as well as revisiting proposals envisaged to create room for regulation-led innovation. If it takes these initial steps successfully, India will do what others have tried to but failed – craft a governance framework in which competition and users’ rights walk hand-in-hand, rather than on opposing sides.Vivan Sharan is a Partner and Aayush Soni is the Communications Lead at Koan Advisory Group, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/crafting-an-indian-exceptionalism-in-technology-policy-101623850873047.html
16-06-2021||Today's||Institutional reform is key to post-Covid-19 national recovery||The second wave of Covid-19 has exposed serious institutional infirmities in India — in access to health care, in the management of elections, and in the balance between the judiciary and the executive, where the latter’s failure has led the former to step in.India has one of the lowest ratios of population to health care infrastructure. It also invests inadequately in scientific research. Investments in genome sequencing, vaccine research, and preventive health care at the rural district level are key to staying ahead of the curve. Moving from a 1.2% to 3% budgetary allocation for health will be insufficient, especially in this fiscal year, as a large proportion of the funds will — hopefully and presumably — be utilised for the vaccination drive. This will leave marginal funds for capital expenditure towards expansion in medicine and vaccine research and operational costs for the enhanced infrastructure. The intensity of the pandemic has also meant that treatment for other serious illnesses is being postponed indefinitely. There is no substitute for greater investment.This inadequate infrastructure is coupled with a high degree of resistance to the idea of seeking treatment due to lack of awareness, financial implications and fear, especially in rural areas. It is, therefore, essential to develop decentralised schemes that create awareness and access at the district, village and ward levels — local civil society organisations, self-help groups and community initiatives are critical to the sound implementation of health policy on the ground. Centralised remote control policies seldom work in a country as diverse as India. All case studies of relatively successful Covid-19 management have a common thread of decentralisation. In preparing a larger national apparatus, the district level needs special focus.Public health is also an area that requires cooperative federalism — the Centre has a role and responsibility during a pandemic, and states have an obvious role given that health is a state subject. But citizens are losing their patience with blame games between the states and Centre, and, perhaps, the time has come to fix responsibility.One institutional reform is creating a nodal organisation which, only on the subject matter of health, plays a role bridging Centre-state rifts. To be sure, behind the media headlines, state and Union health officials have been in touch. But to prevent the pulls and pressures of politics, this organisation should be manned only by health care professionals and administrators. This does not negate democratic decision-making. Political inputs are crucial, but it does insulate decision-making from political tussles. All its decisions must be transparent, which will increase pressure on both the Centre and states to comply. The design of this institution will take greater deliberation — and will require a careful balancing act so that neither executive privilege nor constitutional principles are undermined.The Election Commission, endowed with “superintendence over conduct of elections” was subject to public criticism for its negligent role in the recent round of state elections, which spread the infection. An independent collegium or committee for appointments of commissioners will greatly help restore public confidence in this constitutional authority that is perceived to be amenable to political interference.We must remember that this pandemic is neither over, nor will it be the last one. It is the constitutional duty of Parliament to usher in a new era of legal reforms which creates a framework of dealing with pandemics, as well as the root causes of it, rather than leaving the country to rely on antiquated legislation.It is only through reforms and investment in India’s health infrastructure, internalising the principle of decentralisation, enabling greater Centre-state cooperation on public health disasters with a defined role for a national body of experts, ensuring that constitutional bodies are insulated from executive pressure, and creating a new legal framework that India will be able to respond effectively to one of the greatest crises our nation has ever faced.Avishkar Singhvi is an advocate in the Supreme Court of India The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/institutional-reform-is-key-to-post-covid-19-national-recovery-101623846670736.html
16-06-2021||Today's||The promise and perils of Artificial Intelligence partnerships||“A period that had been broadly described as engagement has come to an end,” Kurt Campbell, the Indo-Pacific Coordinator at the United States (US) National Security Council, told a virtual audience in May on the subject of US-China relations. “The dominant paradigm is going to be competition.”On several occasions, Campbell has highlighted that one of the major arenas of this competition will concern technology. This is increasingly reflected in US national security structures. Today, there is both a senior director and coordinator for technology and national security at the White House; the National Economic Council has briefed the Cabinet on supply chain resilience; and the focus of Department of Defense policy reviews have been on emerging military technologies.The subject of intensifying technology competition is also making its way into new US avenues for cooperation with partners, including with India. This could take the form of bilateral cooperation, coordination at multilateral institutions, or through loose coalitions such as Quad. At the virtual summit in March of Quad, the four leaders (of India, Japan, Australia and the US) agreed, among other things, to establish a working group on critical and emerging technologies, which has already convened.Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as one technology of particular importance because of its role as an accelerator, its versatility, and its wide applicability. Driven by recent breakthroughs in machine learning made possible by plentiful data, cheap computing power, and accessible algorithms, AI is a good bellwether for the possibilities and challenges of international cooperation on emerging technologies. It is also incredibly lucrative, and may generate hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue over the coming decade.There are some obvious areas of commonality and cooperation between India, the US, and other partners when it comes to AI. For example, there is a similar concern about developing AI in a broadly democratic setting. AI can be used in many positive ways — to foster innovation, increase efficiency, improve development, and enhance consumer experience. For India, AI deployment will be tied closely to inclusive growth and its development trajectory, with potentially positive implications for agriculture, health, and education, among other sectors.But AI can also be used for a host of undesirable purposes — generating misinformation, criminal activity, and encroaching upon personal privacy. Quad countries and others — including in Europe and North America — generally seek partners amenable to broadly upholding a responsible, human-centric approach to AI.Additionally, despite the nominally more nationalistic rhetoric (e.g. “Build Back Better”, “Atmanirbhar Bharat”), there is a fundamental recognition that international partnerships are valuable and necessary. AI development and deployment is inherently international in character.Basic and applied research involves collaborations across universities, research centres, and countries. Data can be gathered more easily, a lot of development relies on open-source information, and funding for AI start-ups is a global enterprise. There is also a recognition that countries can learn from each other’s experiences and mistakes, and that the successful deployment of AI would serve as a model for others. India, for example, is one of the few developing countries large enough to marshal considerable resources for AI, in a manner that could be replicated, including in South Asia or Africa.India and its partners also confront some similar challenges when it comes to the development and deployment of AI. One imperative involves nurturing, attracting, and retaining the requisite talent. According to Macro Polo’s Global AI Talent Tracker, 12% of elite AI researchers in the world received their undergraduate degrees from India, the most after the United States (35%) and more than China (10%). Yet, very little top-tier AI research is being conducted in India (over 90% is taking place in the United States, China, European Union, Canada, and the UK).Beyond talent, additional challenges lie in securing the necessary infrastructure; ensuring resilient supply chains, especially for components such as microprocessors; alignment on standards, governance, and procurement; and ensuring critical minerals and other raw materials required for the development of the necessary physical infrastructure.Given that various governments have only recently established AI policies, and in some cases are still formulating them, international cooperation is still very much a work in progress. More detailed efforts will be outlined in the coming months and years.Nevertheless, the contours of cooperation are already discernible. Some areas are proving relatively easy, such as coordination in the setting of standards at the multilateral level, which is already underway. Other areas will prove more challenging. Supply chain security and building resilience should theoretically be easier, given the political-level agreement on this issue. However, ensuring bureaucratic and regulatory harmonisation remains complicated. India and its partners may have the most trouble aligning their approaches to data – a particularly touchy subject at the moment – and, in the long-run, incentivising joint research and development.The future looks bright for organic cooperation on AI — the demand is there and India and its partners all hold relative strengths. But critical decisions made in the near future could have transformative effects for international cooperation on AI, which, in turn, could decisively shape the contours of what some have described as the Fourth Industrial Revolution.Dhruva Jaishankar is executive director, ORF America The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-promise-and-perils-of-ai-partnerships-101623837070390.html
