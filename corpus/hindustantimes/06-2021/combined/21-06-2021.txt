21-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra found 21 Delta Plus variant cases||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday confirmed that they have found 21 Delta Plus Covid-19 variant cases in the state. It was found in the genome-sequencing report conducted by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB). The report was recently submitted to the state health department.Of the 21 cases, two are in Mumbai and one in Thane. Nine cases are in Ratnagiri, seven in Jalgaon and one case each in Palghar and Sindhudurg.The Delta Plus, formed by mutation in the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, is currently a “variant of interest”, and hasn’t been classified as a “variant of concern” by the Union health ministry yet. Genome sequencing is an exercise to study changes in the structure of the virus over time.In April, the state government signed an MoU with CSIR-IGIB to sequence 100 positive samples from each of the state’s 36 districts per month. They have collected 7,500 samples.“Genome sequencing was conducted in the state to ascertain if the state has the Delta Plus variant. The report has found 21 Delta Plus. Taking this into consideration, the health department instructed to collect details of index cases such as if the patient was re-infected after 102 days; it was infected even after vaccination and their travel history etc.,” the health minister said.“We have decided to start contact tracing of high-risk and low-risk contacts of index cases and genome sequencing of all those found Covid-positive will also be done. We have directed to start surveillance for influenza-like Illness (ILI), severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in the affected areas. It is being done to ascertain the differentiating factor between Delta and Delta Plus variants and understand their virulence and transmissibility,” he added.Tope said they also wanted to know if variants are escaping the Covishield and Covaxin vaccine. For this, genome sequencing on a lot of samples need to be conducted which the health department is doing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-found-21-delta-plus-variant-cases-101624299457380.html

21-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: HSC students will have to wait for clarity on results||Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) students will have to wait a little longer for clarity on the status of their results, an official from the state education department told Hindustan Times. In a meeting held on Monday to discuss formula-based results for state board Class 12 students, it was decided to seek clarity from legal experts and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray before announcing a final decision. “While both the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council of Indian Secondary Certificate Examinations (CISCE) have announced their evaluation criteria, there have been challenges coming from several states against the formula-based results. We have decided to further study this before announcing something for our (HSC) students,” said a senior official from the state education department.Last week, the CBSE and CISCE boards submitted their decision on the evaluation criteria for Class 12 students to the Supreme Court.The approved mechanism for CBSE includes a 30:30:40 formula, which takes into account a student’s performance in the past three examinations (Class 12 pre-board, Class 11 finals, and Class 10 board) to settle at a score for the theory component of the examination that could not be held.The theory portion accounts for 70% or 80% of a subject score, with the remainder coming from internal practical tests that most schools managed to complete prior to the outbreak of the second wave of Covid-19. In the case of CISCE, the formula will take into consideration the students’ Class 10 ICSE Board exam results, project and practical work in subjects, and best marks obtained in school exams in Classes 11 and 12. “We have news from some states of parent groups challenging the CBSE evaluation formula, so announcing any decision before understanding the response of the stakeholders will be difficult,” said the state government official. He added that the government will release a decision on this subject soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-hsc-students-will-have-to-wait-for-clarity-on-results-101624299337276.html

Jadia said the district administration had set a target of vaccinating two lakh people during the day and set up 675 immunization centers where a total of 1,140 sessions of vaccinations were organised from 8 am to 9 pm. He said 1,200 health department employees administered jabs to people. Indore collector Manish Singh said the final figure of inoculation in the district could be between 2.25 lakh to 2.50 lakh during the day. "Many technical hurdles were also encountered while registering beneficiaries on the portal. However, with the help of experts and officers sitting in the control room the vaccination continued continuously," he said. Indore is the worst-affected district by the pandemic in Madhya Pradesh. As per the official figures, 1.52 lakh Covid-19 cases were reported in the district and 1,376 patients died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/indore-sets-national-record-with-over-200-000-people-receiving-covid-19-jabs-in-1-day-official-101624298853704.html
21-06-2021||Mumbai||MCZMA rap for Thane civic body over mangroves||The Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) has rapped the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) and district collector for inaction on complaints of mangrove destruction in Mouje Kopari village. In a strongly worded remark made during MCZMA’s last meeting on June 10 (the minutes of which were made public late last week), the authority expressed its displeasure at corporation and collector, warning them of punitive action. As per the minutes, TMC (in partnership with a private real estate venture) was alleged to have buried a number of mangrove trees in Kopari village under waste and debris, on plot bearing survey number 86 in land records, last year. The move, which violates both the Coastal Regulatory Zone notification and previous orders of the Bombay high court concerning mangrove conservation, was first flagged in August 2020 by Janshakti Bahuuddeshiya Sanstha, a non-profit operating across Maharashtra in the fields of environment and agriculture. The sanstha has since continued to draw attention to the recurring violations on three different occasions, writing to MCMZA in October, November and December last year. Taking note of these complaints, MCZMA itself wrote to TMC on at least five different occasions between September 2020 and January 2021, instructing the latter to take appropriate action in the matter and submit a formal report. The mangrove cell, which was also asked to look into the matter, deferred it to the district collector “as the land does not fall under protected notified mangrove forest”. “Despite repeated reminders and continuous follow-up with the offices of the district collector and TMC, no report is received from them... the authority expressed displeasure over the same. As last opportunity, the authority decided to direct the district coastal zone management authority and the TMC to submit the report immediately within one week, failing which necessary action would be initiated.” When contacted, Dr Vipin Sharma, commissioner, TMC, said he would have to look up details of the specific instance before providing a comment, and he would respond with details. The commissioner had not responded to HT’s request until late on Monday. Despite efforts, Rajesh Narvekar, Thane district collector, could not be reached for a comment on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mczma-rap-for-thane-civic-body-over-mangroves-101624299037437.html
21-06-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay’s donations up to ₹80cr in ’20-21||Annual donations collected by the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B) from corporate and alumni networks grew to ₹80 crore in 2020-21, from ₹20 crore in 2017-18. IIT-B, which has been recording an annual fund deficit to the tune of around ₹100 crore in its annual reports, recently ramped up its efforts to raise funds from alumni and industry networks to fund various infrastructure and research projects. In 2015, the institute set up a not-for-profit and charitable company registered under the section 8 of the Companies Act for raising donations. “In the recent past, to upscale the efforts towards building up alumni and corporate relations and fundraising in a systematic, dedicated and professional manner, akin to that in many foreign Universities, but customised to our needs and ecosystem, the Institute decided to start a separate Section 8 Company for this purpose. The company, named IITB Development & Relations Foundation, is now leading this effort as an arm of the institute,” said Prasanna M Mujumdar, deputy director (Finance & External Affairs) and professor in the department of aerospace engineering at IIT-B. The company is led by the Dean (alumni and corporate relations), supported by other functionaries, he added. “Over the years, the bond between IIT-B and its alumni has become very strong. The alumni want their alma mater to reach to the same pinnacle as they themselves have reached in their very successful careers. Their strong support, not just in terms of donations but also in mentorship and vision, has been of tremendous help in taking the institute to newer heights,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-B. The primary sources of income at the institute are from academic receipts such as tuition, examination fees, hostel rent, royalty and consultancy charges for research and development, and grants from the union Ministry of Education. While the Covid-19 pandemic affected the income of the institute, owing to minimum operations and maintenance on campus, the institute was able to manage with the reduced income, said Mujumdar. “As government orders on expenditure management were received right towards the beginning of the financial year, the budgets were adjusted, anticipating the naturally expected reduction in expenditure due to regulated functioning,” said Mujumdar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombays-donations-up-to-80cr-in-2021-101624299036741.html
21-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Four arrested for kidnapping, murdering 23-year-old driver||A month after a 23-year-old driver was allegedly kidnapped and murdered, the Mumbai Police’s crime branch has arrested three people from their hometown in Madhubani, Bihar, and a fourth accused from Karnataka.“The four were brought to Mumbai on Saturday on transit remand and a local court remanded them in police custody till Thursday,” said police inspector Ghanshyam Nair from unit 5 of the crime branch.The police have claimed that the main accused – Surendra Mandal, 30 – along with his associates – Shambhu Sadai, 30; Ram Kumar Sadai, 23; and Vijay Kumar Mistry, 50, allegedly abducted Rajesh Chaupal on May 13, suspecting that he was having an affair with Mandal’s wife in Bihar.The accused took the victim to a construction site at Fort where they worked and slit his throat and dumped Chaupal’s body in a water tank and filled it with 25-kg salt to ensure that the body did not stench, said Nair.“Chaupal is also from Mandal’s village and had been to his hometown last year due to the pandemic. He stayed around a year and was allegedly having an affair with Mandal’s wife. Mandal learnt about the affair and allegedly threatened to kill the victim,” said Nair.Chaupal came to Mumbai last month, and on May 13, Mandal asked him to meet near Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, after which he went missing. Chaupal’s father registered a missing person complaint when he did not return home, said Nair.During investigation, the crime branch learnt that the victim’s last location was near a construction site, where Mandal and the other accused were working. On probing further, they found out that the four had not reported to work at the construction site after May 14. The police suspected foul play and a team immediately rushed to Madhubani and arrested Mandal and the Sadai brothers, while another team arrested Mistry from Karnataka.“During interrogation, they confessed to the crime and the victim’s body was recovered from the water tank on May 20,” said Nair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-four-arrested-for-kidnapping-murdering-23-year-old-driver-101624298916677.html
21-06-2021||Kolkata||Bengal governor shown black flags by TMC, Gorkha group in Darjeeling||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who arrived at Darjeeling on Monday on a week-long visit, was shown black flags by supporters of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and its ally, the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (Bimal Gurung faction). The demonstrators also shouted ‘go back’ slogans at several locations. Raju Bista, BJP Lok Sabha MP from Darjeeling, said, “It is a black day for people of West Bengal. Those who are into politics for money showed black flags to the Governor at the behest of chief minister Mamata Banerjee and TMC leaders.”“The black flags were actually shown to the nation’s law and the Constitution,” Bista said.At loggerheads with the state administration over a host of issues, including alleged post-poll violence, Dhankhar broke his silence on Monday night and said in a tweet that the district magistrate and the superintendent of police (SP) of Darjeeling breached protocol during his visit.Without spilling any details, Dhankhar tweeted, “DMs & SPs-members @IASassociation @IPS_Association have consistently breached protocol on my visits in State. Called upon CS @MamataOfficial to direct Darjeeling DM and SP, who faulted, to see me today, which they did. Sought their response by tomorrow on protocol violation.”Dhankar was shown black flags while he was on his way to Darjeeling. The demonstrators gathered at Rohini Gate and Kurseong but did not attempt to stop the convoy. In Darjeeling, a group of GJM supporters led by Binita Roka shouted slogans. Shanta Chhetri, TMC Rajya Sabha member and a local leader, said, “The governor has come to Darjeeling only to do politics.”Referring to the decade-old demand for a separate of Gorkhaland, Roka said, “The governor should not visit Darjeeling as a tourist. He should find a permanent political solution to the problem.”Addressing the media at Bagdogra airport, Dhankhar said, “The magnitude of post-poll violence is the highest since Independence. This has created a serious situation and people are in trauma. It is unfortunate that even seven weeks after the polls ended the state government has not admitted that it is a big problem.”“There has been no rehabilitation and no confidence-building exercise. This is not democratic governance. I appeal to the government to see the writing on the wall. Confrontation with every constitutional body is most unfortunate,” the Governor said. In Kolkata, TMC Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said, “Publicity and television coverage is all the Governor is after. Having met Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi, he has to do something to remain in news. So, he decided to spend a week in north Bengal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-governor-shown-black-flags-by-tmc-gorkha-group-in-darjeeling-101624298857602.html
21-06-2021||Lucknow||Procure maximum wheat from farmers: Priyanka to UP CM||Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has demanded that all procurement centres in Uttar Pradesh should function till July 15, 2021 to guarantee purchase of wheat from all farmers in the state. In a letter sent to chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday, Priyanka said she was getting reports from different districts that only 30 to 50 quintal of wheat was being bought from a farmer at one time in the state. She said it was causing a lot of troubles to farmers and must be stopped immediately. She said arrangements for procurement of wheat should be made at all centres and maximum wheat be procured. Priyanka said wheat procurement though was started in the state on April 1, 2021 most of the procurement centres remained closed due to Covid-19. She said states like Punjab and Haryana procured 80 to 85% of the total wheat produced there whereas only 14 % of about 378 metric tonnes wheat produced has been procured in UP. She said the officers were not procuring wheat from the farmers apparently due to orders from their higher ups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/procure-maximum-wheat-from-farmers-priyanka-to-upcm-101624298741108.html

The shops will remain open till 7pm and parks will open from 6am till 12 noon. The duration of night curfew has been reduced further and it will now remain from 9pm till 5am,” said Kumar.Offices were earlier allowed to function till 5 pm with 50% attendance during Unlock 2, which was announced last week on June 16 while shops were allowed to be opened on alternate days till 6pm.On Monday, Bihar had less than 2,200 active Covid cases.Bihar imposed a hard lockdown on May 5, an order that was extended four times to contain a record rise in Covid-19 infections in the state, the last on June 2. The severe restrictions helped control the spread of the infection that paralysed the healthcare system and led to death of hundreds of patients while the state struggled to augment the number of beds, oxygen supply and essential medicines.The restrictions were eased in phases, first when shops were allowed to open from 6am-5pm on alternate days while the night curfew barred movement of people from 5pm till 6am. These restrictions were further eased on June 16, described by state officials as Unlock 2.“During the Unlock 3 period, parks and gardens have been allowed to open from 6am till 12 noon with proper Covid protocol while the duration of night curfew has been further reduced by an hour from 9pm till 5am,” additional chief secretary (home), Chaitanya Prasad.Prasad said the state government has allowed certain relaxations for weddings and last rites. “In both these functions, now 25 persons have been allowed while restaurants have also been allowed to provide take-away services in addition to home delivery. However, cinema halls, malls, swimming pools, clubs would continue to remain closed,” he said.The official said schools, colleges and coaching institutes will continue to remain closed and a decision on their opening will be taken at a later date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-offices-can-function-at-100-capacity-night-curfews-shorter-nitish-kumar-101624298738081.html

However, IMD said that some areas may see patchy rains. As the monsoon is likely to arrive around its normal time, the maximum temperature is likely to increase by 4°C and will hover around 38°C for the next three days, said an IMD official. On Monday, IMD recorded maximum and minimum temperatures for Noida at 34°C and 25.7°C against 34°C and 25.5°C on Sunday. At the Safdarjung monitoring station, considered average for the National Capital Region, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 37.4°C and 25.3°C, respectively.“The region will see steep rise in daytime mercury from Tuesday onwards. The major reason of the sudden dry weather is that the thunderstorm activities leading to patchy rains around NCR and western UP are likely to subside for the next few days. The dry westerly winds will weaken the monsoon flow over the region. The mercury is likely to soar till June 25 when the region may see strong winds and thunderstorm activities. The southwest monsoon is likely to be ready around its normal time on June 27,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet, a private weather forecasting agency.Meanwhile, the air quality of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad were well under ‘good’ level on Monday.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Monday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 70 against 52 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 65 against 33 a day earlier, while Ghaziabad recorded an AQI of 92 against 46 a day earlier. An AQI level up to 100 is considered ‘good’, between 101 and 200 is ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is ‘very poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/mercury-to-soar-in-noida-over-next-three-days-imd-101624298617293.html
21-06-2021||Noida||Yamuna pollution: Artificial wetland to naturally treat Kondli drain to be ready by November||Noida: The Uttar Pradesh irrigation department has started work on the creation of a wetland to naturally clean stinking murky water of Kondli drain, a major source contributing to the pollution of river Yamuna. About 500 metres in length, the wetland is being built between sectors 51 and 52 and will be ready by November this year, officials said on Monday.The Noida authority, which is financing and monitoring the project, said that six more such wetlands will be created at different locations. “The wetland is being built where the drain is the widest. The estimated cost of the first wetland is ₹7 crore, and all seven may cost around ₹42 crore. The first wetland is likely to be ready by November,” said RP Singh, deputy general manager (waters), Noida authority.In February last year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had ordered in-situ treatment of the Kondli drain jointly by the UP irrigation department and the Noida authority, in consultation with Delhi University professor emeritus CR Babu. In continuation to the NGT order, the authority had proposed to create six wetlands at different sites of the drain that cuts Noida into two parts and finally merges with the Yamuna at Sector 168.“The drain was originally intended as a flood water drain that would also help with irrigation. As the city grew, the drain was fed with untreated sewage. We hope that the artificial wetland will work by decreasing the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels and increasing the dissolved oxygen in the drain water,” said VK Singh, assistant engineer, UP irrigation department.According to Prof CR Babu, the wetland being built is unique as it aims in-situ remediation of effluents. “We have successfully treated sewage using the wetlands at a Delhi biodiversity park and elsewhere. For Kondli, it’s for the first time the wetland is being built over or on the site of the drain, thus it will lead to in-situ remediation of the effluent. It will be 100% successful in treating even the industrial effluents. However, we will need all seven wetlands to completely clean the drain,” said Babu.An engineered wetland used to treat the sewage using natural resources including flora and fauna, Babu explained that the wetland will incorporate 25 to 30 species of plants, layers of stones and boulders and two zones. The first zone is for oxidation, where microbes will decompose pollutants and benthic fauna such as snails will eat coliform or bacterial pollutant, while the second zone will be the physical filter zone where stones will provide turbulence and increase oxygen levels, he said.Various studies, conducted over the years, have identified the sewage in Kondli drain to be the main cause of pollution in the Yamuna. According to a Central Pollution Control Board report, about 64 MLD untreated sewage in Noida flows through the Kondli drain into the Yamuna.The 40-year-old and 20km long Kondli drain originates from Kondli village in Delhi and enters Noida (via Ghaziabad) near Hari Darshan police post in Sector 11. After travelling through Noida sectors 11, 12, 22, 50, and 92 for about 17km, the drain empties into the Yamuna near Chak Mangrola in Sector 168.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/yamuna-pollution-artificial-wetland-to-naturally-treat-kondli-drain-to-be-ready-by-november-101624298616699.html

Individuals, residential bodies, institutions, etc participated in the day via small camps, at home or in virtual workshops.“Practice of yoga, especially pranayama, is good for a healthy lifestyle. I defeated Covid-19 after fighting for nearly 15 days. However, I kept facing issues like fatigue, shortness of breath, etc. I was advised post-Covid care and since then have been practicing yoga regularly. Now I have recovered almost completely and I urge people to engage in these activities for a healthier life,” said KK Jain, secretary general, federation of Noida residents’ welfare associations.Officials from the district administration, the police department, etc also participated in various yoga camps across the city.“Senior officials participated in a yoga camp at the police lines on Monday morning, following all necessary Covid guidelines. They have urged all personnel to incorporate the practice in their daily lives for better health,” said a police spokesperson. “Over 23,000 students joined in from all across the country to celebrate the international Yoga Day and World Music Day through a live virtual workshop, which was aired from our Noida studio. Conducting the workshop virtually seemed most appropriate keeping in mind the pandemic. The idea was to promote the activity with children in an interactive manner,” said a spokesperson for Routes2roots, a cultural exchange-based NGO. Meanwhile, a group of bicyclists in the city said they rode for 50 kilometres on Monday morning to promote exercising among the youth. “We started from Sector 34 and went via Sector 61 to the elevated road on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway before coming back. Any form of exercise helps with both mental and physical health, whether it is yoga or bicycling. They are good forms of stress relief as well, especially for the youth,” said Dharmendra Sharma, president, sector 34, RWA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-residents-hold-virtual-sessions-small-camps-on-yoga-day-101624298556701.html
21-06-2021||Noida||Noida shuts nine oxygen counters||NOIDA: As the number of active Covid-19 cases decrease in the Gautam Budh Nagar district subsequently bringing down the demand for medical oxygen, the Noida authority has closed nine of its oxygen counters and decided to supply oxygen cylinders from only one cylinder refilling facility, located in Sector 93B.“As the demand for oxygen has come down to a large extent for the past many days at all centres, the authority has decided to provide medical oxygen service only from the Sector 93B community centre from Monday. Those who need oxygen can avail the service from there,” said Mukesh Vaish, project engineer of the authority.From May 3 to June 19, the authority provided 1,859 oxygen cylinders and 93 oxygen concentrators from its 10 facilities.The authority provides D-type oxygen cylinders of two different capacities – 40 litre and five litre -- for ₹500 and ₹200, respectively.The authority started supplying oxygen cylinders on May 3 from its two counters set up at community centres in sectors 93B and 135, amid shortage of medical oxygen in the city during the second wave of the pandemic.On May 11, the authority decentralised the process and started refilling empty cylinders at eight more locations in the city, said officials. On May 16, it also started home delivery of cylinders.“There is no demand for cylinders for home delivery and hardly anyone is turning up these days at the facilities for oxygen. However, we have kept one centre open so that anyone in urgent need can avail of the service,” said Vaish.As of Monday, there were 121 active Covid-19 cases in the district and in the last 24 hours, as per the state health bulletin, while 17 new cases were reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-shuts-nine-oxygen-counters-101624298497945.html
21-06-2021||Noida||Noida: Markets, malls see decent footfall as curbs eased||Several markets and malls in the city saw brisk business on Monday when night curfew timings were further relaxed to 9pm till 7am the next day.The latest unlock guidelines have extended timings of restaurants too, while keeping the weekend curfew in place. Malls and restaurants were required to keep the footfall at 50% capacity. They had been shut for almost two months due to the second wave of Covid-19 infections.“Today saw an increase in the customer turnout as more establishments and restaurants opened. We expect the footfall to rise 25-30% more than what we saw in the last two weeks. Businesses have suffered major losses in the last 14 months which will hopefully start improving soon,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, president, sector 18 market association.Logix Mall’s vice president of operations Amit Taneja too had a similar view although he hoped there would be further relaxations soon.“By the afternoon we had seen several customers at the mall. The numbers will go up as the days progress. However, the weekend restrictions and nighttime guidelines is not very conducive to business. For a 9pm closing time, we need to start herding crowds out by 8pm. To sustain our operations, we need some more relaxations with timings,” said Taneja.It would still take some time till all businesses in the district opened.“Most of my staff had gone home during the lockdown. It will still take me a couple of days to reorganise everything with my suppliers and employees before I can start the dine-in here. As it is, not many people are expected to come out. Most of them are content with online orders,” said Shubham, an eatery owner in sector 76.Many shoppers in the Sector 18 market on Monday were those for whom online services are not an option.“My sister is getting married in July and we needed to do some last-minute jewellery shopping. Somehow, we have managed to do most of it through known contacts during the last one month because this is something that we are not very comfortable doing online. Plus, it seemed like a good time to come out as not many people are roaming in markets right now both because of the pandemic and the weather,” said Ruby Chawla, a customer.“In the past year, I have become used to a different kind of lifestyle where going out happens only in very necessary cases. There might be a drop in the number of Covid-19 cases, but we are still not going to risk it. All of our needs can be taken care of online so there is no reason for us to go to malls for shopping or even dining,” said Ritika Singh, a resident of sector 75.Meanwhile, police are urging people to follow all requisite guidelines.“No undue incidents of violations occurred during the day and our teams will be out to ensure that the night curfew is enforced,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Rajesh S.During the weekend lockdown, police prosecuted 4,699 people for not wearing masks and spitting in public and collected ₹4.75 lakh in fines. Similarly, over ₹1 lakh was collected in fines from nearly 1,983 vehicles. Over 130 people were booked for not following Covid-19 protocols and 110 registered cases across the district in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-markets-malls-see-decent-footfall-as-curbs-eased-101624298436759.html

But inculcating honesty in all those disreputable jewellers who have thrived on unethical practices all these years, is not going to be an easy task.In fact in the last several years, as consumer demand for hallmarked jewellery slowly picked up, many dishonest jewellers have been found to use fake BIS marks to fool consumers. Press releases issued by the BIS following raids on such jewellers bear testimony to this.In one such case that came up before the Madhya Pradesh High Court , the jeweller was forced to forfeit all pieces of jewellery with fake hallmarking and also pay a fine of ₹45,000.(BIS, Bhopal Vs D.P.Jewellers, April 5, 2019)That case was decided under the old BIS Act. Today, under the new BIS Act of 2016, such offences invite stiff financial penalties and even jail term of one to two years and it is extremely important to mete out the toughest penalty provided under the Act and instil the fear of the law in these jewellers. Now mandatory hallmarking brings the added responsibility on the BIS to not only nab those who fail to comply with compulsory hallmarking or use spurious markings, but also those assaying and hallmarking centres that indulge in corrupt and dishonest practices. In February this year, BIS officials raided a fake hallmarking centre in Jammu, but there have also been instances of BIS recognized assaying centres issuing the hallmark of purity without even testing the gold.After a study initiated by the consumer affairs ministry threw light on some of these malpractices, the BIS introduced several new measures, including a software for real time monitoring of the activities of the centres, so as to prevent fake and fraudulent markings. All in all it’s a tough call to ensure the integrity of the entire hallmarking system, but consumer protection demands that the BIS accomplish this. Besides, on the success of the first phase rests the mandatory scheme in the remaining districts.It was in the summer of 2000 that the BIS first brought gold jewellery under hallmarking under a voluntary scheme. As can be expected, the response from the jewellers was lukewarm. By November that year only 149 jewellers had taken the license from the BIS . Even these had only a few pieces of hallmarked jewellery because of lack of consumer demand . A market survey of non-hallmarked jewellery undertaken a year later by the BIS along with consumer activists in eight cities, showed that a whopping 88 per cent of jewellers cheated on caratage. This raised the demand for mandatory hallmarkingHowever, an expert committee constituted by the ministry in 2003 , said while mandatory hallmarking was necessary to protect consumer interest, it can only be done after building the required infrastructure, , the most important being assaying and hallmarking centres- covering all the districts in the country. The ministry has since been making efforts , including through several incentives, to increase the number of testing centres.Thus from 12 hallmarking centres in February 2002, today their numbers have swelled to 943. Yet, a large number of districts and even some of the states do not have even one assaying centre. This has forced the government to introduce mandatory hallmarking in a phased manner, covering only 256 districts that have hallmarking centres.From just 265 in 2002, today 39,000 jewellers have taken the license from BIS for getting their jewellery hallmarked through BIS recognized assaying and hallmarking centres. Rough estimates put the total number of jewellers in the country at about two to four lakhs. At present, government has exempted from the mandatory scheme, jewellers whose annual turnover is less than ₹40 lakh. However, such small outlets cater mostly to the poor and the rural consumers and it is imperative that these too be brought under mandatory hallmarking at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hallmark-on-gold-jewellery-mandatory-but-checking-cheating-by-sellers-to-remain-a-challenge-101624298378011.html

21-06-2021||Noida||Trial run of near-to-home vaccination begins in Noida, Ghaziabad||For 52-year-old Randhir Nagar of Birondi Chakrasenpur village in Dadri block, Monday was a day of celebration. After a long wait he finally got his first shot of vaccination against Covid-19.“Right from the day when my son, daughter-in-law and grandchildren got infected in the second week of March, I had been waiting for this day. Today, I finally got the jab with my wife and children. My fear has suddenly disappeared now,” he said.Forty-eight-year-old Murari Kishan of Bhagwantpur Chhatanga village in Jewar block, said that for the last 45 days, all the attempts of most of the villagers, to get the vaccination was futile. “Even today, we waited to book our slots till 3 pm. Suddenly, someone came and told us to reach the vaccination booth near our home. Had the administration or health department cleared our confusion on time, probably all my 200-odd villagers – eligible for vaccines could have been inoculated today. But due to confusion, only 62 of us could get our first shots,” he said.This seemed to be the major drawback of Monday’s trial run of the “near-to-home” vaccination drive in Jewar and Dadri blocks in the Gautam Budh Nagar district.District magistrate Suhas LY admitted as much saying that the turnout in Jewar block was only 22%. “It appears that the villagers were not informed properly about the drive. I’ve asked the health department officials to look into the shortcomings. It was better in Dadri where we vaccinated 2,700 people out of a target of 3,000,” he said.The vaccination required no prior-booking and was a precursor to the July 1 mass vaccination drive when all districts of Uttar Pradesh would have to target 1 million vaccinations.GB Nagar chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri, said, “The trial run will continue in both these blocks till June 30. I hope from Tuesday, we’ll have good numbers.”District immunisation officer, Dr Neeraj Tyagi said that altogether 18,958 persons got their different vaccine doses at 120 vaccination sites in the district, including 77 at government health centres. “Till the date, total vaccination doses given in the district are 1,019,694. Out of it, while 9,00833 have taken their first dose, 118,861 have taken both doses,” he said.GhaziabadIn Ghaziabad, the cluster vaccination drive for all adults resulted in the highest daily number of 28,001 doses at two blocks, surpassing the target of 20,000.A major share of 10053 (35.9%) doses administered at six Covid vaccination centres (CVCs), including five in urban segments, in the clusters of Indirapuram urban centres and Bhojpur rural centres. Together, there were XXX CVCs.The cluster at Kailash Mansarovar Bhawan administered the most doses (4272) , followed by Maharajpur and Bhojpur (1,930), Vasundhara (909), Adarsh Nagar (Khoda) (819), and Sadik Nagar (748).“Earlier, I had tried several times to book the slots online, but I could not. This time, I got the vaccine easily,” said Nimit Tyagi, a beneficiary at Bhovapur centre under Maharajpur CVC. “However, I feel that turnout at these centres could be more if proper awareness is spread among people and prior information is provided.”Some beneficiaries faced issues as staff at Makanpur was not familiar with the registration process.“I got myself, my wife and my sister vaccination at the centre on Monday morning and when I checked if I could get my mother vaccinated as well, the staff said that she will have to go to a camp meant for 45+ age group category. However, when other staff arrived, they got the issue resolved and finally I took my mother to the centre for vaccination,” said Kishan Singh, another beneficiary at the centre.Under the cluster vaccination drive from June 21 to June 30, specific areas in urban and rural segments have been identified. Teams from the health department have been assigned a cluster, having several residential wards or villages, which they will try and fully saturate with vaccination to the local population.Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr N K Gupta said that CVC staff will be briefed about the age criteria. “We will also seek help from local councillors and RWAs and this will help us achieve better vaccination per day,” he said.According to the Cowin portal, the state of UP till Monday night achieved vaccination of 26304025 beneficiaries and this included 690552 doses administered on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/trial-run-of-near-to-home-vaccination-begins-in-noida-ghaziabad-101624298136701.html

While evaluation of students on the basis of the results of Class 11 and an internal assessment for Class 12, was discussed, implementing a formula taken by the CBSE board of evaluation was not considered. “The common discussion point was not to implement the CBSE board evaluation formula as it is for the state board students. Rather, take the class 11 marks and internal assessment marks for the class 12 while declaring the results,” said Gaikwad. Due to the increase in Covid cases in the state, the class 12 board exams were cancelled this year by the state government. The assessment will affect 1,317,000 students of Class 12. Earlier the CBSE board announced evaluation of their students on the basis of marks obtained in Class 10, 11 and 12, together, for the Class 12 results. Dhananjay Kulkarni, an education expert and who had filed a PIL in the Bombay High Court about conducting the Class 10 exams, said, “The state government should not go along with the CBSE formula. Either giving 50 per cent weightage to CET exam for admissions or entire 100 per cent marks of CET exam should be taken into consideration. When the Covid situation normalises, the exams should be conducted for the further admission processes.”Students and parents are worried about the evaluation process for Class 12. Mahesh Kirani a parent of a Class 12 student said, “My daughter wants to take admission for MBBS and she is worried about the evaluation process which will decide her future. The state government should take the decision as early as possible, because lakhs of students are waiting for the results and depending on that their further admissions are going to happen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/education-minister-meets-with-experts-colleges-to-discuss-hsc-evaluation-cbse-formula-not-on-the-table-101624298076735.html

The centre currently has 43 active patients who are likely to be discharged within a week’s time. The jumbo facility is the largest government Covid-19 centre in the district with a capacity of 800 oxygenated and ICU beds. The centre, however, never operated at capacity.Dr Shreyansh Kapale, director of Medbros, the company running the centre, said, “We will shut down services soon. We had stopped admitting new Covid19 patients a week ago and those admitted will be discharged after treatment, which should be this week. After the first wave too, we had stopped admission after the number of new cases dropped. The centre was then shut down.”The decision on whether to maintain the structure or demolish it, will be taken by the PMC. Additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “Regarding the structure, we will take a call after a structural audit. As of now, the current audit is valid till July 15. Once all the patients are discharged we will take a call.” As of June 20, the hospital had seen 3,000 admissions since its inauguration in August. Of these, 43 were active Covid-19 patients.

A total of 7,729 litres per minute (LPM) of oxygen is currently generated from the 15 existing plants. With the proposed 39 plants that figure will go up to 26, 243 LPM.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said, “All the district administrations in the state should be prepared for the anticipated third wave. Planning should be done to measure the required amount of health facilities, medicine, and oxygen storage. Every district should prepare to produce 3,000 metric tonnes of oxygen every day. The proposed oxygen plants should be completed by the end of July.”“In the anticipated third wave, we cannot predict which state will have how many patients. So it is better to be self-dependent for oxygen. Whichever district is noticing a surge in patients, oxygen storage should be increased at such places. Administration should also focus on increasing oxygen assembled ambulances,” Thackeray added.The decision was taken to increase oxygen storage after the second wave, where major hospitals in district suffered shortages of oxygen supply.“The administration has taken the decision to increase the oxygen storage in the district to avoid situations like the second wave. Currently, the demand for oxygen has gone down. The decision to increase oxygen storage before the anticipated third wave is taken to strengthen the health infrastructure,” said Rajesh Deshmukh, Pune district collector.Within the PMC limit the work of installing five oxygen plants is done, while eight more will be added in coming days.“Quote of Rubal Agarwal after 8:30pm” said Rubal Agarwal, additional commissioner, PMC.“Having enough storage is always beneficial. During the second wave we had to import oxygen from Raigad. Such a situation can be avoided if need arises in anticipated third wave,” said Suresh Patil, joint commissioner, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune division.In PCMC, the work of installing an oxygen plant in Bhosari is under process.PCMC has approved the acquisition of a 465 square metre area for a new Bhosari hospital.The PCMC will pay a total of ₹80,39,850 to the owner at the rate of Rs13,000 per square metre.

21-06-2021||Noida||Found abandoned during Covid-19, Noida’s ‘Nari Niketan’ reports highest admissions in April-May||Between April and May, when the second wave of Covid infections ravaged the country, Gautam Budh Nagar’s only women’s shelter - Nari Niketan - in Sector 34 got 10 new inmates, which officials say is a record for a two-month period. Overall last year, there were 18 admissions.The shelter houses those who are brought in by the police. These are usually those who are mentally challenged and abandoned by their families or fled from their homes due to some distress, said officials. From January to March this year, there had been seven admissions.The shelter’s superintendent Deepika Patel, said, “The shelter is housing 158 inmates against the maximum capacity of 150.” Last year, only one person was admitted in April and May, she added. “The 10 in the last two months is some sort of new record.”Atul Soni, the district probationary officer, too agrees with Patel. “We have never seen as many women being brought to the centre as much we saw between April and May this year. Usually it is one or two,” he said. The shelter home has been admitting inmates since 2018 and often housed women who were transferred from other districts. In fact, of the 158 in the house currently, 50 were from Bareilly and Vrindavan.“Before each admission, medical tests, including for Covid-19 and pregnancy, are mandatory so that the lives of other inmates are not at risk,” said Patel. Patel added that the shelter home also homes children. “One is the child of an inmate, while the other six are girls. We do not know their history,” he said.The sudden spike in admissions and the months when Covid’s second wave was at its peak in GB Nagar, was no coincidence, according to women’s rights activists. Mala Bhandari of Social And Development Research & Action Group (SADRAG) said, “It is safe to assume that under the garb of Covid-19 reactionary abuse, women are being deserted. Abandonment is also another kind of abuse or violence against women”. Earlier HT had reported that 813 such domestic violence cases were reported in April and May this year in the district, according to data from the 112 emergency number. “It is possible that these women may have lost their families during the second wave of Covid and wandered from their homes in shock,” said Patel. “Another possibility is also of abuse because we have often seen that when we try to reunite a mentally challenged woman with her parents or husband, they refuse to taking her back. There have been numerous cases when domestic violence at the hands of the husband have also led the women to run away from their homes.”As per Dr Ritu Gautam, Family Dispute Resolution Clinic coordinator who conducts counselling for cases of violence against women, the background of the women is needed in order to ascertain a reason for the spike. However, she added, “Usually women end up in such a situation when they are highly dependent on their father or spouse and suddenly lose that support. This could be due to their death or could be due to dispute.” Deputy commissioner of police (Women’s Safety, GB Nagar) Vrinda Shukla said that these women are found in a state of shock, distress and trauma by the police officials.“While some of the women are reported by residents of the district to the police on Dial 112, some are found by the police on patrol. When police officials ask them about their whereabouts, they are unable to give any answer and require special counselling. Hence, they are sent to the Nari Niketan at Sector 34,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/found-abandoned-during-covid-19-noida-s-nari-niketan-reports-highest-admissions-in-aprilmay-101624296216612.html

This will be the authority’s first property e-auction this year.Officials of the HSVP, formerly known as Haryana Urban Development Authority, said that around 100 residential and 100 commercial plots of various sizes spread across Gurugram, Dharuhera, and Rewari will be auctioned to the highest bidders. The authority is expecting to earn around ₹200 crore from the auction, while similar auctions are also on the anvil for Faridabad, Hisar, Rohtak, and Panchkula.Jitender Yadav, administrator, HSVP, Gurugram, said that interested buyers can check the details of the properties put on auction on the authority’s website, at the time of registration. “We have carried out due diligence on these properties in different sectors. We got a positive response to the auction in 2020. Properties worth over ₹150 crore were sold. The plots being offered to the people are at good locations, and will certainly generate a premium for the HSVP... Given the portfolio of properties on offer, it is likely that many would bid for the plots this year,” Yadav said.Apart from Gurugram, the auction would be held for HSVP plots in Faridabad on July 2, Hisar plots on July 1, Rohtak plots on June 25, and Panchkula plots on June 23, according to Yadav.The HSVP had sold 100 commercial and residential properties in Gurugram, Dharuhera, and Rewari worth ₹165 crore during the mega property auction in October 2020. The authority had sold maximum properties from Sector 1 to Sector 57, worth ₹135 crore. Officials, however, admitted that more than 200 properties were on auction, but had managed to sell 102 properties due to the slowdown amidst the coronavirus pandemic.The authority suffered a major setback in 2020, after Punjab and Haryana High Court ordered a stay on sale and e-auction of property sites after an applicant filed a petition saying that several cases of plot reallotment and alternatives to be provided by the HSVP had been pending for several years. Later, the HSVP managed to get the stay order vacated and resume the real estate auction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hsvp-to-auction-over-200-properties-on-july-8-aims-to-raise-200-crore-101624295437232.html

Beneficiaries started reaching government health centres from 4am. “Our employers directed us to get vaccinated at the earliest, otherwise, they won’t allow us to work,” said Preeti, who lives in the slum behind Tau Devi Lal Botanical Garden and works as a domestic helper. She reached the Waziarabad health centre with her neighbours around 4am to get tokens for vaccination. Karobi, who works as a domestic help in Sushant Lok, said she reached the Chanderlok health centre at 8am to get vaccinated and took the day off from work. “It is not possible to take an off every day and stand in a vaccination queue. The employer asked us to get vaccinated before June 25. Otherwise they won’t allow us to resume work. Our work has already been affected due to lockdown,” said Karobi. Many beneficiaries said that despite several attempts to get vaccinated, they could not get the vaccine shot before Monday. Raju Singh, of West Bengal, who works as a driver, said, “For the last four to five days, I have been visiting health centres but by the time we reached, all tokens were distributed.” Dr MP Singh, the district immunisation officer, said, “No one can be left behind in the Covid-19 vaccination coverage. The target was to reach out to them in large numbers.

Officials also said that one or two spells of rainfall or thundershowers are expected on Thursday and Friday.Despite a rain prediction, according to the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum temperature may remain around 38°C to 39°C and the minimum temperature may remain around 28°C over the next four days.The maximum temperature is likely to reach 40°C by the weekend, as per the weekly forecast.“Advancement of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, and Punjab will be slow as largescale features and forecast wind patterns by the numerical weather prediction do not indicate any favourable condition for rainfall over the region during the period,” said the IMD.On Monday, Gurugram recorded a maximum temperature of 38.2°C and a minimum temperature of 25.9°C, both of which were 1° C below the normal. The district also recorded 64% humidity in the evening.Last week, the IMD had predicted that Gurugram would receive pre-monsoon showers over the weekend, but there was no rainfall.Meanwhile, the air quality index (AQI) of the district was recorded at 74 on Monday, a slight dip from the reading of 64 on Sunday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) bulletin. The air quality in Gurugram has been in the satisfactory category for the past two days, it said.According to the Air Quality Early Warning System (AQEWS) for Delhi on Monday, the AQI in Delhi-NCR is likely to remain between satisfactory and moderate categories due to the presence of surface winds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/premonsoon-showers-in-gurugram-delayed-101624295379851.html
21-06-2021||Gurugram||300,000 saplings to be planted by Gurugram civic body this monsoon||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is targeting to plant 300,000 saplings, comprising 100,000 trees and 200,000 shrubs, this monsoon, according to a release issued by the civic body on Monday.Officials said that at least 10,000 peepal (sacred fig) and banyan trees, each, will be planted, as part of the exercise. The information was shared by MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja during a meeting with councillors at the PWD rest house.“At present, the main objective of the MCG is to make adequate arrangements for the drainage of rainwater and increase the city’s green cover through planting saplings. A target of planting three lakh (300,000) saplings has been set by the MCG this monsoon. MCG has prepared a list of identified areas for the plantation and during today’s meeting councillors were asked to cooperate and identify more such places in their respective wards,” said Ahuja.Only 9.2% of Gurugram’s total geographical area is under forest cover, a decline from 9.3% in 2017, according to a 2019 Forest Survey of India (FSI) report.Last year, the MCG had planted at least 105,910 saplings across the city with the help of 269 residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), the largest drive undertaken by the civic body.This time around, for the second edition of the citywide plantation drive, the MCG and Gurujal — an integrated water management initiative under the Gurugram administration to address the water crises in the district — opened registrations for RWAs and NGOs last week for taking part in the drive.The sapling distribution will be carried out between mid-July and September.Officials said that a key part of this year’s drive will be for RWAs and NGOs to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for maintaining the saplings for three years. Each RWA or NGO will only be given a maximum of 500 saplings and all saplings will be sourced from MCG’s four nurseries, located in Kadipur, and sectors 15, 44 and 46.However, environmentalists said that the civic body must not only focus on increasing the number of saplings.Vaishali Rana Chandra, an environmentalist, said, “Rather than increasing the quantity, the MCG should focus on increasing the survival rate of saplings. The onus of saplings cannot be 100% on RWAs and NGOs. The MCG’s horticulture team should follow up on the growth of the saplings periodically and closely monitor it. The MCG should also publicly disclose the repercussions if RWAs or NGOs fail to maintain the saplings properly.”First physical meeting in over two monthsMonday’s meeting of MCG officials and councillors was the first physical meeting since April. The meeting started with a tribute to the late RS Rathee, the former councillor of Ward 35, who succumbed to Covid-19 last month, followed by a two-minute silence.Ahuja asked all councillors to prepare a priority list of their respective wards, and make a separate list of pending development works, slow development works, future development works and poor quality works. He also apprised the councillors that the MCG is in the process of developing an online portal for addressing public grievances.Issues of incorrect water bills, sanitation, streetlights, roads, the takeover of private colonies, drainage and internal transfers of ward officials and employees were discussed in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/300000-saplings-to-be-planted-by-gurugram-civic-body-this-monsoon-101624295378664.html
21-06-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19: Health staff struggle to maintain crowds at vaccination centres||Health staff struggled to manage large crowds at vaccination centres and follow vaccination protocols at several session sites on Monday, as the health department held a walk-in mega vaccination drive. Social distancing norms went for a toss while monitoring of beneficiaries for adverse effects of the vaccine was not possible due to the large crowds, a visit by HT found. At a few centres, vaccination was done before registration on the Co-WIN portal. The problems were especially acute at four sites set up for daily wagers at Labour Chowk in Sector 5, Khandsa and Patel Nagar. The sites were set up along the roadside, under a tree canopy, with little space for social distancing and a lack of a dedicated observation area. “It was difficult to handle the crowd as people other than daily wage workers turned up in large numbers. Even commuters stopped by to get vaccinated. They showed their Aadhaar cards to get their vaccine shot,” said Pankaj, a data entry operator at the Anaj Mandi vaccination centre, where a minor scuffle broke out as people argued over their turns. Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “It was a major vaccination drive and some mismanagement might have taken place at some centres. These four sites were the special vaccination sites to cover people who did not have proper ID proof.” According to the health department data, at least 398 daily wage workers were inoculated on Monday.“There are now two processes to do on-spot registration, one with proper ID and another for those lacking any ID proof, as daily wage workers do not always carry their identity card. After registration and vaccination, they are given a receipt mentioning the date of vaccination, along with the seal of the medical department,” said Rajesh Kumar, a data entry operator at the Labour Chowk vaccination camp Rishikesh, a native of Munger in Bihar, who works as a daily wage labourer in the city, said that he is unaware of when or where to get the second dose. “I have been given a receipt mentioning name and data of the vaccination but there is no mention of the date for the second dose,” he said. Officials said that there was hesitancy among migrant workers to take the jab. “Despite repeated attempts, many workers refused to get vaccinated as they feared getting sick and not being able to work,” said Kumar. Anil Kumar, a construction worker who was waiting at Sector 5, said, “If I don’t get a job before 11am, then I can think of getting vaccinated. I cannot afford to lose my day’s wage for vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-health-staff-struggle-to-maintain-crowds-at-vaccination-centres-101624295378203.html
21-06-2021||Gurugram||Green tribunal pulls up state over delay in plan to protect Najafgarh Jheel||Awaiting an environment management plan (EMP) for the Najafgarh Jheel from the Haryana government for over 10 months, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered the chief secretary of Haryana to be present for the next hearing, scheduled for October 10, along with the status of compliance.On June 17, the principal bench of NGT, headed by chairperson justice AK Goel, while hearing a petition filed by the Indian National Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage (Intach) for the protection of the water body, said, “We have considered the matter and find that the issue of restoration of water body in question is significant for the environment but has not received the attention it requires from the authorities. The State of Haryana has neither prepared EMP nor given any explanation for not doing so. None appears for the State of Haryana...” “In these circumstances, we consider it necessary to direct chief secretaries of Haryana and Delhi to coordinate with the concerned departments to ensure further remedial action expeditiously and to remain present in person by video conference on the next date with the status of compliance,” stated the order, a copy of which is with HT. While the Delhi government has submitted a draft EMP, officials from the state environment department said that several committees have been formed to look into the matter and the state will be able to give a response to NGT by the next hearing. RK Chauhan, the joint director of state environment, said, “We have been working in this matter continuously and reports of the technical committee formed to study the matter have been submitted. In our case, we have a lot of area around the lake which falls under different categories like private land, agricultural land. At present, deliberations are underway regarding the area of the lake and we should be able to reach a conclusion by July-end after which an environment management plan will be devised.” The seven-square kilometre water body is important for Gurugram as it acts as a large aquifer to recharge groundwater. Many creeks in the Aravallis flow into the Najafgarh Jheel, which is further carried to the Yamuna. Akash Vashishtha, the advocate for the petitioner, said, “While Delhi has prepared the draft EMP, the Haryana government made no response in compliance with the NGT’s directions from September 19, 2020. The Najafgarh Jheel is a natural hazard zone, as it falls in Seismic Zone-IV and is also the highest zone of soil liquefaction. The two factors, if combined, would be catastrophic to people’s lives and property. Despite that, the Haryana government and its agencies are allowing high-rise constructions near the water body.” Experts privy to the details of the draft EMP prepared by the Delhi government said that the same can be adopted by the Haryana government. Ritu Rao, a PhD scholar at the TERI School of Advanced Studies, who specialises and works on urban water bodies, said that protecting the Najafgarh Jheel can help solve problems of both water scarcity and waterlogging in the city. “To address the issues of water scarcity and flooding in Gurugram, we need to restore the existing hydrological channel and water bodies in Gurugram. Haryana should declare Najafgarh Jheel a wetland up to contour 212.5 metres above mean sea level, in accordance with the high flood level of the past 100 years in the area. If this is not complied with, there is always a risk of flooding and collapsing of buildings constructed on this wetland,” said Rao. Objectives of Draft EMP prepared by Delhi Land use and land cover of the wetland is maintained in line with regulatory requirements under Wetland Rules 2017, and in accordance with master plans of NCT of Delhi and Gurugram Efficient treatment of sewage received within the wetland Maintenance of diversity of biota within Najafgarh Jheel Participation of wetland communities in management plan implementation and affirmative behaviour change within community Systematic wetland inventory, assessment and monitoring system is used to inform management decisions and assess effectiveness Integration of multiple values of wetland in sectoral development planning to be enhanced Restoration of wetland habitat and removal of invasive species||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/green-tribunal-pulls-up-state-over-delay-in-plan-to-protect-najafgarh-jheel-101624295377137.html

Kumar said the 10-storey Bihar Sadan in Delhi was in addition to the existing Bihar Bhawan and Bihar Niwas. “As the two buildings were not able to meet the growing need due to increase in number of people visiting Delhi, I thought of a third building long ago and I am happy it has taken shape.

The possible spread of the coronavirus during campaigning in the rural areas during the panchayat polls, expected to be held from October onwards, is a major cause of concern for both the government and state poll body, amid warnings from experts of a third wave. Vaccine hesitancy in rural areas continues to be a big challenge for the health department.“If the vaccination clause is made mandatory for aspiring candidates, we expect to inoculate several lakhs of people in the rural areas. This will be a big achievement in terms of vaccination and provide protection to rural people,” said the minister. “I have suggested to the SEC, which is yet to take a call on it,” he said.Panchayat polls in Bihar were due to begin in March, but had to be deferred because of the deadly second wave. The five-year term of the rural local bodies ended on June 15.The state government, through an ordinance, has decided that panchayats will be run through advisory committees till fresh elections are held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/make-vaccination-must-for-panchayat-polls-candidate-minister-tells-poll-body-101624293757971.html

Mohammed Wahid, a local social activist, said, “Erosion has led to sharp migration because of shrinking arable land. About 70% to 80% people migrate to other states like Punjab, Delhi, Haryana, Kashmir to earn their living.”“They toil in other provinces and get their houses built with remittances only to be devoured by the rivers,” Wahid says.Purnia district magistrate (DM) Rahul Kumar said he had visited all the vulnerable spots and has directed the officials concerned to expedite the anti-erosion work.Meanwhile all the five AIMIM MLAs of Seemanchal have sought a special package for the region. “We are committed to finding a permanent solution to floods and erosion,” said Akhatarul Iman, AIMIM MLA from Amour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/river-erosion-leaves-purnia-katihar-villages-on-edge-101624293756517.html

21-06-2021||Pune||Number of passport applicants shrinks in Pune||The number of passport applications for police verification for 2021 have almost shrank by half going by the record of the previous two years. In 2019, 1.34 lakh passport applications were received while in 2020, 57,695 passport applications were received. According to the police, the applicants have gone down due to an international travel ban due to Covid-19. According to the police verification department, there is a drastic increase in the number of passport applicants since the year began till date. DCP (special branch) Mitesh Gatte said that since the outbreak of Covid-19 had an impact internationally, it was natural that the number of applicants seeking jobs, going abroad for studies and tourism came down for the current year. “It is obvious that the number of passport applications have reduced. As of today, the wave is receding so there is a possibility that the number of applicants will go up in the next few days,” he said. Police inspector Milind Gaikwad said “The number of passport applicants applying for tourism purposes is high and their choice is Europe and North America. There is an international travel ban and as a result those applying for jobs also don’t have much opening. All these Covid-19 related factors had led to a lesser number of citizens applying for passports.” Passport applicants queuing up at police stations for getting their verifications done is a regular site in the city but during the past six months, a few persons are seen visiting the police stations due to Covid-19 fear and spread of infection. Pune Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) releases 1,200 normal applications and 200 tatkal applications every day and a majority of them are being filled out quickly at this time. Pune does not have direct connectivity with many international airports and currently has only one international flight from Pune airport, which connects with Dubai. The city due to its large pool of student population as well as IT professionals, the city had unprecedented growth in passports in 2019 and has seen the reduced numbers of applications with the onset of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/number-of-passport-applicants-shrinks-in-pune-101624291176385.html
21-06-2021||Pune||Katraj-Kondhwa road project costs to rise due to delays||The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) Katraj-Kondhwa four-kilometre road widening project is not going to complete within the deadline due to lack of land acquisition. The contractor has been able to complete only 25 per cent of work in the last two and half years. Now, the estimate of the cost of the project is going to increase due to the delay. Katraj –Kondwa road is one of the major parts that link Satara road to Solapur road. The heavy traffic is going out of the city through this route from Westerly bypass to Solapur road. However, the road is too narrow (15 meter to 20 meter in width) and it is always facing traffic chaos on the stretch of around four kilometres from Kondwa to Katraj junction through a Khadi Machine chowk. Only 25 per cent work complete In December 2018, a PMC-appointed contractor began the work of road widening from existing (15 to 20 meter) to 84 metres. The project cost was ₹215 crore including Goods Service Tax (GST). The deadline was three years, to be completed in December 2021. After almost two and half years, the contractor has completed only 25 per cent of work as the PMC is not able to hand over land required for road widening. The contractor has completed road widening works in patches where he received the land to widen the road. Vishal Lokhande, resident of Tilekarnagar Katraj-Kondhwa road said, “My office is located in Katraj area. It is very dangerous to pass through on Katraj-Kondhwa road. The work is incomplete. Most of the road is dug and hard to drive for two-wheelers and four-wheelers. Potholes are visible on roads and it is filled with water. I don’t know when the work is going to be completed and taxpayers will get a better road.” V G Kulkarni, chief superintendent engineer of the road department said, “On paper, we have acquired 70 per cent of land for both sides of roads. But we have acquired only 50 per cent of the actual land. The deadline will be missed as only 25 per cent of work has been completed so far and the deadline of the project will end in the month December 2021. The budget of the project will increase as project delays.” Sudhir Chavan, executive engineer of road department who is handling the project said, “Lack of land acquisition and Covid-19 pandemic hampered the project. At present, road widening work is going on at Shatrunjay Bhaktamar Jain Mandir on Kondhwa road. It is a 300-meter road widening stretch. We acquired 70 per cent of land but it is in scatter form. So, work is also completed in bits and pieces. We cannot complete it in a continuous stretch.” He added, “Old bungalows, houses and shops are coming in the road widening. There are around 80 such structures in a four kilometre stretch of road. PMC offered a Floor space Index (FSI) and Transfer Development Rights (TDR) as compensation as per land acquisition rules. But they are not ready to take FSI and TDR as compensation. They are demanding cash compensation. Some house owners want a piece of land or a readymade house or flat. Builders can utilize FSI or TDR, but it is not possible for small households to use FSI or TDR in the market.” PMC needs ₹700 crore for land acquisition Chavan further said, “The administration has calculated ₹700 crore for land acquisition. Due to the financial crunch, it is not possible for the PMC to pay that much as compensation.” Earlier, PMC decided to carry out a road widening project with deferred payment option-temporary postponement of the payment of an outstanding bill or debt, usually involving repayment by instalments. But, PMC came to know that the corporation would have to pay an additional ₹100 crore in the deferred payment option to the contractor. So, it was discarded by the PMC’s standing committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/katrajkondhwa-road-project-costs-to-rise-due-to-delays-101624291116468.html

21-06-2021||Pune||Man booked for duping several people under pretext of Army recruitment||A man was booked for posing as an Indian Army officer, marrying a woman, and duping her family, and at least 10 others, with false promises of recruitment of her brother and other young men as jawan. The complainant in the matter is a 21-year-old class 12 graduate who works in the private sector, according to the police. The accused, whose name has been withheld pending his arrest, has also been booked by Ahmednagar police in 2019 for duping a man under false pretext of placing his son in the armed force. The two had met in January 2020 outside a hospital where the woman takes her father for treatment of sugar and blood pressure, according to her complaint. “He dropped his ID card and the girl picked it up and gave it to him. He thanked her and they exchanged numbers. They first spoke on a messaging app after which they started talking on the phone. He soon proposed marriage and on the day of the wedding, when she reached Aurangabad, he was alone. He claimed that his parents had Covid19 and got married in haste and clicked a photograph. They lived together for 10-12 days and then he brought her to Pune and left saying he had been awarded Shaurya pathak,” said assistant police inspector Rajesh Usgaonkar of Bibwewadi police station who is investigating the case. The man had presented with multiple doctored documents showing that he went to the National Defence Academy, had worked in the ammunition factory in Khadki, and that he was a major general by rank, according to the police. “The documents appear fake at the first glance. The spelling of ammunition and Khadakwasla are wrong in these documents,” said API Usgaonkar. The man then offered to employ the girl’s brother get inducted into the Indian Army and asked her father to pay ₹2 lakh for it. The man had made scores of other people pay similar amounts under guise of getting their children recruitment in the armed force. “The girl started getting suspicious after people whom he owed money started approaching her, asking for their money back. So far we have 10 witnesses at least but there are definitely more,” said API Usgaonkar. A case under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 419 (personation), 170 (personating a public servant), 171 (wearing garb or carrying token, used by public servant, with fraudulent intent), and 140 (wearing garb or carrying token used by soldier, sailor or airman without being one) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Bibwewadi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/man-booked-for-duping-several-people-under-pretext-of-army-recruitment-101624290996525.html
21-06-2021||Pune||All parties lash out at PMC after frequent water cuts||Despite rainy season and adequate water capacity in dams, many areas in the city are facing water cuts. As the central part of the city and periphery areas are facing water problems, all political parties have lashed out at the municipal administration. The ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) members blamed that their areas are facing water scarcity for the last many days. After almost 23 elected members raised the water issue, the mayor instructed the water department head Aniruddha Pawaskar to ask the administration to visit these areas and sort out the issue.NCP city unit president Prashant Jagtap said, “Though 2.5 TMC water was added from Bhama Askhed dam this year, it is sad that the city is facing water issues. Earlier it was said that once the water from Bhama Askhed arrived, the rest of the city would get enough water but there is no improvement.” BJP leader Gopal Chintal said, “For the last many years we have been hearing the same issues. On one side we are executing many mega projects like the metro. Even the city got a new identity like IT city, Smart city but we failed to sort out the water issue despite having good rainfall.” Sachin Dodke raised the issue of pipelines in the recently merged villages. Dodke said, “The four years before villages merged in the city PMC laid the new water pipelines in these areas but did not connect these lines to main water pipelines. If the water pipelines are not connected to PMC water supply, what is the use in erecting these pipelines which are lying idle? Even PMC did not acquire water projects from Jeevan Pradikaran which is state owned and used to provide water for these areas earlier.” Many corporators from merged villages said, “PMC is collecting water tax from these areas but providing water once in a week. Ambegaon, Sadesatra Nali, Warje, Uruli Devachi, Phursungi all these areas are not getting water.” PMC water department head Aniruddha Pawaskar said, “It is true that the water supply in some areas was disturbed. The work of a 24x7 water pipeline is going on, including the work to construct 88 water tanks. Once this scheme would get operational, the problem of each area would get sorted out.”Pawaskar also assured that the senior officials from the water department would visit areas mentioned by elected members in coming days and sort out the issue by offering local solutions. Pawaskar said, “The PMC is giving daily 200 water tankers for Phursungi and Uruli Devachi.” The leader of house Ganesh Bidkar instructed to increase some water tankers in merged villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/all-parties-lash-out-at-pmc-after-frequent-water-cuts-101624290636389.html

Even after merging 11 villages and proposing 23 villages, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had become the state’s biggest municipal corporation by area. Fadnavis said while inaugurating the Bhama Askhed project, “During my tenure, I appointed the committee under the senior official from the irrigation department to get water from Mulshi dam. The existing government and PMC must follow it. As it is the water after generating hydroelectricity going to sea directly.” Pawar said, “There are many legal issues as the dam’s ownership is with private company Tata.

21-06-2021||Bhopal||Lockdown revives aquatic life in Chambal river||The aquatic animal population, including dolphins and gharial, in the Chambal river passing through Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh has increased significantly in the past year due to a decrease in demand for fish and sand amid the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown, officials said.“We have identified the dolphin pools in 2019 and spotted 25 calves. We deployed Ghat (bank) in-charge near the pools to check illegal net fishing as it was a major reason behind the death of calves. Decrease of demand of both sand and fish due to lockdown also helped us in saving calves,” District Forest Officer (DFO) Chambal Amit Nikam said. The dolphin population was falling every year between 2016 and 2020 but for the first time in six years the population has increased. This year, 82 dolphins and 20 calves were spotted in river Chambal, according to the annual animal survey in Chambal river conducted by three states.Forest department officials said improvement of quality of aquatic life in the Chambal river also caused an increase in the population of gharial (type of crocodile) by 17% and crocodiles by 24%, according to the survey. In the year 2016, only, 1,162 gharial were spotted in the river during the survey but this year, the population increased to 2,176. Similarly, there were 454 crocodiles in the river in 2016 which increased to 886.The experts in UP, MP and Rajsthan said after illegal sand mining, illegal net fishing emerged as a new threat for dolphins in Chambal river and baby dolphin were dying every year due to this.Nikam said the decrease in the number of dolphins was a matter of concern for them because illegal sand mining was spoiling the habitat and illegal net fishing was killing calves.He further said this year, too, they spotted 20 calves and will put extra effort to save them.“Dolphins were caught in the nets laid to catch other small fish, such as Rohu, Kirawat and Patola. With the slowdown of the business of hotels and restaurants during the lockdown and other restrictions imposed due to Covid-19, illegal net fishing has almost stopped. We have also increased our surveillance at the banks to save calves,” said Diwakar Shrivasatav, divisional forest officer, Chambal Sanctuary, Agra.Experts feel the state government should come up with a plan to maintain this quality of aquatic life and habitat so that net fishing and sand mining does not increase once the lockdown is eased.Senior scientist at Turtle Survival Alliance and working for Aquatic Animals of Ganga River System, Shailendra Singh, said, “A dolphin gives birth to only one child in a year and rarely two.

This time many dolphins were seen together downstream of Chambal river, which is a rare phenomenon. The maximum numbers of dolphins were seen from Barhi area of Bhind to Sahaso village of Etawaha in UP.

21-06-2021||Kolkata||NHRC sets up panel to probe post-poll violence after HC rejects Bengal plea||Kolkata: Hours after the Calcutta high court dismissed a petition by the West Bengal government on Monday, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) constituted a seven-member panel to “enquire into complaints of post-poll violence in West Bengal” and told the panel to identify people who were prima facie responsible for the violence and the officers who maintained a “calculated silence”.The committee will be led by Rajiv Jain, the former Intelligence Bureau chief who assumed charge as NHRC member on June 2, a statement by the human rights body said about the panel that has been set up on the orders of the high court’s five-judge bench led by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal.The high court, which has been hearing a bunch of petitions on the violence that erupted after the ruling Trinamool Congress’ third straight win in the state elections, ordered the NHRC to constitute the committee on Friday. The West Bengal government rushed to the high court the following day with a review petition, requesting the five judges to recall their order.On Monday, the judges heard out the state government but weren’t convinced. The bench, which told the West Bengal government that it could give its action taken report on the complaints received by the NHRC, made a pointed reference to complaints of police inaction and observed that the conduct of the state did not inspire confidence of the court.The court also pointed out how the NHRC had received 541 complaints in contrast to the state’s human rights commission, which hasn’t received a single one.The NHRC committee headed by Rajiv Jain also comprises National Commission for Minorities vice chairman Atif Rasheed, National Commission for Women member Rajulben L Desai, NHRC’s (director) investigation Santosh Mehra and DIG (investigation) Manzil Saini, West Bengal Human Rights Commission registrar Pradip Kumar Panja and the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority Member Secretary Raju Mukherjee.The BJP, which has mounted a relentless campaign against the Mamata Banerjee government over the violence that allegedly targeted supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party after the May 2 verdict, called Monday’s ruling a “tight slap”.“Rape, murder, arson, every heinous crime took place and the state government denied it. Bengal’s politics of violence is established today. This is a tight slap on the face of the @MamataOfficial and the @AITCofficial govt,” tweeted Ritesh Tiwari, BJP state vice-president. TMC Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy refused to comment. “We will not comment on the court’s decision. The government will examine it and take action,” he said.In proceedings before the high court and the Supreme Court – the top court is hearing a plea for compensation for the victims - the Bengal government has insisted that the government was able to control the violence that broke out before Banerjee was sworn-in on May 3. Victims of the post-poll violence, however, told the top court last week that they were still facing a “hostile attitude”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/nhrc-sets-up-panel-to-probe-post-poll-violence-after-hc-rejects-bengal-plea-101624287336878.html
21-06-2021||Kolkata||Calcutta HC rejects Bengal govt’s petition; NHRC to examine post-poll violence||A five-judge bench of the Calcutta High Court on Monday refused to recall its June 18 order directing the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to constitute a committee to examine all cases of alleged human rights violation during violence after the recent assembly polls, HT has learnt.Arguing for a section of the complainants, lawyer and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Priyanka Tibrewal cited a Supreme Court order and said court orders are recalled only in exceptional situations and there was no such ground in the ongoing case. “Since the high court passed an interim order (asking the NHRC to examine the complaints), the state government should not face any difficulty or suffer any injury,” she argued. The court said the NHRC has to submit its report on June 30 when the case will be heard again.Rejecting the petition for recall that the West Bengal government filed on Saturday, the five-judge bench, headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal, made sharp observations on the law and order situation. Justice Bindal remarked that there are allegations that police are not taking action while more complaints are being filed. He observed that the conduct of the state does not inspire the confidence of the court. Justice Harish Tandon, another judge in the bench, said while 541 complaints have been received by the NHRC, not a single one was received by the West Bengal Human Rights Commission. The court told advocate general Kishore Dutta, who represented the state, that the government can submit before the NHRC’s committee its report on the action taken on the complaints. Dutta told the court that he was not in a position to argue his case as the state was not served a copy of the report filed by the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority (WBSLSA) regarding complaints received from people. Tibrewal told the court that Dutta’s argument was untenable as she, too, had not received a copy of the WBSLSA report.More than 3,400 complaints had been received till Monday, Tibrewal told the court. On Friday, the bench heard several public interest litigations (PIL) and directed the NHRC to form a committee and examine the complaints it has received and visit the affected areas if required. The court said the committee must restore the confidence of the people and see whether their safety and livelihood have been affected by the alleged violence. The bench directed the state government to provide logistic support to the committee during visits to the affected areas and said action would be taken if the NHRC faces any obstruction. The court also asked the member secretary of the WBSLSA to be a part of the NHRC’s committee along with a member of the state human rights commission.“It is the duty of the state to maintain law and order and instil confidence in citizens,” the bench observed on Friday. It said a report prepared by the member secretary of WBSLSA mentioned that complaints were received from 3,243 people till June 10. The complaints were divided into six categories ranging from looting and arson to demand of ransom. The first significant order, in this case, was passed on May 31 when the bench ordered the constitution of a three-member committee comprising officers from the NHRC, state human rights commission, and the WBSLSA to monitor the return of people who were forced to leave their homes owing to post-poll violence at the Entally assembly constituency in Kolkata.The order was passed while hearing a case filed by Tibrewal, who contested the Entally seat but lost to Swarna Kamal Saha of the Trinamool Congress (TMC). Tibrewal alleged that people were threatened and forced to flee. On June 4, the five-judge bench directed the state to rehabilitate people who left home because of post-poll violence in the districts of Bengal. ‘’On receipt of the aforesaid complaints filed by the persons concerned in different districts in the state of West Bengal, the competent authority shall take appropriate steps for their rehabilitation immediately thereafter and report to this court on the next date of hearing,’’ the bench said. After the bench refused to recall its order to the NHRC on Monday, TMC Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said, “We will not comment on the court’s decision. The government will examine it and take action.”The BJP took a dig at the administration.“Rape, murder, arson, every heinous crime took place and the state government denied it. Bengal’s politics of violence is established today. This is a tight slap on the face of the @MamataOfficial and the @AITCofficial govt,” tweeted Ritesh Tiwari, BJP state vice-president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/calcutta-hc-rejects-bengal-govt-s-petition-nhrc-to-examine-post-poll-violence-101624280976810.html

In a statement in Shimla on Monday, Sukhu said the audit will help reveal the cause of non-Covid deaths in the state during the pandemic. Also read: Kin have edge as parties choose nominees for Himachal bypollsHe said the government should make a record of the number of days specialist doctors discharged duty in Covid wards. He also sought to know the number of surgeries conducted during the pandemic. “The audit has become necessary because many corona-infected people were suffering from other diseases. After catching Covid-19, they did not get treatment for other illnesses,” he said. These included patients of cancer, kidney and liver ailments besides diabetes, high blood pressure and heart problems. “Since they had contracted the virus, all such deaths were counted as Covid deaths,” Sukhu said. He said the government should share the number of deaths that occurred after the first dose of vaccine or both doses were administered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/himachal-congress-leader-seeks-audit-of-number-of-covid-deaths-101624277916433.html
21-06-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand locals perform yoga on garbage heaps, protest against trenching ground||In one of the biggest trenching grounds in Uttarakhand’s Kumaon, locals performed yoga on garbage heaps in Haldwani to mark their protest, HT has learnt. Locals in Uttarakhand’s Haldwani in Nainital district protested against the trenching ground in their vicinity by performing yoga on garbage heaps on the occasion of International Yoga Day on Monday. They alleged that the construction of the trenching ground has made it difficult for people to live in the area due to continuous foul smell and smoke emanating from the massive ground. Sartaj Alam, social worker and resident of Banbhulpura said, “Haldwani Kathgodam municipal corporation has made a trenching ground on the forest land adjacent to Indira Nagar in Gaulapar area of Haldwani. About 10,000 to 12,000 people live in Indira Nagar near it. Due to the construction of the trenching ground here, it has become difficult for the residents of Indira Nagar”. He said the ground gets littered every day due to which poisonous gases are released which causes problems for the elderly, pregnant women, children and those who are sick. At the same time, healthy people are also getting affected with smoke coming out of the trenching ground as it often catches fire,” he alleged. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given the slogan of Swachh Bharat but the government machinery here makes a trenching ground in the area adjacent to the residential population. Earlier, there was a green forest here where children used to play and people used to come for a walk. But since the trenching ground has been built, it is difficult for people even to walk near it,” Alam said. According to municipal officials, over 120 metric tons of garbage is thrown every day in the trenching ground from nearby towns like Nainital, Bhowali, Bhimtal, among others. Locals said in July 2018, Uttarakhand high court ordered the state government to set up a waste treatment plant in nine months but the government has not yet set up the same on the pretext of the Covid-19 pandemic. Apart from this, due to the trenching ground on the banks of the river, pollution control rules are also being flouted. “We demand that this trenching ground should be moved elsewhere. Until this trenching ground is not moved, such protests will continue,” he added. In April, locals staged a protest against fire breaking out at the Haldwani trenching ground, expressing their serious concern about the impact of the same on the health of the residents. Uvais Raza, the coordinator of Banbhulpura Bachao Sangharsh Samiti, said they protested last year also for shifting of the trenching ground from the area. “But the government allotted land here for the trenching ground. People here are having difficulty in breathing due to the smoke emanating from the burning garbage,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-locals-perform-yoga-on-garbage-heaps-protest-against-trenching-ground-101624277616436.html

21-06-2021||Chandigarh||Kin have edge as parties choose nominees for Himachal bypolls||The kin factor is evident as both the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress zero in on candidates for the byelections to the two assembly seats. The Fatehpur assembly seat, represented by Congress legislator and former minister Sujan Singh Pathania, fell vacant following his death due to a prolonged illness on February 12, while the Jubbal-Kotkhai seat fell vacant after former horticulture minister and BJP chief whip Narendra Bragta died of post Covid-19 complications on June 5. Also read: In Indian politics, a crisis of leadershipThe BJP’s core group that met in Shimla last week to deliberate on its poll strategy shortlisted three names from Jubbal-Kotkhai, including Chetan Bragta, the elder son of Narendra Bragta. Besides Chetan, who heads the party’s IT wing in the state, the names of former Zila Parishad member Neelam Seraik and Dr Shushant Deshta were discussed. To keep the rival faction in check, the BJP was quick to appoint state urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj as the bypoll in-charge for Jubbal-Kotkhai even though he did not share good ties with Bragta. Seraik and Deshta are considered close to Bhardwaj. In the Congress camp, former chief parliamentary secretary (CPS) Rohit Thakur is the frontrunner for the Jubbal-Kotkhai ticket though a few leaders owing allegiance to former chief minister Virbhadra Singh are vying for the ticket. Rohit, the grandson of Thakur Ram Lal, a former chief minister of the state, was born on August 14, 1974. He did his schooling in Shimla and graduated from Panjab University, Chandigarh. He was active in student politics during his college days. Rohit Thakur was elected to the assembly from Jubbal-Kotkhai in 2003, a year after the death of his grandfather. He lost the election in 2007 but bounced back with an emphatic win in 2012. He was appointed CPS, agriculture, in the Virbhadra Singh-led government in 2012. Thakur lost the 2017 assembly elections. Stepping into his father’s shoes The Congress has already finalised the name of Bhawani Singh Pathania from Fatehpur, the seat that fell vacant after the death of his father Sujan Singh Pathania. Bhawani, 46, studied at St Edwards and Bishop Cotton School, Shimla, before graduating from Shaheed Bhagat Singh College, Delhi University, and doing diploma in management from Institute of Management Technology, Ghaziabad. He has been working in the private sector for the past 23 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kin-have-edge-as-parties-choose-nominees-for-himachal-bypolls-101624276537085.html
21-06-2021||Chandigarh||Days of juicy jamuns, ice-lollies at India Gate||My mother was furious when she saw a purple stain on my white school shirt. “There you go picking jamuns from the pavements on your way back from school. Now how am I going to remove this purple blob from your uniform? There is a jamun tree right outside our home. You can come back and have your fill. No more jamun feasts on your way back from school, I tell you!” She would scold me and try to cleanse the mark with unboiled milk. In spite of the scolding and the fear of staining clothes, one could not resist the taste of this tropical fruit that also goes by the name of Java plum or Malabar plum and a complicated botanical name, Syzygium cumini. What she has managed to do by sloganeering thus is take me back in time to that one year of Class 6 way back in 1966 in the environs of India Gate and bring back a flood of memories and the mouth watering for the jamun fruit. Those trees then were just a little over 50 and now they are over a century old, staking a claim to heritage rights. Now these protestors have little sense of mythology. It is said that the fruit that ardent devotee Shabri offered Lord Rama was not ber (berry) but jamun. It is also believed that the Lord lived on the jamun fruit in the forests during his exile from the kingdom of Ayodhya. Another supportive myth for the jamun, which is now known as the diabetic fruit because of its healing power in defeating rising sugar levels, is that Lord Krishna is also believed to have four symbols of the Jamun on his right foot. Even Lord Megha, the Lord of the Clouds, came down to the earth in the form of a jamun fruit. Perhaps, this myth-rich heritage of the dark-skinned fruit compelled a Union minister to cry out that no jamun tree has been cut and only a few will be transplanted. Transplanting trees over a century old is no mean task. Anyway, forgetting protest, politics and myths, I just want to relive the joy of long ago when one ate ice-lollies for just 25 paise sitting on the lawns surrounding India Gate and savoured the taste of the purple fruit. And look back with love as we schoolgirls, returning from the Mater Dei Convent on Tilak Lane to the Wellesley Road Hostel for army officers, picked the ripe jamuns for free from the wayside and rolled them in our mouths with joy, often staining our uniforms and getting scolded by our mothers. nirudutt@gmail.comThe writer is a senior journalist at HT, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/days-of-juicy-jamuns-ice-lollies-at-india-gate-101624275756443.html

Two people had drowned at the same spot on Sunday as well. This has prompted the local police to write to the forest department, seeking measures to stop people from entering the lake. According to Thane municipal corporation officials, the two boys who drowned on Monday were both 17 and had gone to the lake along with their five of their friends. The group entered the lake for a swim and around 10.05 am, these two boys drowned. Their friends immediately raised an alarm, after which officials from the Vartak Nagar police station as well as the TMC, the Regional Disaster Management Cell, the Thane Disaster Response Force and the Thane Fire Brigade rushed to the spot. A search and rescue operation was undertaken immediately.

Meanwhile, the police said picnickers continue to enter the lake even though it is forbidden, leading to fatalities. On Sunday alone, a minor boy and 20-year-old Juber Sayyed drowned in the same lake. “People have been coming in large numbers ever since the monsoons started and Covid-19 related restrictions were relaxed. Picnickers enter the dense forest area, which makes it hard for the authorities to track them, and then enter the lake. As a result, even if there is an incident, rushing timely help to the spot becomes difficult as the spot is not easily reachable. We have submitted a letter to the forest department today, asking them to put up signboards warning visitors against entering the forest and the lake,” police inspector Santosh Ghatekar, Vartak Nagar police station said.

21-06-2021||Kolkata||In Bengal’s Alipurduar, where BJP won all assembly seats, district president joins TMC||Ganga Prasad Sharma, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit in north Bengal’s Alipurduar district, where the party bagged all five assembly seats in the recent polls, joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Monday afternoon, HT has learnt. “I was aggrieved for a long time because the BJP state leadership did not consult the district unit before inducting a lot of people. Had I left earlier, the party would have called me a traitor. I decided to leave after ensuring the BJP’s victory in the five assembly seats in Alipurduar,” Sharma said after joining the ruling party in Kolkata along with eight BJP office-bearers from the district.Sharma was welcomed by TMC Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, education minister Bratya Basu and Mukul Roy, who left the BJP, where he was the national vice-president, on June 11.“This is the beginning of the BJP’s end in Bengal. The process has started,” quipped Roy who joined the saffron camp in November 2017 following differences with his colleagues. He was instrumental in engineering defections from the TMC over the last three years. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, as well as the recent state elections, the BJP outperformed the TMC in the north Bengal region. In 2019, the saffron camp bagged seven of the eight Lok Sabha seats in the eight districts starting from Malda to Darjeeling. In the state polls, two prominent TMC ministers lost in north Bengal while BJP candidates won 30 of the region’s 54 assembly segments where identity politics played a key role. Even as BJP leaders in Alipurduar quickly convened a meeting of district functionaries to review the situation and stop more defections, the state leadership attempted to play down the development.“Sharma was an old leader but his departure will not affect the organisation. The selection of a new district president was on the cards. He probably got a hint and decided to leave,” said BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu.Meanwhile, TMC workers lodged a complaint at five police stations in north Bengal against John Barla, BJP’s Lok Sabha member from Alipurduar, for demanding a Union territory comprising the north Bengal districts. Barla voiced the demand before the local media last week and reiterated it on Sunday. “North Bengal has been neglected for decades. Only Central rule can ensure development,” he said.BJP state president Dilip Ghosh and other leaders have said the party has made no such demand and Barla expressed his personal opinion. Ghosh also called up Barla.TMC state leaders, however, have started a hashtag campaign, alleging that Barla’s demand has exposed the BJP’s plans to divide Bengal after failing to win the people’s mandate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/in-bengal-s-alipurduar-where-bjp-won-all-assembly-seats-district-president-joins-tmc-101624272037911.html
21-06-2021||Kolkata||Alipurduar district BJP president joins Trinamool Congress||In a major setback for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in north Bengal, Alipurduar district BJP president Ganga Prasad Sharma on Monday joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the presence of party leaders Sukhendu Sekhar Roy and Mukul Roy in Kolkata.Sharma had said he was changing parties as working for the people was becoming increasingly difficult for him in his current circumstances. "I did everything to ensure that the BJP wins the polls, and the party did bag five seats. But some of us are feeling suffocated in the party now, which is expanding in size without establishing links with grassroots workers," he said, according to news agency PTI.Also Read | ‘Wrote thrice to PM seeking Governor's withdrawal’: Mamata on Jagdeep Dhankhar“I had to work hard to consolidate the party’s base in the district. I can no longer stay in a party where the district president is not given importance. I have left the BJP,” he said.He also said that the recent demand by "our local MP for a union territory status for north Bengal" has further pushed him to take the decision, adding that a few other members of the party will also follow in his footsteps.Responding to Sharma's comments, BJP MLA and opposition leader in Bengal assembly Suvendu Adhikari said, "Our organisation is strong in north Bengal. Ganga Prasad's exit hardly matters, adding, "We will create another Ganga Prasad. Individuals don't matter, BJP matters.”Adhikari had joined the BJP in December last year after accusing the TMC of lacking discipline and had vowed to bring the BJP to power in the state. “We who have quit TMC will work as disciplined soldiers so that BJP comes to power in the state in the assembly poll in 2021 and West Bengal becomes Sonar Bangla (Golden Bengal),” he had said.Adhikari contested from the Nandigram assembly constituency against his once-mentor and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, and won the seat by a thin margin.The BJP won 77 of the total 291 constituencies in West Bengal which was seen as an impressive gain from the previous assembly elections, while the TMC bagged 213 seats, to form the government for the third consecutive time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/alipurduar-district-bjp-president-joins-trinamool-congress-101624268554813.html
21-06-2021||Kolkata||No universal vaccination: Only priority groups to get vaccine in Bengal||The West Bengal government will not launch the universal vaccination programme (providing free vaccines to all in the age bracket 18-45 years) and will instead continue to vaccinate priority groups, due to a shortage of vaccines, senior health officials said. The Centre launched the universal vaccination programme against Covid-19 from Monday to provide states with free vaccines for the 18-45 category, a move that is expected to help scale up daily vaccination numbers. “There will be no change in the policy. We will continue to vaccinate priority groups. We don’t have enough vaccines. If we start universal vaccination, there will be a mismatch and the priority groups won’t get the vaccines. Until we complete vaccinating the target groups we won’t be able to vaccinate others,” said Ajoy Chakraborty, director of health services. Also Read | ‘So what happened now?’: Nadda slams oppn over ‘politicising’ vaccination driveThe state had identified a few priority groups, including sex workers, jail inmates, hawkers and transport workers, who could be Covid-19 super-spreaders. The groups include Covid-19 volunteers, jail inmates, retail sellers in markets, hawkers, sex workers and transgenders, lawyers and court staff, journalists, transport workers, dealers of essential goods, and government employees, including teacher, who were not vaccinated during the assembly elections. “On an average, we were getting around 200,000 vaccines per day. The flow will be a little healthier now and we may get around 300,000 doses per day. We have the capacity to scale it up to 500,000 per day. We have vaccinated 475,000 persons in one day, which has been the highest till date,” said a senior health official. Till date, the state has vaccinated 19,010,700 persons, of which 2,142,859 vaccines were given to people in the 18-45 age group. The Union government will procure 75% of the total overall Covid-19 vaccine supplies, and distribute it among states for free to vaccinate all adults. According to senior officials of the Union health ministry, more vaccine supplies are in the pipeline than before and the companies are also ramping up production; therefore, there should be no problem covering the target population. “We will increase the vaccination as per the quantity we receive. It will take some time for us to start universal vaccination. We will first complete the priority groups, which include super-spreaders, persons forcibly exposed to public mingling, and those facing public,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/no-universal-vaccination-only-priority-groups-to-get-vaccine-in-bengal-101624267296040.html
21-06-2021||Delhi||Happy hours: Delhi restaurateurs hail reopening of bars, extension in timings of eateries||The Delhi government, in a fresh order, permitted reopening of bars in the Capital, with 50% seating occupancy, from noon till 10pm. It also granted permission to restaurants to operate till 10pm instead of 8pm, giving them an additional two hours. And, restaurateurs in the city could not be happier, for they feel extended timings and permission to serve alcohol will help revive the dining scene. “All table reservations were coming in late evening, as patrons were unaware of timings. Also, most customers asked for alcohol. Now, even if we won’t see large groups coming in, the average person cost is going to go up, adding to the revenue,” says Radhika Khandelwal, chef-owner of Fig & Maple.Renowned bartender Yangdup Lama, and founder, Sidecar, says the extension in timings will greatly benefit bartenders, bar and restaurant owners. “At a bar, there are hardly any takeaway orders. An extension gives a window to operate for additional hours, and will help space out reservations,” he says. Hoping to see an increase in patrons, Avantika Sinha Bahl, owner of Kampai and Mai Bao, says, “We were losing dinner service, with the 8pm restriction. Footfall seems to be promising in the coming days.”Owners of eateries with multiple outlets are relieved, as they can now reopen branches that had to be shut. “I opened only one outlet out of three, as with limited serving hours and no liquor, the other two would see more losses than gains. I’m now happy, as well be able to open all three outlets and serve the complete experience,” says Kanishk Tuteja, founder of 1 Oak, Nukkad and We Qutub.Moreover, restaurateur Priyank Sukhija wishes to get a further extension as he says, “Hopefully the numbers [of Covid-19 cases] decline further and the industry gets to open beyond 10pm soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/happy-hours-delhi-restaurateurs-hail-reopening-of-bars-extension-in-timings-of-eateries-101624266756021.html
21-06-2021||Lucknow||Etah railway station in UP awaits a viable rail link for 62 years||Despite home to 130,000 people, the railway station in western Uttar Pradesh’s Etah district -- inaugurated on January 18, 1959 by then President Rajendra Prasad-- has failed to live up to its promise even 62 years later with only a single local train scheduled to stop at the station and in the absence of connectivity to the busy Agra-Bareilly route through Kasganj station. This despite the district being home to former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh.The station these days wears a deserted look with the only train that halted here-- connecting Etah with Tundla and Agra-- getting cancelled two months ago due to curtailment of rail traffic amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Little wonder, Vijay Singh Verma, the station superintendent at Etah railway station, doesn’t look busy.A stroll on the empty platform reveals the fading inscriptions on a marble plaque, proudly announcing that the station was unveiled by then President Dr Rajendra Prasad on January 18, 1959. A member of parliament from Etah, Rohan Lal Chaturvedi, who was the deputy railway minister in Jawaharlal Nehru’s cabinet, was instrumental in organising the inauguration, old timers recall.“The railway station at Etah has been awaiting [proper] connectivity for the last 62 years. The railway station at Kasganj is merely 30 kilometres away. Despite promises, the train link to Kasganj is yet to be laid. Once linked with Kasganj, the railway station of Etah will be connected to the busy Agra-Bareilly route,” says Rakesh Gandhi, former chairman of Etah Nagar Palika Parishad. The expansion of the rail network remains a sore point during every election in Etah and protests on the issue were organised twice at Jantar Mantar, near the Parliament, in New Delhi in January 2015 and 2016, but the situation hasn’t changed.The fact that former CM Kalyan Singh’s son Rajveer currently represents the seat in Lok Sabha or that two other former CMs in Ram Naresh Yadav and Mulayam Singh Yadav also represented Nidholi Kalan (now Marhara) assembly constituency in Etah in 1977 and 1993 respectively, has also not made any difference to the fortune of the station.“We have been raising the issue of rail connectivity to Etah and even met senior railway officials. We get assurances. There was a budgetary allocation of ₹279 crore for the Etah-Kasganj section but yet again Etah could not have a train link with Kasganj, since the survey could not be completed in time,” complains Anuj Gupta, a local businessman. Locals say the current link is not preferred since it takes twice as long to reach either Agra or Tundla. “The passenger train is the choice of only those who find the fare less than the bus fare,” says a sanitation worker at the railway station.In absence of a viable option, a large number of students from Etah travel to Agra shelling out higher bus fares. Agra is 80 kilometres from Etah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/etah-railway-station-in-up-awaits-a-viable-rail-link-for-62-years-101624266336050.html

21-06-2021||Bhopal||MP forest dept to test tigers for Covid-19 in wake of unexplained deaths||Madhya Pradesh forest department’s officials will take blood and oropharyngeal swab samples of tigers in Pench Tiger Reserve, Seoni, to test for coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The officials said the decision was taken after the forensic science laboratory could not reach a conclusion as to the cause of three tigers’ deaths at the reserve since January. The reserve, at last count, had 53 tigers.The forest officers claimed Covid-19 testing of tigers will take place for the first time in India.Pench Tiger Reserve field director VS Parihar said, “For the past 20 days, six forest department officials on two elephants are trying to locate tigers in the forest to tranquillise them and take samples. They are yet to find any as it is a difficult task--the rainy season has started.” Also Watch | Tiger rescued from defunct rubber factory in Uttar Pradesh“The decision was taken because three tigers aged between 5 and 8 years have died in Pench Tiger Reserve since January. The post mortem and FSL reports ruled out the possibility of poaching as no poison, electrocution or injury mark was found on the tigers’ carcasses,” he added. “To know the cause of the tigers’ deaths, the Pench Tiger Reserve administration wrote to the head office of the forest department last month, and requested for permission to take the samples of five tigers randomly. The samples will be tested for Covid-19 test and other viral diseases,” said Alok Kumar, principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF), wildlife department. Last year, wildlife activist Sangeeta Dogra filed a petition in the Supreme Court, seeking a thorough investigation into the death of a 10-year-old tiger in Pench. She said she suspected it had died of Covid-19. The apex court asked the Ministry of Environment and Forests to ascertain the cause of death. However, the state government denied that the cause of death was Covid-19. Dogra said, “Last year, a tiger died due to Covid 19 in Pench but the state government showed a forged report from a veterinary institute in Jabalpur to prove that it was not a Covid-19 death. This year too, I filed a petition as the MP government defied the order of NTCA which stated that tigers reserves and national parks must be closed in wake of a lioness’s death in Chennai due to Covid-19.” “They are doing random sampling as they suspect that coronavirus is spreading in the forests of MP. This is a serious issue and needs to be addressed soon to save the wildlife,” she added.“We haven’t received any reports from MP or other states on tigers in the wild suspected of contracting Covid-19,” said Soumitra Dasgupta, inspector general of forests (wildlife), under the Union ministry of environment.With inputs from Bhojraj Raghuvanshi from Chhindwara||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-forest-dept-to-test-tigers-for-covid-19-in-wake-of-unexplained-deaths-101624261415812.html

21-06-2021||Bhopal||Row over soybean seeds ‘shortage’ in MP, farmers allege black marketing||Several soybean farmers in Madhya Pradesh have alleged that the sowing of the Kharif crop has not even begun in 60% area even two months after the beginning of the season due to shortage of certified seeds, provided by the government. However, the state claimed to have more seeds than last year and blamed the shortage on additional demand by farmers who have not been able to grow their own seed due to crop failure.Soybean was sowed in 5,854 million hectares of land last year but farmers said 60% of the area remained uncultivated this year due to unavailability of certified seeds at cooperative societies and seed centres. They also accused the government of turning a blind eye to black marketing of seeds, which is available at double the government rate in the open market.“I used to sow soybean in 20 acres of land till last year but this year I don’t have seeds. In the market, the seeds are available at ₹9,000 to ₹12,000 per tonne, which we can’t afford,” Bhem Singh Meena, a farmer from Rajgarh, said.The government sells the soybean seeds for ₹4,000 per tonne at state-run seed centres and cooperative societies. Meena said it was also upsetting that instead of supplying them with enough quality seeds, the agriculture minister had advised farmers to opt for some other crop for better profitability.MP farmers body’s president Anil Yadav claimed the state government was in truck with private businessmen, who were “minting money by selling substandard seeds at much higher rates.”“The state government is asking [farmers] to opt [for] some other crops. But in reality, the state government is shedding its responsibility,” Yadav alleged.Agriculture minister Kamal Patel said it was his responsibility to offer correct advice to farmers. “I have suggested growing some other crops not to run away from my responsibility but to help them earn more money. Due to the decrease of export, poor weather, diseases in plants, the soybean yield has decreased a lot in the past three years.” Soybean Processors Association of India chairman Davish Jain said: “Instead of de-motivating farmers, the state government should encourage them by providing quality seeds. Soybean is a crop which has multiple uses and has important nutrients to fight against malnutrition and protein deficiency among people.” However, the agriculture department claimed there was no shortage as 1.3 million tonnes of seeds was procured by MP for distribution among farmers compared to 1 million tonnes last year. “Those farmers, who used to sow their own seed until last year, don’t have seeds for this season as the crop failed due to incessant rainfall. Every year, only 40% farmers used to purchase certified seeds from the government, and this year too, we have seeds for 40% farmers, said an officer of agriculture department, who didn’t wish to be named. Agriculture department data shows that MP had procured 1 million tonne seeds last year and that figure increased to 1.3m tonne this year. 340,000 tonnes of these are available at cooperatives and government’s seed centres while the remaining 930,000 tonnes was available at government’s certified private shops.“The prices in the private market are not regulated by the government, so we are helpless,’’ said another government officer on condition of anonymity. Another senior officer of the agriculture department said that the government had realised that the demand may increase this year and therefore banned the sale of soybean seeds to other states in April but it had to be lifted on Centre’s intervention.“Citing problems to farmers, we have [again] requested the Centre to ban the sale of seeds to other states but it is yet to take any decision,” he said.Minister Patel said efforts were on to make seeds available for the left out farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/row-over-soybean-seeds-shortage-in-mp-farmers-allege-black-marketing-101624259496262.html

21-06-2021||Jaipur||Unite to make Covid-19 vaccination in Rajasthan successful: Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said every citizen of the state should play their role in helping combat the coronavirus pandemic and make the vaccination campaign successful.He said this is the time to rise above all other commitments, including political thinking and party ideologies, to unite and save lives."We have to fulfil the duty of humanity by sidelining narrow-mindedness and discrimination. It should be our endeavour that no person is left out from vaccination," Gehlot said in a statement.The CM was addressing a video conference organised on Sunday to increase vaccine participation.He said the state government is conducting the vaccination drive across cities and villages in a planned manner. Every person should get the protective shield of the vaccine to prevent the spread of the pandemic.Gehlot said the government has been successful in keeping vaccine wastage much less than the prescribed standards.The Chief Minister said free vaccines have been announced by the Centre from June 21 for the age group of 18 to 44 years.After the change in the Centre's vaccine procurement policy, ₹600 crore taken from the MLAs fund and deposited in the Chief Minister's Covid-19 Mitigation Fund would be returned. But in view of the effect of the pandemic, it will be appropriate to spend this amount this year itself for strengthening the medical services in the state.Rajasthan Assembly Speaker C P Joshi said public representatives and political workers have access to the booth level in villages and hamlets.In such a situation, they can play a more active role in raising awareness about vaccination at the grassroots level and removing the misconceptions related to vaccines among the backward and uneducated people, he said.Health Minister Raghu Sharma said 2,444 cold-chain points have been made across the state while capacity has been developed to administer doses to 12 to 15 lakh people per day.Minister of State for Education Govind Singh Dotasra said all public representatives should rise above political ideologies and make the vaccination campaign successful to save the people of the state from the pandemic.Deputy Leader of Opposition in the Rajasthan Assembly Rajendra Rathore said the Opposition will fully cooperate with the state government in the vaccination campaign as it did in preventing the spread of Covid-19 cases last year.Health Secretary Siddharth Mahajan said so far about 2.08 crore people of the state have been given vaccine doses. Of these, 1.74 crore people have received the first dose and more than 34 lakh people have received both the doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/unite-to-make-covid-19-vaccination-in-rajasthan-successful-ashok-gehlot-101624250589960.html
21-06-2021||Delhi||HT EXCLUSIVE: On International Day of Yoga, PM Modi’s personal yoga consultant gives us a peek into his routine||It is widely known that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought the art of yoga into the spotlight, but do you know that there isn’t a single day when he doesn’t take out the time for yoga, or that he is dedicated to the avartan dhyan practice. On International Yoga Day, we exclusively talk to PM’s personal yoga consultant, HR Nagendra, as he shares a glimpse of Modi’s dedication towards the ancient practice, calling him a ‘devoted Yoga Sadhaka’.“It’s very heartening to note that Modi ji is a devoted Yoga Sadhaka himself and he regularly practices yoga in spite of having such a busy schedule. Avartan Dhyan or cyclic meditation, which I had conceptualised years ago, is one practice that he religiously follows every day,” Nagendra tells us.The principle of this meditation is to stimulate the body, followed by deep relaxation of the body and mind. “Modi ji’s dedication towards yoga is so high that even if he’s travelling around the world, he never fails to dedicate some time to his yoga routine,” mentions Nagendra, lauding Modi for leading the proposal to make July 21 as International Day of Yoga, which the United Nation’s General Assembly accepted in 2014. Nagendra further reveals that Modi’s fondness for yoga is not just limited to the practice of asanas that strengthen physical health, but “he’s also focused on strengthening the mind to achieve a state of holistic health and well-being”.In fact, yoga plays a very important role in helping people find a way to good health in the times of Covid-19 crisis.“The pandemic has given us the opportunity to stay home, work on family relations and spend more time with them. However, this quarantine or isolation has also impacted the mind negatively. Hence, it’s imperative for us to practice and introduce yoga at home to help tackle mental issues such as depression and anxiety,” shares Nagendra, the Chancellor, S-VYASA, President, Indian Yoga Association. He suggests everyone to include “Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga and Karma Yoga, Pranayama, Kriyas and relaxation techniques” into their life for holistic living.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ht-exclusive-on-international-day-of-yoga-pm-modi-s-personal-yoga-consultant-gives-us-a-peek-into-his-routine-101624250435612.html
21-06-2021||Lucknow||Top BJP leaders in Lucknow today for round 2 of feedback sessions||On Monday, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in Uttar Pradesh (UP) will meet national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, who will hold feedback sessions for the second time in 20 days to thrash out issues between the party and the government and prepare a blueprint for Mission 2022--the UP assembly elections.BL Santhosh’s visit will be followed by a series of visits by the party’s leadership. BJP chief JP Nadda and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are expected to visit UP regularly in the run-up to the assembly polls, due in about nine months’ time.The BJP could also hold a state working committee meeting by June-end or early July, some party leaders indicated. Before the 2022 UP polls, BJP faces elections to the zila panchayat chairpersons’ post on July 3.Also Read | After BJP, Congress battles infighting, power tussle over Karnataka CM faceDuring his three-day unprecedented one-on-one feedback session with ministers of the Yogi Adityanath government, Santhosh had stressed on the need for unity and coordination between the party and the government in the election year, party leaders said.The spotlight, this time, will be as much on Santhosh as on the new UP BJP vice-president AK Sharma, an IAS officer and a former aide of Prime Minister Modi, who earlier joined the BJP, was made an MLC from UP and has since earned applause for Covid management in and around Varanasi, Modi’s Lok Sabha constituency.Sharma’s induction in the Yogi Adityanath government as the new UP BJP vice-president came two days before Santhosh’s arrival.There are 17 vice-presidents in the UP BJP, but party leaders admit that spotlight is on Sharma.“It is clear that Sharma is not going to be a regular state party vice-president. He was recently in Delhi meeting Nishad Party chief Sanjay Nishad who has since firmed up his alliance with the BJP. He also met a Brahmin body in Delhi,” a party leader said.Sharma, who has adopted two health centres – a community health centre in Ranipur and a primary health centre in Suggichauri, both in his home district of Mau – in keeping with the party direction to all ministers, lawmakers and party functionaries to adopt health centres in the state, is expected to attend party meetings with Santhosh and national vice-president Radha Mohan Singh, who is also the UP in-charge.Ahead of Santhosh’s arrival, BJP also announced office bearers to head the various party wings and declared the party’s media, IT and social media panels. Former Congress heavyweight Jitin Prasada, who arrived in Lucknow to meet party functionaries and chief minister Yogi Adityanath, could also be among the leaders expected to meet BL Santhosh and Radha Mohan Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/top-bjp-leaders-in-lucknow-today-for-round-2-of-feedback-sessions-101624248455259.html
21-06-2021||Chandigarh||Why be ordinary when you can become extraordinary?||International Day of Yoga is celebrated on June 21 as it’s the longest day in the northern hemisphere, and the shortest in the southern after which days become longer there. This year, the theme is, yoga for wellness. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, the emphasis is on the importance of maintaining health within the constraints of social distancing. Unlike a gym or regular workout, yoga is not confined to physical health and goes beyond bending and twisting. It instils calm that helps think clear and explore one’s potential. It encourages upgrading oneself to become unique and special. Also read: International Yoga Day: Yoga takes us from stress to strength, says PM ModiAfter performing asanas (body postures), the prana shakti (life force) in the body goes up and the mind gets energised. It’s the mind that determines whether one is successful in life or not. Physically, we are by and large similar, but our achievements are unique. Some of us achieve the extraordinary, while most are ordinary. The body is just the framework. The driver of this body is the mind, and that’s the differentiator. Just like software needs to be upgraded to get the best out of the hardware, the mind needs an upgrade to get the best out of this body. Few people are able to expand the bandwidth of the mind, while most work only on the information given. Yoga helps widen the mind’s bandwidth and tap into the spectrum of wisdom gained in previous lives. It can be achieved by being sincerely committed to the sadhna (daily yoga practice), including meditation. When the mind is calm, it can see beyond distractions and temptations as the hidden spectrum of wisdom opens up. Yoga means to connect, within and with others. The world is like the body. If all parts are connected and working in a coordinated manner, there is a sense of completeness. Similarly, all nations should be healthy for a healthy world. Yoga urges to come to the centre and take a balanced view. It teaches to live in harmony and enrich the world with our unique contribution. It leads to acceptance and tolerance and not to get hung up with one viewpoint or belief. Yoga preaches wellness. It urges governments across the globe to focus on preventive health than cure. With life expectancy on the rise, budgets on healthcare will always fall short if the idea is restricted to building hospitals alone. A healthy community is equipped to bounce back from a pandemic faster. Generally, material wealth is perceived as prosperity and a measure of a successful life. But as one ages, one realises that health is wealth. Material wealth is sustainable only if one leads a value-based life. Values need to be inculcated. Our scriptures define a value-based person as one who is down to earth yet full of ambition, hope, positivity and conviction. Such a person has physical strength, mental stamina and spiritual strength to overcome the odds. Each one of us has the potential to be extraordinary. Yoga offers the tool to realise that potential by enriching and enlivening the mind. yyadav@hindustantimes.com The writer is senior news editor at Hindustan Times, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/why-be-ordinary-when-you-can-become-extraordinary-101624245816888.html

21-06-2021||Patna||Bihar artists demand pension, life insurance citing poor financial status||Artists from Bihar including Padma Shri awardee Shyam Sharma have requested the state government to consider life insurance cover and monthly pension apart from government jobs to support artists- a community, whose earnings has been hit hard due to the coronavirus pandemic. A group of performing and visual artists submitted their demands to Bihar’s chief secretary Tripurari Sharan stating that state patronage was required to help artists support their families while they devoted their time to their art. “Who will take care of the artists who are old and have no money? Monthly pension is important for them and equally important is the provision of life insurance. Something should be done by the government in this direction,” Shyam Sharma, former principal of the College of Arts and Crafts, said. The community has cited government job quotas for sports persons to demand similar support including scholarships for artists. In contrast, state support to artists is irregular and mainly comes through various awards. While their work gets promoted through government organised or supported cultural festivals and exhibitions, they do not enjoy the security of a stable government job.Birendra Kumar, former member of the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) and a painter said the need for economic support has been felt intensely during the Covid pandemic induced lockdown. “Most of those artists who have been dependent upon government programmes like exhibitions, art camps, workshops are in severe financial crisis as all activities have remained suspended due to Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. Those dependent on the sale of art works to different government departments, too, need support to survive,” he said. He added that the government should also consider setting up an art counsel to sort out issues related to artists and events, he added. Kathak danseuses Anjula and Rajeev said state patronage was also needed to support classical art and artists, but it was missing. “Though the place has produced musicians like Bharat Ratna Bismillah Khan, the kind of patronage which is needed for the art and artists to flourish, is missing here.”Shehnai Maestro Bismillah Khan was born into a family of court musicians in Bihar. Chief secretary Tripurari Sharan could not be contacted for comments. Khan was born into a family of court musicians in Bihar. He was apprenticed to his uncle, Ali Baksh, who played the shehnai in Vishvanatha, a Hindu temple in Varanasi.Chief secretary Tripurari Sharan could not be contacted for comments, but culture minister Alok Ranjan said his department has invited artists to submit their work by July 15, which will then be judged for cash rewards. “Solo performers will be given ₹1,500, while a group will be given ₹3,000 and the best artists will be given ₹10,000,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-artists-demand-pension-life-insurance-citing-poor-financial-status-101624244735110.html

21-06-2021||Delhi||Presenting the right gift to mark occasions||Yesterday was Father’s Day, an occasion we had no idea about till the last decade or so. I’m not one of those who condemns it. I welcome it as an occasion to think of other such days too: Children’s Day and Mother’s Day. Still, I want to point out the fallacy in celebrating close family by shopping and consuming.The best gift for a parent is that their child grows up in a safe world. This won’t happen if inequity and poverty aren’t erased. And that, in turn, won’t happen if the middle classes continue to consume the way they do. Think of this number from Oxfam International: It will take 941 years for a minimum wage worker to earn as much as a top executive at a garment export company.This consumption requires gobbling resources: forests must be erased for underground resources or infrastructure. Clean air must be violated. Sand has to be mined, decapitating riverine systems. This only accelerates climate change, wiping out assets. India was left with 14 billion dollars loss by Cyclone Amphan. The poor find it hard to build back, destabilizing the country.Instead of scurrying to find unique ways to consume on these ‘days,’ shouldn’t we figure out how to celebrate primary relationships in ways that actually sustain life, not reduce it’s quality? Changing social norms about celebrations and expressing affection is key. We should push in that direction, so being a parent or a child is less fraught with anxieties about environmental uncertainty.(The writer is founder and director Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/presenting-the-right-gift-to-mark-occasions-101624236866067.html
21-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: An unmarried man||Only yesterday, it seems, he was in his 20s. Today he’s in his 40s. “Samay (time) passes quickly,” says rickshaw puller Vishwakarma Lal, during a leisurely chat lasting to almost half an hour, while he was waiting for passengers, this early evening near Gurugram’s bus stand.Tapping on his chest, he complains that “people think I must be having a wife and many sons, but I’m still unmarried.”Eldest among four siblings—he has sisters—Mr Lal found himself becoming their guardian when he was only a teenager, in his village in Mirzapur, UP. Both his parents died in quick succession. “My father was a rickshaw walla in Allahabad.” Then, one day, the young Vishwakarma Lal migrated to that same city to follow his father’s footsteps. “My sisters had to move to our chachi’s (aunt’s) house in the village, and I would come home every month to give some money to chachi for the expenses.”Over the years, he stayed a puller but changed cities, moving from Allahabad to Delhi, and from Delhi to Gurugram. “I wanted to work in Bambai.” Mr Lal reveals that almost all his earnings, until a few years ago, would be spent in raising his sisters and in arranging their weddings. He feels the absence of a brother; he might have shared the burden. “My plan was to marry after marrying off all my sisters.” They became so involved in their own families that they never looked for a wife for him, he says matter-of-factly.Of course, Mr Lal knows so many rick pullers in the city who, like him, live alone, “but they have their wives and children in their villages.” He shares a rented hall near the bus stand with nine other pullers. At night, most of them lie on their respective bed talking to their families on mobile, or watching news/movies on the phone screen. Mr Lal, instead, settles down on the floor and performs pooja for at least one hour, “because prayer lightens my heart, and one day the Gods might help me find a wife.”He now poses for a portrait but playfully covers his face “because I’m not wearing the mask, and that is not good.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-an-unmarried-man-101624235661805.html
21-06-2021||Delhi||More vaccination camps for workers at Delhi Metro project sites soon||The Delhi Metro will organise more vaccination camps at construction sites for its workers for their inoculation against Covid-19, officials said on Sunday.The DMRC is already conducting an awareness campaign at various project sites to tell the benefits of vaccination to workers."Already, multiple vaccination camps have been organised at the sites for the workers, and more are expected to follow," the DMRC said in a statement.In the statement, the DMRC also shared that despite several constraints induced by the second wave of the Covid pandemic, the Delhi Metro has continued with the construction work of its Ph IV corridors, and achieved a few important construction landmarks as well."The DMRC is currently engaged in construction of 65 km of new lines across three priority corridors as part of its Ph-IV expansion. These corridors are expected to be completed by 2025. However, given the fact that the Covid scenario is still evolving, the completion targets shall be reviewed accordingly," it said.During the lockdown period this year, all Covid related guidelines given by the government from time to time were stringently followed. After the lifting of restrictions, now there is a gradual increase in the manpower available at DMRC's sites, officials said.The tunnelling work between Janakpuri West and Krishna Park Extension on the Janakpuri West – RK Ashram Marg corridor for DMRC's first underground section of Phase 4 achieved many important targets during this period, they said.During these months, the DMRC completed the tunnelling of 500 m of one of the 2.8-km-long twin tunnels. Delhi Metro has also completed casting of over 50 per cent of tunnel segments in the casting yard. The first of the twin tunnels on this stretch is expected to be completed by September this year, the officials said.On the same stretch, the DMRC achieved another major milestone by erecting Ph-IV's first ever T-girder at Mukarba Chowk last month, they said.On the Majlis Park – Maujpur corridor as well, steady progress was made despite the manpower related constraints. Work on Delhi Metro's fifth bridge over the river Yamuna is also going on as part of this corridor near the Signature Bridge. This corridor is significant as its completion will complete the entire ring of connectivity on the Pink Line, the statement said.In April and May, 2021, four major civil tenders of DMRC's Ph-IV underground sections were also floated. These are all being funded by the loan received through JICA. While three tenders are from the Aerocity – Tughalakabad corridor, one is from the Janakpuri West – RK Ashram Marg corridor.

21-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh records no Covid death after 81 days||Chandigarh on Sunday announced zero Covid-19 deaths for the first time since March 31, a milestone that the city had been looking forward to after a deadly second wave.The cases also declined further to 22 in a new low since February 19, when 19 people had tested positive 121 days ago.Just a day after the Chandigarh administration had imposed the lockdown on May 4, Chandigarh had seen its daily deaths peaking to 14, a number it recorded twice again on May 12 and May 21 as the city’s health infrastructure continued to battle the sudden stream of critical patients.But after the city completed three weeks under lockdown on May 24, the day also saw the daily deaths dropping below 10, with seven people succumbing to the virus.For the subsequent seven days less than 10 people died every day and the figure further dropped to five or less through the first 19 days of June, until the city recorded no death on Sunday.In all, the city recorded 275 virus-related deaths in May, its deadliest phase in the pandemic since it started in March last year. The month alone makes up for 29% of Chandigarh’s Covid deaths.In terms of cases, May’s figure of 17,399 also accounts for the most infections in Chandigarh, forming 28% of the tally.But after staying under lockdown for five weeks till June 8, the city’s cases have dropped from the all-time high of 895 on May 9 to 22 on June 20 – a slump of 97.5%.UT’s health director Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang said the zero deaths were worth celebrating after a tremendously difficult phase.“But I wish people would realise the importance of following Covid-appropriate behaviour, as people tend to forget with drop in numbers. Residents need to be more responsible as every life is precious. The pandemic numbers may peak again after staying low for a couple of months,” she cautioned.No Covid death in Mohali for second consecutive dayIn more good news, Mohali also reported no Covid death for the second day in a row. On Saturday, Mohali’s daily casualties came down to zero after a gap of 84 days.

Against 28 cases on Saturday, Mohali had 27 on Sunday and Panchkula’s infections also came down from five to four. With this, tricity’s active cases slipped below the 1,000 mark for the first time in over three months.

21-06-2021||Chandigarh||‘Capt Amarinder is not the Congress... he lies every day’: Navjot Singh Sidhu||As former opener for Team India, an astute sense of timing comes naturally to cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Sidhu who is at the centre of a raging rebellion in the ruling Punjab Congress arising chiefly out of his running duel with chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh for last two years since his exit from the cabinet. Even as the high command looks to pacify the feuding leaders and “suitably accommodate” Sidhu, as recommended by a party panel ten days ago, the Amritsar MLA’s patience may be wearing thin. In an exclusive hour-long interview with Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak and Associate Editor Navneet Sharma at his Patiala residence on Sunday. Sidhu, 59, made a blistering attack on Amarinder and laid out his expectations but played an artful dodger on his next course of action. His tone and timing came as the clearest indicator yet of tough task the high command faces in balancing Sidhu’s ambition and Captain’s authority. Edited excerpts:What does Navjot Sidhu want?The constancy of purpose of my political career was to observe a system and change it. A system run by two powerful families who are controlling Punjab, belittling the legislature, overriding the interests of the state and purely for their vested, selfish interests and businesses as a collusion. They have controlled everything. They have fended for each other, defended each other. My fight has been against that system. I joined the (Congress) party after Prashant Kishor met me 60 times. I told them I have a pro-Punjab agenda. I campaigned in 56 assembly seats and party won in 54 of them, and 23 out of 24 were in Majha. This is the agenda I followed from the very first cabinet meeting where I gave a proposal to the chief minister to change the liquor policy for more revenue and give jobs with that money. You are taking loans to return loans and the state exchequer is being looted. The system said ‘no’. I took the mining policy to the system, saying that this is state’s treasure. Telangana earns ₹2,500 crore from one river annually. Punjab has three rivers. The last Akali-BJP government deposited only ₹40 crore from sand auctions in 10 years. Where is this money going? I told them ‘you fix the rate for sand and sell it at government rates. The system said, ‘no’.Why couldn’t your own government do all this?That’s the explanation I am always demanding. But they never said anything. I told them there is nothing called sand mafia. It is the transport mafia because sand cannot be transported without trucks. I said ‘impound them’. The system said ‘no’. No reasons are given. I went to the system and gave them a vision of my department to make everything such as birth certificate and death certificate online. Who brought drinking water to towns? Look at advertisement policy in Ludhiana that helped increase revenue. They are two sides of the same coin. I raised the issue of illegal encroachments on thousands of acres of land. The system said ‘no’. We formed the government on drugs issue. I said that people are not going to spare us. Let this be a deterrent for future generations. There is special task force report. As minister, I was speaking and Jagdish Bhola was giving statements against (Bikram Singh) Majithia. The court said there was enough prima facie evidence to proceed against him. I said take action, but the system said it has not read the report. I am telling you only one-hundredth of what happened. On sacrilege issue on which Akalis were running scared, the assembly session was called to fool people. A commission and an SIT were set up. If someone is killed, who sets up SIT? Inspector registers case, investigates, takes action, and the matter goes to court. There was evidence available. The system said ‘we will do in the last six months and make it an election issue’. They made me renewable energy and power minister, but I said ‘no’ and rejected the system that ignored my proposals for the welfare of the people of Punjab. I went home, introspected and meditated. They mislead people. They do not want to tell what they have done on loan waiver. Why no white paper on power purchase agreements? What about cheap power? They have again remembered Sidhu before the (assembly) polls. I was invited to CM’s house and told ‘take this’ (ministry). What had changed? I have never sought any post.But you were part of the system, first as minister and are now as an MLA.Who allows you to work in the system? What’s the value of a legislator? The system is ruined. It has mortgaged Punjab. You don’t want the officers to be accountable to them (MLAs and ministers). People did not elect officers. They elected ministers and MLAs. Power of the people must return to the people. I have no personal fight with anyone. There is no personal agenda.But, why didn’t you fight the system while being part of it?How? I have told you the system said ‘no’. If you are close to these two families and do what they want, then everything gets done.Which two families you are talking about?You are smart. You know this. Everyone knows this.You have access to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former president Rahul Gandhi and must have raised these issues with them. What did they do about all this?I cannot answer that question. I can only answer what is in my hands. I discussed these things with them. This is all I have discussed with the three-member committee. I have apprised everyone in the party, not for myself but for the people. Now they have given jobs to the sons of two Congress MLAs.What is wrong with that?There are so many things wrong with this. Is it on merit? What is the ground for giving this job? Sympathy? Who do you want to sympathise with - the man standing last in the queue, poorest of the poor or the privileged after two generations? This is against the spirit of the Constitution. You are tarnishing the party. The day my son was appointed assistant advocate general, he resigned. The day my wife was appointed chairperson with cabinet rank, she left it. That’s why I speak up with clear conscience and courage.What role do you want?I do not want any role. I want this agenda implemented. I want benefit of people. I want sacrilege issue solved. I want cheap power. I want solutions.How do you fix in six months what, according to you, couldn’t be done in last four-and-a-half years of your party’s rule in Punjab?If ifs and ands were pots and pans, there would have been no takers. There are no ifs and buts. If you give me the power to change people’s lives, I will do it. Why do you think people made me win five elections?So, you want power?I have asked for nothing. The power is already with me but there is a bigger power which overrules and says ‘sit down’. Either you are with us, or no. At the time of elections, they want Sidhu. They changed my portfolio, and I left. So why do they remember me again ? Why are they giving me ministry? What has happened now? I am not a party to their wrongdoings.Your party colleagues say you are overambitious and want the top job?If 200 people say something about you, does it become true. These are just diversionary tactics to mislead. I have no personal agenda with anyone. People will decide who I am. They give the power. Have I asked for something? Let anyone prove that I have asked for any position from anyone.The chief minister says you joined the Congress only five years ago, while there are many long-time party leaders.A man loses three elections, loses his security deposit, polls 736 votes, forms his party and then goes running to madam Gandhi and becomes president in six months. Us nu surkhab de parr lagge si. Was he a taksali ( traditional Congressman) ?You are referring to Capt Amarinder Singh?You tell me who lost his security deposits. Who lost from Talwandi Sabo? Who lost to (Prem Singh) Chandumajra. Three elections. I was repeatedly requested to join (Congress). Prashant Kishor had come to me 60 times. I am still standing on my agenda.Then what is the crisis in the Congress?Crisis is simple. Nobody is prepared to do this (fulfil the agenda). Everybody is prepared to loot. These two people have looted the state. They have made the state debt-ridden, finished it. They have gone against their promises. I am raising people’s voice.Democracy is all about numbers. Capt Amarinder Singh has a majority of MLAs on his side.How do you know? Capt Amarinder Singh is not the Congress. The Congress is the high command. Who is he to say that doors are closed for me? I am talking about the beadbi (sacrilege) issue, and he is saying fight election with me. What is he doing?But the high command made him the CM?We made him the chief minister. We also campaigned. I was campaigning for whom? Under whose name? Had he fulfilled the promises, we would have been singing his praises. Why this resentment? It is not just me; all are upset.If everyone is upset, why is the high command not changing the leadership?I can only talk about my agenda. The high command is supreme. Let them decide.There is a perception in some quarters that the high command is weak.Don’t put words into my mouth. The high command was ruling this country six years ago. It ruled India for 70 years. The high command is not our topic of discussion. It is supreme. I am a soldier.Why couldn’t the high command bring about a course correction?You ask them. I don’t question them. I discuss with them.How come Sidhu is seen as a lone ranger?Who says so? 78 MLAs are my group. If nobody was supporting me, would you be talking about me? Why do people criticise me? You are criticised when you are strong. Zikr ussi ka hota hai jiski fiqr hoti hai. Trust characteran te hunda hai, kirdaran te hunda hai. That which needs to be proven is not worth a toss. In a democracy, proof is what people think about you.Capt Amarinder says that Navjot Sidhu is like my son and the position in the cabinet is lying vacant for him and he can come and take it.You insult a person, remove him and then single him out because he is asking justice for sacrilege. You see him through your insecurity and then you say he is your son. What did you do to all of his wishes for the welfare of people of Punjab? Did I ask anything for myself? I rejected every offer that you made for my family and me. I have rejected all your posts offered to me. Why would he make personal attacks on me? Have I made any personal attacks on him? Why did he say I met Kejriwal? Do you say that to a son?Aren’t you asking for too much?This is what the people are asking. This is what the president of Punjab Congress asked. This is what the MLAs asked for. This is what he said publicly. Why are they giving me ministry? What has happened now?There is a perception that you enjoy very good equity with the Gandhi family and that’s your only strength in the party.Is that so? Did they make me win five elections? What was his strength when he ran to them after making a party, after losing his deposit two times. Somebody has to be your boss.Capt Amarinder has repeatedly said that parties operate on the principle of seniority (interrupts).What was his seniority in the Congress at that time when he was made president in six months? A person who lost his security deposit and would not be given ticket. Sidhu is a five-time MP and come to Congress after giving up as member of the Rajya Sabha. What was his locus standi? What was the perception at that time? The perception was made by the high command. I have faith in the high command.You have been camping in Patiala for several months. Why did you leave Amritsar and come here?My father built this house in 1960. I have come here to my house after 15 years to recover from a life-threatening disease. Is that a crime? If someone feels scared and tells me to fight against him, I rubbished it.But, doesn’t your criticism of the Congress government about unkept promises show it in a poor light ahead of assembly polls?Who am I to judge? Do not blame the party for one man’s failure. Everyone was raising the beadbi issue. Why he didn’t do it? Now, 25 MLAs are questioning these jobs (to sons on MLAs). I do not assess the govt or any individual. I am not a party to their wrongdoings If anyone can declare it pass or fail, it is the people of Punjab. Just try to hear their voice. I only raise the voice of people.If they have not been able to do what people want, who is responsible – the government, CM or the party?I do not get into the blame game. He has to take the responsibility.You are saying things that the opposition says?No. Each one of the Congress MLAs is asking why justice has not been delivered sacrilege cases. Punjab Congress president has said this.What went wrong?He will tell. How can I tell? When you get into a bus, it is written there that sawari apne samaan di aap zimmedar hai.A new SIT has been set up to investigate the Kotkapura police firing case. Are you hopeful of quick action?When you set up three SITs, evidence becomes weak. I am a lawyer and that’s why I was asking questions. Did they pay attention? When four SIT members ran away, it is for the home minister to see why that happened. Who was there to supervise? Or, was it deliberate? He was to answer these questions. When they say votes were cast in the name of CM, then he should reply to all these things.The Kharge committee gave its report 10 days ago with its recommendations. If nothing comes out of it, what will be your next step?Agar meri chachi de muchchan hundian, main ohnu chacha na kehnda (If my aunt had a moustache, she would be my uncle). I live for what is in my hands. What is there tomorrow is not in my hands. The past is a bucket full of ashes. Between yesterday’s regret and today’s opportunity, I will take the latter. My intentions are clear and there are no covert operations in my life.How true are the reports that you are adamant on the PCC president’s post?Who said so? Prove it. In 17 years of politics, I have never asked for a position.Capt Amarinder is on record that you tried to be deputy CM with charge of home dept.Trash! He lies every day. He said things about my meetings (with AAP). Has he proved it?. What nonsense he is talking about? Talk about issues. Why is he showing his back to issues such beadbi, loan waiver and white paper? What have you done about drugs? Give your report card.There is a profusion of billboards and posters in Patiala, saying ‘Captain for 2022’. In case the Congress goes into the assembly polls under Capt’s leadership, will you campaign for the party?I will stay on my agenda. I will not speculate. As for posters, I have never asked anyone to put up a poster. There are 1,000 posters of mine. There are Bajwa’s posters. They don’t mean anything? Question is how many posters are there in the hearts of people. Apne mooh shadi mubarak kare jao, ohda ki hunda hai. There is no need for posters because people know who has done what. As for campaigning, there are no ‘ifs’ in my life. Let’s see what happens tomorrow.Punjab Police claims that people who did sacrilege have been arrested. What justice do you want?I used to hear chameleons change colour. I have not heard this statement about the arrests, but we will play for you what he said openly (asks an associate to play a clip of Amarinder’s statement in the run-up to the state polls on police firing in which he had promised action against the then CM Badal).Why is it taking so long to resolve the Congress crisis?How would I know? I don’t think it is a crisis. It is a difference of opinion.What is your assessment of the party in Punjab?I am loyal soldier of the party. I will fight.Do you want leadership change in Punjab?Why do you say that? I have never said that. I want things done.How do you respond to allegations that you are power hungry?(Laughs) I will not waste my breath. Ask the people of Punjab.Who is the Captain of Punjab?I will not answer this question. This is a TRP question. Let us talk about people of Punjab and welfare of the state.You seem to be upping the ante at a time when the high command is trying to resolve the issue. Aren’t you jumping the gun?Why would I? They are my bosses. I go public for the people of Punjab, not for my personal interest.The CM calls this indiscipline.Is challenging your own MLA to fight with him from his own constituency, accusing his own MLAs, threatening them discipline? Is that what discipline is? You asked for it.What next?The high command has to decide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/captain-is-not-the-congress-i-ll-fight-says-navjot-sidhu-101624220794352.html

Taking note of this, Panipat superintendent of police (SP) issued directions to all police stations to booked persons filing false complaints under Sections 182 (false information with intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Officials said most such complaints were related to crimes against women, snatching or assault. A total of 39 complaints of crimes against women filed in the various police stations of the district were found to be false during the investigation.On being contacted, Panipat superintendent of police Shashank Kumar Sawan said action is being taken against people whose complaints were found false during the investigation. “Yes, dealing with false cases is also a time-consuming exercise for the police as cops work on the complaints of crimes against women immediately after the complaint is filed,” he saidHe added that the priority of the police was to register the FIR immediately after getting a complaint. At this point, police cannot identify whether the complaint was filed to target someone so, it becomes matter of investigation, the SP said.Police officials dealing with such cases said there were also instances where the complaints were filed to target a person or a family. In some false complaints of rape, the complaints deliberately delay recording the statement before the magistrate under Section 164 CrPC to settle the case outside and have an opportunity to make a deal with their ‘accused’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/50-false-complaints-in-twomonths-panipat-cops-in-a-tizzy-101624220434221.html

They came armed with black flags but the BJP leader did not turn up. After waiting and raising slogans against the government till 3pm, the farmers left the site.But around 6pm, three hours after the farmers had left, Dhankar arrived at the venue. As soon as the farmers got information about his arrival, they reassembled at the venue. The BJP leader, however, was whisked away amid heavy police deployment. This agitated the farmers, who blocked the Karnal-Yamunanagar highway. The farmers also accused the cops of manhandling a farmer.Jagdip Singh Aulakh, a local leader of BKU (Charuni), said, “We had got information about the programme from social media and gathered the farmers to register our protest.”Farmers’ bodies have been protesting at all public functions involving the leaders of the ruling regime in Haryana. Protest is political, says DhankarLater during an interaction with mediapersons at BJP office in Karnal, Dhankar said, “This agitation is political. People who are leading this agitation have political interests. The (new farm) laws are not being imposed on anybody forcibly. These are optional. We want the farmers to get better prices for their produce,” said Dhankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dhankar-farmers-caught-in-cat-and-mouse-game-in-karnal-101624220254568.html

Holding a panchayat on Sunday, the village residents said many of them have to commute to Delhi on a daily basis for work and they have been suffering due to the farmers’ protest. They said that they will start an agitation of their own if the farmers don’t clear the road. Ramphal Saroha, one of the organisers of the panchayat, said, “We are in solidarity with the farmers but we are suffering due to their blockade. Many people of Kundli villages who work in Delhi are facing troubles in commuting. If farmers don’t open one side of the road in the next seven days, we will hold a massive gathering in Delhi,” he added.Reacting sharply to the panchayat’s decision, Samyukta Kisan morcha leaders alleged the panchayat was called people supporting the Bharatiya Janata Party. “Locals have been supporting the farm agitation. A few people backed by the BJP are holding such meetings to defame us. We will hold a protest march across the nation on June 26 to mark the completion of seven months of the agitation. On Monday, we will protest against BJP-JJP leaders on the occasion of Yoga day,” the SKM leaders added in a press statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sonepat-village-panchayat-wants-farmers-to-lift-blockade-on-route-to-delhi-101624219595926.html

Now, we have inserted iron pipes in the ground and constructed a pucca structure in the middle of the highway with the help of cement and bricks. Two lanes have been left untouched for the passage of vehicles,” said Khera Khap president Satbir Pahalwan.Randhir Singh, another farmer, said they have been waiting for the government’s proposal to hold talks to end the deadlock. “If the government does not address our issues, we will continue our stir till 2024,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/agitating-farmers-build-pucca-structure-near-jind-s-khatkar-toll-plaza-101624219414523.html

Even as the party has not made any formal announcement on his candidature, the veteran leader has been holding meetings in the segment. He was first elected as MLA from Dakala (now Sanaur) in 1985 by defeating Congress heavyweight Lal Singh and became a minister. Ever since, he has been changing assembly segments. Besides Dakala (1985), Chandumajra contested the assembly polls from Lehra (2007) and Sirhind (2012). He never contested the assembly polls from the same seat. Also, he remained MP from Patiala (1996, 1998) and Anandpur Sahib (2014) but contested unsuccessfully from Patiala (1999) and Anandpur Sahib (2019). Ghanaur is considered a tough seat for SAD, as Congress MLA Madan Lal Jalalpur secured a massive lead of more than 30,000 in the assembly and Lok Sabha elections for the party. Chandumajra remained MP from Patiala by defeating Sant Ram Singla in 1996 and Congress heavyweight Captain Amarinder Singh in 1998. He lost in the 1999 parliamentary polls, when Preneet Kaur (Congress) defeated him as he was candidate of splinter Akali Dal — Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal led by Gurcharan Singh Tohra. He didn’t contest polls in 2004 and formed his own splinter group SAD (Longowal), which he merged with SAD in 2007. In 2007, he contested from Lehra, while in 2012 he was in the fray from Sirhind for assembly elections, but lost in both. His son Harinderpal Singh Chandumajra was elected MLA from Sanaur in 2017. Chandumajra said that he has contested from tough seats on his party’s directive. “I have defeated heavyweights like Amarinder Singh and Ambika Soni and will win in the 2022 assembly elections too,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exmp-chandumajra-shifts-base-to-ghanaur-segment-for-assembly-polls-101624219295259.html
21-06-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers fear flooding of land due to upcoming dhusi bandh in Tarn Taran village||A forthcoming 1,000-foot-long dhusi bandh (embankment) along the Beas river at Dhunda village of Tarn Taran district has become a bone of contention between the administration and local farmers who are claiming that the work will leave thousands of acres of agriculture land prone to flooding.The government has already approved ₹1 crore for the purpose but the farmers say the embankment will protect only 150 acres of land that belongs to the village sarpanch, Sarwan Singh, who is affiliated to the state’s ruling Congress. They say if the dhusi bandh is constructed, nearly 2,000 acres of land will become vulnerable to the river’s gushing waters. The administration, on the other hand, claims that in the absence of embankment, the river will inundate nearly 3,000 acre land of other villages this monsoon season. The Dhunda residents have now started an indefinite protest at the bandh site with nearly 100-200 farmers, including women, taking part in it on a daily basis. They say they would not allow the administration to go ahead with the construction work at any cost. Baldev Singh, who owns 8 acres of land along the riverbed, said, “We have been asking for a dhusi bandh from Dhunda to Munda Pind village on both sides of the river. The demand was accepted, but the government is not paying attention to it. Now, it is being done to save the land of sarpanch Sarwan Singh, who is a close associate of MLA Ramanjit Singh Sikki.” Nirvail Singh, another farmer who owns 26 acres of land, said, “If the government is really serious about our problem, the river should be given a canal-like shape by paving both its sides. And the farmers whose land will fall in the riverbed should be compensated.”Tarn Taran sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Rajneesh Arora said, “The project is to strengthen the already existing bandh. If it is not paved, the river water will cause damage to thisands of acres of farmland in the coming monsoon season. We will not allow the farmers to stop the construction work.”He added, “The sarpanch has nothing to do with the project. The farmers are deliberately giving it a political colour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-fear-flooding-of-land-due-to-upcoming-dhusi-bandh-in-tarn-taran-village-101624219294246.html

Kejriwal shared the information about his visit on Twitter. “Punjab wants change. The Aam Aadmi Party is the only hope. See you at Amritsar tomorrow,” he tweeted in Punjabi. Though he or his party did not disclose the purpose of his visit, he is likely to induct Kunwar Vijay into the party fold in the holy city, sources said. Kejriwal had earlier visited the state in March this year to address a maha kisan panchayat in Moga. When contacted, Kunwar Vijay, who led the special investigation team (SIT) probing the high-profile post-sacrilege police firing cases, did not confirm the development. He, however, hinted at “starting a new kind of politics”. “Whenever I have such plan, I will inform you,” he said. He also refused to comment on Kejriwal’s visit to Amritsar. “Joining a party and its timing are my personal choices. After all, I am a citizen with the right to enter politics. You will see what kind of politics we will do. Our kind of politics is mentioned in our holy scriptures” The party in a statement said Kejriwal will address a press conference in presence of state president and MP Bhagwant Mann and others “on an important issue” at Circuit House in the city.

21-06-2021||Chandigarh||Former Jalandhar Youth Congress president shot dead||A former Jalandhar (rural) Youth Congress president, Sukhmeet Singh ‘Deputy’ (43), was shot dead in broad daylight by three unidentified assailants in the Gopal Nagar area of the city on Thursday. Sukhmeet was convicted in the 2008 Mickey kidnapping case and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Mickey, son of film distributor and developer Subhash Nanda, was released by the kidnappers for a ransom of ₹1 crore of which ₹65 lakh was recovered after their arrest. Sukhmeet, who was held guilty in the kidnapping case in 2011, had come out of jail after completing his sentence. Deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Gurmeet Singh said Sukhmeet, also elected councillor in 2007, was going from Workshop Chowk to Gopal Nagar on a bike when a car following him hit his two-wheeler from behind. Sukhmeet fell from the bike and the assailants fired 10-11 rounds at him. The victim sustained 8-9 bullet injuries and was rushed to a private hospital where he was declared brought dead.” “We are trying to procure CCTV footage from the area besides recording statements of his family members. We have got the registration number of the car used by assailants and investigation is underway,” the DCP added. The police said the motive behind the murder was not clear yet. Sukhmeet had enmity with some inmates in jails where he served life term. “We are probing all the angles,” Gurmeet Singh said. Sukhmeet’s cousin Rajbir Singh said he (Sukhmeet) received a call in the afternoon and went to attend a birthday party saying he will return soon. “We received a call after 5-10 minutes that Sukhmeet had a fight with someone. But when we reached the spot we found him dead. We have shared details with the police,” he added. The body was sent for the postmortem. The police said they had initiated the process of registering a case under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code. Jalandhar police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar said they have got some major clues and the case will be cracked soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/former-jalandhar-youth-congress-president-shot-dead-101624219238369.html
21-06-2021||Chandigarh||Divide deepens in Cong govt over jobs to MLAs’ sons; 13 ministers, MPs back Capt||The divide in the ruling Congress in Punjab deepened on Sunday as at least nine ministers and four MPs endorsed the state cabinet’s decision to give government jobs to sons of two party MLAs and slammed those who criticised it. These leaders lashed out at the critics, including Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and other party leaders, of the decision for failing to appreciate the “state policy that has been in force for many years now”. Cabinet ministers Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi, Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, Vijay Inder Singla, Aruna Chaudhary, Sunder Sham Arora, Gurpreet Singh Kangar, Balbir Singh Sidhu, OP Soni, Bharat Bhushan Ashu and MPs Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Ravneet Singh Bittu, Jasbir Singh Dimpa and Mohammad Sadiq were among those named in the joint statement. The decision to give appointments to sons of Congress MLA Fateh Jang Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey on “compassionate grounds” was taken by the state cabinet at a virtual meeting on Friday amid strong opposition by five cabinet ministers. Jakhar, Gidderbaha MLA Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Singh Nagra had slammed the move on Saturday. Responding to criticism, the ministers and MPs termed the collective decision of the cabinet to give government jobs as correct and in line with appointments given to similarly situated persons in the past. Lal Singh, chairman, Punjab Mandi Board, also came out strongly in support of the decision and advised all political leaders of the Congress to refrain from making any statement that could potentially weaken the party. Amarinder’s backers, while giving details of initiatives taken by the government to accord top priority to the ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar Te Karobar Mission’, said the state has been giving jobs to various classes of people keeping in view the hardship faced by them as a result of unforeseen and tragic circumstances. “Apart from terrorism-affected families, jobs and/or financial assistance has been given to handicapped persons, rape survivors and the families of the 1984 riot victims, defence personnel killed in action and government employees who die in harness to name a few,” they said. Giving details of appointments given in the past to families of terrorism-affected families, it was pointed out that there are at present at least five such officers in the Punjab IAS cadre who had originally been appointed to the Punjab Civil Service (Executive) on these grounds. They further cited the case of the department of excise and taxation where 108 jobs, including two ETOs, have been given to the victims on these grounds. Similarly, six terror victims had been appointed as naib tehsildar and many other were given appointments as DSP, inspector, etc in other departments and continue to serve on senior positions in the state, they said. Petrol pumps, ration depots besides other self-employment avenues have been provided on priority to such families. The victims of the 1984 Sikh riots have also been given similar benefits in addition to financial aid, they said.It’s ‘horse trading’, says Pargat; Nawanshahr MLA seeks relookCongress MLA Pargat Singh on Sunday questioned the Captain Amarinder Singh-led government’s decision of giving jobs to sons of two ruling party legislators, terming it “horse-trading” to keep the leaders on his side. Addressing a press conference in Jalandhar, the former Olympian said, “What kind of perception we were creating by giving jobs to sons of two MLAs? Despite being opposed by his five cabinet colleagues, the chief minister firmly took the decision of giving jobs. Why didn’t he (CM) take decisions on other issues?” Also, Congress MLA from Nawanshahr Angad Singh urged the state government to relook at the decision of giving jobs to sons of two party legislators. He said he will request the party legislators Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa and Rakesh Pandey to reconsider the decision of accepting jobs for their sons. Instead they should contribute in giving jobs to the needy, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/divide-deepens-in-cong-govt-over-jobs-to-mlas-sons-13-ministers-mps-back-capt-101624219176497.html

These also don’t reflect the fact that Chandigarh is the first planned city of independent India. The Zirakpur-Chandigarh entry point was beautified long back, but has lost all its sheen now,” said a senior UT official, associated with the project.“Not all the points will be covered. The emphasis is on covering roads which are public transport routes,” the official said.Panchkula-Chandigarh entry point near Mauli Jagran, leading to Chandigarh Railway Station; Chandigarh-Zirakpur entry on Chandigarh-Ambala Road and Mohali-Chandigarh entry leading to Airport Road in Mohali are among the points which will be beautified.To prepare the detailed landscaping plan, services of the landscaping consultant have been availed. “The work is expected to start at the Chandigarh-Panchkula entry point in Mauli Jagran. The architectural plan for beautification is ready for this site,” said the official.Views of Panchkula MLA and Haryana legislative speaker Gian Chand Gupta, who had also expressed interest in beautification of this point, will also be taken. A meeting is scheduled for Monday to discuss the plan.After the architectural plans get the go-ahead, the UT engineering department which is the implementation authority, will prepare the cost estimates for the project. Thereafter, tenders will be floated for the construction work.Landscaping in sync with city’s architectural ethos“The beautification mainly involves landscaping of these entry points, which will be in sync with the planning and architectural ethos of the city,” said the official.The city has a specific theme for trees on its streets, which will be followed in the landscaping of these points also. “Commercial trees like eucalyptus, which were lately used alongside roads even in Chandigarh, will be substituted with fruit bearing, ornamental and flowering trees and decorative plants. Here, the vision and concepts set by Dr MS Randhawa, the first administrator of the city and noted horticulturalist, will be followed,” added the official.Dr Randhawa had played a key role in the selection of trees and overall beautification of the city. “Along with city’s planner Le Corbusier, Dr Randhawa had constituted a landscape committee of experts. A comprehensive list of plants and trees was prepared, with careful cataloguing of their shapes, colours and textures, which was later used to create particular themes on specific roads,” said the official.Notably, the UT engineering department recently also took up the beautification of the road dividers under its jurisdiction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-entry-points-to-chandigarh-to-be-beautified-101624218874199.html

Earlier only those who travelled from far away were affected but now even local farmers, who drive their produce into Chandigarh from nearby villages, are charging more. The supply of vegetables coming into the mandis has also started to dwindle,” said Satbir Singh, mandi supervisor with Punjab Mandi Board.Singh said a rise in the prices of vegetables like potatoes and tomatoes can be attributed to large distances, however it was concerning that even prices of bottle gourd and pumpkin were increasing.“Farmers are using nets to safeguard summer vegetables from rain. They are adding the cost of using this technique to the vegetables’ price,” he said.Meanwhile, with the administration lifting the Sunday lockdown, the apni mandi at Sector 34 opened after over a month. Other apni mandis are also recording a rise in footfall as Covid cases continue to decline.As per mandi officials, the Sector 34 mandi on Sunday used to get most customers and the decision to reopen it will help farmers as well as people.“Earlier mandis would be closed by 5pm but now the timing has been extended to 7pm, which is helpful for people preferring to step out in the evening due to heat or day work hours,” said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rising-fuel-rates-in-punjab-push-vegetable-prices-up-in-chandigarh-101624218694147.html

As per the figures provided by the Haryana education department, 89,138 private school students moved to government schools during the academic session 2021-22. Last year (2020-21), around 1.46 lakh students had made the switch. The education department’s data further shows that as many as 19.95 lakh students have been enrolled in the state’s government schools this year while the figure stood at 21.78 lakh last year. Private schools, on the other hand, have reported only 15.78 lakh new admissions this year, compared to 29.83 lakh last year. This is a 47% percent dip in enrollments at private schools this year. What is drawing more kids to govt schoolsA senior official, not wishing to be named, said, “We are expecting more students to shift from private to government schools by the end of this month. Not just do government schools provide education free of cost, but also offer better infrastructure as compared to private schools. Besides, students can also avail benefits such as mid-day meals here.” The official added that parents of many students have been rendered jobless or are facing financial constraints due to the pandemic-induced lockdown. “At a time like this, some private schools are refusing to enroll students in the next class until the previous year’s dues are cleared. So, most parents are transferring their wards to government schools,” the official added. “Besides, in view of the anticipated third wave, which is likely to hit children the most, it is unlikely that schools may open up any time soon. So, parents are enrolling their children in government schools, that are likely to be located close to their homes, than sending the kids to a private school located miles away,” he added. On reports of private schools not issuing transfer certificates and other documents to students, the official said no school has the authority to deny documents to a student when she/he wants to move to another school. Parent speakRakesh Kumar, a resident of Charkhi Dadri, said he shifted both his daughters to a government school as he lost his job at a private factory in Gurugram after the second wave. “It became difficult for me to run the house. So I decided to move my kids to a government school. There is uncertainty over the opening of schools and further the private school, where my children were previously enrolled, had refused to reduce the fee even when schools are closed,” Kumar added. A rough patch for private schoolsTwo private school owners –one from Hisar and another from Bhiwani – requesting anonymity, said with no sign of schools opening up, they have hit a rough patch. “It has been nearly one-and-a-half year since we have not had physical classes. Some parents told us that they have been sending their children don’t gauge much during online classes so they have had to send them for tuitions. So they ask us why they should pay the full school fee,” one of the private school owners said.Another owner said, “Some parents are also unwilling to pay the fee as they feel that when children are not physically visiting the school, why should they pay charges such as library fee etc. But what the parents don’t understand is that we still have to bear the maintenance charges regardless of whether these services are being used. For instance, we had bought buses on loan. When parents refuse to pay the full fee, we struggle to pay off the installments.” Edu minister lauds govt schools Meanwhile, Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal Gurjar applauded the teachers and educational staff for increasing enrollments in government schools for the second year in a row.“This year, Class 10 and 12 exams were cancelled but last year, both the toppers in Haryana board’s Class 12 exams were from government schools. We have started online classes on Edusat and local cable TV channels free of cost. We have also decided to provide laptops to students so that they can access online education if a third wave hits the state,” the education minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nearly-50-dip-in-private-school-enrollments-in-haryana-this-year-101624218515413.html

The amount is suspected to be the proceeds from the ₹393 crore GST scam unearthed in November last year. Yogesh is a distant uncle of the kingpin of the multi-crore GST scam, Sahil Jain, who was arrested by the department in November. Sahil had availed input tax credit (ITC) worth ₹33 crore through the bogus billing scam.The department was tracking the crucial documents and whereabouts of the accused Sahil Jain when they landed at Yogesh Jain’s house and caught him evading GST too.Principal commissioner Ashutosh Baranwal said that Sahil had availed ITC with ₹33 crores and it was believed that some crucial documents relating to the GST fraud were hidden at his relatives’ house.During the search operation at the house of Yogesh, who is running a firm called M/s Maha Bhagwati S Jain Traders, ₹40 lakh was recovered from the cupboard of a bedroom. When questioned about the cash, he confessed that he was evading GST by indulging in undeclared supply transactions, receiving and supplying goods without issuing proper invoices, and mostly generating ‘Kacha bills’ for the goods supplied, said Baranwal.The department officials said the amount has been seized and the matter is under investigation, following which appropriate action will be taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gst-bogus-billing-scam-rs-40-lakh-seized-from-ludhiana-hosiery-trader-101624218275973.html

21-06-2021||Chandigarh||Friends, canteen food, youth fests: Ludhiana’s college freshers say they have missed out on a lot||From side-splitting anecdotes to sobering misadventures, for 19-year-old Bharti Arora the best conversation starters always seemed to originate on the college or university campus, but unfortunately when it was finally time for her to embark upon the much-touted “golden phase of life”, the pandemic struck and online classes became the way of life. “Really, the coronavirus pandemic could not have come at a worse time!” laments Arora, who is pursuing bachelor of commerce at Khalsa College for Women, Civil Lines. “I had been looking forward to participating in the youth festival and inter-college dance festivals the most, but the virus threw a wrench into the works and colleges remained closed for the whole year.” On the threshold of their adult lives, the newly inducted batch of college students feels it has been robbed of a pivotal milestone. Asked what they have missed out on while home-bound due to the pandemic, students listed freshers’ and farewell parties, a chance to get ready for college after years in uniform, evening strolls on the college lawns, canteen food, student body elections, cultural events and the quiet of the reading room of the library. Around 25,000 first-year students enrolled at Panjab Univertsity-affiliated colleges will be starting with their second year in two months time without having enjoyed campus life. It was the lure of the vast college library that had Government College for Girls BA first-year student Manveer Kaur on tenterhooks. “ I was planning on issuing four-five books a week but thanks to the pandemic I have had to make do with my collection at home.” It was greenery, lawns and the iconic annual freshers’ party that had sold Kaur on the idea of studying at Government College for Girls over some colleges in Chandigarh. Little did she know that she would not get to enjoy the facilities at all. ‘Deprived of a chance to develop life skills’A teacher, who did not wish to be named said, “Interacting with classmates and participating in extra-curricular activities teaches students team work, time management, and an assortment of life skills. However, the freshers could not experience it last year.” When 18-year-old Geetika Kalra was admitted to Guru Nanak Khalsa College for Women, Model Town, in the bachelor of arts course last year she was excited to impress classmates with her oratory and anchoring skills. However, now she spends most days listening to virtual presentations on her laptop. “I would participate in all events at school, but I have not gotten an opportunity at college so far. It is surreal to think that we have been at home for a year,” she says. However, the silver lining is that Kalra has been able to make two new friends during online classes. ‘Haven’t been able to make friends’However, Rohit Kumar, 19, of Satish Chander Dhawan Government College, says he hardly knows anybody in class. “Last year was tough in itself because of the pandemic and attending online classes for two whole semesters was also a challenge. I worry about how I will cope once college reopens as I have no friends there.” “While teachers are doing their best by organising online seminars and contests, the virtual is no substitute for the real. Lack of physical interactions, I feel, has hampered our growth and all-round personality development,” he said . DD Jain College for Women principal Sarita Behl said, “All colleges have switched to online classes during the pandemic and students have not been able to participate in extra cultural activities. So, whenever colleges reopen, we will hold more cultural and sports events.”Colleges in Ludhiana have been shut since March last year. While final-year students were able to visit their colleges earlier this year to attend physical classes for two months and then for practicals, first-year undergraduate students have not been able to visit campus since their induction in August 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/friends-canteen-food-youth-fests-ludhiana-s-college-freshers-say-they-have-missed-out-on-a-lot-101624218214184.html

Justice Mittal, former judge of the Allahabad high court, is framing a draft law for the Uttar Pradesh government to help check rising population of the state. “The draft law will be prepared in the next two months and the report will be submitted to the state government,” Justice Mittal said.Stressing on the requirement of such a law, Justice Mittal said: “Resources are already overstretched due to increasing population. Be it medical facilities, food grains and jobs, everything is under stress due to rising population.” “Imagine if the population of the state remains 22 crore to 23 crore even after 20 years, then what will be the state’s condition? There will be availability of everything in abundance for the future generation. There will be no scarcity of resources,” Justice Mittal said.Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in the country with a population of around 22 crore. “While drafting this law, all aspects will be looked into and exhaustive study of all such laws will be carried out,” he added. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has already announced the gradual implementation of the two-child policy for availing of government benefits in Assam. However, tea garden workers and members of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities have been exempted from its purview.Justice Mittal’s report and a draft bill on Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion had played a key role in the framing of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Act 2021.The State Law Commission had also submitted a draft law to the state government for removal of religious structures from public places, recommending a three-year prison term and fine for violators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-law-commission-framing-draft-law-on-population-growth-101624217674149.html

I will again write to the authorities to change the law for the sake of the growers.”To fell the old walnut trees, growers have to seek permission from the Kashmir divisional commissioner which takes years. “I had suggested making the process easy. The UT administration should to take a decision.”Over 95% of the land under organic fruit cultivation grows walnut. As much as 1.85 lakh tonne of fruit is produced in Kashmir and 85,000 tonne in the Jammu region.

I can neither axe them nor replace them with new varieties. I have tried to seek permission, but all in vain,” said Surjeet Singh a resident of Baramulla.A senior officer of department said strict laws give rise to corruption. “When the laws are too tough, people go for unfair means to axe or prune the walnut trees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jk-horticulture-seeks-end-to-ban-on-axing-old-walnut-trees-101624217196555.html

He said the construction of the tunnel will be complete by August next year. The CM said this while he was being briefed about the proposed alignment on Shimla bypass four-laning project from Kaithlighat to Dhalli section, and construction of a highway tunnel parallel to the Dhalli tunnel under the Shimla Smart City Mission. The CM was apprised that five tunnels were required to be constructed on the Kaithlighat-Dhalli section. The present proposal of twin tunnels from Bhattakufar to Dhalli will completely bypass the urban area and bare minimum forest area/structures will be impacted during the construction of this four lane project. Thakur said that the present proposal of this four-lane bypass must have negligible effect on the lives of residents of the area. He expressed hope that separate twin tunnel proposed to connect the Sanjauli bypass will ensure better connectivity to the people of Shimla town. He also felt the need for improvement of Dhalli junction and Dhalli bypass. He suggested that since the construction of tunnels involves huge muck generation, efforts must be made for creating facilities like stadium etc. on these dumping sites for best utilisation of the land. He directed the officers of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to ensure time-bound completion of this project so that benefits could be derived in time. Thakur said that Dhalli tunnel was over 175 years old and had outlived its design life.

The meeting was called to take a call on the party’s participation in the meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on June 24. “The PAC unanimously authorised the party president to take a final decision on the matter,” PDP chief spokesperson Syed Suhail Bukhari told the media after the meeting.PAGD to adopt joint strategyMeanwhile, the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) has called for a meeting on Tuesday to discuss a joint strategy about the invitation.“PAGD leaders are to meet on June 22, 11am, at the residence of Farooq Abdullah. All constituents have been called to discuss the Centre’s invitation. The PAGD will adopt a joint strategy after this meeting,” said alliance spokesman Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami, who is also the CPI (M) general secretary.National Conference (NC) chief Farooq Abdullah will discuss with his senior colleagues and a decision to attend an all-party meeting of J&K’s leaders in New Delhi next week will be declared by Monday, said Nasir Aslam Wani, a leader of the NC on Sunday.“NC president Farooq Abdullah will discuss this with his senior colleagues. I think discussions will be complete by tomorrow. I think we will be able to tell you more by tomorrow afternoon,” he said.Party spokesman Imran Nabi Dar said, “The party president is consulting leaders individually on the issue. Then a meeting of PAGD is expected within a day or two and decision will be taken thereafter.”However, NC’s Baramulla MP Mohammad Akbar Lone told reporters that the party will participate in the Centre’s meeting. “We will talk about all the issues, including Articles 370, 35-A and statehood. Everything will be fine. It’s good that the BJP-led Centre has realised that talks should be held,” he said.Other leaderships also huddling Apni Party will be meeting on Monday to form an agenda for the Centre meeting which will be attended by party president Altaf Bukhari. People’s Conference chairman Sajjad Lone will also discuss the issue on Monday. “We are meeting tomorrow to discuss the issue,” said Adnan Ashraf, Peoples Conference spokesman.Invitations were sent out to 14 political leaders from Jammu and Kashmir, including four former chief ministers, for participation in a high-level meeting to be chaired by the prime minister, which is expected to set the road map for holding assembly elections in the UT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jk-all-party-meet-most-valley-leaders-to-take-call-on-pm-s-invite-today-101624217134168.html
21-06-2021||Lucknow||Major rivers cross danger mark in UP after heavy rainfall, alert sounded in low-lying districts||Heavy rainfall in many districts led to major rivers in Uttar Pradesh flowing near or above the danger mark and an alert was sounded in the low-lying districts of the state, officials said.Relief commissioner Ranvir Prasad said some areas of 10 districts — Bahraich, Balrampur, Gorakhpur, Pilibhit, Lakhimpur Kheri, Siddharthnagar, Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Sitapur and Shravasti — were flood-affected. Twenty-two villages in these 10 districts were marooned, he said.One death was reported in the Laliya area of Balrampur district where a person drowned in the Rapti. The SDRF (State Disaster Response Force) was trying to fish out the body, he said.The state government launched relief and rescue operations in the flood-affected villages. A total of 242 flood protection centres and 222 flood posts were set up in various districts. The distribution of flood packets started in the affected villages and 58 teams of the health department were activated in the flood-affected districts, Prasad said.According to information released by Flood Management Information System Centre (FMISC), the Ganga at Kachhala Ghat in Badaun and in Ballia was flowing at the danger mark. Also, Rapti river at Rapti barrage in Shravasti and in Balrampur district was flowing above the danger mark.“The districts in the basin of Ganga, Yamuna, Rapti and Sharda rivers have been issued fresh alert after the water level in these rivers reached the danger mark,” said Mithilesh Kumar, executive engineer, FMISC. “The district magistrates and other officials concerned have been alerted through phone calls and electronic channels,” the officer added.The Rohini river was flowing above the danger level at Trimohanighat in Maharajganj district and the Sharda at Paliya Kala in Lakhimpur Kheri.The state government deployed teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) in six districts, including Lucknow, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Bahraich, Siddharthnagar and Shravasti. Teams of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have been deployed in 11 districts.The low-laying districts, where an alert has been sounded include Muzaffarnagar, Badaun, Shahajanpur and Pilibhit in west UP and Chandauli, Varanasi, Sant Kabir Nagar, Mirzapur, Bahraich, Gonda, Basti, Gorakhpur, Maharjganj and Deoria in east UP.In the past 24 hours, the state recorded 13.5mm rainfall, which is 400 % more than the average 2.7 mm rainfall whereas the cumulative rainfall in the state is 125 mm rainfall, which is 200% more than the average 43.2mm rainfall, he said.Twelve districts recorded above 25 mm rainfall in the past 24 hours, including Azamgarh, Badaun, Varanasi, Mirzapur, Ghazipur, Sambhal, Rampur, Moradabad, Ambedkar Nagar, Ballia, Sant Kabir Nagar and Bareilly, the relief commissioner said.Gonda DM Markandey Shahi said, “We have established 45 flood posts across the district where local officials are monitoring the level of water in the river around the clock. The district also also 30 rescue boats on standby.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/major-rivers-cross-danger-mark-in-up-after-heavy-rainfall-alert-sounded-in-low-lying-districts-101624216835576.html
21-06-2021||Other||Isolated, invisible: LGBTQ scientists talk about their experience at workplace||Throughout her pre-transition period, A Mani, a mathematician and scientist at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, remained closeted, introverted and preferred working alone. “Some teachers, colleagues at times did try to say anti-gender diverse stuff to me because I appeared too femme. But I never bothered about them and their degenerate views,” said Mani, one of the very few lesbian trans-women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). Collectively, people from sexual minorities such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer persons and their allies are referred to as the LGBTQ+ community. Even as campuses endeavour to create safe spaces for sexual and gender minorities, past trauma, invisibility and discrimination is rife in this marginalised community. In celebrations to mark the Pride month — which recognises the community’s impact on history locally, nationally, and internationally — HT interviewed LGBTQ+ scientists about their experiences in STEM. A nagging sense of invisibility lingered among all the scientists interviewed by HT. Visibility matters While there are no surveys that can ascertain the number of LGBTQ+ scientists in India, community members said there were only few in number. Out of fear of ostracisation, many preferred to hide their identities. “I don’t see any reason why I can’t or shouldn’t openly assert my sexuality now, but because of the stigma and taboo experienced in the past, I don’t feel like going through the process again” said a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), on the condition of anonymity. While many of his friends and colleagues know that he is gay, this professor has “not come out of the closet entirely”. “So far I have not received any backlash, but that could be because I have shared my truth with only a selected group of people. I come from a time when discussing sexual orientation and gender identity was absolutely damned. During my school and undergraduate days, I had started to believe that I am the only one in my species. It was not until the beginning of social media in the early 2000s when I came across support groups discussing LGBTQ+ rights online that I realised the extent of invisibility,” he said. To address this lack of representation and alienation, this professor and his two friends formed Pravriti — a pan IIT support group for LGBTQ+ members of faculty, students and staff. In 2018, 20 members of Pravriti, excluding the professor, had filed a petition in the Supreme Court against section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised homosexuality and any ‘unnatural sex’. “Invisibility itself is at least a two-fold problem: one can invisibilise the LGBTQ+ scientist or invisibilise the LGBTQ+ scientist’s work. Needless to say, both have tremendous impact on the person’s work and mental health. Queer-trans scientists, who are not out, have to deal with constant mental stress of living double lives while dealing with the immense pressure of practising science in formal settings. Even queer-trans scientists who are out are met with discrimination and dismissal,” said Sayantan Datta, a queer-trans science writer, who holds a master’s degree in neural and cognitive sciences from the University of Hyderabad. Another fallout of the invisibility is that without role models, sexual and gender minority students find STEM less welcoming. Last year, IIT-B renamed its women’s cell – meant for handling sexual harassment complaints – to the gender cell. “Gender violence can happen to anybody, irrespective of their gender. It sends a message to students of all sexual orientations and gender identities that we see you and your struggles,” said Abhijit Majumder, associate professor and faculty advisor to Saathi, IIT-B’s official LGBTQ+ resource group for students, staff and faculty. Out and proud, yet isolated Mani transitioned medically and legally between 2012 and 2014 during her doctoral days. Prior to that, she preferred working independently. “The very idea of a workplace is rather new to me. Visibility meant that I had to learn to interact. Yes, it takes some effort to get used to. Many people are not aware or are ill-informed. I think that means many people may be avoiding any interaction or that they may be acting against my interests. So I have to work against the tide,” she said. Stigma, casual sexism, misgendering, jokes and hidden discriminatory rules aggravate the alienation. A 2019 survey of 1,000 UK-based physical scientists found that almost 30% of LGBTQ+ scientists and half of transgender scientists said that they had considered leaving their workplace because of an unfriendly or hostile climate or because of discrimination. Discrimination against women is a symptom that the system of academia is not healthy, said Prajval Shastri, an astrophysicist retired from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bengaluru. “The notion that science is all about merit and everything else — caste and religious lineage, gender and sexual identities — don’t matter is not borne out by evidence. When it comes to women in STEM, there is clear evidence that unconscious bias and hidden norms compromise merit, and institutes must acknowledge that,” said Shastri, who advocates intersectional feminism at academic spaces. Mental health Growing up, Mani experienced gender dysphoria—a psychological distress that results from incongruence between one’s sex assigned at birth and one’s gender identity. Being closeted only added to the distress, and she suffered from depression. Datta, earlier this year, surveyed 47 people in STEM in India, who are from the LGBTQ+ community. The survey found that 38% of respondents agreed that being LGBTQIA+ in STEM has affected their mental health. Another 38% said that being LGBTQIA+ in STEM may have impacted their mental health, although they were not sure. While most campuses now have in-house psychologists and counsellors, it is important to have counsellors who are LGBTQ-friendly, said Niruj Mohan Ramanujam, scientist at Indian Institute of Astrophysics. More than a safe space On June 17 – marked as the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia – the IIT-B professor came across a homophobic comment made by an international scientist on a global messaging group which he is a part of. The comment was flagged and the scientist was removed from the group, only to be allowed again due to procedural issues. Some members of that global group of scientists also commented that the person had the right to express an opinion, even if it is homophobic. “Had it been a racist comment, the reaction would have been different. But when it comes to gender and sexual minorities, people are willing to offer a discount to discrimination,” said the professor. Saathi at IIT-B became one of the first LGTBQ+ support groups at any IIT in 2011. Since then, it has been advocating the creation of an inclusive campus. In 2019, it became an official body with a say in hostel and cultural affairs at the institute. “With the help of Saathi, we have been able to create a safe space for our LGBTQ+ members on campus. The next step is to make it more welcoming,” said Majumder. “Sexuality of an individual sometimes evolves with time, and it is a good idea to see such an evolution getting an expressional space in the broad, plural and diversity enriched society,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-B. However, a lot more needs to be done. “Specifically for the purpose of making campuses safer and accessible for the LGBTQ community, apart from reservation, it is necessary to increase sensitisation, have related programmes, appoint qualified feminists to help with issues, provide for inclusive healthcare and infrastructure. For example, lesbian research scholars do not get to live with their spouses in special hostels, while other married straight research scholars are permitted to live together. Most non-binary identified people do not have access to gender-neutral toilets,” said Mani, whose research areas include algebra, logic, rough sets, formal approaches to vagueness and allied areas. The draft science, technology and innovation policy, issued by the ministry of science and technology last December, attempts to correct some of these problems. It proposes to offer spousal benefits to LGBTQ+ community, including retirement benefits to any partner irrespective of their gender. Many feel that gender and sexuality in STEM spaces and syllabi were invisible. For example, use of the gender-neutral pronouns ‘they’ or ‘ze’ in the academic space. Artificial intelligence (AI), too, can be discriminatory. “Many AI algorithms are trained on data sets [collected from anywhere] and the results of training are used to make predictions on other situations. Such algorithms can end up learning misogyny and toxic behaviours. People are working in this area to rectify this. Usually, it is not possible to label large data sets and rectify them. Intelligent higher order methods need to be devised,” said Mani. Need for allies “Institutions must make it explicit in their advertisements for students and faculty that they are striving to be welcoming of candidates from all caste and gender backgrounds, have bias-trained medical and psychological counsellors, and build unisex toilets,” said Shastri. Diversity and inclusion committees must be set up at institutions, with outside experts, if necessary, she said. “I believe it to be particularly important that even as all faculty must make it their cause to bring in equity, diversity and inclusion within the workplace, allyship training of the existing STEM members by expert trainers from outside the profession, in order to make the workplace welcoming of LGBTQ+ people, is critical,” said Shastri. Mani has taken up activism, promoting lesbian rights and the free software movement. “Within the free software communities, I have helped with codes of conduct in mailing lists, other forums, conferences, and have helped in initiating action against people indulging in sexist behaviour and harassment,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/isolated-invisible-lgbtq-scientists-talk-about-their-experience-at-workplace-101624216113486.html
21-06-2021||Other||2 months after results, University of Mumbai yet to begin PhD, MPhil admissions||Results for the preliminary eligibility test (PET) for PhD and MPhil aspirants were announced by the University of Mumbai (MU) in April. However, admissions for the courses are yet to take off. In a call to speed up the pending admissions process, the varsity has now decided to decentralise the process for PhD and MPhil subjects, with plans to kick-off the procedure in the next couple of weeks.“We have taken stock of the resources to make sure that we have appropriate number of guides for the students. By decentralising this admissions process, we’ll entrust each department to handle the oral exams so that the admission process can start, said B N Gaikwad, in-charge registrar, MU. He added that the varsity is currently waiting to find out if oral exams for candidates can be conducted in physical form instead of online. “If the situation permits, we will push for face-to-face meetings, but it all depends on the Covid-19 situation. If left with no choice, the process will be conducted online,” added Gaikwad.Before 2021, MU had conducted its last PET exam in December 2018, and the applications made headlines, with an almost 85% rise in PhD applicants. From 3,350 and 3,333 applications in 2016 and 2017 respectively, the varsity received 6,168 applications in 2018, with the maximum being for the science and technology streams, followed by humanities, commerce and management sector.After being unable to hold the exam due to various reasons in 2019 and due to Covid-19 in 2020, MU was expecting an even bigger turnout for the entrance exam this year. “In 2018 itself we witnessed a rise in applications because the exam was held after a break of almost 16 months. This year, PET was held after over two years. So we were not surprised to receive 11,351 applications for PhD alone,” said a senior official from MPhil and PhD department of the university.The university had originally planned to conduct PET in May 2020, for which registrations took place between February 27 and March 31. But due to the national lockdown, MU could not conduct the entrance exam. This year, registrations began in January and were extended till March, in order to accommodate students who cleared their master’s programmes in December 2020, after which the entrance exam was held between March 25 and 27.“The number of applications is almost double because applicants from last year and this year have applied together. We were also very happy to see almost 55% of the applications were that of female candidates,” said the MU official.Experts, however, feel that the rise in PhD applications will not materialise into student count due to the lack of appropriate number of guides across various departments of the university. At present, officials have confirmed that MU boasts of around 1,500 professors, associate professors as well as assistant professors who can work as guides with PhD as well as MPhil students. However, these guides are already working with enough number of students at present making it impossible for them to mentor anymore.“MU is currently understaffed and the lockdown is making matters worse, leading to delay in basic work. I submitted my thesis in January, but the research and recognition committee (RRC) for my chosen subject has not met yet, which means my final interview based on my thesis has not taken place,” said a 36-year-old PhD student, who is waiting for this doctorate to apply for higher studies abroad. “Without this PhD certificate, many like me can’t apply for higher studies or better job prospects,” he added.Gaikwad, however, confirmed that RRCs for nearly 66 of 90 subjects have already been conducted, and the process is on for the remaining subjects as well. “We are making sure that candidates who have already submitted their thesis are cleared by the individual departments at the earliest, so that the guides have more vacancies for new candidates,” added Gaikwad.In 2020-21, the total number of PhD and MPhil degrees awarded at the annual convocation ceremony dropped by over 63% compared to 2019-20 academic year. Many blamed the Covid-imposed lockdown on the small number of doctorates awarded by the varsity this year. Not only was the university and its various departments under complete shutdown for the first few months of the lockdown, but candidates also highlighted several other issues, including lack of proper e-learning resources, unavailability of remote access to science labs and/or libraries and poor internet facility, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-months-after-results-university-of-mumbai-yet-to-begin-phd-mphil-admissions-101624215933528.html
21-06-2021||Other||Cargo helps pandemic-hit Indian airlines beat the blues||The two waves of Covid-19 pandemic have severely dented the air passenger segment with the demand hitting a rock bottom in both domestic and international markets. However, amid these challenging times, the cargo segment came to the rescue of domestic airlines. A massive shift towards online buying, triggered by repeated lockdowns and restrictions on people’s movement since the first wave last year, and movement of Covid-19 vaccines, medicines and other related-essentials, led to an increased transportation of cargo with air cargo cornering a major share in it. For instance, budget carrier SpiceJet – the only passenger airline in the country with a dedicated freighter fleet – saw its cargo revenue growing by 36% in the third quarter (October-December) of the last financial year. Its bigger rival IndiGo, which has been carrying in-seat cargo on its passenger aircraft along with cargo in their belly space, logged a 9.6% growth in cargo revenue in the previous fiscal. Air cargo is carried in two modes – through dedicated cargo aircraft and the belly space of a passenger aircraft. However last year, a week after the government announced the suspension of commercial passenger services and a large number of these planes were grounded, aviation safety regulator Directorate General Civil Aviation (DGCA) allowed passenger airlines to carry cargo within cabin and on-seats to help meet demand for more supplies. In the post-pandemic period, air cargo traffic recovered faster than passenger traffic, according to credit ratings agency CRISIL. While passenger traffic for financial year (FY) 2020-21 was only 34%, cargo traffic was at 74% due to the rising demand for freight during the first wave of the pandemic led by rise in e-commerce demand and disrupted global supply chains necessitating quick transport by air. Moreover, cargo volumes in this March crossed pre-Covid levels (February 2020). The faster recovery in the cargo volumes is owing to the trade of essential supplies, primarily in the pharmaceutical, medical equipment and agricultural produce sectors, according to another ratings agency, ICRA. In the past FY (2016-2020), air cargo recorded a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3%, with domestic cargo recording a faster 6% CAGR over the same period, along with international cargo which has grown at 4.8% said CRISIL. However, the share of international cargo continues to be higher at around 60%. Starting FY2013-14, the cargo traffic had witnessed continued growth till FY2018-19, with increase in both domestic and international cargo traffic, although the growth rates had remained volatile, stated ICRA. CRISIL said the proportion of domestic cargo carried as belly cargo by airlines is expected to be around 80-85% and the remaining 15-20% by dedicated cargo during FY2015-16 to FY2019-20. The proportion of international cargo carried by foreign carriers will be 80-85% and remaining 15-20% by Indian carriers during FY2015-16 to FY2019-20. The country did not have a policy for air cargo until January 2019, said former civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu, adding that it was during his tenure that such a policy was announced to push cargo traffic amid the rapid growth in domestic passenger traffic. “The idea was to provide a backup to the airlines in the eventuality of a slowdown in passenger traffic, which is exactly happening at present. I didn’t know Covid-19 was going to come one year later. So if you don’t prepare for the worst when the going is good, you always run into difficulties,” Prabhu told HT. William Boulter, chief commercial officer at IndiGo, said that for the 2020-21 fiscal, the cargo revenue increased by 9.6%, compared to the previous year. “This has really supported IndiGo during this pandemic period when its operations have been severely impacted,” he said. “The pandemic has given us the opportunity to look at new ways of doing business. We always find new ways to combat difficult situations. We entered the crisis with no freighters but deployed around 10 A320/ A321 passenger aircraft for cargo operations as our ‘CarGo-in-cabin’ charters,” added Boulter. As per ICRA, lack of significant niche cargo (over dimensional and hazardous cargo and express shipments) and intense competition from airlines – which also carry cargo in aircraft belly – are expected to continue, restricting growth of domestic dedicated freighters in India. It also noted that airlines transport cargo at lower prices compared to dedicated freighters (given that airlines are not dependent on cargo and only operate it as an ancillary business). Observing that the Indian airline space is highly competitive and while one passenger carrier has freighter operations and another has announced plans to induct cargo aircraft, CRISIL says more players entering the cargo market may replicate the passenger space where several airlines are competing for limited demand, leading to airlines resorting to price cuts to fill aircraft. Indian airlines are structurally weak, and diversification into cargo in a changed situation seems unlikely. As the Covid-19 situation improves and capacity starts getting back into the market, belly cargo capacity would return to pre-Covid levels while the additional freight aircraft/cargo only aircraft would lead to excess capacity in the market. Furthermore, dedicated freighters command higher yields globally. The cargo yields for UPS – a US-based cargo airline – for instance, are two or two-and-a-half times more over the past three years, compared to those for Blue Dart as yields for global freighters are based on end-to-end movement of express segment, whereas for domestic freighters, it is airport-to-airport movement for the most part, according to CRISIL. “The airline continues studying the market, and as it was important not to be too influenced by the unusual demand caused by the shortage of passenger belly capacity, that will inevitably return, “ said Boulter, whose airline is set to induct four freighter aircraft into the fleet, starting next year. “We have initiated a freighter programme and are in the process of sourcing four A321CEO aircraft. The A321P2F passenger-to-freighter conversion is the most efficient narrow-bodied freighter available, offering 24 container positions and supporting a payload of up to 27 tonnes. The delivery of our first freighter is expected in the first half of 2022,” he said. As per CRISIL, air cargo is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8-10% over FY20-26, higher than the growth rate over FY2015-16 to 2019-20. According to Boulter, Indian carriers currently transport only around 10% of total export and import air cargo. “Clearly, this is not satisfactory, and IndiGo, with the acquisition of freighter aircraft and optimal use of belly space, will do its best to help redress the balance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cargo-helps-pandemic-hit-indian-airlines-beat-the-blues-101624215873515.html
21-06-2021||Bangalore||After BJP, Congress battles infighting, power tussle over Karnataka CM face||Bengaluru Far from capitalizing the growing rift within the Karnataka BJP over leadership change, the Congress in the state too finds itself in a similar position with reports of infighting emerging from within their party ranks over the chief ministerial candidate for the 2023 assembly polls.While discord between party president DK Shivakumar and opposition leader Siddaramiah is no secret, however, those who side with the leaders have unleashed a war of words on the probable Congress’s chief ministerial candidate, two years before the state heads to the polls. Zameer Ahmed Khan, the Congress legislator from Chamarajapet in Bengaluru, who continues to moot Siddaramaiah’s name has irked party president, Shivakumar, who also nurses the ambitions for the top job in the state.Though Khan has clarified that the statements were his “own opinion”, Shivakumar on Saturday issued a warning saying that everyone in the party should remain in their limits.The Congress has shown some signs of revival in recent months in the Belagavi and Maski bypolls held on April 17 as well as elections in urban local bodies ,the results of which was announced on May 1. .“There is a wave in favour of the Congress and such statements give room for growth of confusion,” R Dhruvanarayana, the working president of the party said on Sunday.Though legislators are trying to brush off the incident, they are wary that the current problems could get bigger over the next few months, making it harder for the Congress to regroup and prepare for the elections. However, they admit that the clash is due to the nursing of ambitions for the top job.“This is his best chance and he has never been closer to the opportunity than now,” said one party legislator on Sunday, referring to Shivakumar.Since Siddaramaiah joined the Congress in 2006, he has been at the helm of affairs irrespective of who holds the post of state president, making it harder for those who may not endorse him as the undisputed leader within the party.The Congress has faced similar problems in Rajasthan where the camps headed by chief minister Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot have been at each other for almost two years now. Similarly, in Punjab, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu have openly aired their differences.The leader has countered Shivakumar on several occasions, according to people aware of the developments.“This is how he (Siddaramaiah) functions,” said the legislator cited above.People aware of the developments said that Shivakumar has tried to bury the hatchet with Siddaramaiah, but with little success as the latter continues to consolidate his support base.Despite the presence of senior leaders in the Congress, the party backed Siddaramaiah in 2013 for the post of chief minister.Siddaramaiah had stormed to power on the back of the AHINDA (Kannada acronym for minorities, backward classes and Dalits) movement and challenged the dominant caste theory prevalent in the state. The Lingayats and Vokkaligas, believed to be the two largest caste groups in the state, have their axes to grind against Siddaramaiah, people aware of the developments said.The decision to accord a separate religious status to Lingayats that left out the Veerashaivas was seen as an attempt to break the community which cost Siddaramaiah the 2018 elections.The commissioning of a caste-census in 2015 (unreleased till date) was also seen as an attempt by Siddaramaiah to challenge the political dominance enjoyed by the two communities.Siddaramaiah is from the Kuruba community that backed him in 2013. But leaders like KS Eshwarappa, a senior BJP leader and minister in the Yediyurappa government, are trying to cut into this.“Caste groups support those in power,” said a senior BJP legislator to HT during an interaction last week.The legislator said that just because a person is from a community, he does not become their leader. He applied it to Yediyurappa who has so far enjoyed the support of the Lingayats and Siddaramaiah, who is believed to have the support of the Kuruba community.Analysts add that the Congress and BJP have faced a problem in growth of second rung of leaders as people like Siddaramaiah and Yediyurappa have turned into “local chieftains”. The two leaders grew powerful when their respective central leadership was at the weakest, consolidating their clout and resisting any attempts to replace them.While the Congress may have faced a rout in most states of the country, Karnataka has been a steady source of hope where it has enjoyed power for 12 years since 2000, of which nine are on its own and the remaining in partnership with Janata Dal (Secular).Siddaramaiah is among a handful of chief ministers in the state’s history to have completed five full years in power between 2013 and 2018.Though the question of chief ministerial candidate does not arise at this juncture for a party that rarely announces a face before the results, the minor scuffle, people aware of the developments said, could snowball into a larger problem for the Congress in Karnataka.With volatility continuing within the BJP on the issue of change of leadership and fresh charges of corruption on chief minister BS Yediyurappa and his son, levelled by its own partymen, the Congress stands a chance to regroup from their rivals discord to its own advantage.As Eshwarappa said on June 16, “We have problems and we will find solutions for them. They (Congress) should have ideally exploited the problems but where are they.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/after-bjp-congress-battles-infighting-power-tussle-over-karnataka-cm-face-101624215814064.html
21-06-2021||Bangalore||K’taka further eases Covid restrictions as cases decline||Bengaluru The decline in new Covid-19 infections has prompted the BS Yediyurappa government to announce further easing of restrictions in most parts of the state and its capital, Bengaluru, from Monday. Taking a cautious approach, Karnataka has made three categories of its 30 districts where restrictions will vary and will remain in force till July 5. Though the state government has termed it graded-lifting of restrictions, people have been moving freely in places such as Bengaluru where businesses that are not listed in the guidelines continue to operate, increasing the risk of surge in infections. Experts said that the graded lifting of restrictions serve as a reminder that we are still at risk and curb movement where it is not required. “Unlock-2 is also graded in the sense, film theaters are not open, swimming pools, cap on crowding continues, capping on marriage attendees continues. It is not a total release of lockdown. It is a little more than a semi-lockdown,” Dr CN Manjunath, senior cardiologist and director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research told Hindustan Times on Sunday. Karnataka was among the worst affected regions in the country but has seen a steady decline in new infections. There are fears that by lifting restrictions too soon, crowding could resurface and increase the chances of infections. The new guidelines will see public transport like bus services and the metro operate in districts under category-I, which includes Bengaluru. The state government on Sunday said that Dharwad will also remain under category I, which will see maximum relaxations. This means that most shops, companies and other establishments in most districts, including Bengaluru, will remain open between 6 am to 5 pm. Karnataka recorded 4,517 new infections on Sunday while the positivity rate stood at 2.58%, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. There were 8,456 recoveries that brought active caseload down to 126,813, according to the bulletin. The fatality rate continues to remain high at 2.65% as 120 more deaths were reported on Sunday, taking the toll to 33,883. Bengaluru remains the biggest contributor of new infections as India’s IT capital recorded 933 new cases and 12 deaths. There were 1902 recoveries that brought down the active caseload to 71,282, according to government data. Mysuru, one of the largest cities in Karnataka continues to remain under strict restrictions as it reported 545 new infections and 17 deaths. Meanwhile, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Sunday said that it will initiate a special vaccination campaign. Karnataka has targeted to give at least the first dose to all eligible citizens of the state by the end of the year and cover at least 80% of all above 45 years of age before the end of the month. “(The) chief commissioner (of the BBMP) said that by making micro plans in every zone under BBMP, the eligible beneficiaries must be vaccinated. More camps must be set up and teams should be formed accordingly to vaccinate more people,” according to a statement by the civic body on Sunday, attributing it to Gaurav Gupta. The chief commissioner also said that camps must be set up to vaccinate street vendors, garment workers, cab-auto drivers, vendors in the APMC market, bank staff, hotel staff, and construction workers. “As per the direction of the Government of India, a nationwide vaccination campaign is being conducted tomorrow(Monday). Priority will be given to beneficiaries over the age of 45. The vaccination of beneficiaries whose 2nd dose is pending, vaccination of health workers and frontline workers, eligible beneficiaries recognized by the government in the age group of 18 to 45 years, and the frontline workers who’ve worked in the health sector will be conducted as per government’s directions,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-further-eases-covid-restrictions-as-cases-decline-101624215574195.html
21-06-2021||Mumbai||Join hands with BJP, Shiv Sena MLA tells CM Uddhav Thackeray||Facing Enforcement Directorate probe in alleged money laundering cases, Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik has requested chief minister and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to join hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party once again to save its leaders from being harassed by central agencies. Sarnaik, in a letter to Thackeray, also said that Sena’s allies Nationalist Congress Party and Congress are weakening the party and poaching its leaders. The letter has set tongues wagging in political circles, but a Sena spokesperson said the letter was written in personal capacity and is not the party’s stand. The legislator, who represents Thane’s Ovala-Majiwada constituency in the state Assembly, has faced raids by the ED on his properties. His son, Vihang, was also questioned by the agency in connection with the case. “While being in power, the Congress-NCP is poaching our party workers and weakening our party…In this situation we must get close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in my opinion. At least, with that the undeserved harassment to people like Pratap Sarnaik, Anil Parab and Ravindra Waikar will stop, such is the feeling of many party workers,” Sarnaik wrote in his letter, dated June 20. He added, “Next year there are many corporation elections including Mumbai and Thane. Though the alliance [with BJP] is off, the personal relations between many leaders of the two parties are still intact. Before it breaks, I think we must get back together.” Sarnaik claimed there are internal rumblings within Sena legislators that the work of NCP and Congress legislators are being completed in a jiffy, but even with a Shiv Sena chief minister, the work of its legislators is not happening. “By snapping alliance with the BJP, did the Shiv Sena forge Maha Vikas Aghadi for Congress-NCP to grow,” he said in his letter. “The letter is written by one MLA, and it may be his personal grievance. It is just one voice and the party does not accept such practices. It is an alliance; one cannot expect things to happen their way. There is no issue within the party [on the alliance front]. There is no faction, he is an individual. He should not have gone public [with the letter]. He could have gone and met the party chief and should have given his views,” said Arvind Sawant, Sena MP and chief spokesperson. Sanjay Raut, Sena chief spokesperson, did not comment on claims made by Sarnaik, but said that the important part of the letter was about harassment by central agencies. “He must have made some personal opinion on this, what is there to comment on that. Besides, there is an important part in the letter about “unnecessary harassment”, which is a big allegation. He may have written the letter after being fed up with the unnecessary harassment,” Raut said. State NCP chief Jayant Patil said the letter by Sarnaik is unlikely to sour the ties between the NCP and Sena or create any trouble for the MVA government. “I do not see that there has been anybody going from the Sena to Congress or NCP lately. I do not think that there will be any discomfort or clash between NCP and Shiv Sena due to this [letter]. If somebody has written a letter, we will have to see if there have been any instances in his constituency,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/join-hands-with-bjp-shiv-sena-mla-tells-cm-uddhav-thackeray-101624215453455.html
21-06-2021||Other||Mumbai housing society vax fraud: Fifth accused brought from MP||Mumbai Police have arrested Mohammed Karim Akbar Ali, the fifth person accused of holding an unauthorised vaccination drive at Hiranandani Heritage housing society, Kandivli, on May 30. Ali was detained by the Government Railway Police (GRP) on Friday after he alighted a train at Madhya Pradesh. He was brought to Mumbai on Sunday.According to senior police inspector Balasaheb Salunkhe, the investigating officers had given the name of the train on which Ali was trying to flee Mumbai to GRP. “Based on the information, GRP officers caught him,” said Salunkhe.Ali is said to be the link between two accused – Mahendra Singh and Ramesh Pandey – and a doctor, Manish Tripathi, who is absconding. Police officers said Ali, who was trained by Dr Tripathi, was responsible for finding data entry staff and ward boys to assist the vaccination drive by private hospitals and introducing them to Dr Tripathi and Singh. “Tripathi was the one who procured vials of Covishield vaccination. We are still investigating the source from where he got the vaccines,” said Salunkhe. The police also said that Dr Tripathi was present at Hiranandani Heritage and administered the vaccine to 390 members.Meanwhile on Sunday, a second first information report (FIR) was registered against the same accused at Versova police station in another unauthorised vaccine drive, where 150 employees of a film production house and their families were given Covishield in May, but did not receive the vaccine certificates. The FIR was registered under sections 268 (public nuisance), 270 (malignant act which is likely to spread infection of any disease dangerous to life), 274 (adulteration of drugs), 275 (sale of adulterated drugs), 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery) and relevant sections of the Information Technology (IT) and Epidemic Diseases Acts. Officers said that once Kandivli police complete their probe, the five accused will be arrested by Versova police.After the society members of Hiranandani Heritage approached the police, Borivli-based Aditya College also lodged a complaint about a similar unauthorised drive on their campus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-housing-society-vax-fraud-fifth-accused-brought-from-mp-101624215393466.html
21-06-2021||Mumbai||How fraudster scripted a ₹2-crore con by offering ‘lead roles’ in films||Cyber police arrested an actor and cyber fraudster for cheating parents by promising to get their children cast in lead roles of Bollywood and ad films featuring top celebrities. Police suspect he has duped over 100 parents of ₹2 crore.Borivli resident Mahesh Gupta paid ₹32.69 lakh to have his 15-year-old daughter play the lead role in a film titled Bachchon ki Duniya, while a senior executive of a hotel chain in Bengaluru shelled out ₹16.5 lakh to feature his 7-year-old son in an advertisement for a biscuit brand.After months of tracking of digital footprints of the suspect, the cyber police team of deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Dr Rashmi Karandikar, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Nitin Jadhav inspector Ravikiran Nale, assistant inspectors Amit Uttekar, S Pore and others nabbed the fraudster, Apurva Ashwin Dauda alias Dr Rishi Shroff, 47, last week.One of the complainants, Gupta, said, “In the middle of a pandemic, when there is a health emergency around, businesses are shutting down, people are losing jobs, economy is falling apart, lives of middle class and poor people are shattered, and in between all this if you see a golden opportunity that can brighten the future of your child, you are bound to jump on it.”Gupta, who supplies spare parts of aircrafts, said, “In August 2020, I received a random SMS and next day a woman named Alisha Kapoor called me informing about an opportunity for kids to be cast in cinema and ad films.” Gupta was encouraged to view some websites of modelling agencies named Ellee Advertising, Ford Advertising, Zara Kids, etc which were allegedly run by Dauda’s company. Gupta was promised that his daughter would be cast in an ad film of a biscuit brand with Virat Kohli and Deepika Padukone and in another ad film featuring players from Mumbai Indians.After seeing the websites, he thought them to be genuine. “Like every other parent, I also thought that if my daughter (a Class 10 student) gets some exposure to entertainment industry at an early stage it will be a good start for a brighter future for her,” said Gupta.Dauda allegedly also sent Gupta a memorandum of understanding promising that his daughter would get ₹1.25 lakh for each day’s shoot. The Bengaluru victim said, “Before casting my son, the accused wanted to take an audition and asked me to send a video of my son. He then said my son was selected and asked for registration fees of ₹1.25 lakh for five years of contract with his agency.” “Dauda played his game very cleverly and would never meet his targets in-person and always spoke to them over phone. To ensure that his victims do not raise any suspicion on him, he would fix a meeting with them in any five-star hotel and would cancel the meeting at the last moment claiming that some urgent work had come up,” said assistant commissioner of police (cyber) Nitin Jadhav.The Bangalore complainant said, “Since I am in the hotel industry I cross-checked his claims with Grand Hayat hotel where he claimed to have made bookings for our meeting which also included Virat Kohli. I found he had actually made the booking. But before my wife and I could board a flight to Mumbai, he called me saying Virat Kohli delayed the meeting by a few weeks due to Covid-19 spread.”However, Dauda told the victims that as their children had been finalised for the shoot and the quality of the ad film would be high scale they would use costumes only from celebrity designers. Under the pretext of buying designer clothes for the kids for shooting, the accused would ask the parents to pay to refundable deposits for the clothes. He would also extract money from the parents under the pretext of buying accessories for the kids for shooting purpose. However, it took time for the parents to understand that they were cheated. “After three months when he almost exhausted all excuses to delay the shooting further he started ignoring me. He stopped answering my calls and messages, deactivated his phone number. By this time, I had already sent ₹32.69 lakh to him in various bank accounts,” said Gupta. He then lodged a complaint with the Mumbai police.“The fraudster would always make WhatsApp calls saying he is shooting at a place where cellular network was poor. He did this to ensure his conversation with the victims were not recorded and do not reflect in CDRs (call data records),” said assistant inspector Amit Uttekar.“To ensure that his location is not traced he would use internet-based network and virtual private network (VPN) to contact his targets. He used multiple mobile phones and sim cards,” said DCP Karandikar.Cybercrime officers also questioned him about how he would find potential targets and their contacts. “Dauda would send boys to malls and collect data of affluent people in the name of contests, surveys, etc. He would also fraudulently obtain data of car owners, doctors and people from other reputed professions from various internet sites. He has data of nearly 50 lakh such people,” said inspector Ravikiran Naale.The Bangalore victim says that before beginning his game the accused would do a profiling of the accused. “He knew that I am from hotel industry so he first researched about my seniors and bosses of previous employments and took their names while speaking to me to build trust,” the victim said.Dauda also contacted a fashion designer company and somehow managed to get the contacts of models and then duped them similarly under the pretext of casting them in ad films, said the police,Graduated from a prominent college in south Mumbai, Dauda also studied at TFT Business School in Colorado, United States. He learnt acting from the acting school of Kishore Namit Kapoor, Juhu and worked nearly 10 years in the ad film industry for many popular FMCG brands.Claiming to be a member of known cinema, TV artists, writers associations, Dauda was making a film named Trance under the banner of his company Arman Films and needed ₹25 lakh to make the trailer. Hence, he came up with the idea of duping people under the pretext of offering them roles with the help of fake websites.According to the police, analysis of his bank accounts indicates that he has deceived more than 100 such parents and cheated them of around ₹2 crore over the past four years.After the police arrested Dauda, Gupta went to meet him. He said, “When I went to the police station to see him, he again made false emotional attempts, asking me to spare him. His wife too was begging me, but you cannot forgive someone who has destroyed your life,” He added, “Forget about my daughter’s career, he robbed all my savings that I had saved for my daughter’s future. When I realised that he has duped me, me and my family were in complete shock for months. My wife’s both kidneys have failed, she is now on the verge of losing vision completely. She is also diabetic. I had to face shortage of funds for her medical treatment as I had invested all savings for the kid’s future with a hope that soon I would get the refund. The last six to eight months were very traumatic and stressful for me and my family, especially in the middle of a pandemic.”“My 78-year-old father passed away in May month. He had heart attack. But even during his last days he would keep on consoling me saying, ‘Beta, don’t worry, he (the fraudster) would get caught one day’,” Gupta said.My daughter is a teenager and she knows that her family has been duped. She was very excited to work with film and cricket stars. But, the fraudster has shattered all her dreams. Such devastating things impact kids minds and confidence adversely.Police probe has revealed that Dauda has a company in Dubai and investigators are checking if it was used in the fraud. His three passports, cheques books of 11 different bank accounts and agreement documents of his bogus companies have been seized. The police believe that there are many other victim parents who still have not yet approached the police. “We urge all those victims to come forward, register their complaints, and help police,” DCP Dr Karandikar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/how-fraudster-scripted-a-2-crore-con-by-offering-lead-roles-in-films-101624215333444.html

21-06-2021||Mumbai||Nine districts of Maharashtra accounting for 50% fresh Covid-19 cases||Even as the state’s daily Covid-19 cases have reduced comparatively, a major chunk of the infections come from the rural areas of nine districts of Maharashtra. The state added 9,361 fresh infections on Sunday, of which 5,194 come from the rural parts of Raigad, Ahmednagar, Pune, Solapur, Satara, Kolhapur, Sangli, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg districts. The state’s active case count was 132,241, while the state’s overall tally rose to 5,972,781. Mumbai reported 747 fresh Covid-19 infections and 19 deaths. The city’s active caseload was 18,591.These nine districts have been reporting around 50% of the state’s cases for some time now. State health department and health experts said that the viral activity works in a different manner and parts showing higher numbers will eventually go down. On Sunday, 761 cases were reported in Ratnagiri, 728 in Satara, 725 in Kolhapur rural, 643 in Raigad, 579 in Pune rural, 572 in Sangli rural, 549 in Ahmednagar rural, 329 in Sindhudurg and 308 in Solapur rural, the state data said. These areas reported 55.48% cases on Sunday.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, former director-general of health services (Maharashtra) and advisor to the state government, on Covid-19 said that the pandemic does not behave in the same manner across areas. “Western Maharashtra places, particularly Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, and Ratnagiri and Sindhdurg in the Konkan region, are not showing a distinct decline we are seeing in other parts of the state. The virus does not behave in the same manner across geographical limits. The virus could have entered late in these rural areas,” he said.Besides these areas, the other major contributors remain Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune city and Pimpri-Chinchwad. These areas clock around 25% of the state’s daily case count. On Sunday, MMR (excluding Mumbai) added 1,253 cases, while Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad added 553 cases. Collectively, Mumbai, MMR, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad contributed to 27.27% of the state’s cases on Sunday.The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state has climbed in the past month as the state added over 21,000 fatalities in its data reconciliation process since May 21. A whopping 21,147 deaths have been added to the state’s tally in almost a month, which has taken the CFR from 1.54% on May 20 to 1.97% on Sunday. Between May 20 and June 20, 32,606 deaths were added, of which 21,147 were as part of the data-cleaning process. “Deaths have occurred in the second wave, but rather than looking at the absolute numbers, we must see that the CFR has remained under control. CFR was much lower than what we saw in the first wave,” said a health department official, who did not wish to be named.The state added 415 deaths to the state’s progressive death tally on Sunday, besides the 190 deaths in the past 24 hours. Out of the 415 deaths, 164 occurred in Pune, 81 in Nashik, 59 in Ahmednagar, 25 in Thane, 20 in Ratnagiri, 12 in Aurangabad, 11 in Beed, 10 in Satara, seven in Buldhana, five in Akola, four each in Nagpur and Sangli, two each in Hingoli, Solapur and Wardha, one each in in Amravati, Jalna, Kolhapur, Latur, Parbhani, Washim and Yavatmal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nine-districts-of-maharashtra-accounting-for-50-fresh-covid-19-cases-101624215213493.html
21-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra reports 20 Delta+ Covid variant cases: Officials||A total of 20 cases of the new Sars-CoV-2 variant AY.1, also dubbed the Delta-plus, have been found in samples collected from at least four districts of Maharashtra — Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Palghar and Jalgaon. More samples have been sent for genome sequencing to understand whether the new variant is dominant or scattered, state government officials said.The Delta-plus, formed by mutation in the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, is currently a “variant of interest”, and hasn’t been classified as a “variant of concern” by the Union health ministry yet.In April, the state government signed an MoU with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research’s (CSIR) Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) to sequence 100 Covid positive samples each from 36 districts per month.Genome sequencing is an exercise to study changes in the structure of the virus over time.State health minister Rajesh Tope while confirmed receiving a genome sequencing report from CSIR-IGIB, refused to discuss the matter till Monday. “CSIR-IGIB has prepared a report based on samples collected of Covid positive patients from all districts of the state... The contents of the report will be discussed in a meeting to be held on Monday and inferences will be drawn...,” he said.In Ratnagiri, Dr Sanghamitra Gawde, a civil surgeon, said she has not received the final report confirming the presence of the Delta-plus variant, but said 50 samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology for genome sequencing in June.“We are randomly collecting samples from areas that are recording high infections...”Dr Subhash Salunkhe, state advisor to Covid-19 task force, said he hasn’t received the official report from the public health department, but said: “The Delta variant is extremely infectious and contributed to a great extent in the second wave. So, we need to study the epidemiological characteristics of the mutated virus (Delta plus) to understand its implications in the general population.”Earlier this week, Dr VK Paul, Niti Aayog member (health), said the variant was first observed in Europe in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/20-delta-plus-covid-cases-found-in-maharashtra-101624215154627.html

The promise has been made by none other than Sonia Gandhiji,” Nana Patole, state Congress chief, told reporters in Pune. “...Sonia Gandhi’s stand to be a part of the MVA was to prevent the BJP from coming to power (in 2019) . However, it had no mention that we are permanent in alliance,” he added.Addressing Shiv Sena’s 55th foundation day on Saturday, Thackeray said, “If we do not offer solutions to people’s problems but only talk about going it alone in politics, people will beat us with footwear...” Though he chose not to name anyone, the remarks made clear that he was not happy with the stand taken by the Congress state unit.Patole said that Thackeray didn’t name any party and he would respond if that is cleared.Meanwhile, the Nationalist Congress Party insisted that the three allies — Sena, NCP and Congress — are together and will contest polls as an alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-will-remain-part-of-mva-till-end-of-tenure-says-congress-101624215155256.html
21-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body chalks vax plan for potential superspreaders; drive only for 30+||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to vaccinate on priority “potential superspreaders” or those who are in touch with multiple people daily, in order to control the spread of Covid-19, amid the threat of a third wave. This category includes auto-taxi drivers, hawkers, delivery executives, restaurant staff, daily wage workers, among others. Further, although the Central government has allowed all citizens above the age of 18 to get vaccinated for free starting Monday, however, in Mumbai, vaccination will be conducted only for those who are 30+, following the state’s directives.The BMC is exploring various options to develop a mechanism to start vaccination of citizens in these categories. A final decision on the same is expected to be taken this week. The plan is similar to the earlier model of testing on priority such individuals who come in touch with multiple citizens on a daily basis.According to BMC officials, one of the options is to start vaccination for citizens under the superspreader category on a walk-in basis, however, nothing has been decided yet. Also, there are deliberations over whether citizens above 18 must be allowed under this category or only citizens above 30, which is permitted by the state government.The state government had on Friday allowed vaccination for citizens between the age group of 30 and 45. The vaccination drive for the 18-45 age group will be restarted in a phased manner considering the supply of doses, the officials said.Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s Public Health Department said, “We are planning to vaccinate on priority a certain set of people who are in touch with multiple citizens. We are working on various options for the same and also deliberating on the age group for the same. For now, the vaccination drive for 30+ will continue in the city.”Earlier, a week ago the BMC had also decided to vaccinate all the staff of restaurants in the city, however, now the scope of the vaccination has been expanded to multiple categories.To give a boost to the vaccination drive in the city, the BMC will double the doses supplied to each vaccination centre in the city from the current 100 doses to 200-300, depending on demand and usage.The BMC said the supply in June from the central government is better than that of May, which saw a major fall when compared to April. The increased supply will, however, be valid for civic and government centres. For private hospitals, BMC will act as an aggregator for vaccine procurement.Dr Gomare added, “For now, we got supply of above 100,000 doses say three days back and also on Sunday we got around 100,000 doses. Hence, the supply is sufficient to have the vaccination drive ongoing.”Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “We are now giving 300 vaccine doses to each centre, considering the scope of vaccination has also increased now. Our priority will be to administer maximum doses on a daily basis.”As of now, the vaccination remains on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and on appointment basis between Thursday and Saturday, while vaccination remains shut on Sunday.Meanwhile, as of Saturday, 4,462,767 citizens have been vaccinated in the city. Of these, 1,063,792 are in age group of 18 to 44, 1,375,665 are above 45 to 59 years, 1,336,547 1 above 60 years, 3,089 are lactating mothers, 3901 are those students wanting to go abroad for further studies, and the rest are healthcare and frontline workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-chalks-vax-plan-for-potential-superspreaders-drive-only-for-30-101624215154057.html
21-06-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants anticipatory bail to cop accused of sexual exploitation||The Bombay high court (HC) has granted anticipatory bail to a constable accused of sexual exploitation of a female colleague under the pretext of marriage. The court prima facie held that as the sexual relationship between the two police personnel was consensual and voluntary from the beginning, the application can be allowed and directed the release of the accused in the event of arrest. The accused constable is posted with the traffic department at Malabar Hill. The single-judge bench of justice SK Shinde, while hearing the anticipatory bail application of Madhav Krishna Vasave was informed by advocate Arjun Kadam on June 11, that he had approached the HC seeking relief in the case registered at Byculla police station by a female colleague, as the sessions court had rejected his plea for protection in March. Vasave was booked for offences of rape, outraging modesty of woman, cheating by personation under sections of the Indian Penal Code and for identity of theft under the Information Technology Act, 2000. According to the complaint, the two got acquainted in 2017 while working together and got into a relationship. Vasave allegedly had not disclosed that he was married, and later when it came to light Vasave had said he would divorce his wife as she was psychologically unfit. The complaint further states that on the promise of marriage Vasave forced her to have physical relation. He had allegedly also borrowed ₹1.5 lakh from her. When she asked him to return the money he allegedly abused her, following which she severed her ties with him. The complaint further said that Vasave emotionally and physically abused the woman, pressured her to maintain a relationship, and recorded her videos and was threatening to upload it on social media. The woman further said that after she agreed to marry another person in September 2020, the accused again threatened to post videos of her in compromising position. The marriage was later called off, following which she lodged the complaint in March, this year. Advocate SR Nargolkar for Vasave submitted that the sexual relationship between the applicant and complainant was consensual and voluntary and the woman was aware that he was married. He claimed the allegations of video recording were false and added that Vasave had cooperated with the investigating officer by handing over his mobile phone. In view of this, he urged the court to grant Vasave protection from arrest. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed, “The complaint, prima-facie, suggests that the love and sexual relationship between the applicant and the complainant was consensual and voluntary since beginning. It may be stated that after lodging the complaint, the complainant was examined by the medical officer.”The court also directed the forensic science laboratory (FSL) to trace the deleted or available data on the mobile photo and submit its opinion and report on or before July 16. The bench then posted further hearing to July 19 and directed Vasave’s release on executing personal bond of ₹50,000 in the event of arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-cop-accused-of-sexual-exploitation-101624215093377.html
21-06-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants anticipatory bail to man accused of abetting suicide||The Bombay high court (HC) has granted anticipatory bail to a man accused of abetting the suicide of a woman. The single judge bench of justice Prakash Naik, while hearing the anticipatory bail application of Samir Shaikh on June 11, was informed by advocate Sana Khan that the complaint by the brother of the deceased woman wherein her client has been named as the abettor is not true as the records prove otherwise. He said that though the man was serenading the woman, it was the constant harassment of her husband that pushed her to take the drastic step, and hence the man should be protected from arrest. In the complaint lodged at Nehru Nagar police station on January 23, the deceased’s brother alleged that as Shaikh had been calling his sister repeatedly, it led to the strains in the relation between his sister and her husband, as a result of which his sister committed suicide. However, while arguing for Shaikh, Khan submitted that the relationship between the deceased and her client were consensual and the woman had indicated that her husband intended to kill her. Khan further submitted that there was no suicide note and there were no previous complaints by the victim against the applicant, as there was no evidence to establish that the applicant had instigated or abetted the victim to commit suicide. However, additional public prosecutor YM Nakhwa for the state submitted that the husband had alleged that Shaikh was constantly harassing his wife by calling her. After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that as there was no incriminating evidence against Shaikh and he had complied with the earlier directions of the court to appear before the investigating officer and cooperate with the investigation, it was allowing the application and directed the release of Shaikh on a PR bond of ₹25,000 in the event of arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-man-accused-of-abetting-suicide-101624215035392.html
21-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai pot brownie supply case: Three more arrested||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) arrested three persons in three separate cases and allegedly seized multiple drugs in commercial quantities, as part of its week-long intense efforts against drug suppliers and peddlers in the city ahead of International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.In the first operation, the agency arrested Sachin Tupe, 26, a college drop-out, from Andheri in connection with last week’s case wherein the agency busted a marijuana brownie bakery in Malad (West). Tupe was allegedly supplying marijuana to drug supplier Jagat Chaurasia who was arrested by the agency on June 12 in the pot brownie bakery case. Chaurasia used to supply the contraband to Elston Fernandes and a 20-year-old woman who was running the bakery, said NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede.The agency recovered 11 blots of LSD in commercial quantity from him and further investigation is on. The second operation was conducted on the basis of specific information and the agency intercepted one auto driver Afsar Khan from Goregaon (West) and during the search allegedly recovered 20 grams of cocaine worth ₹2 lakh. During interrogation, it was revealed that Khan was connected with an African national based in Mira Road and was supplying cocaine for him. NCB is trying to locate the African national, added Wankhede. The third operation was carried out in Mahim where the agency raided a house, recovered 60 gram of Mephedrone and 360 grams of marijuana and arrested Fahad Salim Qureshi. On June 12, NCB officers conducted raids in a bakery shop in Malad (West) and arrested three persons including a woman and main supplier of marijuana, and allegedly seized 830 grams of edible pot brownie and 160 grams of marijuana from them.A case has been registered under relevant sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act against three accused. During interrogation, it was learnt that the accused found the idea of selling edible weed with brownie cake through an online streaming service.The agency discovered a new trend among youths of consuming pot brownies. This was the first case in India in which the edible weed is used for baking and the agency cracked the nexus, added Wankhede.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-pot-brownie-supply-case-three-more-arrested-101624215033466.html
21-06-2021||Mumbai||No online classes, children take up odd jobs in Malshej||With the residents of adivasi padas in Malshej losing their livelihoods during lockdown, the children in the families are now helping parents in earning daily meals. As digital education has not reached these areas, the children are forced to work. Adivasi padas such as Shiravali and five padas near Tokawade village are facing severe scarcity due to loss of income since the past several months. Families who were selling vegetables, food items on the street to travellers, are now left with no option as all picnic spots are closed due to the pandemic. In addition, these areas face severe electricity issues, pushing the chance of digital education further away for the children residing here. Jayesh Pawar, a social worker, said, “Children of Shiravali village have started fishing or taking u other small work around the area to earn money for daily chores. I came to know about it when I found these children were using mosquito nets to catch fish and earn ₹30 to ₹40 by selling it. When the school started here a few years back, I convinced all parents to send their children to school. But now we cannot see these children as they lost their touch with school. It has become a difficult task for all of us to find them again and make them realise the importance of education.”Satish Thakare, a 10-year-old from Tokavade village who has been fishing for the past two months, said, “I joined the school four years ago but continued only for a year. Now I enjoy fishing, as my school is closed.” However, after seeing a lecture on a mobile phone, he got excited and said, “I would like to learn this.” A zilla parishad officer from Malshej said, “Our teachers and staff along with social workers would visit every adivasi pada and make the children sit in the school with several innovative ideas to attract them. Now due to Covid-19 duty, staff remain less and it’s hard to reach out to every Adivasi padas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-online-classes-children-take-up-odd-jobs-in-malshej-101624214973496.html
21-06-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: Diversify portfolio to tide over market volatility||The coronavirus pandemic coupled with the upheaval in the stock market has forced many to re-evaluate their mutual fund investments. Continued investments in mutual funds is the key to earning high returns though plunging net asset values (NAVs) and volatility in the market in these unprecedented times have changed people’s outlook towards debt and hybrid funds considering their relative stability over equities.That investments must be aligned to one’s goals is the mantra that guides every successful investor. Allocate, check, adjust, churn and re-adjust are simple steps to do to ensure that every investment you make is in tune with your short-term and long-term goals. Portfolio diversification is not a one-time task but involves a series of steps that could be repetitive. Here’s where you start.If you are a long-term investor, consider investing in mutual funds for returns that beat inflation and help you earn more. Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar.com, an online marketplace for financial products, said, “Mutual funds are a good investment if you have at least three years to remain invested. If you are investing in children’s education, a large-cap fund or a blue-chip fund would be a good idea as these are less risky and provide returns to the tune of 12-18%. The chances of capital erosion in these funds are also less. The risk-averse can also consider debt-oriented hybrid funds that earn usually between 8-12% depending on the fund.” Many people also invest in secure government instruments that earn returns more than the inflation rate. Choose your investments: Making the right pick of assets is an arduous decision and warrants a correct understanding of financial goals and risk tolerance. Mutual funds performing well under specific market conditions may not deliver similar results when the economy is in doldrums. The epidemic has shifted the focus from equity investments to mixed investments including debt instruments and fixed income schemes. Equity investments fall into different categories including investments in stocks/shares, equity mutual funds, arbitrage schemes and real estate funds. Debt instruments include bonds issued by companies, municipalities and various government sectors The fixed income schemes are mostly bank deposits including savings accounts and money invested in deposits promising fixed returns.Jayesh Faria, associate director, Motilal Oswal Private Wealth Management, an investment and fund management company, said, “Do detailed personal risk profiling activity and arrive at ideal asset allocation keeping circumstances and requirements in mind. Roughly 80% of the strategic portfolio must be allocated to stay invested all the time. The balance 20% can be looked at tactically to take the opportunity of market volatility.” The open-ended nature of mutual funds helps to minimize investors’ risk quotient as concerned fund managers allocate the pooled amount into multiple stocks depending on the fund subscription by the investors.Mere diversification of funds between the market and those earning fixed returns is not enough. You must also know how to diversify your allocations within your equity fund instruments depending on funds availability and understanding of risk versus returns. Also, holding several mutual funds incessantly without looking at their composition is tomfoolery. Instead, the focus must be on the diversification of mutual funds according to their market cap. You need to diversify across different fund categories such as flexicap, midcap, small-cap, and large & midcap. Even in debt instruments, pay attention to a proper mix of long-duration, medium duration, and short-term debt funds for better results.Lump sum or SIPs? The decision to invest a definite amount in mutual funds or pay for mutual fund investments through small instalments has sent many people into a quandary.Prashant Sawant, co-founder, Catalyst Wealth, a wealth management company, said, “SIP is a good option for the current volatile market. Since it is a disciplined investment plan it helps reduce the propensity to market fluctuations, cost averaging and render significant wealth creation in the long run.” Many investors are unable to decide if they must invest regularly in small chunks or wait for the right time to put their money in the market in a lump sum. Speaking on factors that guide investment making decisions in lump sum or SIPs, Dr Joseph Thomas, Head of Research, Emkay Wealth Management, a financial services firm, says, “In a country like India where retail participation in mutual funds is growing over the decades, SIP has served the purpose of giving access to funds for such investors even with very small monthly investments that are very much within the reach of the common man. Also, this mode is important is because one need not be bothered about the day-to-day happenings in the market. It is a matter of common experience that in a highly bullish market and one-way movement, a lump sum will provide you with better returns.”Diversification helps to bear the brunt of sudden bull market corrections or gain from the bear market rallies. The equity stock market does not promise linear returns, and hence, it helps to enter the market in a phased manner through small and regular investments over a long period.Monitor diversifications: Most people forget to check the performance of their investment portfolio. Once you have decided your investment choices and diversified accordingly, it is important to monitor their performance and plan the right step too. This is because some mutual funds may not perform as per your expectations. Their ineffectiveness must translate to relegating them to the lowest share of the investment portfolio while more money can be allocated to the more stable and outperforming ones. Check for the funds’ annual returns, growth in dividend income and asset allocation to assess your funds’ performance.

21-06-2021||Other||Slums in Mumbai breathed easy in the second Covid-19 wave||Mumbai In the second wave – marked by more infectious and transmissible new strains of Sars-Cov-2 – the cumulative Covid-19 cases in Mumbai surged by four times as compared to last year. However, the city’s slum pockets, where the possibility of prevalence and spread of the novel coronavirus infection was considered to be higher, showed more resilience, while the high-rise buildings turned into epicentres of transmission. Public health experts, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and medical practitioners have cited several reasons for fewer Covid-19 cases in slums. These include development of natural antibodies among slum dwellers that acted a protective shield, quicker response by stakeholders, the ongoing vaccination drive and better awareness. The civic body is now prepping up for studies to find answers for the change in the epidemiological characteristic of the pandemic. In March 2020, when Covid-19 struck Mumbai, the virus spread from residential buildings to slums, which emerged as the biggest cause of concern owing to their dense population. Asia’s biggest slum Dharavi was declared a ‘red zone’ area. Many slum dwellers migrated to their villages and no one was allowed to enter or exit containment zones, bringing the life of hundreds of residents to a standstill. As a result, public health experts feared a repeat of last year’s scenario at the start of the second wave in mid-February, especially due to mutation of the virus. However, data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shows that 90% infections in the second wave were recorded in high-rise buildings. By the beginning of March this year, the civic body realised that the main challenge was to contain the spread of Covid-19 in in high-rise buildings and not slums. As on April 30, when Mumbai was at the peak of the second wave, 9,899 floors were sealed and 979 buildings were declared active containment zones, while the city’s slums had only 111 containment zones. Slums hit in first wave More than 50% (6,534,460) of Mumbai’s total population of 12,442,373 (as per 2011 census) resides in slum areas, making the inhabitants vulnerable to contracting the infection owing to their poor and unhygienic living conditions. Public health experts said slum pockets, from where a significant proportion are employed as domestic help, drivers, guards, gardeners in high-rise buildings, are like ticking bombs that can cause the virus to spread like a wildfire among the general population. Dharavi inhabitants, for instance, live in some of the most cramped spaces in the country. In an area measuring 2.1 square kilometres (sq km), the slum has over 57,000 shanties, huts and small flats, almost all being illegal. Its estimated population density – 66,000 people per sq km – is more than double of Mumbai (32,303 people per sq km), the fifth most-densely populated city in the world, according to a United Nations Population Prospects study released in July 2019. Till February 7, the area had reported 3,947 Covid-19 cases and 312 deaths. However, in the second wave, a total 2,917 cases and 47 deaths have been reported since February 1 till June 18. Of the total 6,864 infections, around 42% were reported during the second wave. At present, there are only five active Covid-19 cases. On June 15, Dharavi reported zero Covid-19 cases – a first since February 2. Civic ward officials said the infection rate this year was less than that in 2020 despite conducting similar number of daily Covid-19 tests during both the waves. “In May 2020, when the pandemic curve was at its peak, we tested 200-250 people every day. We undertook the same number of tests in the second wave too. By mid-March, we started observing that the infection rate was rising in high-rises than the slums. We then gradually started focusing on residential buildings,” said Kiran Dighavkar, ward officer, G-South ward that covers Dharavi, Mahim and Dadar. The trend is similar in other civic wards where the slum population is in a majority. For instance, L ward that covers Kurla constitutes over 80% slums. Manish Walunj, assistant municipal commissioner of the ward, said around 3,500 tests were conducted every day between March and May this year and last year, but the infection rate was lower than the first wave. “In mid-May last year, slum pockets in our ward had the highest number of containment zones (131) covering 10,699 households. But by April-end this year, we had only 15 active containment zones in slums. As on June 15, our ward has only 458 active patients, and over 90% are from non-slums,” said Walunj. The M-East ward, which includes slum clusters of Govandi and Mankhurd, has also witnessed a significant drop in cases compared to last year. “In May last year, the growth rate was 8.4%. In April this year, it was 4%. At the start of the second wave, we also increased our contact tracing to 17 individuals per infected patient,” said Dhanaji Herlekar, assistant municipal commissioner, M-East ward. Civic-run hospitals have also witnessed a significant fall in hospitalisation cases from slums in the second wave. Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital (Sion hospital), said, “There has been a 40-50% drop in hospitalisation of slum dwellers in the second wave. There was a spike in admissions in April but the death rate was minimal, below 1%.” Fewer Covid-19 cases in the city’s densely populated slum pockets have left public health officials curious about the possible reasons for low infection rates. Dr Varsha Puri, deputy executive health officer of zone-5 that covers areas including L, M-East and M-West wards, said, “To get answers as to why slums recorded fewer cases in the second wave, we have decided to conduct studies in these civic wards to understand the epidemiological characteristics of the virus. We are awaiting guidelines from BMC to initiate the study in slums.” Seropositivity higher in non-slum areas The first and second serological surveys in Mumbai, to ascertain the prevalence of antibodies, were conducted in July and August 2020. The third was conducted in March across all the 24 civic wards, which showed the presence of antibodies in 36.3% of the total 10,197 samples. Results of the third survey showed an increase in seropositivity rate in non-slums as compared to slums. The sero survey in slum areas showed seropositivity at 41.6% as against 57% and 45% in last July and August, respectively. In non-slum areas, the seropositivity was found in 28.5% samples (which increased from last July and August’s 16% and 18%), making the population more vulnerable to Covid-19 during the second wave. Dr Lancelot Pinto, pulmonologist, Hinduja Hospital, said, “The fact that most of the cases in the second wave were in high-rises possibly suggests two things— the rates of re-infection were low or, most of the infections were likely in individuals who hadn’t encountered the virus in the first wave, and were therefore vulnerable.” Dr Ravikant Singh, founder, Doctor For You, said natural antibodies produced in the first wave is still circulating among slum dwellers, making their immunity stronger to fight the virus. “In the second wave, the mutation of the virus made the infection more transmissible. This could have had severe repercussions in the densely-populated slums. But I assume that many who had already been infected once, have natural antibodies against the virus, and hence, have reduced risks of getting infected during the second wave. We however need to understand that it is just a temporary shield,” said Singh. Mass immunisation drives are therefore the need of the hour before the natural antibodies produced in the body become weak, said civic officials. “Antibodies remain in the body for four-six months. There is strong likelihood that once the slum population loses them, we could again see the virus spread through slums if there is another wave, unless we can catch up on vaccinations,” said Walunj. Dr Pinto suggested that prioritising vaccination for individuals in areas with low seroprevalence, especially among high-risk individuals, would possibly be a high-yield strategy. “We need to also conduct regular seroprevalence studies coupled with whole genome sequencing to identify vulnerable populations and variants of interest before they spread rapidly,” he said. Amita Bhide, dean, school of habitat studies, Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS), who has conducted several studies in M-East ward during the second wave, said the vaccination drive is still lagging in slums. “The priority has been middle and high-class [groups] as the infection rate among them was high. As vaccination in slums is facing a setback, there is a need to bring the drive to people’s doors. Individuals in slums are still sceptical about the need for vaccination. Hence, the civic body also needs to focus on awareness,” said Bhide. The Covid-19 containment proactive strategies not only helped BMC in controlling cases in slums, but their ‘Dharavi model’ also bagged them national fame and appreciation. Through door-to-door surveys at slums, BMC created a health map that helped diagnose Covid-19 patients faster and maintain a record of high-risk patients who were immediately isolated in Covid Care Centres (CCC). “We followed three strategies in slums— test, isolate and treat. Other than RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), we have been conducting rapid antigen tests on the floating crowds in slums. In Dharavi, we have also started mobile van testing facilities,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. Growing awareness among slum dwellers also helped curb transmission from residential buildings. “The first wave has taught slum dwellers lessons that helped them survive the second wave. They were extra careful and cautious even while serving in residential buildings. The question that now remains is how safe will slums be in the third wave,” said Bhide. BOX Domestic workers’ concern Dharavi resident Sunita Pradhan, 36, who lost her job as a domestic help last year, was terrified when the second wave hit the city. Like Pradhan, many domestic workers were anxious to work in high-rise buildings. In many cases, domestic helps were not informed by their employers if any of their family members contracted Covid-19. “In the first wave, we were asked to get Covid-19 test reports. In the second wave, they [employers] started hiding about Covid-19 among their family members from us,” said Pradhan. Ashish More, 41, who works as a security guard at a Carter Road apartment, said that during the second wave, those working as drivers, guards, cooks, gardeners in the high-rise building had to be extra cautious. “We had to wear double masks and regularly use hand sanitisers. They are our employers. So unlike them, we can’t ask for vaccination certificates or Covid-19 reports to work for them. But at least now, the employers treat us better and don’t shoo us away,” said More who lives in a 150 sq feet chawl in a slum at Bandra (East) with five family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/slums-in-mumbai-breathed-easy-in-the-second-covid-19-wave-101624214733443.html

21-06-2021||Mumbai||BJP eyes Mumbai civic body elections||From corruption cases against ruling party leaders to national leaders for campaigning, the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is gearing up for the local body elections, especially for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls, which are expected to be held in January-February next year. Termed as mini Assembly elections, 23 municipal corporations, including Mumbai civic body, 29 district councils and more than 90 municipal councils will go to polls from September-October this year till the end of next year. It is expected that the outcome of results show whether people are happy with the ruling parties and whether the BJP managed to retain hold of the local self-government bodies it won the last time. The most talked-about election is likely to be Mumbai civic polls. The BJP will try to wrest power from the Shiv Sena, which is ruling the BMC for over two decades. The BJP, which has just two seats less than the Shiv Sena in the 2017 BMC polls, has vowed to win power in India’s richest civic body this time. In its recent core committee meeting held in Mumbai in the presence of party’s national leader BL Santosh and CT Ravi, the party discussed the strategy for the forthcoming elections. It was followed by a meeting of key Mumbai leaders to strategise for the Mumbai polls. According to insiders, the party is planning to constitute a core committee of top leaders to handle Mumbai civic polls, amid internal differences within the party’s city unit. Currently, the Shiv Sena’s strength in the 227-seat body is 97, after it engineered defection of corporators from other parties after civic polls. It had won 84 seats in 2017, while the BJP had jumped to 82 seats from 31 seats in 2012. The Congress and NCP have 29 and 8 corporators each. The SP has six, while Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has 1. The Hyderabad way? The BMC polls are likely to be keenly contested, just the way the BJP made a serious effort to win the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) in Telangana. The elections in December last year saw national leaders of the BJP campaigning for the polls, in which the party emerged second largest party by winning 48 seats, from just four it had in the 150-seat civic house. Party leaders, including union home minister Amit Shah, party’s national chief JP Nadda, Uttar Pradesh’s chief minister Yogi Aaditya Nath and several union ministers, came for campaigning.“With an annual budget of ₹39,039 crore, the BMC is the civic body which surpasses many smaller states in its annual outlay. The party controlling India’s richest civic body that governs financial capital wields significant political influence. We were short of just two seats last time and would have been in power if we wanted to. This time around, our aim is to cross the mark of 100 seats and have our mayor,” said a party leader, requesting anonymity. The leader said the BMC polls would not be fought on the Hindutva plank, like GHMC elections. He said that the party will play the development card, exposing how two-and-a-half decades of Shiv Sena rule has failed to give the city bare minimum amenities. The party has started galvanising its cadre at micro level under various programmes such as one booth, ten youths, Shakti Kendra and Active Youth Effective Booth in which the party’s youth and women wing workers get actively involved. War rooms in every city and districts that are going to poll are activated, while surveys are being conducted to weigh the party strength in each ward. The party has been emphasising on the ‘person to person’ and ‘home to home’ contact with voters and has roped in its youth and women wing in Mumbai and other cities that are going to polls. The party has started getting in touch with runner-up contestants from other parties from 2017 elections where the party has no effective face. All out against Shiv Sena Though it is said to be all three ruling parties – Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress – versus BJP, the contest is expected to be fought bitterly between the two saffron parties. “The Sena’s strength lies in power in the civic body. We have enough material about the corruption in the civic body gathered against Sena,” said a key BJP leader. “It was possible for us to grab power in the BMC in 2017 too, but we followed the dharma of friendship and let Sena elect the mayor. But it’s enough now,” Fadnavis had said recently while addressing party workers from Mumbai. Shiv Sena leader Sachin Ahir said, “We have started mobilising our workers at shakha level. The state has done a very good job in Covid-19 management and infrastructure works.”Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “Corruption has been raked up by opposition in every BMC poll, but the Sena has kept its power intact.”The BJP is expected to make a few internal changes. There is a buzz that the party leadership is not happy with its city chief Mangal Prabhat Lodha. The party is also looking to get MNS to dent the Sena in MMR. BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said, “We are preparing to emerge single largest party and get the power in the civic body. We have started outreach programme. We will go to the voters with the development plank.” He insisted there would be no core group, but all senior leaders will guide city leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-eyes-mumbai-civic-body-elections-101624214493470.html
21-06-2021||Noida||Noida: Many Covid survivors turn to yoga for full recovery||Noida: Greater Noida (West) resident Arpan Khanal tested positive for Covid-19 on March 6 and spent about 14 days in the intensive care unit (ICU) as 65% of his lungs had been damaged. Three months on, Arpan hails Yoga to have been his lifeboat during his post-Covid recovery.The 42-year-old tested negative on March 28, but faced breathing issues and weakness. Yoga is not new to him as he and his family have been taking online Yoga sessions since the lockdown last year. His wife and son were also infected with Covid but were not in as critical a condition as him.“From April 1, my wife and I rejoined our online Yoga sessions and started doing light breathing exercises. It not only helped in respiratory issues, but also brought mental peace and positivity, which had been drained out of us because of sickness,” said Khanal.Khanal is one of the many people who have used Yoga to get back their health after recovering from Covid. Kush Singh, Khanal’s Yoga teacher, holds sessions for about 110 people daily.“Since April this year, around 25 new people from Noida-Ghaziabad have joined my sessions, who have recently recovered from Covid. We tell them to start Yoga only when they feel completely comfortable. It takes time for people to recover from weakness. Some light breathing exercises like ‘anulom vilom’ are taught, in order to help them increase their lung capacity,” said Kush Singh, a resident of Ghaziabad.Ravinder Singh Gill, an instructor from Noida’s Sector 107, adds that in the past year, more and more people have turned to Yoga. However, in the past few months, people who got Covid are also using Yoga to recover.“We have to be very careful while dealing with those who have had Covid as we do not want to exhaust them. Since we are teaching online, we cannot see the student’s expressions or body language clearly to ascertain what they are comfortable with. Hence, I prefer to give only light exercises for such people and progress only after they feel comfortable and confident of taking up heavier breathing exercises,” said Gill.He added that the proning exercises, which have been recommended by doctors to bring up oxygen levels in the body, find their roots in Yoga. “Proning exercises are a mix of various asanas of Yoga. Some of my students who had Covid were advised to exercise proning positions by doctors. They came back to tell us that they already knew those exercises as we had done them during Yoga as well,” said Gill.Dr NK Sharma, president, Indian Medical Association’s Noida chapter, said that Yoga is an important addition to the lifestyle in order to stay fit.“However, post-Covid patients should be highly cautious of the extent and strength of the Yoga exercises or asanas that they do. If the lungs have been infected severely, recovery will take time as the muscles in the lungs face constriction in relaxing and collapsing in order to breathe. Deep breathing can also be harmful if done excessively, as it may increase heart rate. Having said that, doctors recommend that mild or light Yoga exercises can be used in getting your health back on track after Covid,” said Dr Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-many-covid-survivors-turn-to-yoga-for-full-recovery-101624214014534.html

21-06-2021||World||US to share millions of Covid-19 shots with Latin America, Africa and Asia||In a bid to fulfill their commitment towards global Covid-19, the White House on Monday announced the plan to share more than 50 million US coronavirus vaccine doses, out of which 75% of the doses will primarily go to Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Africa. The global distribution will be carried out under the COVAX international vaccine-sharing programme.The global aid plan fulfills US President Joe Biden's commitment to share 80 million US-made vaccines with countries around the world.The White House in its statement said: "As we continue to fight the Covidd-19 pandemic at home and work to end the pandemic worldwide, President Biden has promised that the United States will be an arsenal of vaccines for the world," the White House said in a statement.Of the 55 million remaining doses, some 41 million would be shared through COVAX, the White House said, with approximately 14 million going to Latin America and the Caribbean, some 16 million to Asia, and roughly 10 million to Africa.The other 25%, or roughly 14 million doses, would be shared with "regional priorities," including Colombia, Argentina, Iraq, Ukraine, the West Bank and Gaza."For all of these doses, those most at risk, such as health care workers, should be prioritized, based on national vaccine plans," the White House said.As greater numbers of people get vaccinated in the United States, the Biden administration has turned its focus increasingly to shipping vaccines abroad. International partners are eager to get even more.The Biden-Harris Administration will not use its vaccines to secure favours from other countries, the White House asserted.The White House said, in addition to sharing doses from its own vaccine supply, the Biden-Harris Administration is also committed to working with US manufacturers to produce more vaccines to share with the world.To that end, ahead of the G7, Biden announced that the US will purchase half a billion Pfizer doses and donate them to 92 low- and lower middle-income countries and members of the African Union.Earlier this month, Biden had laid out his priorities for the first 25 million doses from that pledge.Here is how the US is sharing vaccines globally:Through COVAX, the US shares approximately 14 million shots with the Latin America and the Caribbean which includes nations like Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, Bolivia, Uruguay, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Haiti, and other Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries, Dominican Republic, Panama, and Costa Rica.In Asia, the US shares approximately 16 million shots. This includes nations like India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Maldives, Bhutan, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, Cambodia, and the Pacific Islands.With Africa under COVAX, the US shares approximately 10 million shots and the recipient countries will be selected in coordination with the African Union.The US also is also sharing Covid-19 vaccines directly with at least 30 other countries like Colombia, Argentina, Haiti, other CARICOM countries, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Panama, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Cabo Verde, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Yemen, Tunisia, Oman, West Bank and Gaza, Ukraine, Kosovo, Georgia, Moldova, Bosnia||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-share-millions-of-covid-19-shots-with-latin-america-africa-and-asia-101624294251715.html
21-06-2021||World||Pakistan PM, foreign minister face criticism for remarks in interviews||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi were criticised on Monday by politicians and social media users for their stand on matters such as sexual violence and the status of slain Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. In an interview with the news programme Axios on HBO, Khan said men would be affected if women wore “very few clothes” when he was asked about what the interviewer said was an “epidemic of sexual violence in Pakistan”. Khan preferred not to speak out on China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, saying Pakistan prefers to discuss such matters with the Chinese side “behind closed doors”.Qureshi, in an interview with Afghanistan’s Tolo News channel, ducked a question on whether he considered bin Laden a “martyr”. Despite Pakistan endorsing a joint statement by China, Russia and the US in March opposing the restoration of an Islamic emirate by the Taliban in Afghanistan, Qureshi didn’t offer a clear answer when he was asked if he opposed the return of an Islamic emirate.Both Qureshi and Khan have been strongly criticised for their remarks in the interviews by Pakistan’s opposition politicians, civil society activists and social media users.Also read: As FATF begins plenary meeting, reports emerge of surge in Taliban fund-raising in PakistanWhen Khan was asked during the interview on Axios on HBO why he raised the issue of Islamophobia in the West while remaining silent on the genocide against Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region, he replied, “Whatever issues we have with the Chinese, we speak to them behind closed doors. China has been one of the greatest friends to us in our most difficult times. When we were really struggling, our economy was struggling, China came to our rescue.” He added, “So, we respect the way they are and whatever issues we have, we speak behind closed doors.” He also sought to turn the focus to the situation in Kashmir, saying, “How come this is such a big issue in the Western world? Why are the people of Kashmir ignored? It is much more relevant compared to what might be going on [with the] Uyghurs, 100,000 Kashmiris have been killed.”Asked if it makes him feel “sick” that he must be silent because of the money China has poured into Pakistan, Khan replied, “I look around the world, what’s happening in Palestine, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Afghanistan. Am I going to start talking about everything? I concentrate on what is happening on my border, in my country.”Khan faced more criticism for his comments on women and sexual violence. “If a woman is wearing very few clothes, it will have an impact on the men, unless they are robots. I mean it’s common sense,” he said.“We don’t have discos here, we don’t have nightclubs, so it is a completely different society [and] way of life here. So if you raise temptation in the society to the point and all these young guys have nowhere to go, it has consequences in the society,” he added.Referring to the remarks by Qureshi and Khan, senior Pakistani journalist Abbas Nasir tweeted, “Is OBL a martyr? Hmmm...I will let that pass. To a question on blaming rape victims: Women who wear too few clothes are a temptation. Men are not robots. Two of Pakistan’s finest minds. The first went to Cambridge, the second to Oxford and got a post-grad from Annabels, London.”Former Pakistani parliamentarian Farhatullah Babar tweeted, “How one explains @SMQureshiPTI refusal to call Osama a terrorist even knowing well the terror attacks launched by OBL? Qureshi doesn’t want to invite the question how a terrorist lived in a cantonment for years. Question inevitable. Answer is clear: complicity or incompetence.”Columnist Mehr Tarar said in a tweet, “Prime Minister Khan must refrain from giving his personal explanations for increase in sexual abuse and rape cases in Pakistan. Not a shred of evidence to prove that clothing has anything to do with Pakistan’s rape cases. I thought he had learnt his lesson after the last debacle.”Pakistan People’s Party leader Sherry Rehman, a former ambassador to the US, too questioned Khan’s remarks. “Does IK not know that by saying women should dress a certain way, he is giving oppressors and criminals against women a new narrative to justify their behaviour. There is NO justification for a prime minister to talk this way. Highly irresponsible and condemnable,” she tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-pm-foreign-minister-face-criticism-for-remarks-in-interviews-101624291416966.html
21-06-2021||World||Canada extends India flight ban till July 21||The Canadian government has extended the suspension of direct flights from India till July 21. The announcement in this regard was made on Monday by the Public Health Agency of Canada.The decision was intimated in advance to the Indian government, an official confirmed.The suspension was originally announced on April 22 and was originally scheduled to last for 30 days. However, it was extended by another 30 days on May 21. In a statement, transport minister Omar Alghabra said that “given the number of Covid-19 cases continue to be very high in India, we have extended our flight restrictions for this country. We will continue to assess the evolving situation and determine appropriate action going forward”.The move was originally precipitated by increasing pressure upon the government of Justin Trudeau to act on this matter after several cases of the Delta variant originating in India were reported in Canada. There had also been mounting demands from provincial governments to ban these flights at the earliest because of the risk of transmission of cases into Canada. While that ban came into place amid a record surge in cases in India in April, with the crisis lasting through May, it will remain in place despite a significant decrease in daily cases being reported in India now.However, the Delta variant of Covid-19 has become widely prevalent in Canada, with health authorities considering it to be 150% more transmissible than the original virus. At the same time, the Canadian Press reported that this variant, first located in India, had caused over 2,000 cases in the country by Friday, citing Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam. It also said that earlier in the week, that number was at 1,187, thereby denoting a spike of nearly two-third in the number of cases. Health authorities in the province of Ontario have also warned that the variant could well dominate the caseload within a month. Public health officials have yet to update the exact number of daily cases as yet, though the count for the other three variants is provided regularly.Prior to the flight ban, both Air Canada and Air India were operating almost daily flights between the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver and New Delhi, India in an air corridor arrangement that came into place last summer. Passengers from India who arrive via an indirect route, through a third country, will have to provide a pre-departure negative coronavirus test result from the last port before continuing their journey.The Canadian government also announced that fully vaccinated citizens and permanent residents entering the country via air will no longer require mandatory hotel quarantine while they await results of an RT-PCR test taken on arrival at a Canadian airport. This relaxation will come into effect on July 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-extends-india-flight-ban-till-july-21-101624290876946.html
21-06-2021||World||Canada won't open border fully until 75% people vaccinated||The Canadian government announced a loosening of Covid-19 travel restrictions for fully vaccinated people amid warnings that a return to a completely open border will take awhile longer.Fully vaccinated Canadians and residents will exempt from the mandatory three-day hotel stay as well as a 14-day quarantine requirement on arrival to the country, Justin Trudeau’s government said in a statement on Monday. Travelers will still need to have tested negative for Covid-19 before they trip from their place of departure, and take a second test at the border.The move, effective July 5, is a first but incremental step to ease restrictions amid mounting impatience for the government to reopen the border between the two countries. A fuller reopening won’t happen until 75% of Canadians are fully vaccinated, Canada’s border chief said on Sunday. The world’s longest undefended border has been closed to most travel since March 2020. On Friday, the government extended the restrictions until at least July 21.“We haven’t reached the finish line, and the finish line is when a significant majority of Canadians, approximately 75%, are fully vaccinated,” Public Safety Minister Bill Blair told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. on Sunday. At present, less than a fifth of Canadians have received two shots, according to data compiled by CTV News.The border restrictions have kept families apart, blocked tourists and students, and hampered the world’s largest bilateral trading relationship. While trucks and trains continued to move goods, Canada’s tourism and travel-related businesses lost an estimated C$20 billion ($16 billion) in revenue last year, according to one estimate.The new measures announced on Monday will help primarily Canadians living in the U.S. come home without the added costs and burden associated with the full quarantine. It could also expedite entry for new immigrants and non-permanent residents like students.Travelers will still need to quarantine until they receive the results of the second test. The new rules don’t apply to tourists and non-residents and partially vaccinated Canadians will still need to do the full quarantine.Airlines, tour operators and other businesses on both sides of the border have been pleading for a more comprehensive reopening plan, with the vital summer season about to begin, and Canada’s go-slow approach is causing frustration. Blair’s announcement Friday that Canada would extend the border restrictions was met with some unusually blunt language from Brian Higgins, a New York Democrat who represents a border district.Canada prioritized giving first doses to as many people as possible before moving on to second doses amid a shortage in vaccine supplies. As a result, some 66% of Canadians have received one shot, but only 18% have had two, the CTV data show. By contrast, about 45% of Americans have had two doses, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.Despite its cautious stance, Trudeau’s government had approved a travel exemption for National Hockey League teams earlier this month for the final rounds of championship playoffs.Canada is expecting the delivery of 68 million doses by the end of July that should be enough to fully vaccinate the eligible population. Asked if that might allow Canada to reopen the border by the end of August, Blair said while he didn’t want to get ahead of the country’s public health agency, he was hopeful.“Clearly, as those vaccines arrive and as Canadians continue to get in those lines and get vaccines into their arms, we’re really optimistic that we can meet that threshold of 75%,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-won-t-open-border-fully-until-75-people-vaccinated-101624286885454.html
21-06-2021||World||US rescinds order on TikTok and WeChat, another Trump-era order revoked||The US Commerce Department on Monday rescinded a list of prohibited transactions with TikTok and WeChat, issued in September last year, paving the way for the Chinese-owned apps to function without restrictions.The Donald Trump administration had sought to impose severe restrictions on both the Chinese-owned apps.The move to rescind the prohibited transactions comes after President Joe Biden withdrew a series of Trump-era executive orders earlier this month. The Trump-era orders sought to ban new downloads of Tencent-owned WeChat and TikTok, and ordered a Commerce Department review of security concerns posed by those apps and others.The Commerce Department under Trump also had sought to ban other transactions that would have effectively banned WeChat's use the United States and later sought similar restrictions that would have barred TikTok's use.The department did not immediately comment.The Biden order directed the Commerce Department to monitor software applications like TikTok that could affect US national security, as well as to make recommendations within 120 days to protect US data acquired or accessible by companies controlled by foreign adversaries.WeChat, which has been downloaded at least 19 million times by US users, is widely used as a medium for services, games and payments.Biden's executive order revokes the WeChat and TikTok orders Trump issued in August, along with another in January that targeted eight other communications and financial technology software applications.The January Trump order directed officials to ban transactions with eight Chinese apps, including Ant Group's Alipay and Tencent's QQ Wallet and WeChat pay. No bans have been issued to date.The Trump administration had appealed judicial orders blocking the bans on TikTok and WeChat, but after Biden took office in January, the US Justice Department asked to pause the appeals.A separate US national security review of TikTok, launched in late 2019, remains active.With inputs from Reuters||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-rescinds-order-on-tiktok-and-wechat-another-trump-era-order-revoked-101624282674601.html
21-06-2021||World||Reports emerge of surge in Taliban fund-raising in Pakistan||As the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) began a plenary meeting on Monday that will assess Pakistan’s efforts to tackle terror financing, reports have emerged of a sharp increase in fund-raising by the Afghan Taliban on Pakistani soil.The FATF’s virtual plenary meeting, which will conclude on June 25, will decide whether to retain Pakistan in the “grey list” or the list of nations under increased monitoring by the multilateral watchdog. Pakistan was placed on the list in June 2018 for failing to curb terror financing and money laundering.Recent reports have said there has been a spurt in fund-raising and recruitment by the Afghan Taliban on Pakistani soil, especially in the restive Balochistan province. Several top Taliban leaders are believed to be based in Balochistan and form part of the Quetta Shura, named after the capital city of the province.Donations to the Afghan Taliban are on the “upswing” in Balochistan as the group intensifies attacks on Afghan forces ahead of the drawdown of US forces, locals told VOA. The international broadcaster funded by the US cited multiple sources and eyewitnesses as saying that fundraising for the Taliban “has continued in various parts of Pakistan”.A resident of Duki, 210 kilometres east of Quetta, told VOA that Afghan Taliban militants stay with coal miners in nearby mountains and come to the local bazaar every Friday to solicit 5,000 to 10,000 Pakistani rupees from shopkeepers.An unnamed member of the Balochistan assembly said members of the Taliban “openly hold fundraising campaigns” in several areas of the province such as Quetta, Kuchlak, Pashtun Abad, Ishaq Abad and Farooqia town. “It is not a secret,” he said, adding he suspected Taliban supporters use the money to fund the fight against the Afghan government.A resident of Quetta said he regularly witnessed Taliban members seeking funds at mosques. The resident quoted a Taliban member telling a congregation at a mosque that if someone cannot go for jihad or holy war, he should support the Taliban financially.Also read: HT Editorial - The real spoiler in KabulBoth VOA and Germany’s public broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW) reported multiple videos have emerged on social media, showing clerics and others allegedly collecting donations for the Taliban. A former parliamentarian from Balochistan told DW that the Taliban is engaged in recruitment on Pakistani soil.These development come at a time when the Taliban have captured some 30 districts across Afghanistan in an offensive launched since the US military withdrawal began on May 1.In its reports assessing Pakistan’s counter-terror financing efforts since the country was placed on the grey list in 2018, FATF listed the Taliban among eight terror groups involved in fund-raising on Pakistani soil. In 2019, FATF’s experts concluded Pakistan had done a lot to align its domestic laws with international counter-terror obligations but failed to do enough on the ground to curb fund-raising or freeze assets of the Taliban, Haqqani Network, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD), Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation, al-Qaeda and Islamic State.Since then, Pakistan has taken steps to crack down on fund-raising by LeT and JuD, but Indian experts believe little has been done to rein in the activities of the Afghan Taliban, especially the Haqqani Network, which has close ties with the Pakistani military.Following its last plenary meeting in February, FATF retained Pakistan in its grey list and urged the country to complete an action plan to counter terror financing before June, including steps to prosecute individuals and entities involved in such activities.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said the fund-raising by the Taliban on Pakistani soil went against everything the world community was doing to tackle terror financing.“Now that the US has announced it plans to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan by September, the Taliban is strengthening its position, security-wise through offensive campaigns and finance-wise by the campaign to raise money. Given the Taliban’s long-standing connections with Pakistan’s deep state, the country provides a conducive environment for raising such finances. All this is mocking the efforts by FATF to neutralise Pakistan’s support for terror financing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-fatf-begins-plenary-meeting-reports-emerge-of-surge-in-taliban-fund-raising-in-pakistan-101624283857763.html

But all the drugs have to be infused at hospitals or medical clinics, and demand has been low due to these logistical hurdles.In April, Gilead Sciences Inc said it will provide support to new local manufacturing facilities in India and donate active pharmaceutical ingredients to scale up production of its Covid-19 drug Remdesivir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gileads-remdesivir-cuts-covid-19-death-risk-study-101624280632355.html

The benchmark index was up 0.3% in the first few minutes of trading Monday. Banks and industrial companies were doing the best, while several big technology companies were falling. That helped pull the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite down 0.4%. Investors will be keeping an eye on more data coming out on inflation this week, as well as earnings from Nike and FedEx. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.48%.How world markets performedWorld markets were mixed Monday after a sell-off Friday on Wall Street gave the S&P 500 its worst weekly loss since February.Japan’s benchmark fell 3.3% but shares rose in London and Frankfurt. US futures were higher.Investors are still thinking over the Federal Reserve’s signal that it may raise current ultra-low interest rates sooner than expected and slow its market-supporting bond purchases.Part of the Fed’s mission is to keep prices under control. The fear is that burgeoning inflation may prompt central banks to dial back the lavish support that has lifted markets to new highs after they plunged at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic last year.Until its latest policy meeting, last week, the Fed had indicated it viewed recent price hikes as transient and would let the recovering economy run hot. Now it's forecasting raising interest rates twice in 2023.Asian markets opened mostly lower early Monday but the losses were contained.In Europe, Germany's DAX gained 0.3% to 15,493.53 and the CAC 40 in Paris edged 0.1% higher, to 6,573.41.

The injuries reportedly weren’t considered life-threatening.“Our first priority was making sure that the families were OK but now we are moving on to handling the damage,” Linda LaCloche, communications director in Naperville, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Chicago, told the Chicago Sun-Times.Officials in the nearby village of Woodridge said a tornado touched down late Sunday and a damage assessment was underway. There were no reports of significant injuries in the community, but people were urged to avoid the area due to downed power lines and trees.“We have no power at all. I’m sitting in the dark waiting to hear back about what’s going on and gathering reports,” Woodridge Mayor Gina Cunningham told the newspaper early Monday.Photos from Woodridge showed damaged fencing, toppled trees and a bent street sign.Residents in the nearby communities of Darien and Burr Ridge, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Chicago, were urged to take cover around 11:15 p.m., the National Weather Service in Chicago said on Twitter.“This is a dangerous situation!” the agency tweeted.Video showed several large trees downed and damage to homes and vehicles in the path of the storm. Some gas leaks were reported in Naperville, and crews went door to door shutting off lines, LaCloche said.The threat of wind damage remained for a few hours as the line of storms moved over northern Illinois and into northwestern Indiana, forecasters said. The severe threat was declared over at 2 am local time.Late Sunday and early Monday, severe thunderstorms also brought gusting winds and drenching rains to parts of Michigan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tornado-in-suburban-chicago-uproots-trees-damages-houses-4-injured-101624276133987.html
21-06-2021||World||Won't meet Joe Biden, says Iran's president-elect Ebrahim Raisi||Iran's president-elect said Monday he would not meet with President Joe Biden nor negotiate over Tehran's ballistic missile program and its support of regional militias, sticking to a hard-line position following his landslide victory in last week's election.Judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi also described himself as a “defender of human rights” when asked about his involvement in the 1988 mass execution of some 5,000 people. It marked the first time he's been put on the spot on live television over that dark moment in Iranian history at the end of the Iran-Iraq war.“The US is obliged to lift all oppressive sanctions against Iran," Raisi said at the news conference.Raisi sat in front of a sea of microphones, most from Iran and countries home to militias supported by Tehran. He looked nervous at the beginning of his comments but slowly became more at ease over the hour-long news conference.Asked about Iran's ballistic missile program and its support of regional militias, Raisi described the issues as “non-negotiable.”Tehran's fleet of attack aircraft dates largely back to before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, forcing Iran to instead invest in missiles as a hedge against its regional Arab neighbors, who have purchased billions of dollars in American military hardware over the years. Iran also relies on militias like Yemen's Houthis and Lebanon's Hezbollah to counterbalance against enemies like Saudi Arabia and Israel, respectively.On a possible meeting with Biden, Raisi simply answered: “No.” His moderate competitor in the election, Abdolnasser Hemmati, had suggested during campaigning that he'd be potentially willing to meet Biden.The White House did not immediately respond to Raisi's statements Monday. Raisi will become the first serving Iranian president sanctioned by the U.S. government even before entering office, in part over his time as the head of Iran’s internationally criticized judiciary — one of the world’s top executioners.The victory of Raisi, a protégé of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, came amid the lowest turnout in the Islamic Republic’s history. Millions of Iranians stayed home in defiance of a vote they saw as tipped in Raisi’s favor.Of those who did vote, 3.7 million people either accidentally or intentionally voided their ballots, far beyond the amount seen in previous elections and suggesting some wanted none of the four candidates. In official results, Raisi won 17.9 million votes overall, nearly 62% of the total 28.9 million cast.Raisi’s election puts hard-liners firmly in control across the government as negotiations in Vienna continue to try to save a tattered deal meant to limit Iran’s nuclear program, at a time when Tehran is enriching uranium at 60%, its highest levels ever, though still short of weapons-grade levels. Representatives of the world powers party to the deal returned to their capitals for consultations following the latest round of negotiations on Sunday.Top diplomats from nations involved in the talks said that further progress had been made Sunday between Iran and global powers to try to restore a landmark 2015 agreement to contain Iranian nuclear development that was abandoned by the Trump administration. They said it was now up to the governments involved in the negotiations to make political decisions.Raisi's election victory has raised concerns that it could complicate a possible return to the nuclear agreement. In his remarks Monday, Raisi called sanctions relief as “central to our foreign policy” and exhorted the U.S. to “return and implement your commitments” in the deal.On Saudi Arabia, which has recently started secret talks with Iran in Baghdad to reduce tensions with Iran, Raisi said that Iran would have “no problem” with a possible reopening of the Saudi Embassy in Tehran and the “restoration of relations faces no barrier.” The embassy was closed in 2016 when relations deteriorated.Raisi struck a defiant tone, however, when asked about the 1988 executions, which saw sham retrials of political prisoners, militants and others that would become known as “death commissions.”After Iran’s then-Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini accepted a UN-brokered cease-fire, members of the Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, heavily armed by Saddam Hussein, stormed across the Iranian border in a surprise attack. Iran ultimately blunted their assault.The trials began around that time, with defendants asked to identify themselves. Those who responded “mujahedeen” were sent to their deaths, while others were questioned about their willingness to “clear minefields for the army of the Islamic Republic,” according to a 1990 Amnesty International report.International rights groups estimate that as many as 5,000 people were executed. Raisi served on the commissions.“I am proud of being a defender of human rights and of people's security and comfort as a prosecutor wherever I was,” he said. “All actions I carried out during my office were always in the direction of defending human rights,” he added. “Today in the presidential post, I feel obliged to defend human rights.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wont-meet-joe-biden-says-iran-s-president-elect-ebrahim-raisi-101624275440118.html

To which, Khan answered saying that "he is more concerned about what is happening at the border of his country." The Pakistani PM also said that he has been speaking about this with the Chinese people "behind the closed doors;" and as long as he has been informed, "this is not the case, according to the Chinese people.".@jonathanvswan presses Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on why he’s outspoken against Islamophobia in the West but silent about the genocide of Muslim Uyghurs in western China. Khan: I concentrate on what is happening on my border. Swan: This is on your border. #AxiosOnHBO pic.twitter.com/QdLfY1qXGLThe journalist, Jonathan Swan of Axio, asked why he felt a need to write a public letter about "Islamophobia" in the West? "It happened after the 9/11 attack when the word Islam terrorism came into existence,” Khan said, adding, "The moment you say Islamic terrorism, the man in the street in the West thinks there is something in Islam that leads to terrorism. Or Islam causes radicalism."Read more: 'Women wearing few clothes impact men, unless robots': Pak PM on rising sexual violenceIn the question, Swan was referring to the letter, Khan wrote in October last year to the leaders of Muslim-majority countries to draw attention to the "increasing Islamophobia that is spreading in European countries where sizeable Muslim populations reside".The journalist then asked Khan about the atrocities of Uighur which is happening just "across his border" and he is so outspoken about islamophobia in Europe and the United States and silent on the treatment of Muslims in western China?"What our conversations have been with Chinese, this is not the case," Khan said in response. "Whatever issues we have with Chinese, we speak to them behind closed doors. China has been one of the greatest friends to us in our most difficult times. China came to the rescue when our economy was struggling," he also said.Khan went on to say that he doesn't comment on what's going on in other countries because he's more concerned with what's going on in his own nation. "I look around the world, what is happening in Palestine and Syria, Somalia, Afghanistan. Am I going to start talking about everything? I concentrate on what is happening on my border in my country," he said.Also Read | Pakistan's terror net gets exposed again as documentary traces journey of Paris attacker linked to 26/11"It is much more relevant compared to what might be going on with Uighur," insisted Khan. "100,000 Kashmiris have been killed. There are 800,00 Indian troops are there. It is an open prison there and 9 million Kashmiris are put there. Why this is not an issue. I think it is hypocrisy," he alleged.Over the last two years, multiple reports from Xinjiang have emerged proving that the central government in China is carrying out forced labour and sterilisations on Uighur in an exercise dubbed as a "campaign against terrorism." Activists and some Western politicians have been raising voice against the same as they accused the Chinese government of torturing Uighur in so-called education camps and destroying mosques.Earlier this year in March, in rare US bipartisan agreement, the top diplomats of the former administration of Donald Trump and the new one of Joe Biden called China’s treatment of the Uighurs 'genocide' in line with a stance of Canadian and Dutch parliaments.Meanwhile, the Chinese government has denied the allegations and said that "some anti-China forces ignore facts and truth and wantonly fabricate all kinds of Xinjiang-related lies." "People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, including Xinjiang women, live and work in peace and contentment," the Chinese foreign ministry said in March as allegations of human rights violations in Xinjiang mounted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-on-uyghurs-muslims-genocide-china-one-of-the-greatest-friends-101624272146610.html

"If a woman is wearing very few clothes, it will have an impact on the men, unless they are robots. It’s just common sense," Imran Khan said in an interview with 'Axios on HBO'. "This is cultural imperialism. Whatever is acceptable in our culture, must be acceptable everywhere else.

21-06-2021||World||Iran’s sole nuclear power plant undergoes temporary emergency shutdown: Report||Iran’s sole nuclear power plant has undergone an unexplained temporary emergency shutdown, the country's state TV reported.An official from the state electric company Tavanir, Gholamali Rakhshanimehr, said on a talk show that aired on Sunday that the Bushehr plant shutdown began on Saturday and would last "for three to four days.” Without elaborating, he said that power outages could result.This is the first time Iran has reported an emergency shutdown of the plant in the southern port city of Bushehr. It went online in 2011 with help from Russia. Iran is required to send spent fuel rods from the reactor back to Russia as a nuclear nonproliferation measure.The report came as top diplomats said that further progress had been made at talks Sunday between Iran and global powers to try to restore a landmark 2015 agreement to contain Iranian nuclear development that was abandoned by the Trump administration. They said it was now up to the governments involved in the negotiations to make political decisions.Earlier in the day, Tavanir released a statement saying that the Bushehr nuclear plant was being repaired, without offering further details. It said the repair work would take until Friday.In March, nuclear official Mahmoud Jafari said the plant could stop working since Iran cannot procure parts and equipment for it from Russia due to banking sanctions imposed by the US in 2018.Bushehr is fueled by uranium produced in Russia, not Iran, and is monitored by the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEA acknowledged being aware of reports about the plant, but declined to comment.Construction on the plant, on the coast of the northern reaches of the Persian Gulf, began under Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the mid-1970s. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the plant was repeatedly targeted in the Iran-Iraq war. Russia later completed construction of the facility.The plant, which sits near active fault lines and was built to withstand powerful quakes, has been periodically shaken by temblors. There have been no significant earthquakes reported in the area in recent days.Meanwhile, the European Union on Sunday chaired the final meeting in Vienna of the sixth round of talks between Russia, China, Germany, France, Britain and Iran.The nations involved in the negotiations have been trying to resolve the major outstanding issues on how to return the U.S. into the landmark nuclear agreement, which then-President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of unilaterally in 2018. Trump also restored and augmented sanctions to try to force Tehran into renegotiating the pact with more concessions.The meeting was the first since Iran’s hard-line judiciary chief won a landslide victory in the country’s presidential election last Friday. Some diplomats expressed concern that the election of Iran’s incoming President Ebrahim Raisi could complicate a possible return to the nuclear agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/irans-sole-nuclear-power-plant-undergoes-temporary-emergency-shutdown-report-101624257410163.html
21-06-2021||World||Indonesia's Covid tally nearing 2 million, 13,737 new cases recorded||Indonesia’s total Covid-19 cases nears 2 million with hospitals starting to fill up as the country grapples with the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus.The government confirmed 13,737 new cases on Sunday to bring the total to 1.99 million. Deaths have begun to pick up as the Covid-19 hospitalization rates exceed 70% in 87 cities across the country, with 371 people dying from the disease on Sunday. That’s the worst since April, according to government data.“Because this is concentrated in certain regencies and cities, we can still mobilize resources from other areas,” said Harif Fadhillah, chairman of the national association of nurses. “If we let this continue, the situation can become urgent and critical.”Indonesia is relying heavily on vaccines to stem the pandemic, with a pledge to administer 1 million doses a day in July, as well as movement limits. All non-essential businesses must stop operating at 8 p.m., while religious and social gatherings are banned in areas most at-risk, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said on Monday. The police and army have been deployed to ensure compliance, and the measures are effective through July 5, he added.The delta variant, which was first detected in India and has since spread globally, were a dominant strain in Kudus and Bengkalan towns in Java, which have became virus hot spots along with Jakarta.The hospitalization rate in Jakarta has exceeded 90% even if the government can add more as there are 34,000 beds in total with 17,300 currently allocated for Covid-19 patients, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said at the same briefing. The capital is in need of 1,179 more healthcare workers, while neighboring West Java province needs 400, Fadhillah said.“The government isn’t choosing between health and the economy,” Sadikin said. “The president has ordered for the health issue to be resolved first because the economy won’t move if the health issue isn’t resolved.”The recent surge in infections had been predicted by the government, which forecast in May that cases could rise by 40% to 60% in four to five weeks after Eid holidays. A persistent increase in cases could threaten recovery in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, which last year saw its first contraction in two decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesias-covid-tally-nearing-2-million-13-737-new-cases-recorded-101624257021633.html
21-06-2021||World||US envoy hopes North Korea responds positively on offered talks||President Joe Biden's special envoy for North Korea said Monday he hopes to see a positive reaction from the North soon on US offers for talks after the North Korean leader ordered officials to prepare for both dialogue and confrontation.Sung Kim, Biden's special representative for North Korea, is in Seoul to speak with South Korean and Japanese officials about the US' stalled diplomacy with the North over its nuclear programme and US-led sanctions.The trilateral talks followed a North Korean political conference last week where leader Kim Jong Un called for stronger efforts to improve his nation's economy, further battered last year by pandemic border closures and now facing worsening food shortages.After his meeting with senior South Korean diplomat Noh Kyu-duk, the US envoy Sung Kim said the allies took note of the North Korean leader's comments and are hoping the North will give a “positive response to our proposal for a meeting soon”.Sung Kim spoke later with Noh and Japanese nuclear envoy Takehiro Funakoshi over the stalled push to resolve the nuclear standoff with North Korea. “South Korea and the US will maintain close cooperation to keep the situation in the Korean Peninsula stable and find a way to resume the dialogue with North Korea as soon as possible,” Sung Kim told reporters.North Korea's economic setbacks followed the collapse of Kim Jong Un's ambitious summitry with then-President Donald Trump in 2019, when the Americans rejected the North Koreans' demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of their nuclear capabilities.Kim Jong Un in recent political speeches has threatened to bolster his nuclear deterrent and claimed that the fate of diplomacy and bilateral relations depends on whether Washington abandons what he calls hostile policies.US officials have suggested Biden would take the middle ground between Trump's direct dealings with Kim and President Barack Obama's policy of “strategic patience.” But some experts say the North likely must take concrete steps toward denuclearisation before the Biden administration would ease any sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-hopes-north-korea-responds-positively-on-offered-talks-101624256174904.html
21-06-2021||World||Lack of preparedness greatest failure of our collective ecosystem: US scientist||Describing Covid-19 as the worst health crisis in the recent memory, an American scientist leading the research wing of one of the top 20 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world has said that lack of preparedness has been the "greatest failure" of the collective ecosystem."I don't want to point a finger at anyone. In some ways it's a collective failure of our system. (While) it's the greatest success in our ecosystem our response to Covid-19 you might argue, it's also perhaps the greatest failure of our collective ecosystem, which was our lack of preparedness," Dr Andrew Plump, president of R&D, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, told PTI in an interview."Covid-19 is the worst health crisis of our generation or the generation before us. It has been a travesty. It's horrible what's happened across the world," said Dr Plump ahead of the 15th annual India-US Biopharma and Healthcare Summit on June 22, being organised by Boston-based USA India Chambers of Commerce (USAIC).However, there are silver linings and there are certainly learnings that can be taken forward, he noted."I think the most important learning is: Let's not get fooled again by history. History predicted this. We knew we were going to have a pandemic and in fact, we got lucky this time in some ways. Despite the massive losses it could have been, it could have been much worse," Dr Plump said.In a recent op-ed, he wrote that although the Covid-19 pandemic has been a human and healthcare disaster, by scientific measures the world was lucky this time."Covid-19 was far less lethal than its predecessors, less contagious than previous pandemic viruses, and we were able to quickly develop a cadre of effective vaccines. But luck is not a strategy," he wrote in an op-ed at STAT.A co-founder of the Covid R&D Alliance, which was established last year, Dr Plump argued that a pandemic needs to be given the same importance and priority by the government as they give to defense."The challenge with pandemics is that we think we can't see the enemy, so we don't even know where to start and so we don't do anything. But that's a fallacy. We know the enemy," he said, adding that science has advanced so much that eight or nine times out of 10 and they can project out."With 80-90 per cent confidence, we can guess what this virus is going to look like. Is it going to come from fluid, or it's going to come from coronavirus. So, we do know the enemy," he said.There are now enough analytical capabilities where they can survey viruses that exist in animals and can use advanced analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence to even make better predictions."So we're not just basing what's likely to come from what's coming in the past, but we're actually basing our ability to protect ourselves against future pandemics by knowing specifically what's likely to come easy with these advanced analytics," Dr Plump said.Observing that there is a great scope for collaboration between pharma companies of the two countries, and in particular platforms like that of the USA India Chambers of Commerce, he said that first and foremost, innovation and science need to be the cornerstone."Secondly, we need to have an infrastructure, we need to have a focus, we need to have collaboration beyond the walls of science that include governments and policymakers and not for profit organisations and that's something else that the USA India Chamber of Commerce has done," he said.Referring to this year's theme of the conference "From N of one to N of a billion" Dr Plump said, "The theme is meant to symbolise the fact that we have become so innovative in health sciences that we're today able to make therapies drugs that can be tailored to a single individual.""But we recognise that if we don't make drugs that are also treating the billions of patients that live across the world, we're not serving our purpose," he said and suggested that the USA Indian Chamber of Commerce can elevate the dialogue of healthcare innovation and bring it ensure that it's focused as much on innovation as it is on access.He opposed the move to grant TRIPS waiver to certain Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization (WTO), as being proposed by India and South Africa and supported by the United States."It's horrible, because the issue is all of us want to create solutions that enable rapid resolution of a global pandemic. That's not where the gap is. The gap is in the supply chain. It's in manufacturing. It's in access," he said."You even saw in India, recently, how you rolled out a vaccination program. Here the government made a decision to decentralise a lot of the work and it backfired. Vaccines ended up going to the wrong people. Costs were driven up. It's not about IP. It's really an operational challenge that we're facing right now; it's not an intellectual property challenge," Dr Plump said.So, not only does it fail to answer the problem, but also creates a challenge in the future. Because innovation is driven by intellectual property, the ability to have some proprietary access to a discovery, he said."And, if you step in and create structures that can in a wanton way like what we see with the WTO remove intellectual property protection, you're going to put the brakes on innovation in the future. So, I think it's a horrible example of trying to do the right thing, but with the wrong solution," Dr Plump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lack-of-preparedness-greatest-failure-of-our-collective-ecosystem-us-scientist-101624256186263.html
21-06-2021||World||Canada to extend flight suspension to India by another month||The Canadian government is expected to extend the suspension of direct flights from India by another month.The announcement in this regard will be made later on Monday by Canadian officials. The decision has been intimated in advance to the Indian government, an official confirmed.The suspension was originally announced on April 22 and was scheduled to last for 30 days. However, it was extended by another 30 days on May 21 and now another extension will be imposed for 30 days.The move was originally precipitated by increasing pressure upon the government of Justin Trudeau to act on this matter after several cases of the Delta variant of the coronavirus originating in India were reported in Canada. There had also been mounting demands from provincial governments to ban these flights at the earliest because of the risk of transmission of cases into Canada.While that prohibition came into place amid a record surge in cases in India in April, with the crisis lasting through May, it will remain in place despite a significant decrease in daily cases being reported in India now.However, the Delta variant of Covid-19 has become widely prevalent, with Canadian health authorities considering it to be 150% more transmissible than the original virus. At the same time, the Canadian Press reported that this variant, first identified in India, had caused over 2,000 cases in the country by Friday, citing Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam. It also said that earlier in the week, that number was at 1,187, thereby denoting a spike of nearly two-third in the number of cases. Health authorities in the province of Ontario have also warned that the variant could well dominate the caseload within a month. Public health officials have yet to update the exact number of daily cases as yet, though the count for the other three variants is provided regularly.Prior to the flight ban, both Air Canada and Air India were operating almost daily flights between the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver and New Delhi in India in an air corridor arrangement that came into place last summer. Passengers from India who arrive via an indirect route, through a third country, will have to provide a pre-departure negative coronavirus test result from the last port before continuing their journey.Easing of norms for air travel is also expected on Monday, particularly with regard to exemption for the mandatory hotel quarantine for citizens and permanent residents who are fully vaccinated. For now, all those arriving require a negative RT-PCR test result prior to boarding and have to take another test on arrival and remain in the designated hotel till the result is available. Even with another negative result, they have to complete the full 14-day self-isolation period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-extend-flight-suspension-to-india-for-another-month-101624252535592.html
21-06-2021||World||Brazil passes half a million Covid-19 deaths, experts warn of worse ahead||Brazil's death toll from Covid-19 surpassed 500,000 on Saturday as experts warn that the world's second-deadliest outbreak may worsen due to delayed vaccinations and the government's refusal to back social distancing measures.Only 11% of Brazilians have been fully vaccinated and epidemiologists warn that, with winter arriving in the southern hemisphere and new variants of the coronavirus circulating, deaths will continue to mount even if immunizations gain steam.Brazil has registered 500,800 deaths from 17,883,750 confirmed Covid-19 cases, according to Health Ministry data on Saturday, the worst official death toll outside the United States. Over the past week, Brazil has averaged 2,000 deaths per day.Covid-19 continues to devastate countries around the region with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reporting 1.1 million new cases of Covid-19 and 31,000 deaths in the Americas last week. PAHO noted upticks in six Mexican states, Belize, Guatemala, Panama and some places in the Caribbean.PAHO warned that Colombia's Covid-19 situation is at its worst point yet, with intensive care unit beds filled in major cities.Experts see the toll in Brazil, already the highest in Latin America, climbing far higher."I think we are going to reach 700,000 or 800,000 deaths before we get to see the effects of vaccination," said Gonzalo Vecina, former head of Brazilian health regulator Anvisa, predicting a near-term acceleration in fatalities."We are experiencing the arrival of these new variants and the Indian variant will send us for a loop."Vecina criticized far-right President Jair Bolsonaro's handling of the pandemic, including the lack of a coordinated national response and his skepticism toward vaccines, lockdowns and mask-wearing requirements, which he has sought to loosen.Thousands of Brazilians protested against Bolsonaro's management of the pandemic in nationwide demonstrations on Saturday, blaming the administration for the high death toll and calling for the president's ouster.Raphael Guimaraes, a researcher at Brazilian biomedical center Fiocruz, said delays in the vaccination program in Latin America's most populous nation meant its full effects would not be felt until September or later.Guimaraes warned that Brazil could revisit scenes from the worst of its March-April peak, when the country averaged 3,000 deaths per day."We are still in an extremely critical situation, with very high transmission rates and hospital bed occupancy that is still critical in many places," he said.This week, new confirmed cases in Brazil accelerated to more than 70,000 per day on average, edging past India for the most in the world.Vaccination will be crucial in beating the virus in Brazil, since the country has failed to reach a consensus on social distancing and masks, said Ester Sabino, an epidemiologist at the University of Sao Paulo."We really need to increase vaccination very quickly," she said.However, evidence from neighboring Chile, which like Brazil has relied overwhelming on a vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech, suggests it may be months before mass immunization will effectively curb transmission.Nearly half of Chileans have been vaccinated, but their capital Santiago just went back into lockdown as cases surged again to near peak levels.Brazil will need to inoculate some 80 million people to reach Chile's current per capita vaccination levels.That will require a more consistent supply of vaccines and ingredients in Brazil, which have been spotty in recent months, as imports from China were delayed after Bolsonaro antagonized Beijing with comments perceived as anti-Chinese.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-passes-half-a-million-covid-19-deaths-experts-warn-of-worse-ahead-101624249624851.html
21-06-2021||India||2022 Punjab polls: Kejriwal says AAP’s CM face will be a Sikh||AMRITSAR: Ahead of 2022 assembly elections, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced that the party’s CM candidate in Punjab will be from the Sikh community. Replying to a question during a press conference after inducting former Inspector General of Punjab Police, Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, into the party at Circuit House, Kejriwal said, “I totally agree with your curiosity and keenness on this issue… because Punjab is annoyed with the current leadership and looking for a new kind of leadership. In wake of this, discussions within the party are underway to choose the CM face. You will be informed when time will come, and you will be proud of the party choice”. He added, “However, it is certain that the AAP CM face for Punjab will be from Sikh community. Because we feel that Punjab is the only state across the world, which gets Sikh CM. I feel that this is a right of the Sikh community, and this right should be upheld.” However, former minister and Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia said it was condemnable that Kejriwal was talking about giving a “Sikh face” in Punjab as its chief ministerial candidate but had not picked even a single Sikh face in Delhi despite forming the government thrice.Kejriwal also said he had lot of respect for dissident Congress bigwig Navjot Singh Sidhu. When asked if there was any possibility of Sidhu joining the AAP and if there had been any talks with the Congress leader, who has opened front against Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh with harsh attacks, Kejriwal said, “Sidhu Sahib is a senior Congress leader. I respect him very much. We should not indulge in loose talks about this kind of leader.” Speaking about his meeting with Sidhu, the Delhi CM said, “Whenever anything happens, you will be informed first.” Flanked by AAP’s Punjab unit president and MP Bhagwant Mann, state affairs in-charge Jarnail Singh, co-incharge Raghav Chadha, leader of the opposition in Punjab assembly Harpal Singh Cheema and party MLAs from the state, Kejriwal welcomed the former IPS officer into the party fold. The former senior officer opted for voluntary retirement on April 11, two days after the report prepared by the special investigation team (SIT) led by him in the Kotkapura firing incident, in which Sikh protesters were injured in 2015, was quashed by the Punjab and Haryana high court. The court directed the state government to reconstitute a new SIT without Kunwar Vijay Pratap. “He has remained a dedicated cop of the common people, who struggled to get justice for the people of Punjab in the Bargari sacrilege case,” Kejriwal said, adding, “The entire Punjab is watching how the masterminds of the Bargari sacrilege and the Kotkapura firing case were roaming freely. When he was unable to do anything while being there in the system, he resigned. It is not an easy task.” The AAP national convener also announced that the culprits of the Bargari sacrilege case would be put behind bars if his party came to the power in the state. He added that the people of Punjab were fed up with the Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal and wanted change. “The people of Punjab gave chances to all three parties, but nothing changed…,” he said while appealing to the people to give one chance to his party to usher in a change in the state. “If Sri Guru Granth Sahib ji could not get justice on the land of Punjab then what would be the condition of the common man,” said Kunwar Vijay Pratap, thanking the party leadership for inducting him into the party. Reacting on the former IPS officer’s induction into the AAP, Majithia said Kunwar Vijay Pratap’s entry into the AAP proved Kejriwal was “an integral part of the conspiracy” to malign the SAD in the cases of sacrilege. He said it was condemnable that a former “tainted” cop, who had “misused his position to conduct a biased and politically motivated probe” into the Kotkapura firing incident, was rewarded by AAP. “Custodial interrogation of the former police officer is also needed to expose the AAP-Congress conspiracy,” he added.Bhagwant Mann said, “People had hoped after Kunwar Vijay Pratap’s appointment as the head of SIT probing the Bargari sacrilege case, that the culprits would definitely be punished. But the system is corrupt, and the ruling party is working in collusion to save the real culprits.” Later in the day, Kejriwal also visited Golden Temple and Durgiana Temple. He was shown black flags by SAD workers when he was on the way from Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport to Circuit House. Kunwar Vijay Partap has served as the Amritsar city senior superintendent of police and was also the deputy inspector general (DIG), border range. He came to limelight as the investigator in the cases of Kotakapura firing incident and Behbal Kalan Police firing incident in 2015 when two Sikh protesters were killed. The protesters were seeking justice in the Bargari sacrilege case, which has turned into one of the biggest political issues in Punjab at the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2022-punjab-polls-kejriwal-says-aap-s-cm-face-will-be-a-sikh-101624299516747.html

21-06-2021||India||In his first address, Guv says TN will oppose ‘infringement on state rights’||Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit’s customary address at the first session of the 16th legislative assembly established that the new DMK-led government’s ‘ultimate goal’ is ‘greater autonomy of states’, to create ‘true federalism at the union level through constitutional means’, and one that is guided by Dravidian dogma.“Strong states are needed to create a strong union,” the Governor said. “This government will staunchly stand in defence of the rights of the states and constitutionally oppose any infringement of such rights. At the same time, we will maintain a cordial relationship with the Union Government as partners in the process of nation-building, in line with our policy of extending our hand in friendship, even as we speak up for our rights.”Throughout his speech, the Governor addressed the Government of India as the ‘Union’ and never as the ‘Centre’ - a nomenclature that follows the Constitutional guidelines was consciously brought in by the DMK reflecting its position on federalism.Purohit also emphasised the state’s vision of social justice by continuing and protecting the 69% reservation (given that the Supreme Court recently struck down the Maratha quota) and exemption from NEET. Based on the recommendation of the recently appointed Justice AK Rajan committee to study the adverse impact of NEET on socially and educationally backward students, the state would introduce legislation to ensure that the students of Tamil Nadu are not adversely affected and obtain the President’s consent.Purohit said that the Government is guided by the Dravidian movement which identifies social justice, gender equality, economic equity, opportunity-for-all through reservations, and progress through education and social reforms. He added that there cannot be social justice when there is high economic inequity and to correct that, the new government is focused on inclusive growth. “These values will drive every action, every legislation, every scheme, and every initiative of this Government,” he said.Chief minister MK Stalin-led government plans to revitalise the Lok Ayukta to deal with complaints against public authorities including elected representatives and government officials. “Providing clean administration is the highest priority,” Purohit said, looking up at the assembly members and urging them to clap. “Why are you all silent? Clean governance is the highest priority of the government,” he said before continuing his speech that the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption (DVAC) will expedite pending complaints.A Right to Services Act will be introduced to streamline the delivery of various public services by government agencies. Keeping in line with transparency and in the case of temples, the government will protect assets, lands and properties. A state-level advisory committee for all major Hindu temples will be constituted to enhance facilities for devotees, improve the maintenance of temples and advise on related issues.For Chennai, preparations for the third master plan for the city will be completed before the due date of 2026. During Stalin’s mayoral term of the Chennai corporation, he rolled out several schemes under ‘Singara Chennai’ meaning beautiful Chennai. “Singara Chennai 2.0 programme will be launched to provide modern world-class infrastructure and services in Greater Chennai Corporation,” Purohit said.Opposition leaders dubbed the Governor’s address as disappointing. “The DMK made 505 poll promises but none of the important promises was mentioned by the Governor in his address,” leader of opposition and former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami told reporters.“They haven’t given a clear plan for NEET to be exempted from Tamil Nadu,” said PMK founder S Ramadoss. The assembly will be on until June 24th and Stalin is expected to give his responses on that day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-his-first-address-guv-says-tn-will-oppose-infringement-on-state-rights-101624297717233.html

Within 5 minutes, a nurse came and gave the vaccine again before I could tell her that I have been vaccinated,” said Sahu from his village over phone.“I was too shocked. The officials there told me that nothing would happen and if anything happens then I should go to the nearby health centre,” he said. He was given an oral rehydration solution to drink. Rajendra Behera, the official observer at the vaccination centre, said the gaffe happened as Sahu was present in the vaccination area even after receiving the shot instead of shifting to the observation room. It was by mistake that he was given the second dose, he said.Mayurbhanj chief district medical officer Rupabhanu Mishra, however, rebutted Sahu. “This can’t happen... In any case, we have ordered a probe,” he said.On Monday, the district administration sent a team to Sahu’s home to check if he had any adverse reaction to the vaccine. “Luckily, I have had no adverse reaction so far. But anything could have happened. Those vaccinating should have been more cautious,” he said.Last week, a 63-year-old woman in Bihar was administered two doses of two different Covid vaccines the same day. Sunila Devi from Patna was told to wait for some time after she got her shot at a vaccination centre in Punpun block town. She, however, assumed that everyone should take vaccines at both the counters and stood in another queue for vaccines. Soon, she was administered the Covishield vaccine by the health workers. The woman is said to be fine but is under observation.In April, Kamlesh Kumari in her 50s in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur Dehat district was given two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine at a government centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-orders-probe-after-51-yr-old-says-he-was-given-vaccine-twice-101624297057189.html
21-06-2021||India||‘Dream team’ of international economists to advise Stalin for inclusive growth of TN||To advise chief minister M K Stalin, the Tamil Nadu government has constituted what is being dubbed as a ‘dream team’ with leading global economic experts comprising Nobel laureate Esther Duflo, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, former chief economic advisor to the Indian government Arvind Subramanian, development economist Jean Dreze and former union finance secretary S Narayan, as announced by Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Monday.The five-member team was brought together by state finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, who, before his political stint, was an investment banker in the US and Singapore.“The chief minister was keen that we must get the best minds in the world to help us. Our priority is that growth should be inclusive,” said Rajan.“Both Professor Rajan and Dr Subramanian are Tamilians. Professor Duflo has been working with Tamil Nadu through J-PAL,” he said, explaining their international experience and connections with the state. Duflo and her spouse Abhijit Banerjee, with whom she shares the Nobel prize, are co-founders of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) that researches on policies for poverty alleviation that are informed by scientific evidence. Narayan is also the author of ‘The Dravidian Years- Politics and Welfare in Tamil Nadu.’Governor Banwarilal Purohit made this announcement during his address at the first 16th legislative assembly meeting of the state on Monday. Named as the “Economic Advisory Council to the Chief Minister’, the team will help chart out a rapid and inclusive economic growth for Tamil Nadu.“Based on the recommendations of this Council, the government will revitalize the state’s economy and ensure that the benefits of economic growth reach all segments of society,” the Governor said.“In recent years, we have seen a slowdown in Tamil Nadu’s economic growth rate. This government will make all-out efforts to reverse this trend and usher in a period of rapid economic growth taking full advantage of the available limited window of the demographic dividend,” he added.The experts have worked in the areas such as poverty alleviation, development economics, gender inequity.Later in the day, a government order was issued that the additional chief secretary of the finance department, S Krishnan, will act as the convener of the council. The order said that the fiscal situation is precarious with fiscal deficits and a large overhang of debt but there is the public expectation for the government to deliver faster on economic growth, social justice and equity.“In this context, the government requires expert advice from the best economists available globally, who are familiar with Tamil Nadu, its economy, society and polity, as also the trends in the Indian and global economy,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dream-team-of-international-economists-to-advise-stalin-for-inclusive-growth-of-tn-101624296097216.html
21-06-2021||India||Soon, drones could be used to transport vaccines to remote areas||Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, could soon be used to transport Covid-19 vaccines to challenging remote places in the quickest possible time, said people privy to the developments.“The study on drones transporting the vaccines, conducted in association with the ICMR, has been done. The ICMR has been informed about the parameters finalised for this. Transportation of vaccines could begin if these parameters are followed,” said an IIT-K spokesperson.The IIT-K and the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), which were asked to explore the feasibility of the option, have reportedly given a go-ahead to the plan after a detailed study, said the people cited above.As the next step, the ICMR will enter into an agreement with the drone operating companies, the tendering process for which has already begun, they said. The idea was first mooted by the ICMR.However, when it went to the ministry for civil aviation for approval, it was told to first conduct a feasibility study in association with the IIT-K.“Making the vaccines available to people living in such inhospitable parts is a challenge and the ministry wanted the ICMR and the IIT-K to conduct a joint study on how far sending the vaccine through drones was safe?” said people at The Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) on condition of anonymity.Aerospace engineering Professor AK Ghosh and his team studied the plan and conducted many experiments before concluding that the plan could work.In the field trials, Prof Ghosh and his team analysed the impact of take-off, airborne and landing tie vibration on the vaccine.They also studied if vaccines will be affected as the drones were battery-operated and could impact the temperature.Based on these findings, the team set certain parameters, which, if followed, could make the transportation of vaccines to remote places possible.The drone to be used in vaccine transportation essentially should have a minimum flying range of 35 km and should be able to carry a load of four kilos.Also, the drone should be able to fly 100 meters above and take off vertically with that much load. The drones own weight should be in accordance with the standards set by the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soon-drones-could-be-used-to-transport-vaccines-to-remote-areas-101624293097132.html
21-06-2021||India||Is India's second Covid-19 wave over? Not completely, say experts||Witnessing the decline of the deadly second wave of Covid-19, India has seen multiple green flags indicating the end of the crisis. The green flags include a sharp decline in cases with India reporting only 1/7th of the cases it reported during the peak last month, arrest in positivity rate and deaths, and lower active cases.India on Monday saw 53,256 fresh cases of Covid-19, the lowest in 88 days. For perspective, India had seen the highest count of daily infections on May 6 when it reported 414,188 Covid-19 cases in just 24 hours. In line with World Health Organisation's norms for reopening a region, the Covid-19 positivity rate should be less than 5% for 14 days in a row. India on Monday achieved that milestone as well.So does that mean India has turned a corner and can proceed with reopening? The experts are still not convinced enough to declare the end of the second wave in the country.While it is safe to say that the worst is over, according to the experts, the holistic picture should not discount the emerging new variants which have sparked fears globally and started third waves in countries like the UK. Additionally, some parts of India are still seeing a positivity rate over and above 5%.Pointing out that India's second wave fell as sharply as it rose, as predicted by many experts, Naga Suresh Veerapu from Shiv Nadar University warned of new variants like Delta which is responsible for driving India's second wave.“With the current positivity rate at less than 5 per cent, India’s Covid-19 second wave is on the wane as quickly as it rushed to its peak, but the end of it may yet be far away as more transmissible new variants such as Delta plus variant are emerging,” Veerapu, associate professor at the School of Natural Sciences (SoNS), Shiv Nadar University told PTI.Positivity rate is a crucial metric that shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and over time it provides an idea of whether a region’s testing strategy is adequate to contain the virus.Cautioning with the unpredictable pattern of virus, he said, “The Delta variant that emerged in March spread across the different parts of India, then cases surged to the peak yielding a second wave. The second wave conjoined with the first when the latter was at 1 per cent positivity rate."The central government on Saturday joined experts and courts in warning states and Union territories not to become “complacent” about a decline in Covid-19 infections, urging them to ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed and asking them to monitor signs of a potential spike in cases as they lift lockdown restrictions.In a letter to states and UTs, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said that while the opening up of businesses is “essential” for revival of economic activity, the local administrations must ensure that the whole “process is carefully calibrated”.India should not sideline the absolute number of cases which is still above 50,000 in the country, said public policy expert Chandrakant Lahariya, adding that several parts of the country still have a positivity rate over 5%. This reduces India's chances of opening up completely.“Therefore, before saying that the second wave is over, I would like to wait for the TPR to come down below 5 per cent everywhere and sustain for two weeks or longer,” he told PTI.India’s tally of Covid-19 cases is 2,99,35,221 (2.99 crore/29.9 million) while active cases have reduced to 7,02,887, according to the data by health ministry.The second wave of the pandemic overwhelmed the healthcare system of the country, leaving hospitals struggling to cope with the surge in cases and critical drugs and oxygen in short supply. Infections have now slowed down and restrictions have been relaxed in most states.Agreeing that the drop in India’s cases has been quite dramatic, Menon noted, “From all we know, this is a genuine decline, both in urban and rural India.”For a country the size of India, enough attention needs to be paid at the local level,” Lahariya said.He explained that Covid-19 is not just any other respiratory illness and decision-making parameters cannot be simple.“We know that there are new variants which are more transmissible. We know that human behaviour determines the spread of this virus. Therefore, it is not very relevant if we declare whether the second wave is over or not,” the public policy expert explained.“Key is, are we prepared to respond to the rise in cases? That's where the attention has to be,” Lahariya told PTI.India’s second and worst wave so far of infections began in March and started to ease sometime in May. At its peak, India added an average of 3,91,819 daily cases for the week ending May 9.It also surpassed the US — the worst-hit nation in cumulative cases — in recording the most number of infections in a single day (305,062) when it recorded 315,909 cases on April 21. In fact, India recorded more than USA's highest single day tally every day from April 21 to May 15. The world’s worst outbreak at the time brought the national capital to its knees, as hospitals ran out of medical oxygen and life-saving drugs and bodies piled up in crematoria. The health care infrastructure in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Odisha, too, were stretched thin in those months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-india-s-second-covid-19-wave-over-not-completely-say-experts-101624280631210.html

21-06-2021||India||‘Optional exams in Aug, Sep only for main subjects’: CBSE tells SC||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will have a Committee to resolve grievances of students upset over the marks awarded under the tabulation scheme for Class 12 students and the option to write exams for interested candidates will tentatively be held within a month from August 15 depending on the conditions being conducive for holding an offline examination, as stated by the Board in an affidavit filed before the Supreme Court on Sunday.The affidavit, filed through advocate Rupesh Kumar, said, “Regarding the date before which the optional examination for the candidates who are not satisfied with their assessment with the policy, the examinations for such candidates shall be conducted any time between August 15 to September 15, subject to conducive situation.” Even the Private/ Patrachar/2nd chance compartment candidates would have to appear in the offline exams to be conducted during the same period, the Board informed.A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari will take up the affidavit on Tuesday as some petitions that have challenged the tabulation scheme of CBSE and Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) could not be listed on Monday.Last week, when the CBSE, CIISCE submitted their tabulation schemes to Court, it was found wanting on two fronts – lack of dispute resolution mechanism and clear dates for results and holding of optional exams.The CISCE informed the Supreme Court that it wishes to hold the optional exams before September 1 subject to conducive conditions. On the issue of settlement of grievances, the CISCE informed the Court about an inbuilt provision in its scheme allowing candidates to submit complaints to their respective schools that would then be forwarded to CISCE within a week.The CBSE also stated in its affidavit that all disputes regarding the computation of results will be referred to a committee formed by the Board. This has been made part of the tabulation scheme as well. In addition, the CBSE scheme provides that any candidate who wishes to appear in the optional offline examination will have the facility of registering online.As and when conditions are conducive, the Board will hold physical examination limited to the main subject papers. The marks obtained in this examination shall be treated as final.Last week, the CBSE came out with its scheme for tabulating marks of Class 12 students on a 30:30:40 formula that took the best of three subject marks of Class X boards (30 per cent), followed by annual results of Class 11 (30 per cent), and pre-boards or internal assessment conducted during Class 12 (40 per cent). The scheme was to apply to nearly 14.5 lakh students across the country.The Council for Indian School Certificate Examination’s (CISCE) scheme took into account the best performance of the student in Class 11 and 12 based on examinations conducted and practical/projects with less emphasis on Class 10 board results.An application moved by UP Parents Association was in favour of holding the examination and criticized the schemes formulated by the boards. In the case of CISCE, the bench was told that the marks to be obtained from schools have been deposited with CISCE but with regard to CBSE, there was scope for manipulation.As per CBSE scheme, a result committee of every school will tabulate marks based on the tabulation scheme and submit results to CBSE. The committee will comprise the principal, two senior-most faculty teaching Class 12 and two senior-most teachers from neighbouring schools.The CBSE scheme even provided for rationalization standards by which the results submitted by a school have to be moderated in terms of the school’s best performance in the past three years. Any student securing more than the highest marks attained by students of the same school will be awarded two marks more than the best performing score of the school in the past three years.The Court also listed for Tuesday an application filed by three private/compartment candidates who have demanded an assessment scheme similar to regular students.

As a result, the state government was asked to relieve the IAS officer with immediate effect and he was directed to report to North Block by May 31.West Bengal chief minister, however, requested the Prime Minister to withdraw the order to recall Bandyopadhyay. Later, she informed that the bureaucrat has retired from the service and will not join in Delhi and has been appointed as her chief advisor.Bandyopadhyay decided to retire on May 31 rather than avail the three-month extension granted to him by the state government.The entire controversy erupted after the chief minister arrived 30 minutes late for the meeting held by the Prime Minister at Kalaikunda in Paschim Medinipur district to take stock of the post-cyclonic situation. After arriving late for the meeting, the chief minister and the then chief secretary left for the 'pre-scheduled' meeting at Digha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-centre-initiates-disciplinary-proceedings-against-alapan-bandyopadhyay-101624280825558.html

The Lakha red granite of the state will be used in the construction of the iconic Central Vista project.

Named after Lakha village, the red granite is found on the border of Jaisalmer and Barmer districts will be utilized in the construction of flooring, walkways, and pillars in the Central Vista . The sourcing has been going on for the past two months and thus far 55,000 cubic meters of stone have been sold. Lakha red granite is coveted for its unique red shade. It has a smooth texture and waves of multi-coloured microparticles on the red make this stone very eye-catching. Bhagwan Singh Bhati, an engineer with the state’s mining department in Jaisalmer said that Lakha red granite is famous for its colour. It is also exported to many other countries, he added. A major supplier of this stone, Kamal Singh Kohra, said that so far he has supplied around 600 trucks of stone which will be used in the construction of one lakh feet area. “Before transporting, the raw stone is processed here,” he said.

21-06-2021||India||Pakistan PM Imran Khan again seeks US intervention on Kashmir||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has again sought the intervention of the US to settle the Kashmir issue with India, a move that is unlikely to go down well with New Delhi, which has consistently spurned mediation by any third party. Khan made the call for the US administration to help resolve the dragging Kashmir issue during an interview with the news programme Axios on HBO. In the past, Khan found a ready taker for his calls for US intervention on Kashmir in former president Donald Trump, but such efforts were always shot down by India. The Pakistani premier acknowledged he hasn’t spoken to US President Joe Biden since the latter assumed office in January and said he would raise the issue of Kashmir if there was a meeting between the two leaders. Asked what he would discuss during a meeting with Biden, Khan replied: “The US has a big responsibility, the most powerful nation in the world – almost 1.4 billion people living in the subcontinent, we are held hostage [by] one dispute in Kashmir. Also Read | Pakistan exposed as documentary tracks journey of Paris attacker linked to 26/11“A disputed territory, according to the UN Security Council resolutions. There should have been a plebiscite for the people of Kashmir to decide about their own future. That has never taken place, it’s festering. If the Americans have the resolve, the will, this can be sorted out.” There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Khan’s remarks. In the past, India has ruled out intervention or mediation on the Kashmir issue by any third party. In response to recent statements from Islamabad opposing any possible changes in Jammu and Kashmir, New Delhi has maintained that the region is an integral part of India and such moves amounted to interference in the country’s internal matters. Khan had raised the Kashmir issue at least twice with Trump in 2019 and 2020 and the former president had offered to help India and Pakistan settle the issue. Despite pushback from New Delhi, Trump had persisted with similar offers. During the interview, Khan contended that India and Pakistan would no longer need their nuclear arsenals if the Kashmir issue was settled. Asked if his goal for the two countries was nuclear disarmament, Khan replied: “I am completely against nuclear arms, I always have been. We’ve had three wars against India and ever since we’ve had [a] nuclear deterrent, we have had no war between the two countries. “We have border skirmishes but we’ve never faced war. The moment there is a settlement on Kashmir, I believe the two neighbours will live as civilised people. We will not need to have these nuclear deterrents.” Khan ducked another question on assessments by experts that Pakistan has the world’s fastest growing nuclear arsenal and indicated his country’s atomic weapons were needed to achieve some sort of parity with India. “I don’t know where they [experts] have come up with this. Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal is simply as a deterrent, to protect ourselves,” he said. “I’m not sure whether we’re growing it or not because as far as I know...the only one purpose [of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons] – it’s not an offensive thing. Any country which has a neighbour seven times the size as Pakistan has, would be worried,” he added. Khan also made the surprising admission that he hasn’t spoken to the US president since Biden assumed office in January. Asked why such a conversation hadn’t happened, he said: “Whenever he has time, he can speak to me but at the moment clearly he has other priorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-again-seeks-us-intervention-on-kashmir-101624274376335.html

They were involved in conversion of over 1,000 people in the past 18 months, police said.ATS has lodged a First Information Report (FIR) in Lucknow against the duo, some unidentified persons and Islamic Da’wah Centre (IDC) under section 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 120 B(criminal conspiracy) 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion) 153 B(imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) 295(injuring or defiling place of worship) 511(attempt to commit offences) of IPC along with relevant sections of the state’s new anti-conversion law, Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act. In a press conference, additional director general (Law & Order) of UP, Prashant Kumar said in Lucknow, “The duo was involved in an illegal, large scale conversion of people of different faiths to Islam in UP and other parts of the country. Our teams are working to identify other members of the group and their supporters.”Jahangir Alam, a mufti (Islamic preacher), is linked with IDC in Jamia Nagar. Alam allegedly used the centre for mass conversions, and organised an annual convocation for the newly converted there. Umar Gautam allegedly looked for people they could convince to convert, said the police officials. Gautam himself converted to Islam a few years ago.The officials have also recovered a register from the accused that contains details of over a 1,000 people who were converted by the duo in the past 18 months.“They targeted vulnerable groups in the society and lured them with the promise of jobs and other avenues to convert them. They also targeted specially abled children living in various institutions and converted them forcefully without their parents’ consent,” said UP ATS chief GK Goswami. “The duo also converted girls of poor households and married them off to Muslim men,” he added. The officials also alleged that the men received funding from various international organisations, including Pakistani spy agency ISI, for their activities. “We are looking into the financial aspects of the group to get more details about the funding which will be presented before the court,” said Prashant Kumar. The authorities came to know about the group in June following the arrest of two Muslim men who tried to enter a temple complex in Dasna area of Ghaziabad district pretending to be Hindus. “Their interrogation led us to Umar Gautam and the mufti. They were called for questioning on several occasions and were arrested after we had gathered enough evidence against them,” said ADG Prashant Kumar. “We are trying to ascertain the motive behind these activities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upatsarrests-two-delhi-men-for-mass-conversion-racket-101624270176176.html

21-06-2021||India||As Centre begins free vaccination for all against Covid, Nadda has a question for Oppn||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president JP Nadda said on Monday that the issue of Covid-19 vaccine was heavily politicised by the opposition parties, adding the ongoing vaccination drive in India is the fastest and the largest globally.“Firstly, it was said that there will be hesitancy in taking the Covid-19 vaccine and the medical trials haven’t been completed. Some politicians even said people should be treated as guinea pigs or rats. What kind of language is this?” Nadda said while speaking to reporters after paying a visit to the vaccination centre in Delhi’s Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.His reference to the phrase ‘guinea pigs’ can be seen as an indirect attack at senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, who said in December last year that India should not be made an experiment lab and the citizens should not be made guinea pigs for vaccine trials.Also Read| Free vaccination for all from today as new policy rolls outNadda pointed out an attempt was made to malign the vaccination drive but despite this, 1.3 billion citizens of the country came forward to get inoculated against the viral disease on the call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“I want to ask a question to those politicians who called themselves guinea pigs. Today, they are getting themselves vaccinated. So what happened to them? These people left no stone unturned in politicising such a holy initiative,” the BJP president told reporters.Several leaders of opposition parties including the likes of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi have heavily criticised the Centre over its vaccination policy.Akhilesh Yadav, who said in January that he won’t vaccinate himself, took a U-Turn and announced on June 8 that he will take a jab against the viral disease. “Seeing the public outrage, the government instead of politicising the corona vaccine announced that it would give the vaccines doses. We were against the BJP’s vaccine but welcome the vaccine of the Government of India. I will also get vaccinated. I appeal to those who could not get vaccinated for the lack of vaccines to do so,” Yadav tweeted.Also Read| On Covid-19 vaccine, Ravi Shankar Prasad's appeal to Rahul GandhiRahul Gandhi, who has been the strongest critic of the Centre’s Covid-19 response, targeted the Centre on June 16 over its decision to extend the gap between two doses of Covishield from 12 to 16 weeks.

21-06-2021||India||Pakistan's terror net gets exposed again as documentary traces journey of Paris attacker linked to 26/11||A new documentary has shed light on the involvement of Paris attack conspirator Muhammad Ghani Usman, a Pakistan national and Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist, in the planning and execution of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Usman is in a French jail after being arrested in connection with the 2015 attack on the French capital.The documentary has been aired by German broadcaster DW. It aims to find out financing, planning and commissioning of terror attacks in Europe. The makers of the film follow the leads which reveal the terrorists' connection to Pakistan intelligence service ISI."This man was a key member of the Lashkar-e-Taiba. It is believed that he was a part of the operations planning for the attacks in Mumbai in 2008. Yet, nothing was done," the film quotes London-based security analyst Sajjan Gohel as saying.Watch the documentary here:Usman was questioned by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which was probing the Mumbai attacks cases, in 2019. According to NIA, Usman was in touch with David Coleman Headley, the Pakistan-origin US terrorist who plotted the 2008 Mumbai terror strike.The film then talks about the major conspiracies being hatched by indoctrinated terrorists, and reveals the name of Sajid Mir, a shadowy figure. "Suspects in the US confirm the existence of Sajid Mir and his role in recruiting and indoctrinating westerners with an aim of sending them back to Europe or the US to carry out attacks in the name of LeT," the documentary quoted Jean-Louis Bruguiere, a former French investigative judge, anti-terrorism.Hindustan Times reported last year about the whereabouts of Sajid Mir, who was the handler of Headley. The terrorist carries $5 million on his head.India has blamed LeT, which is allegedly linked to Al Qaeda, for the Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people. The documentary makers also claimed to have found evidence that showed that the ISI increased its cooperation with the terror organisations, especially Lashkar-e-Taiba."The documentary shows that Pakistan continues to be the terror factory of the world. This is quite evident when Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan calls the 9/11 Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden a martyr and foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, in an interview to Tolo News, gives it a pass. Pakistani political leadership continues to deny the presence of Taliban leadership, including Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, and Sirajuddin Haqqani in the country. What makes it worse is that Sajid Mir is still living in Rawalpindi and David Coleman Headley was a relation of former Pakistan prime minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani. Till date, the American intelligence has not shared the financial transactions of Headley with India. With the American forces leaving Afghanistan next month, the terror factory in Pakistan will be running full steam with impact on the entire world," said Shishir Gupta, the author of best selling book 'Indian Mujahideen: the enemy within' and an expert on terrorism.French investigators suspect that Islamic State, which claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks and the suicide bombings in Brussels, sent Usman and Haddadi to Europe to carry out attacks.Usman, the 34-year-old bomb-maker, was arrested in October 2015 along with his Algerian aide and suspected Islamic State fighter Adel Haddadi soon after they arrived on the Greek island of Leros along with 200 other refugees for carrying forged passport. Investigators believe there were two other men in the boat who later blew themselves up outside Stade de France stadium, one of a series of brazen assaults by around 10 people around the French capital.Haddadi and Usman were detained by Greek authorities for 25 days because they had fake Syrian passports. Once let go, they followed the main migrant trail and made it to Salzburg in western Austria at the end of November - after the Paris attacks. They applied for asylum at a refugee shelter in Salzburg.The two were arrested again in December 2015 when a fingerprint search linked them to the passports stolen by the Islamic State. An Austrian court later approved their transfer to France for trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-exposed-as-documentary-tracks-journey-of-paris-attacker-linked-to-2611-101624263886829.html

"It will be someone who the whole of Punjab feels proud of," said Kejriwal, addressing a press conference in Amritsar. It was at the same event that former Punjab police officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap also joined the party after a day of speculation over the same.आज PUNJAB के लिए खुशी का दिन है।Kunwar Vijay Pratap जी नेता नहीं है, ना ही इनके दादा-परदादा जी नेता थे। मैं और भगवंत मान भी नेता नहीं है।हमारी नेताओं की पार्टी नहीं है, हम राजनीति करने नहीं आए। हम देश और समाज की सेवा करने के लिए आए है - CM @ArvindKejriwal#PunjabDiUmeedAAP pic.twitter.com/L3EevmNZlWGOOD NEWS!Former IPS Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh (IG) joins AAP in the presence of Delhi CM Shri @ArvindKejriwal.#PunjabDiUmeedAAP pic.twitter.com/B5bSWNvc54Arvind Kejriwal had been hinting at making inroads in the state's politics for a while now. Yesterday, he tweeted, “Punjab wants change. The only hope is the Aam Aadmi Party. See you tomorrow at Amritsar,” without elaborating any further. Punjab AAP leaders also remained tightlipped about the induction of any leaders to the party at Amritsar.However, the party already seems to be hedging its bets in the state. The day saw the induction of Kunwar Vijay Pratap, an ex-inspector general (IG) who was part of the special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 Kotkapura police firing incident in Punjab.Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh took premature retirement in April after the Punjab and Haryana High Court quashed a report by the earlier Punjab Police SIT into the firing at people protesting in Kotkapura in 2015 over the alleged desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in Faridkot district. Singh was part of the SIT which was probing the 2015 Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan policing firing incidents. The court had then directed the state government to set up a new SIT without Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had initially refused to accept the resignation of Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who otherwise was to retire in 2029. But when the former IG-rank officer remained firm on his stand, the CM accepted his premature retirement request. The former police officer had assured the government of full help and support even outside his service in connection with the probe led by him in two cases of police firing.Meanwhile, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD-Sanyukt) president Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and patron Ranjit Singh Brahmpura will reportedly visit the Golden Temple at the same time when Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal will pay obeisance at the shrine. This led to a buzz in political circles about a possible tie-up between the two parties ahead of the 2021 Punjab assembly elections.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-reveals-punjab-poll-plans-says-aap-s-cm-candidate-will-be-local-101624262105755.html
21-06-2021||India||Three days after quitting as Assam Congress MLA, leader joins BJP||Three days after quitting Congress and resigning from his Mariani seat in Assam’s Jorhat, former MLA Rupjyoti Kurmi joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday. The 43-year-old leader from the influential tea tribe community, who represented Mariani for four consecutive times since 2006, joined the BJP at a function attended by chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at Gerukamuch in Dhemaji district. “We welcome Shri Rupjyoti Kurmi to BJP family. A prominent leader from tea tribe community and a four-term MLA, he has always been working for uplift of poor and development of the region. BJP, and Assam shall immensely gain from his experience,” tweeted Sarma after the event. Also Read | Uttar Pradesh follows Assam to raise concerns regarding rise in populationOn Friday, Kurmi had cited the Congress high command’s failure to listen to second-rung leaders like him and promotion of a few select leaders in Assam as reasons for his resignation. He had also claimed that the Congress joining hands with Lok Sabha MP Badruddin Ajmal’s All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) for the Assam assembly polls had cost the party many seats in upper Assam. This time, the Congress won 29 seats, three more than 2016, while AIUDF won 16. The 10 party ‘grand-alliance’ led by the Congress won 50 of the 126 seats in the state. On the other hand, BJP (60) and its allies Asom Gana Parishad (9) and United Peoples Party Liberal (6) bagged 75 seats. “Congress under leaders such as Rahul Gandhi is a sinking ship. In Assam, there’s a lobby of leaders in the party which is interested in promoting only its personal interests. The party overlooked indigenous people of the state and gives importance to immigrant Muslims from Bangladesh,” Kurmi said on Monday. “Kurmi’s exit from the party is a loss for the Congress in Assam. He was a capable leader and was close to me. It would have been better if he had raised his grievances on the party platform before quitting. We are aware of the complaints similar to Kurmi’s coming from within the party and are trying to address them,” Congress legislature party leader and Leader of Opposition on assembly Debabrata Saikia said after Kurmi’s resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-days-after-quitting-as-assam-congress-mla-leader-joins-bjp-101624263996113.html

21-06-2021||India||Odisha’s test positivity rate dips below 5 after over 2 months||For the first time in the last 80 days, Odisha’s daily test positivity rate (TPR) for Covid-19 came down below 5 on Monday, signifying the rapidly declining infection curve during the second wave even as the daily fatalities continued to hover above 40.On Monday, the state reported 3,021 new Covid cases from 61,000 samples tested in the last 24 hours with a test positivity rate of 4.96, the first time it went below 5 since April 2. Despite the declining TPR, which is the percentage of people testing positive out of the total people tested, the situation in at least six districts, including Bhadrak, Balasore and Khurda, continues to be matter of concern as the weekly TPR between June 14 and 20 was more than 10. In Bhadrak, the weekly TPR was 15.66 followed by 14.86 of Balasore and 14.44 of Jajpur. In western Odisha district of Nuapada, the TPR seems to be on the rise at 10.45.Also Read | UP to ease Covid-19 curbs from today: Check latest guidelines hereThe lockdown, which has been extended till June 30, is still in force in all the 30 districts even as it has been partially relaxed in 17 districts due to their low TPRs. Director of health Bijay Mohapatra said even after the lockdown is lifted, no one should take it easy. “Masks and social distancing have to be followed rigorously. We are prepared for the third wave. The state government is ramping up vaccination so that we can vaccinate 300,000 people daily. Besides, training is being imparted to doctors and healthcare workers in special paediatric care,” he said.June has been the most devastating for Odisha with 842 Covid deaths officially recorded so far, though by unofficial estimates, the number would be at least double. The state BJP has demanded a white paper on Covid deaths while a lawyer has filed a PIL in Orissa high court seeking a special audit of the deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odishas-test-positivity-rate-dips-below-5-after-over-2-months-101624259735959.html
21-06-2021||India||AICC in charge leaves Goa after 4-day visit, leadership issue yet unresolved||All India Congress Committee in charge for Goa Dinesh Gundu Rao wrapped up his four day trip to the state on Sunday after holding extensive discussions with local leaders, primarily to settle the divisive issue of leadership ahead of the upcoming state assembly elections. He also attacked the current Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government over handling of the coronavirus pandemic, state of economy, employment and environment. On the first day of Rao’s visit on Thursday, a scuffle broke out among supporters of different factions in the state unit, serving as a reminder of the need to resolve the pressing issue in time. Leaders aware of developments said Rao held several rounds of meetings with south Goa parliamentarian Francisco Sardinha, leader of opposition (LoP) Digambar Kamat and some other candidates aspiring to head the state unit. The need for new leadership arose after state Congress president Girish Chodankar resigned after the party’s poor showing at local level elections. While Chodankar-- who continues to head the party till the new leadership is chosen-- has the youth wing’s backing, not many MLAs support him despite having been at the helm of party affairs for more than four years now. Political observers say he has failed to unite the party and secure any notable electoral wins. Speaking to HT, a Congress leader said the party was eager to resolve the issue to ensure it has a “face” in the run up to the elections.“The party is facing challenge from both the BJP which seeks to retain the Bahujan Samaj vote and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is trying to eat into the Catholic vote. The party leadership has received feedback from several leaders and will accordingly make a decision based on the realities. There are several aspirants for the post,” another Congress leader, who didn’t wish to be named, said.“The party is also deliberating on possible alliances ahead of the polls,” he added. Political observer Cleofato Almeida Coutinho however said it will be difficult for the party to change the leadership six months ahead of elections. “The Congress finds itself in a difficult position and may yet decide against a change of leadership. Changing of leadership barely six months ahead of elections will upset the plans that are already in place and may not make for good optics,” he said. Keeping dissensions within Congress aside, Rao publicly attacked the incumbent BJP government and promised to scrap all the environmentally sensitive projects like the doubling of the railway tracks, construction of highway and laying power lines across the eco-sensitive Western Ghats after 2022 state polls, which he said will return the party to power.“Goa needs to be saved from this government and its horrible administration. That should be the main issue,” Rao claimed.“There is failure of government, the CM does not know what he is doing; his Covid administration was pathetic; people have suffered; the economy is suffering; youth don’t have jobs; environment is being harmed,” he added.Rao also announced that the party won’t take back MLAs who jumped ship to the BJP earlier and may look to return ahead of the polls. “We will not take such people (defectors) back. We have to end this virus. Goa can’t have this kind of politics going on forever. They are still elected members of the Congress,” Rao said at a press conference before his departure and added, “When we select our candidates this time, we will be doubly careful. We now know what the BJP is capable of.”Despite winning 17 seats in the 40-member Goa assembly in 2017, Congress was outmanoeuvred by the BJP, which only won 13 seats yet formed the government with the support of parties it had campaigned against. Later in September 2019, 10 Congress MLAs moved to the ruling party. The assembly speaker rejected a plea to disqualify them under the anti-defection laws in April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aicc-in-charge-leaves-goa-after-4-day-visit-leadership-issue-yet-unresolved-101624258956370.html
21-06-2021||India||'Get ready with tractors': Rakesh Tikait rallies farmers against govt, says 'false cases' won't hold||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Monday rallied fellow farmers against the government, asking them to "get ready with tractors" as he issued an ultimatum to the central government over the contentious farm laws. "This government is not going to agree. It needs treatment. Get ready with your tractors, we will have to intensify the movement to save our lands," Tikait posted from his official handle on Twitter. A day ago, the farmer leader had said that the central government should get over its 'misconception' that the farmers would go back from their protests because they won't.Rakesh Tikait asked the farmers to unify under one cause and said, "Either the farmers and the public will remain or this government. The voices of farmers can't be subdued with false cases."सरकार मानने वाली नहीं है। इलाज तो करना पड़ेगा। ट्रैक्टरों के साथ अपनी तैयारी रखो। जमीन बचाने के लिए आंदोलन तेज करना होगा। #FarmersProtestया तो ये किसान और जनता रहेगी या ये सरकार रहेगी। अन्नदाता की आवाज झूठे मुकदमों से दबने वाली नहीं है..#खट्टर_सरकार_किसानों_पर_अत्याचारThere were isolated reports of disturbances across protest sites over the past few days, as the police blamed the farmers for dismay, while the protesters, in turn, said that their movement has been largely peaceful, yet the police used force to disperse them. Protesting farmers have also been opposing the public functions of the BJP-JJP leaders in Haryana over the farm laws.The Delhi Police alleged earlier this month that several protesters had assaulted two of its special branch officers at the Singhu border who were at the site for ground analysis. An FIR against unknown protestors had also been lodged at the Narela police station. Decrying the allegations, Rakesh Tikait had said that the intention of the police and government is to instigate farmers.The farmers' protest, which is still underway at the border sites of the national capital Delhi, has been consistent with its single-minded demand to repeal the three farm laws, even though more than 200 days have passed since the movement began. They have demanded that the three laws -- the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/get-ready-with-tractors-rakesh-tikait-rallies-farmers-against-govt-says-false-cases-won-t-hold-101624256109946.html

21-06-2021||India||Govt proposes to boost medical, wellness tourism post-Covid||The government has released a draft strategy to boost travel in the wake of Covid-19 by promoting the country as a medical and wellness tourism destination.To achieve the same, in its draft recommendations released past Friday, the ministry of tourism suggested a restructuring of the National Medical & Wellness Tourism Promotion Board, headed by the Union minister, and a more liberalised visa policy.“The board will be restructured to streamline its functioning and discharge its responsibilities as one-stop centre for medical value travel. The board will have an advisory committee, a technical committee and an executive committee to discharge its functions,” it said in its June 12 draft, seeking comments from the public till June 30. “In post Covid-19, demand for wellness travel will increase and it provides a great opportunity to India with its varied offerings,” the draft added. Also Read | Skywalk project proposed for LonavlaThe board was constituted in 2015 to “provide dedicated institutional framework to take forward the cause of promotion of medical and wellness tourism, including the Indian system of medicine covered by Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha and Homeopath (AYUSH).”Thailand, Mexico, US, Singapore, India, Brazil, Turkey, and Taiwan are the top destinations in terms of number of patients for medical value travel. “The global medical value travel market size is in the range of USD 60-80 Billion and some 141 million people travel across the borders for medical tourism . India has been ranked 10th in Medical Tourism Index (MTI) for 2020-21 out of 46 destinations of the world by Medical Tourism Association,” the draft said. “Global Wellness Institute has estimated global wellness tourism market to be USD 639 Billion in 2017 with Secondary wellness travellers accounting for 89% of the trips and 86% of the expenditure. Domestic wellness travel contributing 82% of total trips and 65% of expenditure,” it says. Global Wellness Institute is a non-profit organisation with a mission to empower wellness worldwide by educating public and private sectors.As per estimates by Global Wellness Tourism Index, as mentioned in the report, India ranked 7th position in 2017 with 56 million trips in wellness tourism and total revenue of USD 16.3 Billion.The draft also identified the lack of government regulations for the sector and also the absence of a nodal body to spearhead Medical Value Travel as areas that need special attention. “Under Heal in India campaign, an integrated communication strategy to promote brand India will be prepared and executed in partnership with the industry. This will be promoted as a sub brand of Incredible India on all the digital platforms and global media campaign of the ministry,” it said.It has also proposed a more liberalised visa policy. “India has already introduced e-VISA and other measures to facilitate medical value travellers to visit India. India will further liberalise and put in place a holistic and transparent visa regime to make it more patient friendly,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-proposes-to-boost-medical-wellness-tourism-postcovid-101624253315507.html

21-06-2021||India||Government seeks public feedback on Cinematograph Act amendments||The government has sought public feedback on the proposed Cinematograph Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021, that will enable a broader age-related classification, allow the Centre to act on complaints and seek re-certification of a film, and also penalise piracy. The amendments, for which the Centre has sought feedback before July 2, propose an age classification system akin to the one specified under the new intermediary and digital media guidelines notified on February 25. The categories would include U, or universal, U/A 7+ , U/A 13+, and U/A 16+, besides an A rating for content restricted to adults.At present, under theCinematograph Act, 1952, there are only three categories of film certification: unrestricted public exhibition or U, parental guidance required for children under 12 or U/A, and adult films. Also Read | Hong Kong to follow China’s steps, start censoring films over national securityIf the proposed amendments are cleared, then the government will also have the power to restrict cinematic content on the basis of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence. “The Central Government in respect of a film certified for public exhibition, on account of violation of Section 5B(1) of the Act, the Central Government may, if it considers it necessary so to do, direct the Chairman of the Board to re-examine the film,” the government said in a release on June 18.The government has also pointed out a lack of provisions to check film piracy. “At present, there are no enabling provisions to check film piracy in the Cinematograph Act, 1952, making it necessary to have a provision in the Act to check film piracy,” the release stated. The new provisions include a jail term extending up to three years for piracy, and a fine of not less than ₹3 lakh. There is also a move to grant film’s certificates in perpetuity, while the present system only allows for a film to be certified for 10 years. According to Prasanth Sugathan from the Software Freedom Law Centre, granting revisionary powers to the Government goes against the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Union of India v KM Shankarappa. “This effectively gives the Union Government supervisory power over the Board as well as the Tribunal,” he said. “This will result in a situation where a few persons protesting can virtually stall the exhibition of any film. This will be a case of heckler’s veto prevailing and, in a country, where there will always be sections who are easily offended by any work of art this will have dangerous repercussions for freedom of expression.”Film critic Gautam Chintamani said, “The age-appropriate certification proposed is one of the key elements of the new Cinematograph Act. It’s a much-needed change, which has been suggested many times in the past including by the Shyam Benegal-led committee. In addition the certification aspect, the compliance of the same needs to be ensured. The abolition of the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) by the Government of India last week — under the Tribunal Reforms Ordinance, 2021 — has evoked criticism from some quarters. As this was the penultimate forum for filmmakers to appeal against edits suggested by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), its absence means now the filmmaker would have to go to the high court. In my personal opinion, an updated Cinematograph Act where the definitions such as obscenity, anti-national, etc. are clearly defined so that there aren’t any misunderstandings around the interpretation of the nature and scope of these words and age-appropriate certification could lead to CBFC having a clearer and more contemporary understanding of certification.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-seeks-public-feedback-on-cinematograph-act-amendments-101624251395527.html
21-06-2021||India||Child, adoptive parents separated by Child Welfare Committee, reunited by SC||The Supreme Court has reunited a two-year-old girl with her adoptive parents in Mumbai almost two years after they separated by a court order. The girl had been lodged at a child-care facility since June 2019 after her adoption was declared illegal by the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Mumbai. The Bombay high court too had dismissed the adoptive parents’ plea in March this year.The couple, who have no biological children, had moved the top court to get the child back. They had adopted her in January 2019 from a single mother who worked as a housemaid. The biological mother, due to her weak health and poor financial condition, had willingly signed an adoption deed in January 2019 with the couple under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956.Also Read | SC dismisses doctors’ plea for cancelling, postponing PG final year medical examHardly had the child spent six months with her adoptive parents that the CWC, Mumbai, suspecting that the child had been sold by the mother, declared the adoption illegal and lodged the girl with a special adoptive agency. After the Bombay high court refused to hand over the child to her adoptive parents in March this year, the couple requested the Supreme Court for the child’s custody.The vacation bench of justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian observed, “Generally, a child is orphaned by natural events. But here the child is orphaned by the orders of the court.” The court referred to the Bombay high court’s decision of March 18, 2021, refusing to hand over the child to the petitioning couple.The bench termed it “unfortunate” that the order gave rise to a situation where the child was neither with her biological mother nor the adoptive parents, but in a child care home.The adoptive parents in their petition filed through advocate Syed Mehdi Imam pointed out that the adoption was legal under Hindu Adoption Act and the religious ceremony of dattak (adoption) was also performed as per the requirement of the Act in the presence of witnesses. They were financially able to take care of the child and a social investigation report (SIR) prepared by a NGO attached with the CWC found considerable improvement in the health and wellbeing of the child within six months of her adoption.Even the biological mother appeared before the top court and said she had no objection to the child being given to the petitioner. The only other party left to be heard was the CWC, which had set aside the adoption deed and ordered an FIR to be lodged against the couple and the child’s biological mother. The bench directed the child’s biological mother to file her affidavit by the date of the next hearing.Issuing a notice on the petition and posting the matter for hearing after four weeks, the bench held, “In the meantime, custody of the child be handed over to the petitioners (couple).”For the next hearing, the court told the petitioners to check upon a 2003 Supreme Court judgment (Anokha v State of Rajasthan) which exempted adoptions under a personal law from the purview of the adoption guidelines formulated by the top court in its earlier judgment of 1984 titled LK Pandey v Union of India.The 2003 judgment is regarding an Italy-based couple who wanted to adopt a child from her biological mother in India. The question was whether the LK Pandey guidelines would apply to a case where the child was not destitute, and the biological mother had voluntarily agreed for adoption. Under the LK Pandey guidelines, every inter-country adoption requires a sponsorship from a social or child welfare society recognised by the country of origin of the adoptive parents. The couple had to then apply for a no objection certificate from Central Adoption Resource Agency (CARA). The 2003 judgment decided that the LK Pandey guidelines would not apply to voluntary adoptions made by biological parents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/child-adoptive-parents-separated-by-cwc-reunited-by-supreme-court-101624250315968.html

Yoga tells us that so many problems might be out there, but we have infinite solutions within ourselves. We are the biggest source of energy in the universe," PM Modi said as he addressed the nation on the seventh International Yoga Day. "Today even medical science lays emphasis on the healing process, besides medical treatment. Yoga helps in the healing process," PM Modi added.This year, the theme of the International Day of Yoga is 'Yoga For Wellness', and the focus will be on practicing yoga for physical and mental well-being.In pics: From Delhi to New York, here's how the world celebrated Yoga DayPresident Ram Nath Kovind, vice president Venkaiah Naidu, several union ministers and citizens across the country performed yoga on the occasion. However, the celebrations and events were mured and held virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic.International Yoga Day has been celebrated every year on June 21 since 2015.In UNThe proposal to observe an International Yoga Day was first introduced by PM Modi in his address during the opening of the 69th session of the United Nations General Assembly. “Yoga is an invaluable gift from our ancient tradition. Yoga embodies unity of mind and body, thought and action ... a holistic approach [that] is valuable to our health and our well-being. Yoga is not just about exercise; it is a way to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world, and nature,” PM Modi said.Also read | M-Yoga app to promote yoga videos in different languages: PM ModiPM Modi proposed that June 21 be picked for celebrating International Yoga Day as it marks the Summer Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere – the longest day of the year and considered auspicious in many cultures.The United Nations, recognizing its universal appeal, proclaimed June 21 as the International Day of Yoga by resolution 69/131 on December 11, 2014. The International Day of Yoga aims to raise awareness worldwide of the many benefits of practicing yoga.The draft resolution establishing the International Day of Yoga was proposed by India and endorsed by a record 175 member states.

The International Day of Yoga created two records, a Guinness World Record for the largest yoga class at a single venue and the other for the highest number of nationalities to have participated.“From the Upanishads, comes the idea of yoga to transform human consciousness through control of body and senses through constant practice. The body is the vehicle for the realisation of the Supreme Being,” PM Modi said during his speech at the event.The day billed as one to promote "harmony and peace" also triggered a controversy with some Muslim organisations saying yoga is essentially a Hindu religious practice and is against Islam. Authorities denied the charge and said that participation in the yoga day is not mandatory.Celebrations were held in 192 of the 193 UN member countries, except Yemen, and events were held in 251 cities in six continents with 30,000 people performing yoga in Times Square in New York.Yoga, an ancient physical, mental and spiritual practice, originated in India thousands of years ago.

21-06-2021||India||Indian Army and Navy favour theatre commands, Air Force plays the lone ranger||Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat has called a meeting on Wednesday of the tri-services and other stake holders to understand their concerns over theatre commands and iron out differences before working towards the raising of maritime and air defence commands this year. The ministry of defence had accorded acceptance in principle to theatre commands in 2017 with Prime Minister Narendra Modi handing over the mandate of reorganization to Gen Rawat.Earlier this month, after a presentation, defence minister Rajnath Singh had asked Gen Rawat to call a meeting of stake holders and discuss all the issues threadbare before taking the theatre command concept to Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) for final approval. Majority nations, including tiny Maldives to mighty US, function on theatre command concept with the idea of seamless integration among the land, sea and air forces for better coordination and response. While China has reorganized its seven military districts into five theatre commands, Pakistan has sought support of Beijing to help its forces also be reorganized under the same military concept.Although there have been media reports indicating that the entire process may be delayed, the ministry of defence, Indian Army and the Indian Navy are totally in favour of activation of the theatre commands with the Indian Air Force ploughing a lonely furrow on even issues like naming of the commands. Since the end of 1999 Kargil war, the Indian Air Force has its own version of jointmanship and integration with the sole purpose of keeping its air assets undivided and protecting its own turf. The fact is that even today, official files pertaining to army are labelled as Integrated Headquarters, Army (Ministry of Defence). The Navy filed are labelled Integrated Headquarters, Navy, but the Air Force files are still labelled as air headquarters only. This speaks volumes about Air Force vision of integration of the three services.A senior military commander explained the context and said: "Those in doubt are confused and outdated. Has corporatisation of ordnance factory boards come with 100 per cent consensus or is it based on efficient and better management of resources. Leadership in military is meant to take decisions in best interests of security ensuring optimum and efficient management of resources. Whatever is the best way for us to achieve the objective is the way forward.”Under the present theatre command concept, there will be three land-based commands - North comprising only of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, East comprising land area from Himachal to Arunachal Pradesh and West comprising of land area from Punjab to down south. Apart from this there will be an air defence command and a maritime theatre command with the Andamans and Nicobar Command under its jurisdiction. The maritime and air defence command will be raised by serving commander in chiefs after announcement this year and start functioning next year under the newly appointed theatre commanders. The theatre commanders will be selected from the serving commander in chiefs of the three services with air defence command going under an air marshal and maritime theatre command under a vice admiral without creation of any new posts.With Pakistan on its west and China on its eastern flank, the northern command will remain a single unit under an army general as the theatre is expected to remain active on the Line of Control and the Line of Actual Control for time to come.Apart from getting its air assets divided and issues like rotation among services for theatre commanders, the IAF’s concern is the perceived dilution of powers of the air chief as the theatre commanders will be in-charge of operations and directly report to the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee with three chiefs as members. This concept is similar to the US concept where the chief of staff is responsible only for procurement and training while the theatre commanders report to the defence secretary.The present command structure in the Indian military is lop-sided with Indian Army having seven commands, a much smaller Indian Air Force having similar number and Indian Navy having three commands. This structure will be rationalized under the theatre command concept with the Indian Navy expected to get one more commander in chief position.With the Chinese PLA already functioning as one integrated unit under the Western Theatre Command along the 3488 km Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Indian military needs to get its act together and move fast on theatre commands for a cogent and strong response to the adversary in future. India has no other options.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-army-and-navy-favour-theatre-commands-air-force-plays-the-lone-ranger-101624245785895.html

21-06-2021||India||International Yoga Day: Yoga takes us from stress to strength, says PM Modi||When there are threats to humanity, yoga offers a holistic way of life and takes us from stress to strength and from negativity to creativity, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday during his address on the occasion of the seventh international Yoga Day, even as he announced the launch of M-Yoga app. The app, which will be available in many languages, will show videos on yoga training based on a common protocol.. Referring to the benefits of yoga during the Covid-19 pandemic that has wreaked havoc across the globe, the PM said yoga, which addresses physical as well as mental health concerns, has emerged as a beacon of hope at a time when the world is facing the challenges posed by the pandemic. The Prime Minister stressed on the impact that yoga has on mental and physical well-being and said when the Covid-19 virus knocked on the doors, no country was prepared for it logistically or otherwise, yet yoga became a medium of great self-confidence during such difficult times. He said the world over, yoga became an important medium for self-reliance and give people the confidence that we can fight this disease. “When I speak to frontline workers and doctors, they tell me how they have made yoga an important tool in the fight against Corona. They use it to strengthen their own bodies and for their patients as well,” he said. On the benefits of yoga, he said many doctors as well as health experts have shared their own experiences of Pranayam and other yogic exercises and how their respiratory system has benefited. The PM quoted Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar who had advised to seek the root of the disease, find the reason of the illness and then ensure its treatment. “This is what yoga does. Today, medical science also focuses on healing apart from treatment and yoga helps in the healing process,” he said. He said there are many people who are carrying out research on yoga across the world. He said research is also being carried out to assess the impact of yoga on immunity. Underlining the popularity of yoga for its many benefits, he said, “Even though major public events have not been organised in India and across the world, the enthusiasm for Yoga Day has not diminished. During this difficult time, people could have ignored it or overlooked it. For many countries, Yoga Day is not part of their culture yet their love and enthusiasm for yoga has increased.” He went on to say that In India, sages taught us that yoga and exercise are good for the body and give us a longer life. “For us, good health is the medium for success,” he said. He also referred to yoga as a means of finding solutions. “We are the biggest source of energy, but we do not realise this energy because of the many divisions that exist…at times, the lives of people exist in silos. The shift from silos to union is yoga, the realisation of oneness is yoga,” he said. He said the mantra of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) is now finding global acceptance as we all are praying for each other’s well-being. “Yoga also gives us a healthier way of life I’m sure it will continue playing its preventive and positive role in taking care of the masses. When India put forth a proposal of Yoga Day in UN, it was with the intent that it should be beneficial for all,” he said. The PM said India had taken another important step in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) with the launch of M-Yoga app and the world will benefit from it. “This will help us in making the ‘One World, One Health’ motto successful,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-yoga-day-yoga-takes-us-from-stress-to-strength-says-pm-modi-101624244075110.html

It is particularly helpful in allaying their fears and anxiety."International Yoga Day 2021: History and significanceThe idea for an UN-mandated International Day of Yoga was first proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 2014. In his speech, Prime Minister Modi called Yoga an "invaluable gift of India's ancient tradition" and called for the "harmony between man and nature" through Yoga. This initiative was backed by as many as 177 nations, the highest number of co-sponsors ever for any UNGA Resolution of such nature.Following Prime Minister Modi's proposal, 21 June was marked as the date to celebrate International Yoga Day since it marks the summer solstice, the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere, which holds special significance in many parts of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-yoga-day-2021-all-you-need-to-know-on-its-theme-history-and-significance-101624235276514.html

The day also brings in the shortest night.The word "solstice" originated from Latin word "sol" which means sun and "sistere" which means stationary or stand still. The summer solstice occurs between June 20 and 22 every year.Summer Solstice is also referred to as Midsummer, First Day of Summer, June solstice (in the Northern Hemisphere) and the longest day of the year. This phenomenon occurs twice a year, once in the Northern Hemisphere (between June 20-22, depending on the year and time zone) and once in the Southern Hemisphere (between Dec 20-23).This year, the day is coinciding with International Yoga Day, which is being celebrated virtually due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.On the occasion, Union petroleum and steel minister Dharmendra Pradhan said he hopes the rising sun would lead to disease-free earth.Taking to Twitter, Pradhan said that sun worship has been an intrinsic part of sacred traditions throughout history and many cultures across the world and the summer solstice is an auspicious time to revere the sun, align the body and mind with positive energy and embrace nature."Summer Solstice is an auspicious time to revere the Sun, align the body & mind with positive energy and embrace the nature. Sun worship has been an intrinsic part of sacred traditions throughout history and many cultures across the world," he tweeted.The minister also called for taking pride in the cross-cultural, universal and holistic appeal of yoga and hoped that yoga guides people to immunity and unity.Last year, the day witnessed an annular solar eclipse, which was visible in many parts of the world including India. The ‘ring of fire’ was visible to people in Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttarakhand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/summer-solstice-2021-longest-day-of-year-coincides-with-international-yoga-day-101624235354869.html

The Trust has denied all allegations of irregularities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-land-deal-row-3-booked-for-post-on-temple-trust-gen-secretary-101624219270951.html
21-06-2021||India||Raghunath Mohapatra: Famed sculptor who dreamt big||Raghunath Mohapatra often said that the last spectacular work carried out by Indian sculptors was nearly 400 years ago when they built the Taj Mahal in Agra under Mughal emperor Shah Jahan’s reign. So it’s little wonder that the much-decorated sculptor from Puri – and member of the Rajya Sabha – wanted to create a spectacular work.The 78-year-old belonged to a state that has long been considered a land of sculptors as their detailed understanding of architectural science and immaculate attention to the human form gave rise to the renowned school of Hindu temple architecture, exemplified by the Lingaraja temple in Bhubaneswar, the Jagannath temple in Puri, and the Sun temple in Konark built between the 11th and 13th centuries.“His dream was to build a second Sun temple like the one at Konark. He dreamt big and had the necessary rigour to make it a reality. His power of imagination set him apart from others,” said Adwait Gadnayak, director general of National Gallery of Modern Arts.Mohapatra died of Covid on May 9.Born and brought up in Puri’s Pathuria Sahi, a neighbourhood of 50-odd sculptor families a few kilometres away from Jagannath temple, Mohapatra honed his sculpting and chiselling skills under the watchful eye of his maternal grandfather, eminent sculptor Aparti Mohapatra. While in primary school, the young Raghunath was once punished mercilessly by his class teacher, which prompted his grandfather to pull him out of school. The young ward took to crafting stone idols and sold them to pilgrims on the streets of Puri. At 18, Mohapatra was drafted as a master craftsman in the Handicraft Training and Designing Centre in Bhubaneswar.In 2013 Mohapatra founded Raghunath Mohapatra Arts and Crafts Foundation at Sisupalgarh, which has trained over 2,000 students till date. He received several awards over the years, including the National Award, the Padma Shri, and later, the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Vibhushan. He was nominated to the Upper House in July 2018 for his contribution to the world of arts. Mohapatra first caught the country’s imagination when he made a statue of the warrior and stallion –Odisha’s emblem taken from the Konark temple -- outside the open-air Barabati Stadium in 1968. The then deputy minister Bhairab Mohanty put out a call for a sculptor who would be able to replicate the emblem. Mohapatra, then 25, was paid ₹68,000 for making a stallion in Khandolite stone.His career took off in 1974 after he made a six-foot-tall grey sandstone statue of the Sun god, now displayed in the Central Hall of the Parliament in the National capital. The following year, he won a Padma Shri award. What followed was a series of remarkable works: a lotus sculpted out of a single black granite block of stone for the final resting place of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi at Vir Bhumi, New Delhi; Mukteswar Gate, a red sandstone gate at the popular crafts complex in Surajkund; a wooden statue of Buddha at the Buddha Temple in Paris; in 1985, he made two white Dholpuri stone lamps made by the sculptor still adorn the office of the prime minister.But Mohapatra kept returning to his muse: in 1980, he sculpted an 18-ft long and 15-ft high replica of the Konark horse, which remains a signpost in the capital city at the Master Canteen square; another 14-feet-high Konark wheel in red sandstone made the same year for the India International Trade Fair is now displayed at the Ashoka Hotel in New Delhi.Mohapatra married Rajani in 1966 and they had three sons -- Jashobanta, Prashanta and Sushanta – and two daughters Rajalaxmi and Meenakshi. Sushanta alone followed in his father’s footsteps to become a sculptor. Four years ago, however, Sushanta who lived in Bhubaneswar, died of a heart attack. Prashant was a star batsman of the Odisha cricket team and a BCCI umpire, while Jashobant looked after the operations at the crafts village. Both the daughters are home makers.Towards end of April, Jashobanta, Prashanta, Rajani, Mohapatra and other family members got infected with the coronavirus disease. On April 20 when Mohapatra tested positive, he was running high fever with depleting oxygen saturation. The next day, he had to be rushed to AIIMS Bhubaneswar. Rajani accompanied him to hospital. Prashant had already been admitted to AIIMS, and Jashobanta followed soon after. While Rajani survived, Mohapatra and his sons succumbed to Covid.Mohapatra was close to his grandson Smitesh, 25, and pushed his grandson to do a post graduate degree in Business Administration, as his own lack of formal education rankled him. “He taught me chiselling stones and encouraged me to pursue higher studies telling me that he always felt the lack of school education. ‘I will pay your MBA fees.

He would get angry at anyone who raised hand on me,” Smitesh, Jashobanta’s son, recounted. “The pain of losing him would never go away,” he said.His dream to re-construct the 13th century Konark sun temple only became stronger over the years.He bought around 100 acres of land in Sakshigopal area of Puri district 10 years ago and set up the Aditya Narayan trust. “He would tell me if that he passed away, then I would have to complete the Sun temple project,” said Mohapatra’s youngest brother, Ramkanta, 55, who will look after Mohapatra’s trust and the arts foundation with Smitesh’s assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raghunath-mohapatra-famed-sculptor-who-dreamt-big-101624216953514.html
21-06-2021||India||No reduction in fuel prices: TN finance minister||Chennai: Tamil Nadu finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Sunday ruled out any immediate measures to reduce excise duty on petrol and diesel due to the fiscal situation in the state. It was an election promise of the DMK government, and the minister said it would happen later when the situation is better.Speaking to reporters, the minister listed reasons for not doing this immediately. He said that the Union government, in its budget, imposed and increased the cess on fuels and deprived the state of the revenue. He added that the price and taxes of fuel are high, but the dues to the states have been reduced. Taxes collected by the Union government for petrol and diesel have increased by 63%, from ₹2.40 lakh crore to ₹3.90 lakh crore, he said. He also said that states are yet to receive their dues. He added that the “fiscal situation was much worse than what they had feared,” and the second wave of Covid-19 had increased state spending to thousands of crores. The finance department is preparing a white paper on the fiscal situation, which will be released in two weeks, he said.For these reasons, he said that the state government is unable to cut petrol prices immediately. “But, we will not go back on our word,” the finance minister said, adding that once the ‘injustice’ is corrected, the reduction will be done. “In our history since independence, we have never seen the state rights and finances being taken away like this and laws made by the Union government on subjects that are in the state lists,” he said.A political commentator, Sumanth Raman criticised the government on Twitter, saying that these facts were known when the DMK had made a poll promise. The DMK had stated in its election manifesto that when they come to power, they will reduce the price of petrol and diesel by ₹5 and ₹4 respectively. To this, the finance minister responded, “Things we didn’t know then: Union budget would switch ₹50,000 crores from excise to cess (not shared with states). The full extent of fiscal decay.” He added that they did not promise an immediate cut, but a cut during their term.Political analyst Maalan Narayanan agreed with the state’s decision not to cut under the present circumstances. “Technically, it is the right thing to do because VAT is one of the main resources for states,” Narayanan said. “If they introduce a reduction now, it will affect the state’s finances, which are already in bad shape. Due to the lockdown, TASMAC (Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation, the state-run liquor outlets) was shut, there wasn’t much revenue from GST and registrations for land and vehicles had come down. Politically, this was the same predicament that the AIADMK was in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-reduction-in-fuel-prices-tn-finance-minister-101624216893478.html
