04-06-2021||Lucknow||Redefining fashion for sustainable living||Eco-friendly fabric, natural colours, traditional handicrafts, minimalism, sustainable living, conscious consumerism, upcycling and recycling are the buzz words these days. On World Environment Day (June 5), we spoke to a few in the industry about how we can make our daily fashion eco-friendly and do our bit in making a better tomorrow. According to fashion designer Manish Tripathi sustainable living, natural fabric production, upcycling and recycling are an imperative aspect of fashion scene today. “We are focusing on sustainable living by training women in rural belt to make and preserve traditional textile and natural handicraft work. Like we are producing silk without harming worms in Buxur, Bihar and women of rural Ghaziabad are making deity dresses in temples where everything is natural and eco-friendly. Besides, we are training them in recycling, upcycling used items like making table-runner out of saris, cushion covers and decorative items out of jeans, shirts and t-shirts,” says the Delhi-based designer who hails from Lucknow. Akhilendra Pratap Sonkar, assistant professor at National Institute of Fashion and Technology (NIFT), Raebareli, quotes Vivienne Westwood: Buy less, choose well, make it last. “Sustainable fashion is one of the latest trends which are accelerating in the current time, and the Indian fashion industry is not untouched. From mass fashion brands to high-end designer labels, this trend is all over the place. Conscious consumerism has given wings to it, and we see a lot of products which are made of eco-friendly materials in the market, today. A number of brands are coming up with products which are recycled or upcycled.” He mentions about greenwashing in which companies invest more time and money on marketing their products or brand as “green” rather than actually putting effort to ensure that it is sustainable. Lucknow-based fashion designer Pallavi Madesiya Yadav believes in international pattern and styling dresses with a desi touch. “Indian fabrics, natural colour and dyes, traditional handicrafts juxtaposed with international styling, pattern and fits is what’s we work upon. We believe that with fashion if we are able to bring dresses close to nature, we are making baby steps towards eco-friendly living. With these small steps we will achieve sustainable fashion in longer run.” Anushi Dwivedi, a science teacher at Loreto Convent, developed a hobby of making toys during lockdown. “I started making them for my granddaughter and realised need of safe toys for kids. “So, I started making them with natural wool and cotton fabric. Next, I want to give it a try from khadi fibers and for kids we need to be very safe. I’m trying to turn this as a small venture,” she said. Celebrity fashion designer Rina Dhaka, during a fashion show around R-Day in Lucknow had stressed on making eco-friendly fashion and fabric like khadi relevant on national ‘parvas’ and special days we need to bring them in our daily routine if we really want to make a difference and serve the Mother Earth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/redefining-fashion-for-sustainable-living-101622831359515.html

Central agencies were also alerted about the call, the officer said.“The teams spotted him near Khajoori Khas Chowk and overpowered him. He was brought to the Khajoori Khas police station, where the IB and Special Cell officers are also questioning him. His identity has been established as Salman alias Arman, a resident of Loni in Ghaziabad. He appears to be a drug addict,” the officer added.A second officer said the interrogation team was trying to ascertain why Salman made the threat, and whether someone influenced him.During questioning, Salman told the interrogators that he was annoyed after being scolded by his family for taking drugs. “Salman said he wanted to go to jail, which is why he made that call. He was involved in a murder case in 2017. He was a minor at that time, and remained in the correctional home for boys for a year. He has not been involved in any other crimes,” the second officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/midnight-hunt-leads-to-arrest-after-man-calls-police-threatens-pm-101622830128534.html
04-06-2021||Chandigarh||Power privatisation: Chandigarh to consult Centre on stay order||Before making its next move against the Punjab and Haryana high court’s stay on power privatisation, the Chandigarh administration will consult the Union Government.The administration is exploring a number of options, including a review petition in the high court or approaching the Supreme Court in the matter.“There is also a legal opinion that we can go ahead with the privatisation proceedings as the stay is not on the entire process but on a letter issued by the administration to the transaction adviser on fast-tracking the process,” said a senior UT official, requesting anonymity. The letter in question was issued by the special secretary, engineering, Chandigarh, to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP, Gurgaon.On May 28, the Punjab and Haryana high court had applied the brakes on privatisation of the electricity department for the second time, and even pulled up the administration for its “undue hurry” during a raging pandemic. Earlier, the HC had stayed the process on December 1. After the UT approached the Supreme Court, it stayed the HC order and remanded back the case to it.The decision to privatise the department was taken on May 12, 2020, after directions from the Centre. As many as seven firms had expressed interest after the administration invited the bids in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-privatisation-chandigarh-to-consult-centre-on-stay-order-101622830518404.html
04-06-2021||Mumbai||‘MMR has lost 107.6sqkm of waterways and agricultural land’||The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has lost 107.6 square kilometre (sqkm) of waterways and agricultural lands along its coast between 1990 and 2019, according to preliminary results from an ongoing study by Pune-based NGO Srushti Conservation Foundation (SCF). The cumulative area is larger than Sanjay Gandhi National Park, which encompasses 103sqkm. The SCF study is led by Dr Deepak Apte, former director of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), Due to increased rate of siltation over the past 30 years, Apte explained, these areas have now turned into mudflats or mangrove forests, leading to shrinking and even shallowing of the city’s creeks. About 47sqkm area has been lost in the Mumbai-Thane creek itself, which in the future may pose a threat to the area’s avian biodiversity (including flamingos). The coasts in Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Uran have all been affected by this process.“As a result, existing waterways and coastal lands may turn into extremely shallow swamps or even dry lands in many parts, which will become unfit for navigation, reduce their storm water drainage capacity, and render the habitats unsuitable,” Apte said, warning that there will also be consequences for urban flooding. Shrinking creeks spell bad news for Mumbai, especially at a time when previous studies have indicated rising sea levels of 0.5 to 3mm per year in the Arabian Sea, along with of extreme rainfall events in the foreseeable future.Simply put, shallow creeks cannot hold as much water; so even with a slight increase in sea level rise and precipitation levels, the combined impact of high-tide and heavy rainfall with lead to a spill-over of water into the city, disrupting the lives and livelihoods of coastal populations and exacerbating degradation of otherwise productive coastal lands. Apte recommended that the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences be roped in for “drawing up a comprehensive plan for conservation/ restoration of the ecosystem using scientific study”. NCCR, in collaboration with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), last year developed a flood warning system called i-flows for Mumbai to mitigate adverse impacts during monsoons and extreme weather events.To be sure, this is not the first time that researchers have attempted to make an assessment of Mumbai’s shrinking waterways. As yet unreleased data from the mangrove cell under the forest department found that Thane Creek has shrunk by an average of 0.6sqkm every year between 1972 and 2020. The unpublished study also found that in a business as usual scenario, the mouth of the Ulhas river may entirely shut in the next 30 years, by 2050. Published studies, such as one from January 2020 in the Journal of Coastal Conservation and another by the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON) and the BN Bandodkar College of Science, Thane, have also noted or demonstrated the siltation issue.“Considering the seriousness of this issue where the width of creeks are reducing owing to excess siltation, scientific removal of mangroves will have to be carried out to protect the original coastline. SCF’s findings seem to be accurate as mangrove cell has also carried out a similar internal satellite mapping study of Thane creek, which shows tremendous rise in mangroves with the width of these waterways decreasing. We are fine tuning this report and it will be published soon,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell) and executive director, Mangrove Foundation.SCF’s analysis shows that surface waters across Mumbai and Thane creeks along the eastern seafront dipped from 400sqkm in 1990 to just over 350sqkm in 2019. However, between 1995 and 2019, the average flamingo population, as reported by BNHS in multiple releases to the press, rose from about 20,000 in 1995 to about 120,000 in 2019.“Flamingos and migratory waders are presently benefiting from the shrinking waterways as their population increase is being witnessed in the same trajectory as the expansion of mudflats and mangroves. This in combination with high sewage load that MMR is pumping into the creek as well as warm water from refineries and power plants make it a perfect feeding ground, with nutrient rich flora and fauna,” said Apte.Another factor aiding the abundance of flamingos (in Thane Creek and satellite wetlands in Navi Mumbai) is the loss of other wetlands in MMR and Uran, which has reduced their available space. The Thane Creek, Apte said, is still relatively safer and cut off for the birds. However, once the accreted land is taken over by mangroves in combination with reduction in tidal prism during non-monsoon months, soft mudflats turn into hard and barren land. “Thus, flamingos could permanently move away from the area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mmr-has-lost-107-6sqkm-of-waterways-and-agricultural-land-101622829557804.html
04-06-2021||Mumbai||Mahim cop suspended after externed criminal commits murder||An assistant inspector from Mahim police station has been suspended for alleged negligence and a lethargic approach towards duty. The police personnel failed to act against a hardened criminal externed from the city limits, who managed to return, molested a woman and committed murder.Assistant inspector Suresh Pandit Walvi, attached to the Mahim police station has been suspended by Dyaneshwar Chavan, additional commissioner of police (Central region), pending departmental inquiry.According to the police, Walvi failed to ensure strict preventive action against Richie Fernandes, 27, who has several criminal cases (of theft, robbery, etc.) filed against him. Fernandes was externed from city limits in 2019. Despite this, he was often seen in the Mahim area.On the night of May 27, the accused had a dispute with a footpath dweller, Masjid Yamin Khan, 18, over money. The fight escalated, following which, Fernandes assaulted and killed Khan on the footpath of Sion-Mahim Link Road in Mahim (West). Fernandes was immediately caught by the family members of the victim. “Fernandes had also molested a woman in November last year. However, he got bail. We took action against him four times for breaching the externment orders. But as he has no home or relatives, he would come back to this [Mahim] area,” said Vilas Shinde, senior inspector.Senior officers, however, suspended detection officer Walvi, observing he had no effective control over local criminals, and failed to strike a good rapport with the general public, shopkeepers, police Mitra and prominent people from the area. “He was suspended in order to send out a strong message among other police personnel that such a lethargic approach in duty won’t be tolerated,” said an officer.Some junior officers, however, believe that a punishment like suspension for an officer who was performing well is not justified. “A transfer or a strict warning could have been a better option,” an officer said requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mahim-cop-suspended-after-externed-criminal-commits-murder-101622829377865.html

The advertisement link has gone viral on various social media platforms since last few days.“The website claimed that the recruitment drive for teachers for secondary and higher secondary education, other teacher posts, and clerks was initiated by the government and sought details from interested candidates,” said Mumbai Police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police Chaitanya Siriprolu.Following this, many candidates submitted their details on the website. The education department learnt about it and issued a statement clearing the air, saying no such advertisement has been issued by the government and that the website is a fake one.“On Thursday, the education department submitted a complaint against an unknown person for creating the fake website. On the basis of the complaint, we have registered a first information report (FIR) under sections 419 (cheating by impersonation) and 511 (attempt to commit a serious offence) of the Indian Penal Code and section 66C (identity theft) the of Information Technology Act,” said Vishwanath Kolekar, senior inspector, Marine Drive police station.He added, “We have written to nodal officer concerned in cyber police to get the website blocked. The fake website could have duped people by taking money under the pretext of processing fees for the recruitment purpose. However, so far no one has lost money.”The investigators are also writing to the service provider to get the IP address used to create and operate the fake website, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/education-dept-files-case-over-fake-recruitment-notice-on-fake-website-101622829318469.html
04-06-2021||Mumbai||Indian tourists most concerned about polluted beaches, over-tourism: Survey||Governments have the responsibility to help make travel more sustainable, believe as many as 24% of the 18,327 people surveyed for international digital travel agency Agoda’s sustainable travel trends survey. At least 20% respondents said they themselves have to ensure it. The survey found pollution of beaches and waterways, and “over-tourism” in India were the top two concerns among the tourists. Single-use plastics and energy inefficiencies including overconsumption of electricity/water ranked third.The survey launched to mark World Environment Day on Saturday highlighted that tourists, globally, consider governments most accountable for making positive environmental changes around travel, followed by tourism authorities and individuals. Tourists from Indonesia and the United Kingdom were most likely (36%) to hold governments most accountable followed by those from China (33%), Australia (28%), Malaysia (27), and India (24%).Managing waste including using less single-use plastics, switching off air conditioners and lights when leaving accommodation, and looking for eco-friendly accommodation were some of the suggestions made by respondents when asked how they will make the post-Covid travel scenario better. “...when asked about what Indians associated the most with sustainability, the top three results were renewable resources (36%), natural cleaning products (32%), and eco-friendly design/furniture (31%),” the survey stated.Booking.com also came up with their sustainable travel report by conducting a research among a sample of 29,349 respondents across 30 countries and territories. The report revealed that 94% of Indian travellers think sustainable travel is vital, with 88% saying that the pandemic has made them want to travel more sustainably in the future.The survey revealed that 74% Indian travellers want to have authentic experiences that are representative of local cultures when they travel while 91% of them believe increasing cultural understanding and preservation of cultural heritage is crucial. “Around 56% of Indian travellers still believe that in 2021, there aren’t enough sustainable travel options available, with 63% admitting they get annoyed somewhere,” stated the survey.John Brown, chief executive officer of Agoda, said another thing that is clear is that while globally the message is governments need to take the lead on managing sustainable travel, there is recognition that some responsibility lies with people’s own behaviour. “This past year at Agoda, we have seen a shift in travel patterns as people, limited to domestic travel, explore lesser-known areas. If managed well, not only does this help support independent hoteliers and accommodation providers that rely economically on tourist dollars, but it can also help lessen the environmental burden on overcrowded areas.”The survey found 35% respondents from South Korea, 31% from India and Taiwan each were keener on the need to travel more sustainably. “It is concerning that many people see sustainable travel as less important today than they did before Covid-19, but I hope that is just a short-term effect, driven by people’s thirst to get back out there and travel any way they can,” Brown said.Ritu Mehrotra, regional manager, South Asia, Booking.com said, “Over the six years we’ve been conducting this research, it’s been inspiring to see awareness of the importance of sustainable travel consistently grow, both with our customers and now with our partners, too. We are constantly working towards supporting our partners in their efforts to become more sustainable by encouraging them to identify, implement and share their sustainability practices with us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/indian-tourists-most-concerned-about-polluted-beaches-over-tourism-survey-101622829257787.html

His body landed at the Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport, Lucknow, on Wednesday morning.What followed was nothing short of harrowing for the already grieving family. His younger sister came all the way from village Chandanpur in Varanasi to receive the body. After completing all the formalities, she pleaded with the authorities to arrange for a vehicle to carry the body back to Chandanpur, but they refused to help. She dialled numbers of ambulance providers but they demanded exorbitant amounts. “I only had only ₹1,000 with her but the ambulance was demanding more than ₹15,000,” the woman said.She kept waiting from 11 am to 4 pm at the airport with the body of her brother, for help from some quarter but none was forthcoming.Meanwhile, her cousin living in Uttamnagar, Gujarat got the number of Nirmal Singh, president, Alambagh Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee, from a social media site. Rani rang Singh up for help.Singh recounted, “I called the woman immediately and within half-an-hour our ambulance with five volunteers from Gurudwara reached the airport. I told her she is the daughter of this country and the sewadars coming to help her were her brothers. By 2 am, the body and the woman were reached to their residence by an ambulance. I have promised her more help as she has only a widowed mother to take care of her. We wanted to transfer some funds to her account but the girl refused any monetary help despite living in poverty.”However, the Alambagh Gurdwara Committee has contacted the gurudwara committee in Varanasi to provide all help to the family. Singh said, “The gurudwara will ensure that the girl doesn’t suffer. The girl is a graduate and we will try to arrange a job for her too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lucknow-gurudwara-officials-help-woman-carry-brother-s-body-to-varanasi-101622829197943.html

Flatted factories are multi-storeyed complexes in which non-polluting industrial units can operate. This concept is adopted to ensure easy availability of land for industries. Navneet Sehgal, additional chief secretary, MSME, informed that the state government had approved ₹51.13 crore for the flatted factory complex, one each in Agra and Kanpur. For the Agra project, the government has approved ₹26.41 crore and for Kanpur ₹24.72 crore. The Centre will provide financial assistance of ₹12 crore each for both the projects. The fatted factory complex model is adopted for non-polluting units permitted by industrial development authorities. Industries like readymade garments, handicrafts, woollens, hosiery, IT, carpet and other such units can come up in such complexes. The complexes are most likely to be four-storey buildings, including ground floor. A technical committee headed by additional secretary, union government, MSME ministry, has approved this project. This model would help MSMEs to start a business venture with less capital, Sehgal said. Sehgal also informed that for improving industrial infrastructure in Lucknow, Jaunpur and Farrukhabad, the state government had approved ₹21.54 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/flatted-factory-complexes-to-come-up-in-agra-kanpur-101622828057775.html

It also asked the government to file an affidavit listing out the steps that it had taken to rehabilitate the orphans and extending help to the families who have lost their kin in the second wave of the pandemic.The judge initially said that a division bench of the high court is already considering the aspect of compensation for the families of the victims and that the petitioners should wait for the final report of the Delhi government on the deaths.However, advocate Utsav Bains, appearing for the petitioners, told the court that the division bench had asked similar litigants to take individual legal remedy. Delhi government’s counsel Aditya P Khanna told the court that government is already considering this issue and has set up committee to investigate the reasons for the deaths. He added that he would file a detailed affidavit listing out all the steps as asked by the court. The plea has contended that the cause of death of the patients was respiratory failure due to insufficient supply of oxygen and not comorbidities, as stated by a Delhi government committee in its report.Hindustan Times had first reported on May 4 the findings of a committee constituted by the Delhi government to collate the data of the deaths that had taken place due to the alleged shortage of medical oxygen for the purposes of compensation. On April 27, the Delhi high court had asked the Delhi government to provide a list of the people who had died due to the shortage of oxygen.Quoting the news report in HT, the petitioners said that they first got to know about the finding from the news report. The plea has said that there was complete inaction and failure of the city government to provide adequate supply of oxygen in spite of having knowledge that any shortage would be fatal for the life of Covid-19 patients and immediately cause their death.It alleged that the report prepared by Delhi government’s committee is “erroneous and has been prepared to favour the Delhi government”. “..the cause of the death of the deceased has been mentioned as respiratory failure by the doctors for the reason that proper oxygen supply was not given to the deceased on time. It is the case of the hospital that when the oxygen supply did not come on time the deceased were put on oxygen cylinders, however, the requisite pressure was not there and due to same, the patients died while suffocating for oxygen,” the plea readIt said that the authorities in the present case have rendered themselves not only liable to pay compensation to the families of the deceased victims but also for criminal prosecution under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The petition said that shockingly, the hospital authorities did not even inform the family members about the shortage otherwise they would have arranged for oxygen cylinders and this would have saved the life of their loved ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hcseeks-centre-and-delhi-govt-s-responses-on-plea-for-cbi-probe-in-deaths-at-jaipur-golden-hospital-101622827937680.html

Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the high humidity levels in the national capital and comparatively higher daytime temperatures led to the rain. “The maximum temperatures at the Safdarjung and Palam weather observatories were nearly 40 degrees Celsius today (Friday). The humidity levels at the Palam observatory touched 93%. This was another reason that caused the rainfall,” Srivastava said adding that a western disturbance passing over Jammu and Kashmir and a cyclonic circulation over Uttar Pradesh also prompted the change of weather. IMD’s initial recordings show that Safdarjung received 3.2mm rainfall, Palam received 9.4mm rainfall and Lodi Road received 1.6mm rainfall, as of 5.30pm. Some areas around the Palam observatory also reported a hailstorm around 6pm. The three municipalities (north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations) confirmed that Friday’s strong winds, with speeds of around 60km, and uprooted more than 90 trees in areas such as Kalkaji, Nizamuddin West, Dilshad Garden, Greater Kailash, Uttam Nagar, among others. Western disturbances are cyclonic storms originating over the Mediterranean that affect the weather in north-west and north India. Cyclonic circulation is the swirling motion of winds caused by a low pressure area, which--when it pulls warm moist air--results in overcast conditions and rainfall. On Friday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered to be representative of the city, was 39.5°C, a notch below what is considered normal for this time of the year. The minimum temperature was one degree below ]normal at 26.1°C. The relative humidity recorded at the station was 64%. Even though the mercury remained below the 40°C-mark, the “feel-like”temperature in Delhi was 42-43°C, due to the high humidity. According to IMD, the “feel-like” temperature of a region is how hot or cold the human body feels as opposed to the actual temperature recordings. At the Palam observatory, the daytime temperature was 38.4°C, three degrees below normal, while the minimum temperature was 26.2°C. The relative humidity recorded here at 5.30pm was 93%. Met officials said the wind speeds in Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Noida went up to 60kmph in the evening. The IMD forecast said strong winds and rain are likely to continue till late Friday, but it was unlikely to reduce the temperature on Saturday. “The thunderstorm is likely to stay only till Friday. We are also seeing that there is a possibility of another spell of rain around June 11-12, but we will be able to confirm that when we are closer to the date,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rain-thunderstorm-in-delhi-90-trees-damaged-101622827877757.html
04-06-2021||Chandigarh||Petrol inches towards ₹100/litre in Mohali||Already at an all-time high, fuel prices continued to rise across the tricity, with petrol priced at ₹96.92 per litre in Mohali on Friday. After remaining stable for a couple of months, fuel prices have been hiked eighteen times in the past one month, rising by around ₹3 per litre since the beginning of May.In Panchkula, petrol was available for ₹92.38 on Friday, while it cost ₹91.14 in Chandigarh. Meanwhile, diesel was priced at ₹88.57 in Mohali, ₹86.05 in Panchkula and ₹85.32 in Chandigarh.With fuel rates being the highest in Mohali, the local petrol dealers there are facing the maximum brunt. “The disparity in rates between Chandigarh and Mohali has pushed business out of here. Many petrol pumps on the highway are on the verge of closing down, and those within the city are also reporting a massive drop in sales,” said Ashwinder Mongia, president, Mohali Petroleum Dealers Association. Mongia said fuel is mainly consumed by farmers and transporters in Mohali, and by increasing the prices, inflation in items of daily use can be expected. “If the Punjab government can reduce the disparity in liquor prices between Mohali and Chandigarh, then why can’t the same be done for fuel, which is a basic necessity?” he said.Petrol pump owners in Chandigarh are also reporting reduced sales. Colonel HS Kapoor (retd), the owner of a fuel station in Sector 21, said his sales have dropped by 50% as compared to that in February and March. He attributed it to both the hike in fuel prices and lockdown restrictions on vehicle movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/petrol-inches-towards-100-litre-in-mohali-101622827819562.html

While addressing a press conference, Rai said officials have been asked to submit the report by July to ensure transparency and monitoring of plantation work. A third-party audit of plantation work undertaken by all green agencies in the state is being conducted by the Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, Forest Research Institute, Dehradun and Certification Engineers International Limited on the department’s direction. “The Delhi government is serious about monitoring and transparency of the plantation work. In a bid to ensure this, I have ordered a strict independent third-party audit of the plantation work across Delhi. The report of the audit should be submitted by July,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/plantation-audit-report-to-be-submitted-by-july-says-gopal-rai-101622827758418.html
04-06-2021||Mumbai||Global Covid vaccine bid: Mumbai civic body rejects nine proposals||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday said it has rejected all nine proposals it received for supply of 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, as the suppliers did not submit required documents it sought from respondents to its global tender. The civic body is in talks with Dr Reddy’s for Sputnik vaccine doses. The BMC had invited global expression of interest (EoI) on May 12 for procurement of 10 million Covid vaccines directly from the international market. It extended the application window twice on May 18 and May 25 for a week. On June 1, the BMC closed the application window, stating that it had received nine proposals, of which eight were for supplying Sputnik and one company had offered to supply any approved vaccine. The BMC had also got a proposal to supply Pfizer and Astranzeneca vaccine. However, the Czech Republic-based company withdrew its proposal after Pfizer clarified it had not given any rights for distribution of its vaccine. Following this, last week, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and Dr Reddy’s Laboratory also issued a statement that Dr Reddy’s has the sole distribution rights for the first 250 million vaccine doses of Sputnik. It asked not to believe claims made by any third party. Considering these statements, and further as per its EoI condition, the BMC’s central procurement department (CPD) had asked the interested suppliers to submit documents to prove their link with the original manufacturers of the vaccine they propose to supply on Tuesday. The suppliers were given time till Friday, and considering they did not get any documents, CPD rejected all proposals. A senior official of the BMC said, “CPD has rejected all nine proposals, and all nine suppliers now stand to be disqualified from the process. We have also submitted a report on this to municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal’s office.” In a statement, the civic body said, “When contacted on Friday, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories have indicated their readiness to supply some stock of Sputnik vaccines to the corporation on an experimental basis by the end of June 2021. Further, discussions to procure a large stockpile of Sputnik vaccine are underway, and will be conducted for the next 8 to 10 days.” According to BMC officials, considering the cold storage facility of Sputnik has to be customised, it will first take a small number of doses on an experimental basis, and after that go for a large stockpile. Similarly, the government is also negotiating with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories to get Sputnik vaccine doses for the state. The BMC official added, “Now, considering Dr Reddy’s Laboratory has the sole distribution rights of Sputnik in India, we have established a channel of contact with them. We will understand what they promise and in how much time to conclude whether we can procure vaccines from them. As of now, there are no plans to contact any other firm apart from Dr Reddy’s Laboratory.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/global-covid-vaccine-bid-mumbai-civic-body-rejects-nine-proposals-101622827697709.html
04-06-2021||Delhi||Police assess threat to Sushil’s life before moving him to Tihar||City police and Tihar jail authorities are conducting a security audit and assessing the possible threat to two-time Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar before he is taken to the prison to serve his judicial custody. Kumar, a suspect in the murder of a fellow wrestler in Delhi’s Chhatrasal Stadium on May 4, is currently in Mandoli jail, where new prisoners are lodged for 10 days before being shifted to Tihar, as part of measures taken to curb the spread of Covid-19.It has been alleged that the victim of the attack, Sagar Dhankad, had links with the gang run by Sandeep Kala, alias Jathedi.Kala is one of Delhi’s most wanted gangsters, and several members of his gang are in Tihar. Delhi Police’s third battalion — which is responsible for the safety of prisoners — has shared with jail authorities the names of at least 20 members of Kala’s gang who are in different sub jails across Tihar.Concern over Jathedi gang membersKala, from Jathedi village in Sonipat, carries a reward of ₹7 lakh for his arrest. Police suspect that he is currently operating from Dubai.Police have said investigations revealed that Dhankad had links with Kala. Further, Dhankad’s friend Sonu Mahal, who was assaulted during the May 4 incident, is Kala’s nephew.“We are checking the names of all people linked to Sandeep Kala gang, and the jails where they are kept. We will ensure that Kumar is kept isolated from these gangsters. Police have also alerted us. We are in touch with the police’s third battalion, which keeps a record of all jailed gangsters,” a jail officer, who asked not to be named, said.A second jail officer said that the Intelligence Bureau has also issued alerts to prison authorities regarding the threat to Kumar’s life. HT could not verify the officer’s claim till the time of going to print. Tihar jail director general Sandeep Goel said the prison department is ensuring proper security for Kumar, and has lodged him separately in a single cell in Mandoli. Kumar was arrested along with an associate on May 23.Kumar’s counsel, advocate Pradeep Rana, said they have written to the court about Sushil Kumar’s security. “It is through the media reports that we learnt about the person’s connection with a gangster. My client did not know this. There are many people who come to the stadium. We came to know later from media statements that one of them has criminal cases against him. So we informed the court. Currently, my client is in quarantine at the Mandoli jail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-assess-threat-to-sushil-kumar-before-shifting-him-to-tihar-jail-101622827638365.html

Now, when the BJP has realised that the power is slipping out of its hands, then the top BJP leadership, out of exasperation, is running between Delhi and Lucknow,” Akhilesh said in a statement. He said: “The truth is that both the BJP cadre and RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh) volunteers have gone into hibernation owing to their disregard by the party and the government. The BJP is unnerved. The situation is such that when a BJP envoy from Delhi tries to placate one leader in Lucknow, then someone else gets disenchanted. Intense activities are going on in the BJP to overcome differences that have cropped up.” Akhilesh said with both the government and the party were in disarray and the government was trying to mislead people with false Covid data and statistics and projecting a success story out of failure. “But now people can’t be fooled. They have decided to dislodge the BJP in the 2022 polls and bring back the SP government”, he said. Meanwhile, several people took membership of Samajwadi Party in the presence of Barabanki Sadar SP MLA Dharmraj Singh alias Suresh Yadav, at the party’s Sadar office in Barabanki on Friday. Welcoming the new members into the party Suresh Yadav said that the ruling BJP betrayed the youth, Dalits, backwards and minorities by showing them dreams but never fulfilling any of them. As most of the new members who joined were youths, he said that the Samajwadi Party had a large youth cadre who were constantly engaged in struggling for people. He said that in 2022 polls Samajwadi Party would return to power with full majority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/people-more-distressed-with-bjp-than-covid-akhilesh-101622827639111.html
04-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: TIFR scientists build model to project, schedule oxygen demand||A team of researchers at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, have developed a digital tool to route medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients to avoid the shortage experienced during the second wave of the Covid pandemic. The oxygen supply crisis peaked in April in many parts of the country as hospitals ran out of medical oxygen that was needed to be supplied to severe patients of the coronavirus disease, forcing the Centre to first reduce and then reroute industrial oxygen all together to various states to manage the demand. The customisable planning tool, developed by the School of Technology and Computer Science (STCS) at TIFR, will help public health officials project the oxygen demand in metric tonnes for each district for a few days or weeks. Based on these projections and suppliers’ capacities and locations, they can use the tool to schedule their oxygen supply to different districts. For example, in Maharashtra, according to June 3 data of 15,229 Covid-19 cases, the model projects that the oxygen requirement for the state will be 887MT on Saturday, and reduce gradually to 725MT by next Thursday (June 10). In Mumbai, the projection is that oxygen requirement will drop from 41MT on Saturday to 37 MT by next Thursday. For Delhi, the projections are 155MT on Saturday. This will reduce to 95MT by next Wednesday (June 9). These are default projections made based on guidelines by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), public health officials from different states can input these details to get a customised projections and schedule for their state and districts. “The default assumptions are that 3% of all detected Covid-19 patients will become critical and require substantial oxygen support for about 18 days, as per ICMR guidelines. However, if a state is experiencing a more severe outbreak, they can customise the consumption pattern to better match their situation easily on the tool,” said Sandeep Juneja, professor and dean of STCS, who was part of the project. For each of these criteria, a range of variables are considered such as patients with severe disease are first admitted in non-ICU wards; the period between detection of case and start of non-ICU hospitalisation is same as that for patients with moderate disease (three days); after some time, these patients are transferred to ICU wards where the period between case detection and start of intensive care is 11 days and period of intensive care is 18 days. The model also takes into account the time taken to get oxygen tanks into each district from the suppliers. All these can be changed to suit the conditions on the ground. For the projections, they use a linear programming model, a mathematical optimisation to find the best possible solution for a problem. “It is a very simple model to build. We have made it available on our website for use and are updating the features to better meet user needs. States can input details and download the schedule easily. We have also provided basic guidelines on how to easily input data to suit your needs. The idea is to improve it and get more people to use it, especially as we prepare for a potential third wave,” said Juneja. Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said the model was promising and could potentially streamline the oxygen supply chain. “I have seen their model. It is based on operations research concepts and has the potential to streamline the huge logistics of oxygen transportation. Very promising,” said Kunte. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid taskforce, said, “The need for oxygen changes every minute for severe and critically ill patients. The demand for oxygen depends on various factors and mathematical models may not necessarily work. The Supreme Court appointed national task force is also looking at this problem. In the third wave, our focus should be on zero deaths and preventing severe conditions, thus reducing the demand for oxygen altogether.”Dr Joshi said that as the size of population that is susceptible to the virus is shrinking, mitigation measures should be focussed on vaccinations and reducing the severity of the symptoms. “The severity of the third wave will depend on antibody prevalence, total exposed population from natural infection and vaccination and Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-tifr-scientists-build-model-to-project-schedule-oxygen-demand-101622827637784.html
04-06-2021||Mumbai||Go extra mile to treat every patient having Covid symptoms: Bombay HC to medicos||Ramesh Ghaderao, 49, an employee of the law and judiciary department, Mantralaya, succumbed to the Covid-19 infection on April 16, leaving behind his wife and two minor children. Though Ghaderao tested negative in the RT-PCR test, which he took on April 10, due to his deteriorating health he underwent a CT scan the very next day. The report showed that he was suffering from 92% of Covid-19 lung infection, having its level at 23 on a scale of 25. The Covid hospital refused to admit and treat him, on the grounds that he had tested negative in the RT-PCR test. After much coaxing and pleading the Covid centre at Thane, Ghaderao was finally admitted. However, it was too late and he passed away.In light of the incident, a petition came to be filed in the Bombay high court (HC) on April 26, seeking directions to the authorities to issue orders to hospitals and dedicated Covid centres not to insist on positive RT-PCR reports for getting admitted and treated. The petition filed by advocate Wilson Jaiswal also sought directions to the authorities, to ensure that hospitals and Covid centres admitted patients who had symptoms like cough, cold and fever and start their Covid treatment forthwith.On May 12, the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the petition, was informed by advocates Shekhani Shah, Satyaram Gaud and Rohan Khandelwal for the petitioner that like Ghaderao, Covid patients were being turned away by hospitals and Covid centres for want of an RT-PCR positive report and hence the petition sought a stop to such arbitrariness. The advocates also submitted that as a CT scan report was more accurate hospitals should be directed to accept it.The bench was also informed by the state that the Centre, through the ministry of health and family welfare, had issued guidelines in that regard on May 8 and the state would be issuing orders accordingly.On May 19 and 20, additional government pleader Geeta Shastri informed the court that on May 17 the state government had issued orders to hospitals and Covid centres to admit patients showing symptoms and had also ordered setting up of three types of wards for such patients. On June 2, the bench was apprised that the circular of May 17 had been sent to all hospitals and Covid centres and henceforth patients like Ghaderao would not be turned away.After hearing the submissions, the bench expressed satisfaction and urged the state government to take strict action against hospitals and medical centres who deny admission to any deserving patient by neglecting his clinical condition merely for want of a positive RT-PCR test report or any other compliance.“It can never be conceived that any person who has developed any of the common symptoms without any reason would approach for getting admitted in a hospital or medical centre,” the court remarked. The bench also opined that the medical fraternity should go the extra mile and attend to every possible patient who would have symptoms of being infected by the Covid-19 and provide all treatment and after thanking the petitioner for the eye-opener disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/go-extra-mile-to-treat-every-patient-having-covid-symptoms-bombay-hc-to-medicos-101622827518403.html

Kalagarh is situated on the border of Bijnor district and Jim Corbet National Park in Uttarakhand. Deepak Kumar, the man who rescued the snake, has been working as snake rescuer in the park since the past two years. He is part of Kalagarh forest department rapid response team for rescuing trapped snakes. Deepak said he received a call from a colony in Kalagarh on Wednesday about a snake in a house. “I rushed to the house and caught a 6-inch snake”, said Deepak on phone and added shared that “ it was a different snake”. Deepak shared that he had been rescuing snakes for several years , so he knew about them. “Initially, I thought it was a Prinked snake but was elated to finally discover that it was a rare Indian egg- eater snake, which was not seen for decades and considered extinct. “ Deepak said that it was a 6-inche juvenile with a yellow line from head to tail and he identified it by its characteristic of lifting its upper side high and making a shape of S after observing a threat to life. Besides, this snake also shakes its tail fast under threat. Prinked snakes also behaves in a similar way but the rescued snake was different in look was identified as Indian egg- eater. This snake is non venomous and feeds on birds’ eggs. Vinod Rishi, former additional director general ( ADG) of Wildlife, Government of India, said that it was a rare species which lived in tree holes, rock crevices, or bushes in dry deciduous and shrub forests. He said, “A close examination of photographs reveals that the rescued juvenile snake could be a rare Indian egg- eater and its discovery needs to be further explored to ensure its presence in the area”. Deepak claimed that the juvenile’s colour would change into black but the yellow line would remain from head to tail. He said that cobra, karait and other snakes also ate birds’ eggs along with rodents like rats and frogs. But Indian egg-eater fed only on birds’ eggs. He said that these snakes broke the egg inside their throat and spat out the skin after swallowing the fluids. Jim Corbet National Park’s warden R K Tiwari said, “We are excited by the discovery of this snake as the species was not seen in the area for quite a long time”. According to wildlife experts, Indian egg-eater snake has been listed in Schedule 1 of Wildife Protection Act-1972 because the species is rare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rare-snake-rescued-released-in-jungle-101622827458392.html
04-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Reduce gap between Covishield shots, urge students going abroad||For 28-year-old Shivangi Desai, her master’s course in science and business analytics starts in less than two weeks in a private university in the United States. However, Desai who is up for her first shot of the vaccine on June 5, will have to wait another three months to get the second dose of the vaccine which leaves her worried she might miss her chance to make it to class in time.“The Indian government recently decided to increase the gap between two shots of Covishield vaccine by 84 days. This means I won’t get my second shot until September, while my class begins on June 18. I can’t afford to miss my lectures,” said Desai, a resident of Ghatkopar. Many students in her place are worried that the three-month wait will eventually mean they miss the first half of their semester. “If I get my second dose by July, I’ll still get to travel to my university and manage to make up for lost classes,” she said.Desai added that while the summer session classes will begin in the online mode, students in India are facing time-zone issues and unable to attend lectures regularly. “Since this is a one-year course, I want the complete study experience with classmates and regular interaction with faculty, which will only be possible if I am on campus,” she said.Recently, state cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray announced a special vaccination drive for students who secured admissions in the universities abroad, on a priority. This move encouraged thousands of students to queue up at vaccination centres across the state and get their first dose. However, since at present, Covishield is the only vaccine recognised internationally, many are worried about not being able to make it for the start of the new academic year in international universities before September.“Covaxin shots can be taken within four weeks, but it is yet to be recognised internationally, whereas Covishield shots can only be taken with a gap of 84 days. We are sincerely requesting the state government to allow us students to take the second shot earlier, so we don’t miss out on our education,” said Anuja Patil, who has confirmed her admissions at the RMIT University, in Melbourne, Australia. Some students have approached Aaditya Thackeray as well as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray requesting them to help reduce the gap between their vaccine shots.Some students, including Desai, had to cancel their plans of making it to their destination country in the month of May due to travel restrictions and a ban on several international flights.While several students applying for a study visa have already finished the process, some are also still waiting for the process to re-start to first get a visa, and then travel to their chosen countries. “My visa interview took place on May 4, by the end of which I was asked to later submit the I 20 (certificate of eligibility for non-immigrant student status). It’s been over a month since I submitted the form but I’m yet to hear from the authorities about my visa,” said another student, on condition of anonymity. She added that her post-graduate course in Data Analytics begins in August, but without a visa and two shots of the vaccine, it’ll be difficult for her to travel.Apart from missing classes, students are also worried that any delay in physically joining the course in the chosen country might also affect their future chances of higher education or work permit. “By attending online classes I can keep following the course but if I don’t spend a designated period in the US for this course, I’ll be termed ineligible to apply for a work permit in the US, which is also a worry,” she added.Earlier this month, Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi wrote to the Union health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, highlighting the plight of students wanting to study abroad. “Some states like Maharashtra have understood the concern of students and opened up vaccination for such students to get their first dose on a priority basis but the problem is to get their second dose before July to enable them to travel on time,” said Chaturvedi in her letter dated June 1. She has requested the Union government to consider the case of such students on a “humanitarian” basis and help all those who need to report to their respective universities by mi-August to start higher studies in time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-reduce-gap-between-covishield-shots-urge-students-going-abroad-101622827457686.html
04-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt to keep data of kids who get multisystem condition after Covid||With rising cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) after Covid-19 recovery, the state health department will maintain district-wise records of children diagnosed with the health condition. The decision was taken after the Central health department issued a directive to all states and Union territories to submit weekly data of MIS-C cases.Children after four-six weeks of recovering from Covid-19 are developing this condition where different body parts including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs suffer from inflammation. Doctors said though MIS-C can be fatal, most children get better with timely medical care.Last year too, there were several cases of MIS-C. However, these cases almost doubled during the second wave due to the rise in Covid-19 infection among paediatric patients, said doctors. Since doctors are not liable to report the data to the state government, there is no centralised data available with the health department. As a result, the Central government has decided to form a registry to gauge its prevalence.“At present, we don’t have cumulative data of MIS-C from all the districts. But according to a directive of the Central government issued on June 2, all states have been asked to submit the weekly data to the central health department. Thus, we will soon instruct the districts to submit the data,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer.MIS-C has raised quite a concern among doctors. Doctors have observed that a majority of the children who suffer post-Covid syndromes belong to the five-14 age bracket. Many have cardiac-related issues, while asymptomatic and mildly infected patients are having post-Covid symptoms.Doctors have welcomed the move of the Central government which would help in maintaining the district-wise centralised registry of MIS-C.“This might help to understand the prevalence of MIS-C district-wise and formulate policies accordingly. Covid-19 is ever-evolving, and therefore it is a good idea to maintain data which can also help in further studies and researches,” said Dr Bakul Parekh, former president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) and part of the paediatric Covid task force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-to-keep-data-of-kids-who-get-multisystem-condition-after-covid-101622827397681.html

04-06-2021||Mumbai||Conduct medical exams online, students urge Maharashtra govt||Less than a week before exams are scheduled to commence, several students belonging to second and third-year medical, dental and para-medical courses have approached the state health education minister requesting that their exams be held online. The May circular of the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) had clarified that pending winter session exams will be conducted in the offline mode between June 10 and 30.“These exams have been postponed three times already, as it was not feasible to hold an offline exam for thousands of students at the time when the state is grappling with a pandemic. The situation is now worse with new Covid variants and emerging cases of black fungus. How is the state planning to conduct physical exams?” asked a student requesting anonymity. He added that students have repeatedly highlighted the need for these exams to be conducted in online mode, but the authorities have paid no heed.Usually scheduled to take place in the month of December-January, the second and third-year MBBS, BDS, and other para-medical and certificate course exams were postponed three times this year due to rising Covid-19 cases recorded across the state. From January this year, to February the exams were then scheduled to take place in April. However, due to the second wave of Covid-19 gripping the nation, these exams were once again postponed to the first week of June by the state government.“To appear for exams in the offline mode, we (students) will all have to travel to our college, then share hostel rooms with at least three other students and share bathrooms as well. What guarantee does the state or university give us that we will not contract the virus?” asked another student. Many have taken to Twitter to share their woes and reach out to more authorities for help.Last week, several student organisations wrote to officials in MUHS as well as the state government highlighting the plight of fellow students. While thousands of students are still in quarantine after getting infected, many have also lost close family members and are traumatised, said the letter. Conducting exams in the offline mode in such times could make the situation worse, students have said.Officials from MUHS, however, have assured maximum safety measures in place for the upcoming exams.In a previous circular, the National Medical Commission (NMC) had clarified that in case students are unable to appear for their MBBS exams due to their health status or travel restrictions, such students will be given the chance to appear for these papers at a later date by the examination authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/conduct-medical-exams-online-students-urge-maharashtra-govt-101622827337749.html

The collection of samples will be completed by June 11,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, additional chief secretary, medical and health, in a press conference. In Lucknow, about 500 samples were collected from 22 different localities. Sampling was done in different caregories, including those who had tested positive in the first wave and those who tested positive in the second wave. Samples from slums will also be collected. Sero-survey is done to understand development of antibodies among the population. In Lucknow, samples were collected from Chandernagar in Alambagh, Bijli Pasi Ka Qila, Vidyawati Ward, Harihar Nagar, Khurramnagar, NK Road and Indira Nagar. People with symptoms of Covid were also tested for the same with antigen kits. In rural pockets, samples were taken from Gosainganj and Kakori. The samples will be tested in the microbiology lab at the KGMU. “The results of the sero-survey will help in preparing for the probable third wave and also plan the strategy for vaccination coverage in the state,” said Dr Sandeep kapoor, director, Healthcity hospital.

The per-day caseload has remained less than 21,000 since the past one week. The tally now reached 58,05,565 since the outbreak of the virus last year.There are currently 1,96,894 active patients across the state of which Pune tops with 22,725 patients followed by Mumbai with 18,261 active patients. The number of people tested in the state was 2,56,769.The death toll stands at 99,771, with Mumbai leading with 14,922 deaths followed by Pune with 13,146.The total number of cases in the past seven days (May 28-June 4) in the state stood at 118,308, which averaged 16,901 new cases daily, while the total number of cases from May 21 to May 27 stood at 1,74,732, which averaged 24,961 cases per day.Mumbai on Friday recorded 968 cases and 24 deaths, taking the toll to 14,922.According to Dr Subhash Salunke, advisor, the government of Maharashtra on Covid-19 management, it indicates the decline in the transmission of the virus. “We will see more decline in the coming days but then for that daily monitoring is required. We need to remember that the Covid-19 virus is still present and can rise again. It can nullify all the gains that we have achieved due to the lockdown if we continue to remain casual and don’t adopt Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Salunke.Ever since there were lockdown relaxations from this month, the state has seen crowding in many places, with many indulging in discarding the masks and not practising social distancing.Dr Ameet Mandot, director, Gut Clinic said vaccination of citizens should speed up significantly. “The government needs to enforce Covid-19 behaviour strictly, but at the same time, we need to speed up the pace of vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-14-152-fresh-covid-19-cases-mumbai-sees-968-101622827217651.html
04-06-2021||Delhi||Generations at work: Their love for environment knows no age||Whether they’re in their teens, in late 20s, or early 40s – age is no bar or barrier for these eco-warriors, who aim to leave behind a better planet for future generations! Driven by the thought to save the planet, even amid all odds, are a few denizens who have been safeguarding Nature. Be it collecting plastic waste, checking the deteriorating tree cover or making a conscious effort to reduce air pollution, their struggle to take care of the environment is a 365 day concern, and have got the spotlight from pandemic to show how crucial is the task to make our surroundings more liveable! One dream, one million trees“I have been diagnosed with asthma, and saw many around me develop breathing troubles owing to the appalling air quality in Delhi-NCR,” says 18-year-old Aditya Dubey, a Noida resident, who has so far planted 15,000 trees in the city! He has been involved in environmental causes throughout his teen years, and says, “It was the thought to support long term well-being of people that motivated me to start the initiative, Plant a Million Trees.” He has been distributing seed orbs, which are seeds wrapped in a small amount of fertilisers, and then coated with clay. “When they are put in the ground during monsoon, they have a higher chance of growing into trees. I’ve distributed about 1,80,000 seed orbs in and around the Capital, to various NGOs and even children’s hospitals under the campaign, Each One Plant One,” he adds. Dubey has also filed petitions against e-commerce companies using excessive plastic packaging and also against the rising air pollution in the Capital. He opines: “I believe every citizen of the country can contribute to making the environment cleaner for the future generations and we need to use more sustainable means to ensure our survival!” Education and environment go hand in hand!For Gurugrammer Nilay Agarwal, watching slums teeming with dirt and pollution, with kids begging and playing around, made him decide to do something for this cause. That’s when Vishalakshi Foundation, an NGO set-up by Agarwal, initiated the Clean N Green (CNG) project in 2020, to clean up dumpyards and convert them into green zones. He shares how they converted a dumpyard into a free school for kids, where more than 50 children are being taught by volunteers now! “Ours is a youth led organisation that is keen to promote education among the underprivileged while caring for the environment. We identified a slum in Gurugram’s Sector 48, which we cleaned using diggers and excavators and planted trees to make the area green. We’ve placed separate dustbins for biodegradable and non-biodegradable substances to promote cleanliness drive... Often, once we clean an area, people let it stay clean for a while before littering again. But by converting those areas into greener spaces for education of kids, we ensure they are treated with much more love and concern,” says Agarwal.His organisation also encourages the kids, who come to study, “to bring steel utensils during the food drives and thus eliminate the use of plastic plates and packaging to barely 20% of its original need”. Agarwal says, “We simply want to send a message that every small step counts towards protecting the environment!” A native nursery for Delhiites Amid the coronavirus crisis, environmentalist Vimlendu Jha’s NGO Swechha has been making efforts to raise awareness about native species of trees and vermicomposting while working on their Farm School, about 100kms from Delhi. “We are launching our native nursery at the school on this World Environment Day! The purpose of the Farm School, a hands-on academy on sustainability, is to engage the community at large, especially youngsters, on issues of resilience and finding long-term solutions to ecological degradation,” says Jha. Jha’s organisation, which has also been working for the cause of river Yamuna for decades, has hit a roadblock in that direction, due to the pandemic. He adds, “Delhi remains one of the most polluted Capitals of the world with over 200 days in a year having ‘bad air’ days. Yamuna still remains a sewer line, and it’s only getting worse by the day with the number of instances of high levels of ammonia in the river increasing every passing year. Pandemic has affected our work on ground, as trees can’t be planted on video calls, or river can’t be cleaned over Instagram!”Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/generations-at-work-their-love-for-environment-knows-no-age-101622825781686.html

The RSPM concentration in the ambient air saw a decreasing trend from 2017 to 2020. This may be due to partial/complete lockdown, which may be attributed to lowered vehicular density on road, less consumption of petrol/ diesel fuel and complete/ partial closure of industrial establishments during lockdown periods, said the report. “The five years’ pre-monsoon data has been compared to find out the prevailing trend of air pollution in Lucknow and a slight change in the values may be attributed to some local environmental/climatic factors and curfew restrictions imposed by the government,” said the report. Among residential areas, Gomti Nagar recorded an average 128.7 microgram/cubic meter of the respirable suspended particulate matter (PM10) followed by Indira Nagar that recorded an average RSPM level of 124.5, in the report. The next is Vikas Nagar, with an average 117.3 RSPM level and Aliganj with lowest RSPM level of 111.9. “RSPM is of size 4 to 5 microns that settle inside human organs such as lungs when we breathe in polluted air,” said Dr AA Mahdi, HoD, biochemistry at King George’s Medical University. Among commercial areas, Charbagh with 143.8 RSPM levels remained the area with highest air pollution, followed by Alambagh 133.9, Chowk 121.1 and Aminabad 109.8. The Amausi industrial area recorded RSPM level of 152.5. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) has kept 100 microgram/cubic meter as the optimum value of RSPM in the air while WHO kept it at a maximum 50 microgram/cubic meter. None of the areas were within the NAAQS or WHO standards. “Pollutants in the air can directly be linked to diseases such as COPD, asthma and other respiratory disorders. A secondary result could be general weakness or even premature deaths,” said Dr Sandeep Kapoor, director, Health City and Trauma Centre. The pre-monsoon ambient air quality assessment of Lucknow was carried out by the environmental monitoring division of CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow during April-May, 2021 PM2.5 level slightly upThe PM2.5 level, which refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, was recorded a bit more than the limit prescribed by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). In residential areas -- Aliganj, Vikas Nagar, Indira Nagar and Gomti Nagar, the 24-hour average concentrations of PM2.5 were in the range of 60.7 to 68.2 microgram/cubic meter while the NAQS prescribed limit is 60 microgram/cubic meter and WHO’s 25. In commercial areas like Charbagh, Alambagh, Aminabad and Chowk, the average concentrations of PM2.5 were in the range of 62 to 71.1 microgram/cubic meter with an average of 114.5. In industrial area Amausi, the average concentration of PM2.5 was 61.5 microgram/cubic meter. Increased noise pollution n residential areas, Aliganj, Vikas Nagar, Indira Nagar and Gomti Nagar, the day and night time noise levels were recorded between 67.0 and 70.7 (day time) and 55.4 and 60.0 (night time) dB(A), respectively. The values were higher than the prescribed limits of 55 and 45 dB (A) for day and night time, respectively. In commercial areas, Charbagh, Alambagh, Aminabad and Chowk, the day and night time noise levels were recorded between 67.2 and 79.0 and 52.3 and 61.3 dB(A), respectively. Noise level at all the commercial sites during day time were above the prescribed limits of 65 dB (A), as per the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/slight-dip-in-lucknow-s-air-pollution-due-to-corona-curfew-iitr-report-101622825477602.html

These villages have less than 5,000 population.Makha village sarpanch Veerpal Kaur said their village remained unaffected in both waves of the pandemic due to joint efforts made by the locals.“We are sanitising every village twice a week. The villagers have unanimously decided to ban entry of outsiders and everyone helped in imposing the decision. The locals purchased vegetables from farmers who in their villages. A few elderly people died in the village but none were affected by Covid,” she said.“The deceaseds’ families made announcements from temple speakers asking the villagers not to come for condolence prayers. The health department also conducted screening in the villages and Covid tests were conducted but not a single case was detected,” she added.Avtar Singh, of Dogranwali, said the locals have been asked not to go out of the village unless essential.“Even those running shops in the village go out of the village to fetch commodities only once or twice a month.

04-06-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana’s global bid to buy vaccines comes a cropper||The Haryana government’s move to purchase 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses through international bidding has fallen flat.With the last date for receipt of tender closing on Friday, no bid was received by the Haryana Medical Services Corporation Limited (HMSCL) which floated the global tender for buying vaccine on May 26.Officials said this has effectively put the onus back on the central government to buy vaccine in bulk and allocate to the states.Officials said keeping in view the scarce availability of vaccines, it was unlikely that a re-tender will be done to buy vaccines. The state government was banking on Russia-manufactured Sputnik V to make a bid as Sputnik is the only vaccine besides Covishield of Serum Institute of India and Covaxin of Bharat Biotech which has been granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI).However, even the Russians did not make a bid. China, which manufactured Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines, was debarred from participating in the global tender in line with the restrictions imposed by the central government in public procurement from bidders of certain countries on grounds of defence or national security.“We made an effort to get the vaccine internationally despite low availability and prior commitments of Covid vaccine manufacturers, some of whom are yet to get a formal regulatory approval from the DCGI,” said an official.“However, it seems that the central government will have to play a proactive role in granting approvals and reaching out to vaccine manufacturers for purchase,” the official added. The state government expects delivery of over 9.50 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines including purchase of about 4.78 lakh doses for vaccinating people in the 18-45 age group.“There is now more demand from work population in 18-45 age category for getting vaccinated. The vaccine prioritisation strategy needs a relook,” an official said.SINGLE BID FOR AMPHOTERICIN WILL ALSO NEED CENTRE’S NODMeanwhile, only one entity has responded to the global tender floated by the HMSCL for buying 15,000 Amphotericin injections administered for treating patients of mucormycosis (black fungus).Officials said while the state government has decided to approve the single bid, the bidding entity will also need approval of the central government to allocate 15,000 Amphotericin vials to the Haryana government.“Amphotericin is a regulated commodity and the bidder won’t be able to provide the injections unless the allocation is approved by the central government,” officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryanas-global-bid-to-buy-vaccines-comes-a-cropper-101622824818835.html

However, its samples were being sent for advanced testing. The park, that was now left with nine tigers, procured Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits to test the carnivores for Covid-19. “...we are sending swab, blood samples and (a) lung (of the tiger) to IVRI (Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly) for detailed investigation, and to find out if the animal was infected with any coronavirus like disease,” said O P Sahu, a veterinary doctor at the biological park. He added that the tiger’s blood test suggested liver and kidney infection and its RAT was conducted on Friday morning. However, RAT has been found to be less accurate than polymerase chain reaction tests, that are considered the gold standard for detecting Covid-19. The scare of animals being exposed to coronavirus was not new. Earlier this May, eight Asiatic lions at a Hyderabad zoo tested positive for Covid-19. It was the first such instance in the country, prompting the Centre to order closure of all national parks, sanctuaries, and national zoological parks. The infected lions were isolated and have since recovered, while similar cases have been reported from other parts of the country. In the recent tiger’s death, a four-member veterinary doctors’ team on Friday conducted its postmortem examination. The tiger was brought to Ranchi from Bengaluru’s Bannerghatta Biological Park in November 2014, officials said. As per available information, the tiger was suffering from fever on Tuesday, that subsided after medication. On Wednesday, the tiger did not eat well. “It did not eat at all on Thursday. Then, we called an expert from Ranchi Veterinary College and a vet from Tata Zoo. We also consulted vets in Hyderabad. The animal was given saline. But, it did not survive,” said the park’s director, Y K Das, adding that the tiger was genetically weak. “It was suffering from health issues. Its liver and kidney were comparatively weak,” he said. Notably, the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has sent guidelines and advisories to zoos, ranging from prevention to sample collection to detection in suspected cases to safety protocols for animal keepers, amid surge in Covid-19 cases. According to the United States Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention, there is currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading coronavirus infection to humans. It said in an advisory on its website that more studies were needed to understand if and how different animals can be affected by Sars-CoV-2, and if Covid-19 can spread from people to animals in some situations, especially during close contact. When asked why a test for the disease was not conducted as per the CZA’s directions, Das said the tiger did not show Covid-19 symptoms. “...we tried to test it for Covid-19, but the test kit was unavailable. Then, we procured it from outside, which was delivered on Thursday night,” he said, adding that the tiger was isolated since the onset of fever. “We have procured 24 test kits and Covid test will be conducted of all carnivores,” Das said. Praveen Kumar, an assistant professor at Ranchi Veterinary College who examined the tiger, said by the time it could be tested for Covid-19, its condition deteriorated. “We gave saline to the animal with difficulties, as its vein were not found. The Covid test kit was brought but the test could not be conducted on Thursday night, as diluents were missing in the kit,” he said, adding that he does not suspect it to be coronavirus. Meanwhile, DS Srivastava, a former state wildlife board member, blamed the park for negligence. “The tiger fell seriously sick amid Covid-19 pandemic. Why was the test not done at the first stage? Even if the tiger was not suffering from coronavirus, why it was not given proper treatment from specialist doctors?” he questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/tiger-dies-at-ranchi-zoo-samples-sent-for-testing-101622821877238.html

Despite this, you issued a statement that shows you do not respect party’s guidelines. Therefore, you are removed from the party with immediate effect,” said a letter issued by BJP’s state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal on Friday.After getting the show cause, Pandey had met late former Siwan MP Mohammed Shahbuddin’s son Osama at their residence. Talking to media persons, he had said, “I have been given 10 days time to reply… This is not the first time I have got the notice. It has happened many a time. At the most, they will remove me from the party. Party does not run my expenses and I do not aim to contest polls as well. I am not afraid of anybody.” Pandey was elected to the Legislative Council from local body quota in 2015 and his term ends on July 16, 2021. Of late, he has been flirting with the RJD. In fact, one of his brothers, Bachcha Pandey, is RJD MLA from Barharia seat.

The government has come up with a separate procedure only for those candidates from the different abled category who could not apply in 2019. The district education officers (DEOs) will make the available the vacancies — as per recruiting agency, subject and category — on the web portal with clarity by June 9, while the candidates could apply from June 11 to June 25 at the recruiting agency concerned or through post. After the receipt of applications, they will be screened, and the recruiting agencies concerned will proceed further as per the laid down provisions to prepare the revised merit list. The recruiting agencies at the panchayat, block and district level had earlier prepared the merit list, but after the court stay on recruitments in 2020, things got stuck. The Patna HC had on Thursday cleared the decks for recruitment of nearly 1.25 lakh school teachers by giving relief to the petitioners, the National Federation of the Blind Bihar branch, which filed a petition against denial of 4% reservation the differently abled as per the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 as also the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. The appointment had remained stuck for nearly two years and the court did early hearing in the case on the request of education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary. The minister said he would like the process to be completed at the earliest, without any further wrangles. “The government also has to carry out seventh phase recruitments. But before that, the sixth phase has to be completed, hopefully in the next couple of months,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teachers-recruitment-day-after-hc-order-govt-notifies-dates-for-persons-with-disability-101622821637932.html

Kumar was holding a high-level review meeting on law and order through video conferencing. All senior officers, including chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, director general of police SK Singhal and DMs and SPs of all districts, joined the meeting. Listing out measures for speedy disposal of land related cases, the CM said land disputes were the major reason behind crimes in Bihar. “Besides the DM-SP meeting, subdivisional police officers (SPDOs) and SDOs shall hold meeting with circle officers and station house officers (SHO) once in a week to speed up the disposal process. As per officials, nearly 60 per cent of violent crimes in the state have their roots in land disputes. Keeping this in view, the CM had earlier asked the revenue and land reforms department to complete fresh survey and settlement of land records at the earliest. The CM also directed the officials to properly review all cases of crime so that the guilty are not let off. “Night patrolling must be intensified and women police personnel be posted at all police stations across the state,” he told the DGP, adding that information gathering at village level shall be reinforced without any delay. The officers were also told to ensure speedy trial of all important cases. “Investigation of all cases shall be backed up with scientific based analysis so that the cases stood in the law of court,” said the CM. The opposition parties, during the last assembly session, had cornered the state government on the law and order situation, alleging that the crime had doubled last year as compared to 2005 when the RJD-led dispensation ruled the state. Opposition leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had claimed that the number of cognisable offence cases was 97,850 when the RJD rule ended in 2005, but the number rose to 1,96,911 cases in 2018 during NDA regime, registering a 101.2 per cent of growth. The CM had, however, disputed the contention, and cited data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) to claim that the crime had come down in Bihar over the last few years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cm-tasks-dms-sps-to-hold-fortnightly-meet-to-resolve-land-dispute-101622821637273.html

The trust’s initiative comes before Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey tweeted on Friday that arrangements at neonatal ICU, paediatric ICU and special newborn care units of government medical college hospitals and district hospitals were being improved in anticipation of the third wave affecting children. The Mahavir Vatsalya Aspatal has found support from a Chennai-based NGO, One More Breath, which has offered assistance. The support was routed through top government functionaries, who said the resources could be best utilised by the trust, which already runs five hospitals — the Mahavir Cancer Sansthan, Mahavir Arogya, Mahavir Vatsalya, Mahavir Heart Hospital, Mahavir Eye Hospital and the Mahavir Agrasen Sewa Samiti, a child and maternity hospital in Begusarai. “The NGO has committed to provide us hospital beds and equipment like nebuliser, infusion pump, suction pump, Bipap machine, oxygen concentrators, etc.,” said Kishore Kunal, secretary of the Mahavir Temple Trust. “We are arranging ventilator support on 35-40 beds besides providing other allied items to set up the requisite infrastructure by next month,” he said. “We are installing a separate elevator on the back side of our existing hospital building to access the second floor, exclusively for paediatric Covid-19 patients,” Kunal said. The ₹2 crore 60-bed dedicated paediatric Covid-19 hospital project was in addition to the existing 70 non-Covid bed hospital, including a 40-bed neonatal ICU. Philanthropy in Covid times amid dwindling earning The trust, which manages the over 300-year-old iconic Mahavir temple in Patna, is not untouched by the pandemic. Its annual earning through donations has taken a severe hit due to the temple’s closure during the lockdown. “Our average annual earning through the temple is ₹20 crore (approx.), which we primarily use to support our five not-for-profit hospitals. Our earnings were almost nil during the pandemic. We have been compelled to take a bank loan of ₹4 crore against our fixed deposit, the first time in the last decade,” said Kunal. The financial crunch during the pandemic notwithstanding, the Mahavir temple trust has gone ahead with its philanthropic activities. It has been supplying free medical oxygen cylinders to those infected by coronavirus and under home isolation. It also provides refilling facility of small oxygen cylinders free of cost. The initiative was launched last month during the peak of oxygen crisis that lasted almost a fortnight in Patna, claiming precious lives, forcing the Patna High Court to take cognizance. At a time when the 91 hospitals empanelled by the government in Patna to treat Covid-19 cases put up house-full boards, the trust opened its doors to cure Covid-19 patients at its Mahavir Arogya Sansthan. It earmarked 40 beds for Covid-19 patients and extended treatment at rates fixed by the government, when many other private health facilities took it as an opportunity to mint money, charging arbitrary rates from patients. The Patna district administration has already issued show-cause notices to 12 of the 31 private health facilities presently under its scanner. “We have registered FIRs against four private health facilities for overcharging patients and got five other hospitals to refund excess payment to relatives of patients. Inquiries are on in several other similar complaints,” said Richie Pandey, Patna’s deputy development commissioner, also the senior nodal officer, treatment cell of Covid-19, constituted by district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh. The trust had donated ₹1 crore to the Bihar Chief Minister Relief Fund in March last year as soon as the first case of Covid-19 was reported in the state, said Kunal. It also partnered with the government in inoculating people against Covid-19 free of cost between January and April 30, after which the government stopped free supply of vaccines and asked non-government facilities to approach vaccine firms directly for supplies. Ironically, government red tape has delayed its efforts to revive vaccination at its hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/temple-trust-braces-for-third-wave-to-set-up-60-bed-paediatric-covid-hospital-101622821577252.html

As of Thursday, the city has 28 active zones of which six are in building, 10 in societies and 12 others. The fall in city’s positivity rate also facilitated its ease in the lockdown restrictions earlier. As of now, almost half of the city’s wards, which is seven out of the 15 wards do not have any active micro containment zones. According to the information from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), as of Thursday, seven wards have the least number of active zones which is almost half the number of wards within PMC limits. This is for the first time since the second wave of Covid receded that half the wards have no active zones. The wards that have zero zones are Warje-Karvenagar, Kothrud-Bawdhan, Dhole Patil road, Yerawada-Kalas-Dhanori, Bhawani Peth, Bibwewadi and Kondhwa Yewelewadi. While the highest number of active zones is present on Sinhgad road and Dhankawadi-Sahakarnagar wards which have nine active zones each. Micro containment zones intend to stop the spread of infection by restricting public movement. Santosh Warule, assistant commissioner of Warje-Karvenagar, “The criterion for an active micro containment zone is five or more positive cases. In such a situation, to control the number of cases we effectively implemented contract tracing in our ward especially among high-risk contacts. Also, by declaring societies as micro containment zones the outside facilities including daily household maids and parcel services were hampered which made people follow Covid appropriate behaviour properly.” Additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “We have crossed over 11 lakh vaccinations in Pune city and we have only 28 micro containment zones. Also, we have only two per cent active cases of Covid. This is a big positive news after the city faced the huge surge in the second wave.” Micro containment zones in the city A week ago, the city reported 56 active micro containment zones which has reduced to 28.

The civic administration has been instrumental in refunding those who were billed in excess. PMC has been assessing hospitals for their role in overcharging patients based on citizen complaints for the past one year. It has now once again swung back into auditing the hospital billing as part of the citizen grievance redressal mechanism process.Assistant health officer Manisha Naik said that since the outbreak of the second wave in March, the number of complaints regarding overcharging has gone up and PMC is scrutinising each complaint. “The health department is receiving at least 25 complaints daily and we have acted upon all of them till now. We received complaints against 222 hospitals and notices have been issued to 172 of them. Of them, 90 cases have been addressed, 27 billing have been re-audited, ₹20 lakh has been refunded and 15 complainants could not be traced,” she said.The health department had issued a notice to a prominent hospital for overcharging 34 patients. When there was no response from the hospital, the department issued a licence cancellation notice and the hospital refunded ₹22 lakh to patients.Even as the state government has capped Covid treatment in private hospitals under three categories, PMC received several complaints about overcharging by the private hospitals. Hence, PMC launched audit of private hospital bills since March 2021. It was observed that some hospitals overcharged for the treatment under the pretext of other services. The bill amount was charged between ₹2 lakh and ₹8 lakh per person.PMC health department chief Dr Ashish Bharti said, “We are going to examine every pre and post Covid hospital admission bill.” District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said that he has issued guidelines to government institutions seeking audit of Covid bills and refund patients. The collector has sought detailed report on total cases of overcharging, refund status and pending figure to be submitted within seven days.Four docs booked for overcharging Covid patientThe Pimpri-Chinchwad police on May 31 registered a case against four doctors attached with a private hospital in Chakan, for overcharging a Covid-19 patient of ₹1.5 lakh. The patient, a resident of Ozar in Pune district, was admitted to the hospital and charged ₹2.5 lakh towards ventilator, ICU, medication and allied charges. An audit conducted by a panel under Chakan rural hospital superintendent Nanda Dhavale revealed that the bill amount was Rs1.5 lakh more than the actual cost. Later, the Chakan rural hospital superintendent lodged a complaint against the four doctors and an FIR was filed against the doctors under Sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 188 (disobedience) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-issues-notices-to-172-private-hospitals-for-overcharging-covid-patients-101622817677067.html

The hospital run by the state government has been at the forefront of the fight against not only Covid, but post-Covid mucormycosis also. According to the doctors who treated patients down with the black fungus at the hospital, it was found that most of these cases were found in Covid-19 recovered patients. They said that apart from steroids given during Covid treatment, the fungus easily enters the body through the nose of patients with co-morbidities (diabetes, hypertension, cancer) and low immunity. The fungus later infects the eyes and brain, causing the patient to lose sight or life. More than 201 patients have been admitted to Sassoon hospital since the onset of mucormycosis and the 100th surgery was carried out on June 3. On an average about 7-8 new patients were being admitted to the hospital daily, according to the hospital staff. Dr Sameer Joshi, head, ENT department, said, “To be specific, we have performed 118 mucormycosis surgeries of which 110 were of ENT alone since mucor affects the ENT first. We have reported only one death due to the black fungus till now. Most of these surgeries happened post the second wave in April, and 83 of these operations happened in May alone. We are operating 11 patients on a daily basis. As of Monday, we will have only four patients on the waiting list. This is probably the highest number of surgeries performed by any hospital in the state. However, only after three months can we say if the surgery was a success since through surgery it we remove the dead tissue and over 90% of the fungus, but 10% is still present in the body which is invisible to the naked eye. So, we continue to prescribe amphotericin even after surgery. We also have a few patients who come to us for post-operative surgery. Only two of these 118 were non-Covid mucor cases which were due to cancer.” The mucormycosis surgeries included FESS (Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery) plus skull base surgery, also two craniotomy, two cancer patients and 11 patients who underwent surgery due to fungal infection in the blood vessels of the brain and four patients who underwent surgery due to fungal pus in the brain. Most of these surgeries were performed under the government’s MJPJAY (Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana) scheme and also the injections required for the treatment were provided under the government scheme. As these complicated surgeries require multi specialists, a team of doctors from the hospital’s Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT), ophthalmology, medicine and anaesthesia departments performed the surgeries. Maharashtra has declared the disease as a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and so every case is recorded. As of now, the state has recorded over 5,000 mucormycosis cases since March 2020. The state government has also capped prices for the treatment of mucormycosis and suspected patients in private and charitable hospitals. It has made it mandatory for them to display the rates and explain the same to patients and their relatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sassoon-hosp-conducts-100-mucormycosis-surgeries-83-in-may-alone-101622815396925.html

The 15-year-old girl and her 11-year-old brother are now being looked after by their 36-year-old maternal uncle, who is a labourer and the sole breadwinner of a family of nine that includes his elderly parents, wife, two children, an unmarried brother. Also read: 17 girls among 30 children orphaned due to Covid in HaryanaAccording to the district health department, the children’s mother tested positive on March 10, and she died of acute respiratory distress syndrome three days later at MM Medical College, Mullana. “She was referred from Ambala civil hospital to Mullana after her condition worsened. Ever since she tested positive, her children have been living with us,” says the uncle. “They have two paternal uncles, but they expressed helplessness. In today’s time, it’s difficult to fend for one’s own family, how does one look after another’s children?” he says. The children are students of Classes 10 and 6 in a government school. “With schools closed, they are home and share a strong bond with my children. The elder sister keeps consoling her brother whenever he gets upset,” he says. Hit hard by the pandemic, the uncle has sought government help and submitted documents required with the district administration. “I don’t expect a new house from the government but at least it can help with their education and insurance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/labourer-comes-to-rescue-of-siblings-orphaned-due-to-covid-in-ambala-101622815217543.html

04-06-2021||Delhi||DU students take on waste: Raise awareness about environment||Subscribing to Greta Thunberg’s channel and holding digital protests isn’t just what students from various Delhi University colleges are limiting themselves to. This year, while celebrating World Environment Day, some students of the varsity are all up for proactive drives, like Project Srijan. This initiative in Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies (SSCBS) has been initiated to tackle the problem of electronic waste by ensuring its proper disposal. “Amid the pandemic the reliance on gadgets has increased manifold leading to a greater amount of e-waste. To tackle this problem head on, we have placed customised bins in various target markets to provide convenient disposal options. Old wires that don’t work, and other electronic gadgets that people usually discard under a tree because of not knowing what to do with it, can now dispose the waste in a productive way,” says Parnika Srivastava, a final year student of SSCBS, informs, “We also channelise this e-waste to help an underprivileged community, by providing them employment opportunities by producing DIY products using the waste component of the collected e-waste. This is then sold through third party, at various digital carnivals.” Elaborating on their efforts, especially amid the lockdown, Tanmay Bhateja, a first year student of SSCBS, says, “Our team comprises more than 50 students at present. To continue sensitising the masses, the team undertook online sessions with several colleges and schools, and urged them to hold on to their e-waste during the current lockdown, and give us an opportunity to dispose it in the right manner when the situation permits after lockdown opens. We plan to install specialised e-waste bins in as many public places as we can.”This Environment day, the group of students from SSCBS will celebrate their achievements by connecting digitally and discussing how far they have made it, in tackling e-waste throughout Delhi-NCR. “So far, through conducting collection drives using customised bins we have succeeded in channelising more than four thousand kgs of e-waste to the formal recycling sector within just one year of operations; ensuring proper disposal from various areas including Rohini, Greater Noida, Nehru Place, Pushp Vihar, Ghaziabad, Malviya Nagar, Vivek Vihar, Indirapuram etc,” says Nimish Dayal, a second year student of SSCBS.Besides electronic waste, the sudden rise in medical waste has also become a growing concern in the times of pandemic. To tackle this, and rid their housing societies and complexes from such waste, some DU students will be seen clad in PPE kits and protective gear, to clean the locality and streets nearby their homes. “Me and my friends reside in the same locality, and are going to clean our streets by properly disposing off used masks and gloves. The pandemic has resulted in a lot of garbage that includes face masks, face shields and gloves. Gloves and face shields are basically plastic and do not decompose; masks leads to an increased cloth waste. Therefore not ensuring their proper disposal pollutes the environment terribly. And if not disposed properly, these can be put to reuse and sold as fresh pieces, as reported by the Delhi Police in a recent case. Therefore, as citizens of the nation, it is our duty to clean the waste and protect the environment,” says Pooja Santosh, a student of Hindu College.And there are some DU students who are also engaging in plantation drives, to mark this day! “On World Environment Day, I’m engaging in a plantation drive along with my friends,” says Abhishek Kumar, a student of Kirori Mal College, adding, “We have all resolved to plant seeds or saplings, and nurture them. We’ve even purchased seeds for this activity, and while we won’t be able to do it together in our college, we will do it near our homes and share our photos with each other and our classmates.”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-students-take-on-waste-raise-awareness-about-environment-101622813417517.html
04-06-2021||Lucknow||BJP in shock over its workers’ rebellious mood, Yogi govt days numbered: SP||Asserting that the Yogi government’s days are numbered in Uttar Pradesh, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Friday claimed the BJP leadership is in shock over the “rebellious attitude” of party workers, allegedly ignored by the government. The BJP leadership is in shock over the “rebellious attitude” of party workers and those of the RSS, who have gone in “hibernation as they were ignored” by the government, claimed Yadav. This has driven the top leadership of the BJP to hold “constant meetings and brainstorming (sessions) in AC rooms from Delhi to Lucknow", Yadav said. "But the situation is that if they try to persuade one leader, the other one gets angry. To bridge the rift between the government and the organisation, the leaders are tweeting only," he said. The former chief minister apparently referred to the recent visits of the BJP’s two central leaders from Delhi to Lucknow to meet the top brass of the party leaders and the state government, which they described as routine. Yadav also asserted that the Samajwadi Party has secured a greater reach and acceptance among the public and the BJP leader has grown apprehensive of it. The former chief minister also accused the state government of suppressing the number of government employees and health and other frontline workers who died while discharging their anti-Covid duties. He said the government was suppressing the number because it wants to save the money to be given as compensation to its employees' families. That is why the government is not releasing any list of its employees who died on duty, he said. “The government is trying to befool people with fudged data. It wants to save itself from paying the money by hiding deaths of its employees on duty due to Covid,” said Yadav. “To hide its failure, it has been claiming fewer deaths of government employees due to Covid-19. Had the government’s intentions been clear, it would have had no hitch in releasing the list of its employees who died due to Covid," Akhilesh said in a statement issued here. He said the SP workers would reach every village and meet families of each Covid victim and ask about their grievances. "It is expected from the party workers that they will help the needy people and not let anyone sleep hungry," he said. The people are more fed up with the government's misrule than the pandemic, said Yadav, adding lakhs of people died of Covid-19 and black fungus infection due to the carelessness in treatment. He said the BJP will no longer be successful in tricking people to vote for them during the next assembly elections in 2022. In 2022, the “BJP's farewell is certain” and so is the formation of a socialist government, he said, adding the people have made up their minds for it. “This has made the BJP scared and it has triggered talks of reshuffle in the party and the government in UP,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-in-shock-over-its-workers-rebellious-mood-yogi-govt-days-numbered-sp-101622811331082.html
04-06-2021||Pune||With drop in Covid patients, hospitalisation of non-Covid cases gains pace in Pune||Pune: Private hospitals in the city are seeing a rise in non-Covid admissions following a drop in the virus infection. Administrators of private hospitals said that though the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) still has control over 80% of beds, many non-Covid cases are getting treated now. According to the district health report, there were 5,213 active Covid cases within PMC limits. Of this, 2,286 are in home isolation and 2,927 are hospitalised. “We are yet to receive any official order about releasing beds, but have started admitting non-Covid patients, emergency and routine surgery. The Covid ward has been isolated and other patients are coming to the hospital now. We have 113 non-Covid patients and 83 Covid cases. As the number of Covid cases is going down, it is impractical to keep the beds vacant when non-Covid patients are reaching out to hospitals for treatments. We have also started to reduce the number of ICU beds increased earlier for Covid patients as it is expensive to keep this facility functional. We will increase the count of beds if Covid cases rise in future,” Dr HK Sale, executive director, Noble Hospital PuneDr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Vidyapeeth Medical College and Hospital, said that as some restrictions have been eased in the city people have started to step out and undergo routine medical procedures. “We have started admitting non-Covid patients. We will increase beds if the virus cases rise in future. During the peak of the second wave, maximum number of Covid patients was admitted and now the count has dropped by almost 90%. Now, non-Covid check-ups, surgical treatments have resumed. Also, since unlocking has begun, people have resumed visiting us for routine investigations, minor surgeries,” said Dr Oswal. Manisha Naik, assistant medical officer, PMC, said, “As there is a possibility of a third wave, we have not released beds at major hospitals in Pune. Private hospitals can admit emergency non-Covid patients.” As the number of active cases has declined, the count of critical patients and those on oxygen support has reduced. On Thursday, there were 1,391 patients on oxygen support and 742 were critical in Pune. The number has drastically reduced in the last 15 days. On May 20, there were 1,328 Covid patients who were critical and 4,360 on oxygen support.

Of them, 17 are girls and 13 boys. Officials said a majority of the children were orphaned during the second wave after having lost a parent either during the first wave or earlier. Of the 30 children, 23 are siblings and at least 16 live with their grandparents and the rest with other relatives. Also read: 23 children orphaned due to Covid-19 in PunjabThey said the number of children who have lost a single parent is likely to go up as the verification process is still on.

04-06-2021||Delhi||SC grants interim bail to ex-Unitech promoter Sanjay Chandra||The Supreme Court on Friday granted interim bail to real estate firm Unitech’s erstwhile promoter Sanjay Chandra in view of his father-in-law’s death last month. He had sought bail for four weeks and has been asked to surrender by June 19.Senior advocate Siddharth Dave, who appeared for Chandra, said a memorial for his client’s father-in-law is scheduled for June 12. He added Chandra’s wife was alone making arrangements.Chandra is accused of fraud and cheating thousands of homebuyers by not handing over possessions of flats on time. The Economic Offences Wing of the Delhi Police submitted a charge sheet against Chandra, his father, and his brother in July 2015.Chandra was granted bail by a Delhi court in January 2021, but the top court set aside the order in March this year. Since then, Chandra has been in jail.Also Read | Editors Guild welcomes SC judgment on sedition case against journalist Vinod DuaChandra applied for both regular and interim bail. The vacation bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and MR Shah felt the regular bail could be heard and decided by the bench which had earlier cancelled his bail. However, in the interim, the vacation bench decided to give Chandra 15-day bail.“He is accused of a serious fraud involving thousands of crores. You must know the reason why his bail had to be cancelled,” the vacation bench said when Dave pressed for at least three-week.In October 2017, the Supreme Court granted bail to the Chandra brothers on the condition that they deposit ₹750 crore with the court’s registry by December 31, 2017. It took three years for the Chandras to deposit this amount.In August 2020, when Chandras applied for bail, the Supreme Court found that the timeline for deposit was breached and the sum of ₹750 crore had to personally come from Chandras. The court found that the money deposited with the registry was the amount procured from the monetization of assets of Unitech Limited that was held by a Court-appointed Committee.Besides, a forensic audit report of the Unitech firm submitted to the Supreme Court found serious instances of money laundering and siphoning of funds to offshore locations by the erstwhile management headed by Chandra. On these grounds, the top court rejected Chandra’s bail plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sc-grants-interim-bail-to-ex-unitech-promoter-sanjay-chandra-101622811137243.html
04-06-2021||Delhi||What do Delhi’s death registration figures tell us about Covid-19 death toll?||Delhi’s three municipal corporations issued 33,109 death certificates in April and May this year at the peak of the Covid second wave, roughly three times the number registered in 2020 and 73.8% of the figure in 2019, records showed. During these two months in 2021, the official Covid death toll in Delhi was 13,210 – 5,120 in April and 8,090 in May. The data from the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) – which together have 95% of the Capital’s population – pointed towards excess or uncounted deaths, which experts say was responsible for an undercounting of Covid mortality during the second wave. In April and May 2020, the three corporations issued 10,258 death certificates. The nationwide lockdown in place during these two months may have forced many people to apply for certificates later. In April and May 2019, the three corporations gave out 19,047 death certificates. Also Read | Delhi University likely to provide fee waiver to students orphaned by Covid-19Municipal authorities clarified that death registrations did not necessarily reflect the total death count in a particular month because some people apply for certificates later. Civic authorities attributed the increase in death registrations to the second wave of Covid-19 and clearance of backlog due to technical problems. Jai Prakash, mayor of NDMC, said death certificate are issued after someone’s kin applies for it and crematoriums also separately issue a slip for funeral. “The hike in death registrations in April and May this year is also because of second wave of Covid-19 where thousands of people died, which is also present in government records. The number of death registrations is just a suggestive data and based on it cannot precisely say that so many deaths occurred in a particular month,” Prakash said. Precise information about number of deaths due to Covid-19 can only be ascertained by conducting a door-to-door survey, he added. A senior SDMC official said on the condition of anonymity that other than Covid-19, the surge was also because of backlog created by technical glitches. “Earlier this year, registrations of death and birth certificates were made completely online but there were initial glitches due to which death certification process was affected. This also created a backlog but now everything is fine and that backlog is being cleared,” the official said. According to municipal data, 9,657 deaths were registered across the three civic bodies in April 2019 while the number was 9,390 in May 2019. In 2020, when coronavirus pandemic hit the city, death registrations across the three corporations dropped to 4,783 for April 2020 and 5,475 for May 2020. When the second wave of Covid – fourth for Delhi – ravaged the city in April and May this year, the number of death registrations increased. In April, the three municipalities issued 9,109 death certificates while in May, 24,000 certificates were issued. “Second wave of Covid is one of the main reasons behind the surge. In April and May 2020, the lockdown was very strict and no one could come for registrations of deaths of their kin. Other than this, due to restriction on traffic movement, fewer people died in that period due to which the number of death registrations in those months in 2020 is less,” EDMC mayor Nirmal Jain said. He also said that the issuance of death certificates by civic bodies did not give a clear picture about number of deaths in any particular month. If someone applied for a death certificate in May and got the certificate in that month, then the death will be registered in May even if the person died in April, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/what-do-delhi-s-death-registration-figures-tell-us-about-covid-19-death-toll-101622808617116.html

He told reporters that he has sent his resignation letter to the party and would also meet the assembly speaker later to resign as an assembly member.Rajender, who is expected to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) next week, said he ended his 19-year-old association with the TRS to protect his self-respect. He said he was pained at the way chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, popularly known as KCR, sacked him without even giving him an opportunity to offer an explanation.Rajender added he also resigned from the assembly in 2006 for the sake of self-respect. “Every time, I contested the elections, I won the Huzurabad seat, because the people of the constituency are with me,” he said.Also Read | Niti Aayog’s SDG index ranks Andhra Pradesh 3rd, Telangana 11thRajender said he and Rao began drifting apart in 2016 when despite taking a prior appointment to meet the chief minister, he and a few other TRS lawmakers were stopped at the gate and refused entry into his camp office. Rajender questioned whether there was a single Other Backward Caste or Scheduled Caste official in the chief minister’s office. “Not just me, several other ministers also faced humiliation in the KCR rule. I had been facing humiliations silently only in the interest of the state. Otherwise, there is no need to be a minister, who is worse than a slave.”Former MLA Enugu Ravinder Reddy, ex-Karimnagar zilla parishad chairperson Tula Uma are also likely to join the BJP along with Rajender.The TRS reacted strongly. “It is like betraying one’s own mother. Telangana became a reality only because of KCR. Leaders might come and go, but the TRS will remain strong under the leadership of KCR,” TRS leader Palla Rajeshwar Reddy said. He wondered whether Rajender would be able to protect his self-respect if he joined the BJP and said he would fade out of politics soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sacked-minister-quits-telangana-s-ruling-party-101622808437058.html
04-06-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Seven Deadly Sins of Social Media||This week, it appeared as though Covid-19 was not the only thing going viral across the planet, giving rise to comment and concern. A moronic, but equally contagious post, began showing up on the timelines of a whole swathe of Facebook users, from continents as far flung as Australia, Asia, America and Europe. “I was wondering where everyone went!” began the awkwardly-worded canard, quickly going on to declare: “Thanks for the tip to circumvent Facebook... Works!! I have a whole new profile. I see posts from people I didn’t see anymore. Facebook’s new algorithm picks the same people - around 25 - who will see your posts...” And then without much ado, the message urges naïve readers to further perpetuate the myth, by copy pasting it on to their own timelines. And lo and behold, without so much as a whisker of scepticism, this idiotic communique has proliferated on user after user’s timelines, as if the whole world has overnight been infected by another deadly virus, this time one that destroys grey matter and all vestiges of common sense. On its part, Mark Zuckerberg’s social media platform has been vainly attempting to quell the contagion, posting numerous and strongly worded advisories that it is false information which has been circulating since 2017, one which has already been debunked in no uncertain terms-but to little avail. (“Facebook does not set a limit on the number of people whose posts are shown in your News Feed.”) So, with no signs of it abating, our attention has been naturally drawn this week to other, similarly hilarious/ odious/ ludicrous practices that have yet to be called out, on the social media platform. And so here they are, gentle reader: The Seven Deadly Sins of Social Media — in the form of popular Bollywood film titles… 1) Mujhse Dosti Karoge! (The Sin of Sycophantic Sucking up) There was a time when the practice of toe-curling sycophancy, unctuous fawning and cringe-inducing toadying were called out for the blatant brown-nosing that they were; but that was a time before the advent of social media. For some inexplicable reason, those given to such execrable demonstrations of smarminess, have assumed a carte blanche to carry on the revolting practice on social media, with a no-holds-barred attitude, making the rest of us reach for the barf bags, all too frequently. 2) ‘Cull’ Ho Na Ho (The Sin of Passive Aggression) You know this type. The ones who want to get a tart message across to some hapless individual on their friend’s list, but rather than come out and say what’s on their mind directly, they prefer to beat around the bush, hoping to get their message across, through a general post, ostensibly addressed to everyone, but actually aimed like a tiny poison dart, at the heart of the particular individual who irks them. There are many ingenious ways they employ to achieve this. Most common among them is to slight A by heaping fulsome — and mostly undeserved — praise on B, on the assumption that A and B are rivals. Complicated? Yes. Tedious? Certainly. Pathetic and juvenile? And how… Oh, and yes, these passive aggressive types are also the ones who will issue periodic veiled threats announcing with sweet regularity, that they are on the verge of culling their friends’ list, in the hope that people be nicer to them, … 3) Dil Dhadakne Do (The Sin of Generic, Gushing Banality) Wish, wish, wish. Every holiday, every festival, every religious celebration, every world event, every famous person who dies, every meme they’ve received, every schlock kindergarten wisdom they’ve marvelled at, every joke they’ve thought funny, even every joke they’ve not thought funny, will end up on these people’s timelines, in an endless carousel of gush. And the prodigious Niagara Falls of their sentimentality is matched only by the ingenuity with which they come up with a million hashtags to accompany their vapid posts with. 4) Band Baaja Baaraat (The Sin of Blatant Exhibitionism and Unbridled Showing Off) Welcome to Show Off Central. Your homes, your cars, your toys, your boys, your PJs, your Porsches, your pearls… all served up daily, by the hour, every hour, in all their pixelated splendour, for your “friends” to envy and covet. What’s more we are informed, this extreme practice of “neighbour’s envy, owner’s pride”, has given rise to a whole range of businesses such as mock up cabins in private jets, Olympic sized swimming pools and luxury limousines, which you can rent by the hour, to service your proclivity for in-your-face, runaway exhibitionism. 5) Dharm (The Sin of Relentless Virtue Signalling) This transgression is perhaps the most disingenuous, because it seeks to deceive not only the viewer, but also its originator, by conveying a vastly exaggerated sense of their saintliness and virtue. This type of post is marked by its propensity to constantly advertise the individual’s good deeds, their numerous acts of charity and their benevolence and singular generosity of spirit, with such dogged consistency, that the light bouncing off their halos is said to be able to guide lost ships at sea. 6) Meri Aawaz Suno (The Sin of Desperate Attention Seeking and Posting Too Frequently) There’s no way escaping from this transgression on your timeline, because it’s in your face, every day, in every way. Whereas conventional wisdom caps it at posting once or twice daily on FB, half a dozen posts before lunchtime, is routine for this compulsive attention seeker, because of course, as everyone knows, you can’t have too much of a good thing. 7) Thappad (The Sin of Virulent, Overt Hatred) This one needs no explanation; you just have to look out for the grammar (non-existent), vocabulary (ditto) and punctuation (way too many exclamation marks and mostly every word in ALL CAPS) which accompany this truckload of freshly minted manure. Leading to the question: What is the co-relation between poor communication skills and a proclivity to verbal violence?

A letter will come soon,” read a WhatsApp message sent by a senior IAS official on a group of civil surgeons of Punjab.Principal Secretary, health, Hussan Lal has confirmed that the government is taking back the vaccines from private hospitals.One-time measure or considered move? On Thursday, Hindustan Times reported how the state government was selling the Covaxin bought for ₹400 a dose to private hospitals for ₹1,060 a dose. These hospitals were administering the vaccine to the common man for ₹1,560 a dose.The HT report showed how the Punjab government was making money on the pretext of corporate social responsibility (CSR) by selling Covaxin doses procured from its quota to the private hospitals. The state health authorities on Thursday had again justified the move, saying that it was “only a one-time measure”.So far, 80,000 doses have been sold to private facilities, 30,000 of which went to a single hospital in Mohali, an official said, requesting anonymity.The government could have earned more than ₹5crore from the sale of vaccines.The state nodal officer for vaccination and senior IAS officer, Vikas Garg, on Wednesday justified the state government’s decision, saying the profit would be used only to buy vaccines and this was a one-time measure. “The decision of providing the vaccine doses to private hospitals was taken on public demand,” he said.However, Hindustan Times has learnt that it was a well thought out move to create a CSR fund.An official privy to the developments, requesting anonymity, said the one-time-measure statement came after discussions among senior health functionaries who were the brain behind the idea of generating funds from vaccines.It is learnt that the vaccine was provided to some private hospitals on Thursday against advance payments made by them.Political slugfest over pandemic premium Union ministers Prakash Javadekar and Anurag Thakur, Shiromani Akali Dal leaders Sukhbir Singh Badal and Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Aam Aadmi Party state chief Bhagwant Maan criticised the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government for “making profit from the pandemic”.Thakur accused the Punjab government of black-marketing vaccines. “Punjab has shown a careless and callous attitude towards the people of the state by charging four times from people for the jab. Why should an individual pay over ₹3,120 for two doses when the Centre is providing vaccines free to the state government? Instead of facilitating the vaccination process, the Punjab government is looting the people during the pandemic,” he said.“Will (Congress leader) Rahul Gandhi investigate why vaccines have been supplied to Congress cronies who are charging a pandemic premium and indulging in black-marketing instead of saving the lives of the poor? And does he have the courage to question his own party’s government in Punjab?” Thakur added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jabbed-punjab-govt-to-take-back-vaccines-sold-to-private-hospitals-101622808017862.html

However, many of them lost their jobs due to the Covid-19 situation and were stranded there, she said."As soon as we got information about tribal migrant workers from our district getting stranded in Tirupur, we ensured their return with the help of the Chief Minister's Office and non-profit organisations. The women have reached Dhanbad and are on their way to Dumka," Deputy Commissioner Rajeshwari B said.The 36 women will undergo Covid-19 tests and will be quarantined for seven days. After completion of their isolation, they will be tested again and then allowed to return to their homes if reports return negative, she said.Speaking to PTI on the issue, Chief Minister Hemant Soren said, "The state government is committed to ensuring the safety and honour of Jharkhand's workers across the country and even abroad.""Since last year's migrant crisis, all the district administrations have been instructed to act proactively in cases of emergency and extend support to ensure the return of the workers," he added.The Jharkhand government had last month rescued 26 migrant workers from the state stranded in Nepal due to a coronavirus-induced lockdown in the Himalayan country.Garment manufacturers in Tirupur, a major textile cluster in Tamil Nadu, are facing hardships due to lockdowns and a steep hike in yarn prices, forcing many to minimise output.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/36-jharkhand-tribal-women-stranded-in-tamil-nadu-to-return-home-101622807151781.html

PC Joshi, the acting vice-chancellor, said that the varsity is "actively considering" the fee waiver matter.

04-06-2021||Pune||Global village idiot: Random notes on healthcare...||It’s Wednesday, 9.30 am, and I am sitting in the Mediclaim department at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, waiting to submit paperwork as part of the pre-admission process. Well, my younger brother is doing it (he is meticulous).I have just submitted the Covid antigen test sample, which is a prerequisite for any medical procedure nowadays. It’s like a final “go, no-go” decision point, after all the other relevant medical “go no-gos” have been checked and cleared. I’ll get the report in an hour. If the report is negative (no Covid), then surgery can proceed; if the report is positive, surgery will be postponed and I will self-quarantine (though I have no symptoms), so that I am not a risk to others. If the report is negative, I will be admitted for the surgery early Friday morning - which is when this column appears in HT Pune.The hospital is coordinating with the insurance company for approval of cashless pre-authorisation. Insurers are typically enthusiastically optimistic when they are selling policies, and cautiously suspicious when it comes to authorisations and claims.My decisions related to hospital processes are not, however, dependent on the insurer’s yes/no: in a surgical intervention it is my responsibility to ensure I have the best attitude going in, the best attitude coming out and the best attitude during. To achieve that it is important I pick the best facilities within my limited means, and not the best facilities my insurance company is willing to approve. In times of a pandemic, it is critical to minimise any risk of other/further infections apart from risk associated with surgery.The insurer has to ensure they are not being taken for a ride, because it is a reality that people get insurance companies to pay for a lot of procedures simply because… So when one is filling out medical declaration forms, it is important to provide all historical information accurately and truthfully, because it helps the insurer evaluate your requirements against the terms mutually agreed to in the policy. I happen to be at Mangeshkar hospital on account of the fact that my orthopaedic, Dr Shirish Pathak, operates here. A couple of months ago, I twisted my left knee climbing down a flight of stairs and since then I have had pain while getting around. Due to the pandemic restrictions, the best course of action had been to grin and bear it. Eventually in the first week of May, I had to admit the pain was considerable (my knee was buckling). A thorough examination, x-rays and MRI scans confirmed that I had a complete ACL tear. ACL reconstruction surgery at the earliest was the order of the day. It was an easy decision because Dr Pathak does not recommend surgery unless it’s the only way out - he weighs all evidence in the patient’s specific context. Since December, I have visited the Chellaram Hospital, Jehangir Hospital, Dr Pathak’s Ortho Sports Clinic, PH Diagnostics, Poona Hospital and Mangeshkar hospital, for various medical reasons. That’s more hospital visits in five months than in the past five years. I am not the kind of person who second-guesses doctors or Googles information. My approach is to trust my doctor, or if it’s a new ailment, select a specialist doctor after consulting friends or family who are doctors themselves (no, I am not in favour of crowd-sourced or app-sourced information).I have visited Jehangir and Chellaram regularly for checkups - the doctors and healthcare personnel are super professional, attentive and facilities are impressively up-to-date. My recent visits in pandemic times have made me feel safe since their protocols are outstanding, quick and patient-oriented. PH Diagnostics in Kothrud has been very impressive and safe. Mangeshkar hospital is right up there with the best in the city - their efficiency, courtesy, and patient-care is seamless. Safety protocols are clearly visible and everyone (right from administrator Sachin Vyavahare to reception staff) is accessible and prompt in addressing patient needs.Yesterday, I was at Poona Hospital near Alka Talkies. My brother-in-law had a heart attack and my sister rushed him to the hospital as per recommendation of the family physician. An angiogram revealed 100% and 90% blocks on his arteries. An angioplasty was performed, stent implanted and he was in ICU all in good time. The hospital seemed well organised, staff all helpful and following safety protocols.It’s 10.50 am now and I just got the Covid antigen test report - it is negative. Yesssssss! I feel like I have just won a new contract or finished writing a new book. Because the negative report is an affirmation of the precautions we have been following since March 2020. It renews my faith that social distancing, precautions and appropriate lifestyle choices work, and that we have to continue the same vigilance and self-care. A big part of my faith is coming from first-hand experience at the healthcare institutions: I have found fearless, committed, competent and safety-oriented doctors, nurses, technicians and staff everywhere. They do this every day. And they have been doing this every day throughout the last 15 months of the pandemic. #Respect.Am looking forward to the surgery and thereafter, will get onto the road to rehabilitation and recovery … but that will be a different journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/global-village-idiot-random-notes-on-healthcare-101622803756910.html

04-06-2021||Chandigarh||23 children orphaned due to Covid-19 in Punjab||Twenty-three children have been orphaned by the coronavirus pandemic in Punjab. These include children whose both parents died of Covid-19 or who lost one parent earlier and the remaining single parent succumbed to the infection in the past 14 months, thereby rendering the child orphaned, according to the department of social security and women and child development department. Also read: ‘Will order an inquiry’: Punjab health minister on charges of vaccine diversion to private hospitalsThe Covid orphans have been identified after the state government announced relief measures for children who have lost both their parents and families that have lost their breadwinner in the pandemic. The child development project officers (CDPOs) of each block have been designated as special mentors for each such child and they will act as counsellor-cum-motivator for the child. Principal Secretary, social security, women and child development, Raji P Shrivastava said the data is for the period from March 31, 2020, to May 31, 2021, but subject to being updated based on fresh information received from the field. She declined to share details of the children affected by Covid, saying that the data has been uploaded onto the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) portal and is confidential. The department of social security, women and child development is the nodal department for the care of orphaned children. Social investigation being conducted “In all cases of children orphaned by Covid-19, social investigation is being conducted. The child and his close relatives are being interviewed and their views ascertained. Initially, most such children have been taken in by their close relatives. Those who are not accepted by relatives or those who do not have relatives, will be taken into children’s homes. Siblings will stay in the same childcare institution,” a department official said. Relief measures till beneficiaries turn 21 The state government has decided to provide ₹1,500 a month as social security pension and free education until graduation to all those children orphaned in the pandemic and families that have lost their breadwinning member, beginning July 1. The government will ensure free education in government institutions for such children and kids belonging to families that have lost the breadwinner to Covid. Also, they will be eligible for ₹51,000 under the Ashirwad Scheme and entitled to free ration under the smart ration card scheme and under the Sarbat Sehat Bima Yojana. The relief measures will be provided to orphans until they attain the age of 21 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/23-children-orphaned-due-to-covid-19-in-punjab-101622802736651.html
04-06-2021||Other||Maya expels two senior leaders over anti-party activities||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati has expelled two senior leaders Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar, who are also party MLAs, on the charge of indulging in anti- party activities during the recently concluded panchayat elections, a press statement by the BSP’s state unit said. Verma was also replaced as the BSP legislature party leader in the assembly. The post has now gone to Shah Alam aka Guddu Jamali, the party MLA from Mubarakpur in Azamgarh district. Expressing surprise over his expulsion from the BSP, Lalji Verma ruled out joining any other political party.“I will continue to work as a committed soldier of the BSP. I could not campaign for the party during the panchayat elections due to Covid-19 infection. I was admitted in SGPGI (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences), Lucknow. I had informed the party chief about my ailment,” he said.The expulsion of the two senior leaders when the BSP is gearing up its cadre for the 2022 assembly polls has surprised political analysts. An influential Kurmi community leader, Verma was a founder member of the party and a close aide of BSP founder the late Kanshi Ram. Projected as the backward class face of the BSP, he represented Katehri assembly constituency in Ambedkar Nagar district. Ramachal Rajbhar, a close confidant of the BSP chief, represented Akbarpur assembly constituency in Ambedkar Nagar district. Owing to his influence among the backward castes, particularly the Rajbhar community in central and east UP, Mayawati had promoted him as the party’s national general secretary earlier. He was also made the party’s Uttarakhand in-charge to expand its support base in the hill state before the 2022 assembly election there. A party leader said the BSP’s performance was below expectations in its stronghold in Ambedkar Nagar district in the recently concluded panchayat elections. The party won only seven of the 41 zila panchayat ward seats there. Verma was forced to withdraw his wife Sobhawati Verma, a former zila panchayat chairperson, from the election due to an objection raised by BSP sector coordinator Ghanshyam Kharwar. Verma’s relations with the party leadership soured when his close aides were not permitted to contest the panchayat election, the party leader said. Earlier, Verma faced humiliation in the by-poll for the Jalalpur assembly seat in 2019 when his daughter Chaya Verma was defeated by the SP candidate, he said. Shyam Sunder Verma aka Sadhu Verma, said to be a close aide of Lalji Verma, contested the zila panchayat ward election as an independent candidate after the BSP denied him the party ticket. Sadhu won the election by a margin of 11,000 votes. The BJP was planning to field Sadhu as the party candidate in the election the zila panchayat’s chairman post to be held in June-end, the party leader said, claiming that Sadhu met senior BJP leaders on Wednesday. There were rumours that Lalji Verma would also join the BJP, he said. The BSP leader alleged that Ramachal Rajbhar was hobnobbing with SP leaders and Mayawati showed him the door on the basis of the party coordinators’ report. To win the support of the Rajbhar community, Mayawati had earlier appointed Bhim Rajbhar as the state unit president, he said. The BSP had 18 MLAs in the legislative assembly. After rebellion by nine MLAs — Ramvir Upadhyaya, Anil Singh, Aslam Raini, Aslam Ali, Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind, Hargovind Bhargava, Sushma Patel, Vandana Singh — and the expulsion of Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar, the party’s strength has been effectively reduced to seven MLAs in the assembly. Mayawati has already announced that the BSP will go it alone in the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. She will hold a meeting with senior party leaders to discuss the strategy for the elections, the BSP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maya-expels-two-senior-leaders-over-anti-party-activities-101622802616079.html

The Union Territory administration is in the process of compiling data of such children before extending financial help to enable them to continue with their education. Also read: After first infection, Covid-19 risk reduces for up to 10 months: StudyUT social welfare secretary Sheetal Nanda said, “We are in the process of collecting data of Saksham scheme beneficiaries and intend to be ready with it by June 20. Over 400 children have either lost a parent or both parents to the infection so far in J&K. After verification, we need to open their bank accounts. They will be joint accounts of the minor with a major guardian. Besides, we need details such as where they are studying.” The divisional commissioners in Kashmir and Jammu and all district heads have been given the June 20 deadline after which the process of sanctioning relief will begin. Lost both parents in two weeks, teen struggles to come to terms The move comes as a helping hand for children like a 15-year-old student at an elite school in Jammu who lost her parents to Covid-19 within a fortnight in May 2021. The girl’s mother was a music teacher at the school. She is now being taken care of by her paternal aunt. Kamaljeet Kaur, a friend of the girl’s mother, said: “She is with her paternal aunt for now, but then what? She has to be taken care of and her uninterrupted studies should be ensured by the administration. She is a student of Class 11. She needs counselling for her mental and emotional well-being. I was able to talk to her once on her mother’s cell phone but since then no one is responding to my calls. I plan to visit her house and intend raising funds for her,” she said. Special scholarship announced Earlier this week, the J&K government constituted a five-member panel for hand-holding families of Covid victims. Apart from financial assistance of ₹1,000 a month to such families, the government has approved scholarship to their children. Under the scheme, the surviving spouse and the eldest surviving member of the affected families will receive a special monthly pension of ₹1,000 through direct bank transfer (DBT), provided they are not otherwise receiving any pension under other schemes. The scheme will provide special scholarships to children who lost their earning parent(s), sibling(s), guardian(s) to Covid. The special scholarship of ₹20,000 and ₹40,000 will be paid annually through DBT to children studying up to Class 12 and those pursuing higher education, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/over-400-children-need-govt-help-in-j-k-after-second-covid-wave-101622801536563.html
04-06-2021||Chandigarh||'Will order an inquiry': Punjab health minister on charges of vaccine diversion to private hospitals||Responding to allegations by the opposition about Covid-19 vaccines being sold to private hospitals by the state government for profit, Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Friday said that he will definitely initiate an inquiry.While speaking to reporters, Singh said that it was not his department, and an inquiry will be made for the same."I don't have control over vaccines. This comes under the chief secretary and other officials. I just look over treatment, testing, sampling of Covid-19, and vaccination camps. We will definitely set an inquiry, I myself can inquire about the matter," he said.He added, "We don't have the full picture. We will get to know by 3 pm today and we will release a statement. Purchasing is not my department. We have appointed several nodal officers for different departments. We will get a report and inform you."Earlier, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal had demanded a high court-monitored probe into the alleged selling of Covid-19 vaccine doses by the Punjab government to private hospitals for profit."The Punjab government is getting vaccines at ₹400 but selling them to private hospitals at ₹1,060. And private hospitals is administering vaccine on higher prices. A case should be registered against Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu for diverting vaccines meant for the common man to private institutions," Badal had said.He added that if this corporatisation of vaccine distribution is not stopped, the SAD would be 'forced to approach the courts for justice.Further, he said that vaccine doses were available in the State but they were being sold to private institutions instead of being given free of cost to the common man.He also claimed that in Mohali alone 35,000 doses were sold to private institutions to earn a profit of nearly ₹2 crore in a single day.He also condemned State chief secretary Vinni Mahajan for allegedly asking people to get themselves vaccinated at two private institutions at inflated rates.Punjab recorded 2,206 new Covid-19 cases and 91 deaths in the last 24 hours, according to the state bulletin on Thursday.

The park, which now has nine tigers, has procured kits to test all the carnivores for Covid there.“...we are sending the swab, blood samples and [a] lung [of the tiger] to IVRI [Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly] for more detailed investigation and find out if the animal was infected with any coronavirus like disease,” said O P Sahu, a veterinary doctor at the park. Sahu added the tiger’s blood test suggested liver and kidney infection and that the rapid antigen test was conducted on Friday morning.Rapid antigen tests have been found to be less accurate than the polymerase chain reaction tests, which are considered the gold standard for detecting Covid-19.Eight Asiatic lions at the Hyderabad zoo tested positive for Covid-19 in May. It was the first such instance in the country and prompted the Centre to order the closure of all national parks, sanctuaries, and national zoological parks. The lions were isolated and have since recovered while similar cases have been reported from other parts of the country.Also Read | 12 big cats killed in accidents triggered by dumping of leftover food: ReportThe Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has sent guidelines and advisories to the zoos -- ranging from prevention to sample collection to detection in suspected cases to safety protocols for animal keepers -- amid the surge in Covid-19 cases. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention, there is currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the coronavirus disease to humans. It said in an advisory on its website that more studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by Sars-CoV-2, and that Covid-19 can spread from people to animals in some situations, especially during close contact.A four-member veterinary doctors’ team was on Friday due to conduct the post-mortem on the tiger, who was brought to Ranchi from Bengaluru’s Bannerghatta Biological Park in November 2014.Officials said the tiger had a fever on Tuesday which subsided after medication. On Wednesday, the tiger did not eat well. “It did not eat at all on Thursday. Then, we called an expert from Ranchi Veterinary College and a vet from Tata Zoo. We also consulted vets in Hyderabad. The animal was given saline. But it could not survive,” said the park’s director, Y K Das. Das said the tiger was genetically weak. “It was suffering from health issues. Its liver and kidney were comparatively weak.”Das said the tiger did not show Covid symptoms when asked why a test for the disease was not conducted as per the CZA’s directions.”...we tried to test it for Covid, but the test kit was unavailable. Then, we procured it from outside, which was delivered on Thursday night.” Das said the tiger had been isolated from the beginning. “We have procured 24 test kits and Covid tests will be conducted of all the carnivores...”Praveen Kumar, an assistant professor at Ranchi Veterinary College who examined the tiger, said by then, its condition had deteriorated. “We gave saline to the animal with difficulties, as its vein was not found. The Covid test kit was brought but the test could not be conducted on Thursday night, as diluents were missing in the kit.” Kumar said he does not suspect it to be coronavirus. DS Srivastava, a former state wildlife board member, blamed the park for negligence. “The tiger fell seriously sick amid Covid pandemic. Why was the Covid test done at the first stage? Even if the tiger was not suffering from coronavirus, why it was not given proper treatment from specialist doctors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tiger-dies-at-ranchi-zoo-samples-sent-for-testing-after-covid-ruled-out-101622796136352.html

04-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s April Covid surge was driven by Delta replacing Alpha variant: Paper||Delhi’s rapid surge of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in April is linked to the Delta variant of concern B1.617.2 overtaking the earlier predominantly found Alpha variant B1.117, shows a yet-to-be peer-reviewed paper from the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB). The paper, which was uploaded to MedRxiv Thursday night, states that the B1.117 variant – which was initially reported from UK in December last year – was “minimal” in Delhi in the month of January, rapidly increasing to 20% in February, and 40% in March. Even this rapidly spreading variant of concern was, however, overtaken by April by the Delta variant first found in Maharashtra. The proportion of the Delta variant increased from 5% in February to 10% in March, before overtaking the Alpha variant by April and accounting for 60% of the sequenced samples, according to the paper. This increase in the proportion of the Delta variant was paralleled by a large increase in the positivity rate. Also Read | Scientifically Speaking: Decoding the evolution of coronavirusesThe positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive – in Delhi had jumped to over 36% by April third week, meaning one in every three samples being tested was found to have Covid-19. Based on data from India and the UK, the researchers from IGIB estimate that the Delta variant is as much as 50% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which is also manifold more transmissible that the wild-type Sars-Cov-2. The researchers also found that the breakthrough infections – Covid-19 after immunisation – were disproportionately because of the Delta variant. They are yet to determine whether the variant also leads to increased case fatality ratio – proportion of deaths among positive cases. “While much more remains to be done, three takeaways for now are: Delta (B.1.617.2) is more transmissible than Alpha (B.1.1.7), there seems to be greater immune escape and reinfection, and fully vaccinated breakthroughs were disproportionately due to Delta,” said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, IGIB in a tweet. An earlier study from the same institute found that it was causing more breakthrough infections in a tertiary care hospital. The researchers found that of the 33 healthcare workers who got the infection, almost half the infections were caused by B1.617 variant. “The dominance of B.1.617 could be explained by prevalence of this lineage in community infection or simply reflect transmission among healthcare workers. The data nonetheless raises the possibility of a transmission advantage of B.1.617 in vaccinated individuals,” said the yet-to-be peer-reviewed article from mid-May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-april-covid-surge-was-driven-by-delta-replacing-alpha-variantpaper-101622791336090.html

People were running from pillar to post to secure basic beds with oxygen set up, oxygen concentrators and even basic medicines. The national capital also suffered the brunt of the second wave as it led to crematoriums running out of space to bury the dead.The trajectory is now on the downward trend, however, many experts and the government have warned people to not let their guards down due to the impending third wave. As of Friday morning, the country has a total caseload of 28,574,350 and its death toll stands at 340,702.On June 2, a report by India's largest public sector bank, the State Bank of India (SBI), suggested that the intensity of the third wave could be as severe as the second wave. In the five-page-long report, the bank said that the average duration of the third wave of the pandemic in the worst-hit countries is 98 days as against 108 days during the second wave.Delhi has been under lockdown since April 9 in view of the massive surge in Covid-19 cases.

04-06-2021||Delhi||Around 70% vaccines slots for 18-44 age group in Meerut booked by Delhi residents: Official||People living in Delhi and Haryana and booking slots for their second dose of the vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Meerut, district immunisation officer Praveen Gautam claimed, news agency ANI reported on Friday. "Around 70% slots of Covaxin's second dose for the 18-44 age group have been booked by people from Delhi," Gautam said, according to ANI. “We're discouraging them,” he added.Many were able to book their slots in the initial period of the third phase of the immunisation drive but it has met with hiccups due to the acute shortage of the vaccines against Covid-19. Several states, including Delhi and Maharashtra, have suspended their immunisation drives for the people in the age group of 18-44 citing a shortage of doses.The central government opened the immunisation drive for all above 18 on May 1 in the third phase.On Wednesday, the Delhi high court issued notice to the Centre on two pleas to make the second dose of both vaccines against Covid-19, Covaxin and Covishield, available in the national capital.One of the petitions pending in the high court was moved by a lawyer, Ashish Virmani, who received the first dose of Covaxin on May 3 and since May 29 has been unable to book a slot for receiving the second jab which has to be taken within six weeks of the first.Subsequently, Virmani also travelled to Meerut, which around 98km away, to receive the second dose of the vaccine, advocate Pallav Mongia, representing Virmani, told the court during the hearing.The court also pulled up the Delhi government and gave an earful about not ensuring the availability of vaccine doses. "Why did you (Delhi government) start it (vaccination) if you were not sure you can provide the second dose also? You should have stopped," the court while hearing the petitions."You opened so many vaccination centres everywhere with so much pomp and splendour and now you say you don't know when the second dose stock would be available," it also said.Meanwhile, Justice Rekha Palli has issued a notice to the Delhi government and sought its stand on whether it can provide the second dose of Covaxin to those who got the first jab, before the expiry of the incubation period of six weeks between the two doses.The court will resume the hearing on the petitions on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/around-70-vaccines-slots-for-18-44-age-group-in-meerut-booked-by-delhi-residents-official-101622776722572.html

04-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Reopened for business||This afternoon the kiosk is booming, as always, with the “deck-level” sound of singer Prahlad Badhana’s devotionals in praise of “Dev Narayan.” A few folks are standing by the counter, waiting for adrak chai (ginger tea). The glass jars are filled with mithais, laddus and biscuits. While swirls of dust caused by the passing cars on the kachchi sadak (unmetalled road) are settling down on this chai shack, here in Gurugram’s Sector 35.It seems like any afternoon of the pre-pandemic era. “But I’m in mask,” points out tea man Rajesh Kumar. So are the customers.“Nahin nahin, even our noses are properly covered,” he clarifies, laughing, on this WhatsApp video chat, as he details the ambiance of the place.In his 30s, Mr Kumar is a rare fellow showing no anxiety about our pandemic-ridden lives.“I’m not stressed,” he insists, but with no cockiness in his voice, as if respectful of the feeling of helplessness lurking in the air.Not that he hasn’t suffered due to the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Kumar’s stall was shut down for a month as the Delhi region reeled under the crushing second wave. His earnings stopped. He returned to his village in Rajasthan.“I accepted the situation,” he says, noting, “I would have felt differently if the government had closed only my stall.”Mr Kumar came back a week ago (all his family remain Covid-free) and reopened the stall three days back—the lockdown in the Millennium City has been relaxed. Since the stall is surrounded by factories and warehouses, “my customers consist of labourers, taxi drivers and courier wale”. These are people who can’t work from home, and come to him for chai breaks between their work shifts.It was like a jungle here when he set up the stall a decade ago, he informs. The office block at the back of his stall used to be a dense cluster of trees. Mr Kumar’s recollections of earlier times suggest that the surrounding region has dramatically transformed. Probably the only thing that seems to have stayed unchanged is his tea shop, along with its wooden shelves and glass jars and chipped kettle (which he does replace with new ones regularly).One day, when the pandemic recedes, you ought to drop by Mr Kumar to enjoy his company, his earthy chai, and his stall (this reporter has experienced the place in the pre-pandemic era).The stall would serve daily from 5.30am to 10pm, but now the opening hours are from 9am to 3pm. After which Mr Kumar walks to his room in nearby Narsinghpur village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-reopened-for-business-101622765564405.html
04-06-2021||Delhi||Sisodia flags jab shortage, says Centre has no concrete plan to manage Covid||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday criticised the BJP-led Centre’s Covid-19 management and said the Union government didn’t have any “concrete plan”, as he flagged vaccine shortages across the country despite a ₹35,000 crore allocation in the Union budget.Sisodia was responding to BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra’s press conference earlier in the day, where he alleged that Covid-19 death figures in the Capital were underrecorded.“It is evident that Sambit Patra and the BJP are neither concerned about the shortage of vaccines nor a potential third wave. He only went on abusing [Delhi chief minister] Arvind Kejriwal in his press conference. It shows that the BJP has no concrete Covid management plan. I was hoping that he [Patra] would share information about the Centre approving new vaccines, or that he would shed light on the budget allocation of ₹36,000 crore for vaccines. But he did not...,” said Sisodia.“This is the BJP’s new tactic — blame Kejriwal for everything. People in the country want vaccines, they don’t want to hear baseless rants about Kejriwal. People are asking the BJP why they sell vaccines to other countries. Were they clueless about a Covid-19 wave? Where have you spent ₹36,000 crore meant for vaccines? Where are the vaccines? Why are vaccine centres being forced to be suspended across countries? Why does the private sector have so much stock?... [The BJP] leadership should tell their leaders to focus on vaccines and Covid-19 management, instead of wasting time on using filthy language against Kejriwal. BJP should also accept that the country’s vaccine programme is in a mess because of them,” he added.The BJP on Thursday asked the AAP government in Delhi for a white paper on issues related to Covid-19, asking if the number of deaths was “fudged” to keep the official tally down.BJP spokesperson Patra hit out at Kejriwal over the number of “unaccounted” deaths, citing a media report that the MCDs issued 34,750 death certificates for April and May while the official Covid tally for the period was 13,201. “We want to hold the AAP accountable for what has happened,” Patra said.“Delhi’s fatality rate of 2.9% is more than double the overall national rate of 1.3%, he said. Did you fudge death numbers...,” Patra said, addressing Kejriwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sisodia-flags-jab-shortage-says-centre-has-no-concrete-plan-to-manage-covid-101622765266799.html
04-06-2021||Delhi||Case count below 500 for the 1st time since mid-March, less than 50 deaths||Delhi’s daily Covid-19 tally dipped below 500 cases for the first time since mid-March, while deaths of the infection also dropped to a 45-day low, as the Capital continued to recover from the fourth surge of the coronavirus. Data from the state government’s daily health bulletin showed that the Covid-19 test positivity has been below for 5% for two weeks.The city added 487 new infections on Thursday, the fewest since March 16, when Delhi logged 425 infections.The seven-day average of cases, known as case trajectory, continued to drop sharply, falling to 768 on Thursday, the lowest since the last week of March.The test positivity rate, a crucial metric to gauge the spread of an infection, stayed below 1% in the city for the fourth straight day as well. The city recorded a positivity rate of 0.61%.Positivity rate is a crucial metric as experts say it shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when a dropping positivity rate is coupled with decreasing new cases, it indicates that the spread of the virus is reducing within the community. Tracking a region’s positivity rate serves as a good barometer for whether cases are going to increase or decrease in the coming days.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control. In Delhi, this number has been below the threshold for 14 days now.With 1.4 million cases recorded in Delhi so far, experts said there may not be a huge surge in cases in the city for at least six months, even as the city is in the process of adding beds and oxygen capacity in preparation for the third surge.“I don’t think that there will be another surge in infections at least for the next six months; a lot of the susceptible people were infected during the current surge. There isn’t much of a susceptible pool left in the city to drive more infection,” said Dr Puneet Mishra, professor in the department of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Over 1k black fungus cases in Delhi: JainAt least 89 patients in the national capital have died of mucormycosis so far, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said, on Thursday, adding that there have been at least 1,044 cases of the fungal infection in the city after the April-May surge in Covid-19 cases.“There is also a severe shortage of Amphotericin-B,” said Jain, referring to the only last-line antifungal medicine that can effectively treat mucormycosis, which is commonly known as ‘black fungus’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/case-count-below-500-for-the-1st-time-since-mid-march-less-than-50-deaths-101622764732025.html
04-06-2021||Delhi||No curbs on Ramdev, he’s entitled to his opinion: HC||The Delhi high court on Thursday refused to restrain yoga instructor Ramdev from making any statements against allopathy or in favour of Patanjali’s Coronil kit, saying he was entitled to his opinion under free speech laws.A single-judge bench of Justice C Hari Shankar was hearing a suit filed by Delhi Medical Association (DMA), accusing Ramdev of falsely representing Coronil as a cure for Covid-19 and spreading misinformation about modern medicine, or allopathy. The court issued summons, advised Ramdev not to speak about the efficacy of modern medicine until the next hearing, but refused to pass a restraining order without going through his formal reply.It said that “considerable time has passed since the passing of allegedly injurious statements” and added that “the allopathic profession was not so fragile”.Ramdev’s counsel, senior advocate Rajiv Nayyar, told the court that his client has already retracted his remarks made against doctors on May 22. “Then tell your client to not make any statements…I have no objection to him making statements on Coronil… ” the court said as Nayyar urged the judge to not make this a part of the order. Ramdev has three weeks to file his reply.The court said that DMA should file a public interest litigation instead of a suit, and that the yoga guru’s statements are covered under freedom of speech and expression.“If I feel some science is fake…Tomorrow I feel homeopathy is fake...Do you mean they will file a suit against me?...It is public opinion. I do not think your allopathic profession is so fragile,” the court said. “It is an opinion…. Any case founded on prayer for blocking statements has to be tested on (the) anvil of Article 19(1)(a)… There is a right…Terminology may be offensive,” the court observed.Senior advocate Rajiv Datta, appearing for DMA, argued that Ramdev’s statement affects doctors as Coronil does not cure Covid-19, and it is misleading. He claimed a token damage of ₹1 from him saying that it was a suit for civil rights of the doctors.The judge said he was “least concerned” with the association’s argument that Ramdev was a powerful person with a huge following. “Ramdev is a person who doesn’t have faith in allopathy. He believes everything can be cured by yoga and Ayurveda. He may be right or wrong. … You people should rather be spending time to find a cure for the pandemic instead of wasting the court’s time,” the judge remarked.Dutta also submitted that the Ayush ministry had made a statement that Coronil was not a cure for Covid-19 and could not be advertised as such, and had also asked Patanjali to give details, after which Ramdev said that it was an immunity booster.DMA’s counsel further claimed that Patanjali had made ₹25 crore from Coronil sales after it was touted as a cure for Covid. To this the court said, “Is he (Ramdev) to be blamed for people buying Coronil?”The matter will be next heard on July 13.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-curbs-on-ramdev-he-s-entitled-to-his-opinion-hc-101622764028341.html

However, no action has been taken against these plants; instead, they have been allowed to pollute with a total disregard for the health of citizens,” Rai said.He added, “We hope that the Supreme Court will take the necessary steps and direct closure of these plants on an urgent basis.”Rai said the compliance timelines given to these thermal plants by the Union ministry of power were revised to December 2019 from 2018.

Her family was not in the city.The suspects were spotted on footage from CCTV cameras installed in and around the residential complex, which has 12 apartments, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (south-east) RP Meena said a case of house trespass and theft has been registered at the New Friends Colony police station, and several teams have been tasked to nab the suspects. When contacted, Ahlawat declined to comment.A senior police officer associated with the case said the burglary came to light when Ahlawat woke up around 5.30am and found crockery and silver missing from the kitchen.The kitchen window’s latch was bent, indicating that the robbers made their way in through it. Ahlawat informed the police about the incident, following which a crime spot inspection team and forensic experts reached her house.“The boundary wall of the building is close to the railway tracks. Ahlawat’s apartment was locked from inside. The suspects scaled the boundary wall and entered the house. The involvement of an insider cannot be ruled out,” said an officer.As per the contents of an FIR registered on Ahlawat’s complaint, apart from the silverware, the thieves stole nearly ₹20,000 in cash, two briefcases containing court papers and cheque books, some locker keys, and a pair of sports shoes.The apartment where the burglary took place is several metres away from the main entry and exit gate of the residential complex where two security guards were on night duty. “They did not see or hear anything because of the distance,” an officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/advocates-friends-colony-west-home-robbed-of-cash-silverware-101622759662695.html
04-06-2021||Delhi||‘No arbitrary arrests of medicine buyers’: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Thursday clarified that it has not asked the city police to indiscriminately arrest people buying medicines, oxygen cylinders and essentials for personal use, saying that the “ idea is not to harass the general public”.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh asked Delhi Police to sensitise its force on the guidelines for booking someone of hoarding and black marketing. The court also asked the amicus curiae to go through various FIRs and list out ones in which no offence of hoarding and black marketing was being made out.“Please sensitise your force. The idea is not to harass the general public… You should internally have some guidelines.. what constitutes hoarding and black marketing… It is only those cases where there is hoarding or black marketing, action can legitimately be taken,” the court said.“Amicus and his team of volunteers may examine the same and pick out cases where according to their understanding no offence is made out since it is represented before us that they have been unfairly booked,” the court added.The order comes while hearing the suo motu contempt proceedings which said that independent contempt action would be taken against all such people indulging in hoarding equipment or medicines or selling the same at prices above the MRP. The court issued notices to all the people named in over 40 FIRs pursuant to its May 2 order.During the hearing, DCP (legal) Rajesh Deo of the Delhi police assured that he would take steps in accordance with the court’s suggestion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/no-arbitrary-arrests-of-medicine-buyers-delhi-hc-101622758922454.html

04-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh tops UTs in achieving sustainable development goals||Chandigarh has emerged as the top union territory in the third edition of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) India Index 2020–21. In the SDG Index released by NITI Aayog in Delhi on Thursday, Kerala with 75 marks out of 100 topped among the states and Chandigarh with 79 marks led among the UTs in terms of sustainable developments goals achieved. Chandigarh’s overall performance has also improved – from 70% marks in 2019 to 79% in 2020. Since its launch in 2018, the index has been documenting and ranking the progress made by states and union territories towards achieving the sustainable development goals. These were adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030.From covering 13 goals with 62 indicators in its first edition in 2018, the third edition comprises 16 Goals on 115 quantitative indicators, with a qualitative assessment on Goal 17. Tweeting about Chandigarh’s performance, UT administrator VP Singh Badnore said, “Commendable effort by the citizens, officers, counsellors and NGOs who are actively involved in ensuring the overall development of Chandigarh.”Where UT fared better than the restThe City Beautiful continues to be on the top in the country in “providing quality education”. It has the lowest dropout rate, highest gross enrolment ratio and best language proficiency in the country. 100% of its schools have access to basic infrastructure, such as electricity and drinking water. The enrolment rate in elementary education improved from 82.7% to 85.78% between 2019 and 2020. For higher secondary, it was 81.55% and higher education at 50%. Average dropout rate, which was zero in 2019, increased to 4.52%.Among UTs, Chandigarh was the best in achieving “zero hunger” by meeting the 100% coverage target under the National Food Security Act. With 99% marks, the city was best in “clean water and sanitation”. It achieved 100% target for individual household toilets constructed under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) and all city schools have separate toilets for girl students. Also performing best in “life on land”, Chandigarh increased its forest cover from 18.91% to 19.32% and tree cover from 8.77% to 22.34% between 2019 and 2020, say the Niti Aayog Report. Poor performance With the crime rate against women nearly doubling between 2019 and 2020, Chandigarh was one of the worst performers in achieving the “gender equality” goal. In 2019, there were 59.8 crimes against women per 1,00,000 female population, which increased to 95.20 in 2020. In contrast, Puducherry’s crime rate against women is 12.1. Murders per 1,00,000 population increased from 1.32 to 2.20 and cases under Prevention of Corruption Act and Indian Penal Code per 10,00,000 population increased by four times from 1.10 to 4.24. In industrial development as well, the city was among those on the bottom of the list. Remarkably, it scored zero for ease of doing business. Manufacturing employment nearly halved from 15.15% to 8.47% from the previous year.The city fared poorly in achieving “climate action” goals. While Lakshadweep had 100% renewable energy out of total installed generating capacity, Chandigarh’s figure was 69%. CO2 saved from LED bulbs per 1,000 population for Chandigarh stands at 48 tonnes, which is even lower than Delhi’s 67.57 tonnes, while Lakshadweep’s is 309.48 tonnes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-tops-uts-in-achieving-sustainable-development-goals-101622753473397.html

While the Covid cases had started coming down after touching the all-time high of 2,612 on May 10, the deaths had remained in double digits for three straight weeks until the figure came down to nine on June 1.Among those who died on Thursday, three were from Mohali and one from Chandigarh, while Panchkula reported no casualty for the second time in the past three days.On the other hand, there was a slight rise in the Covid-19 cases with 366 people testing positive in the tricity, against 337 on Wednesday.Only Chandigarh saw the cases dropping further, from 134 a day ago to 111 on Thursday. Mohali’s cases rose from 153 to 191 and in Panchkula 64 infections were reported, up from 50 the day before. On a positive note, the active cases in the tricity reduced from 4,204 on Wednesday to 3,994 on Thursday.The daily positivity rate – proportion of tests returning positive – was 4% in Chandigarh, 4.9% in Panchkula, but a tad higher in Mohali, at 6.9%.The latest fatalities took Chandigarh’s toll to 762, while the cases reached 60,399. A total of 1,135 patients are still under treatment in home isolation or at hospitals and 58,502 have been cured, a recovery rate of 96.8% - currently highest in the tricity.In Mohali, the cumulative cases and deaths stand at 67,035 and 978, respectively. As many as 2,243 people are still recuperating and 63,814 (95.19%) have recovered.With no death, Panchkula’s toll stayed at 352, but cases climbed to 29,879, of which 616 are active.‘Continue to exercise caution’“There was a significant decrease in Covid-19 cases for the last one month, but there was no proportionate drop in the number of deaths in the tricity. It is a good sign that the fatalities have started coming down, but people should take care not to lower their guard and continue to follow Covid appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER, Chandigarh.Dr VK Nagpal, UT joint director, health, said, “Our rapid response teams are working round the clock to assess the patient from the moment a positive report arrives. Even though cases have decreased, continued prompt response has helped people get hospital care sooner, which in turn has helped bring the mortality graph down too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tricitys-daily-covid-deaths-drop-to-four-lowest-in-seven-weeks-101622752693220.html

The duo, along with their accomplices, had gunned down the ASIs at Jagraon grain market on May 15.The two accused have been identified as Baljinder Singh alias Babbi of Moga’s Mahla Khurd village and Darshan Singh of Sahauli village in Ludhiana. They were carrying a cash reward of ₹2 lakh each on their heads. The Organised Crime Control Unit (OCCU) had nabbed them from Dabra of Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh on May 28 when they were planning to board a train to Maharashtra.After their arrest, a local court in Ludhiana sent them to 10-day police custody. Confirming the development senior superintendent of police (SSP) Jagraon Charanjit Singh Shoal said the duo was brought to Jagraon on police remand and questioning is on.As per police sources, the accused are associates of notorious gangster Jaipal Bhullar and cops are trying to trace the hideouts of the gangster through them. Police are also trying to ascertain how the accused had procured drugs and weapons used in the crime. Earlier on May 20, six aides of gangster Jaipal, including Darshan’s wife Satpal Kaur alias Noni, were arrested with a cache of weapons and ammunition. Punjab police chief Dinkar Gupta had stated that preliminary questioning of the suspects had revealed that Baljinder had come to Jagraon grain market in his mini-truck to pick Jaipal and Jassi and drop them at a hideout outside the state. Darshan had turned up at the spot with some clothes for the gangster and his associate. Gupta said the ASIs who were on duty confronted Baljinder on suspicion of drug smuggling following which Darshan opened fire from his .32 revolver.Darshan, Jaipal and Jassi then fled in their I-10 Hyundai car, while Baljinder drove off in his mini-truck and joined them after some time. They all fled towards Rajasthan. As per information, Darshan and Baljinder had been earlier convicted in two different murder cases. They had come in contact while serving the jail term. Darshan was granted remission while undergoing his sentence while Baljinder was released on bail by the high court. Darshan reportedly has two more criminal cases pending against him and was also involved in opium smuggling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/asis-killing-jagraon-police-bring-two-accused-on-police-remand-101622752453314.html

There is, however, no presumption that the law on the point will not be followed. It is not a case that the Tribunal needs to determine any question. Only issue is the compliance of well-established norms by the state authorities. Accordingly, the secretary, urban development, Government of Punjab and the commissioner, municipal corporation, Ludhiana, may look into the matter and take remedial measures as are found necessary, following due process of law,” the bench said.The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by the Council of Engineers seeking restitution of the green area of a public park (Mini Rose Garden) situated at Kidwai Nagar, near Industrial Area- A, Ludhiana and for injunction against commercialisation and concretisation of the park under the Smart City Mission. According to the applicants, “The Ludhiana Smart City Ltd. is developing Mini Rose Garden (land area around 3.50 Acres) under Smart city Mission with a budget of ₹3.48 crore of Public Funds.“Despite knowing the facts that park size is not big as compared to number of surrounding residents of densely populated localities (which is in core area of Ludhiana), situated very close to Industrial Area of Ludhiana, Ludhiana Smart City Ltd is going to commercialise and concretise the park by constructing buildings for indoor badminton court building, cafeteria, water fountains, concrete paths and parking with solid interlocking tiles in contrary to judgments as held by Supreme Court,” the plea said.The petitioners further stated, “Due to concretisation of parks and green belts, the rain water does not seep through preventing recharge of ground water. The concretisation causes an increase in temperature of the environment as it absorbs heat and cools down very slowly as compared to open earth surface and green areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ngt-directs-punjab-govt-to-look-into-plea-for-restitution-of-public-park-in-ludhiana-101622752333129.html

Vaccine doses were available in the state but they were being sold to private institutions instead of being given free of cost to the common man. A Covaxin dose costing the state ₹400 was being sold to private institutions at ₹1,060. The private hospitals were further selling the dose at ₹1,560,” alleged Sukhbir.“Rahul Gandhi had recently demanded free vaccines for all. He should now tell if he supports the Punjab government’s move to force the common man to pay ₹1,560 per dose,” said the Akali Dal chief.Flaying chief secretary Vinni Mahajan, Sukhbir alleged that she had “assumed the role of a marketing director of private institutions by tweeting that people should get themselves vaccinated at two private institutions.”Mahajan was not available for her comments. AAP, CONG hand in gloveOn rebel AAP MLAs Sukhpal Khaira, Jagdev Singh Kamalu and Pirmal Singh Khalsa joining the Congress, Sukhbir said: “This clearly shows that the Congress and the AAP are working hand in glove with each other.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhbir-seeks-hc-monitored-probe-into-punjab-govt-selling-jabs-to-private-hospitals-101622752153254.html

Both are absconding since the incident.The victim’s mother said that on Wednesday, her daughter, along with another girl from her class, had gone to purchase books. Few hours later, she returned home alone, profusely crying. The victim told her mother that when she and her friend were on the way to the market, they ran into the accused who offered them a lift in their car. Since the two were their classmates, the victim and her friend accepted the offer.After driving for some distance, the accused asked the victim’s friend to get off. Before the victim could gauge the situation, the accused locked the doors of the car and sped off with her. When they reached the entrance of Radha Swami Vatika in Sun City Colony, the accused stopped the car and one of them raped her. They then pushed her off the car and sped away. Inspector Rajinder Kaur of Khanna City 2 police station said that after recording the statement of the victim, a case under Section 376- D (rape which also include a clause of bearing the medical expenses and rehabilitation of the victim) and 354 (any man who assaults or uses criminal force to any woman) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered. Since the victim is a minor, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act has also been invoked. “Both the accused are minors and on the run. Efforts are on to nab them,” said the inspector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-2-minors-booked-for-raping-classmate-after-offering-her-lift-101622751973084.html
04-06-2021||Chandigarh||Online camps, hobby classes keeping Chandigarh kids engaged this summer break||As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to encumber the outdoor life for adults and minors alike, teachers and parents are adopting new ways to keep their wards occupied this summer vacation.In Chandigarh, most parents have put their faith in online hobby classes.Government schools in the city announced summer vacation on May 8 and are set to open soon. Several private schools stuck to their academic calendar and declared the break around May-end, while Vivek High School, Sector 38, pushed the date to June 14 based on the feedback from parents.With an aim to make the holidays interesting and productive for children, some schools are organising summer camps. Sweety Bahl, a teacher at DAV Sector 15, who has arranged for a week-long summer camp for the students, said, “The theme of the camp is the environment. Principal Anuja Sharma and the teachers are helping students learn skills like tie-dying with natural ingredients, making green terrariums and papier mache.”Similarly, St John’s High School in Sector 26 is holding coding classes for students, according to principal Kavita Das. “We have designed our holiday homework in such a way that students will have to apply their creative minds in preparing their projects,” she said.Hobby centres in the city have also taken to the online approach. Pracheen Kala Kendra has been holding online classes for dance and fine arts. Pracheen Kala Kendra secretary Sajal Koser said, “We are planning to start offline classes for students at the centre from June 10 onwards after discussion with their parents and checking the government’s guidelines. We are likely to hold online workshops for classical dance, music and fine arts from June 15 onwards.”Many parents, however, say that children are now averse to online classes after studying in the mode for over a year. Nitin Goyal, whose children study in a city-based school, said, “We have tried to get our kids involved in various online classes, including online karate, but they are more inclined towards Whatsapp calls with friends and online games.” He added that without any release of pent-up energy, kids are getting moodier and more irritable.Dr Adarsh Kohli, professor of clinical psychology at PGIMER, said, “Hobby classes are useful if chosen well as per the child’s interests and inclinations. It is a good change for the child from routine activities. Children are missing out on a productive period of their childhood and their social economical and psychological quotient is being neglected. The joys of learning, meeting, sharing and talking are not being experienced due to the pandemic and parents have to fill in these gaps.”Meanwhile, some schools are not holding any summer classes at all. Speaking about this, director of Strawberry Fields High School, Sector 26, Atul Khanna, said, “Our teachers have been working constantly since 2020, so we have decided to give them time-off to be with their families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/online-camps-hobby-classes-keeping-chandigarh-kids-engaged-this-summer-break-101622751793835.html
04-06-2021||Chandigarh||No drug case for years in at least 10 Sangrur villages||At Santpur village in Sangrur district’s Dirba block, no resident was booked in a drug case in the past 10 years. Sarpanch Lal Singh (55) says the village that shares border with Haryana has been drug-free as elders were more interested in sports, mainly wrestling and kabaddi. The youngsters only towed the line by engaging themselves in sports and other activities such as organising blood donation camps. According to police records, no drug case FIR was registered for years in Santpur, Nagakheri, Ratangarh Sindran, Nihalgarh, Ghanaur Jattan, Mardkheda, Bhaini Ganduan, Satoj, Khanpur Fakiran, and Maidevas villages. Hardeep Singh, husband of Ratangarh Sindran sarpanch Jaswinder Kaur, says no drug-related FIR was lodged since 2013 as the residents opposed drugs and women even stood up against the illicit liquor trade. “A woman whose husband used to drink alcohol smuggled from Haryana had informed the police years ago. The incident triggered awareness among women and they all stepped in to check illicit liquor and drug trade. People inform the police whenever they come across something fishy,” says Hardeep. Nirmal Singh, 38, a private school teacher, says education and reports of drug deaths in other parts of the state made people taking a stance to eradicate drugs. Khanpur Faqiran sarpanch Balveer Singh says the village’s youth club and panchayat members didn’t allow drugs in the village for years. “The village has a population of over 2,200 and all are against drugs. The youths spend their time in sports and agriculture,” added Balveer. Former sarpanch of Bhaini Ganduan Bikar Singh says there has been no drug case in the village for about a decade. “People support the panchayat. I have served as sarpanch and never tried to save anyone who violated the law. The residents never allow smugglers to enter the village,” he said. Charan Singh, husband of Satoj sarpanch Kiranpal Kaur, says villagers support the police drive to make the village drug-free. Dirba deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Mohit Agarwal says many villages haven’t seen a drug case for years. “We intensified the drive against drugs and got good response from panchayat members and residents,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-drug-case-for-years-in-at-least-10-sangrur-villages-101622751734399.html
04-06-2021||Chandigarh||A day before meeting Kharge panel, Capt brings Sukhpal Khaira, 2 other rebel AAP MLAs into Cong fold||The ruling Congress in Punjab got a shot in the arm when three rebel Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs, including former leader of opposition (LOP) Sukhpal Singh Khaira, Jagdev Singh Kamalu and Pirmal Singh Khalsa, joined the party on Thursday ahead of next year’s assembly polls in the state. The MLAs were welcomed into the party fold by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh minutes before he left for Delhi in a helicopter for a one-on-one meeting with three-member committee constituted by the Congress to resolve infighting in the Punjab unit. Amarinder’s wife, Patiala MP Preneet Kaur, was also present at the helipad where the three legislators met the chief minister and posed for photos which were posted on social media by the state Congress from its official handle promptly. “Chief Minister @Capt Amarinder Singh before leaving for Delhi today welcomed Sukhpal Singh Khaira, MLA and former leader of opposition and his two AAP MLA colleagues named Jagdev Singh Kamalu, MLA Maur, and Pirmal Singh Dhaula, MLA Bhadaur, into the party fold (sic),” the Punjab Congress tweeted. The three MLAs resigned from the membership of the state assembly. “Their resignations have been received in the speaker’s office,” an official of the state assembly said. The trio’s entry into the Congress, in a well-choreographed move timed with his meeting with the central team, is being seen as a boost for the chief minister. It could not have come at a more opportune moment for Amarinder, who, though, the tallest of the party in Punjab, is being openly targeted by a section of the Congress, particularly former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa, who are trying to paint a dismal picture of the party’s poll prospects. The AAP rebels’ entry has provided an opportunity to him to send out a message to the party leadership that he retains his appeal and can get leaders from rival parties. After the meeting, Amarinder said their induction has been approved by Congress president Sonia Gandhi. After joining the Congress, Khaira thanked Sonia and former party president Rahul Gandhi, besides heaping praise on Amarinder for his stand on the three farm laws. “Justice will definitely be delivered in the 2015 sacrilege and subsequent police firing incidents,” he said. He also termed his decision of joining the AAP a “political blunder”. However, not everyone in the Congress seems pleased with Khaira’s return to the party fold due to the ED raids at his premises three months ago and his sharp personal attacks against some party leaders, including the chief minister, earlier. While it is homecoming for Khaira, a two-time legislator from Bholath who first got elected to the state assembly as a candidate of the Congress in 2007, Kamalu and Khalsa are first timers. After quitting the Congress, Khaira had joined the AAP in 2015. He won the Bholath seat in 2017 and was later appointed LOP in the state assembly. However, he fell out with the party leadership after Arvind Kejriwal tendered an apology to Akali leader Bikram Majithia in a defamation case. When the party removed him as the leader of opposition, he, along with a few other AAP MLAs, rebelled and floated his separate Punjab Ekta Party (PEP). Khaira later contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Bathinda seat but lost. Amarinder in DelhiAmarinder, who has already reached Delhi, will meet the three-member committee comprising leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former MP Jai Prakash Agarwal at 11 am on Friday. On reaching the Capital, the CM went into a huddle with cabinet ministers Vijay Inder Singla and Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi, MPs Ravneet Singh Bittu, Manish Tewari and Gurjeet Singh Aujla and his advisers at Kapurthala House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/a-day-before-meeting-kharge-panel-capt-brings-sukhpal-khaira-2-other-rebel-aap-mlas-into-cong-fold-101622751733342.html

The case is now listed for June 7.Dr Kichhar, in his complaint, said that the derogatory statements made by Ramdev, who is a public figure, will create an atmosphere of panic and fear among the people against modern medicine. He added that “by spreading fear of allopathy, he has spread fear against Covid vaccination”.Bassi said in his complaint that “the so-called godman Baba Ramdev made false claims with his ayurvedic medicine, Coronil. He even called a press conference in this regard and claimed that he had tested the medicine on more than 200 people in collaboration with a private university. Later, he ran away from his statement and said that it was not a medicine, but an immunity booster”.“Now in this time of emergency, he is calling the doctors foolish and allopathy a pseudo science,” he added.The advocate has prayed that Ramdev be summoned and punished under Sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 276 (Sale of drug as a different drug or preparation) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 51 and 52 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.The doctor has urged the authorities to take strict legal action against Baba Ramdev under the Sedition Law, the Disaster Management Act, the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954, the Epidemic Act and other applicable laws, for damaging the reputation and the image of allopathy and its practitioners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-doc-lawyer-file-plaint-against-baba-ramdev-for-slander-101622751553104.html
04-06-2021||Chandigarh||Profiteering from pandemic: 80k vials already sold, officials now say it was one-time measure||A day after Hindustan Times report exposed how the Punjab government was minting money in the name of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) by selling Covaxin doses procured from its quota to the private hospitals, the state authorities on Thursday said that it was only a one-time measure. So far, 80,000 doses have been sold to private facilities, 30,000 of which went to a single hospital in Mohali, an official said, requesting anonymity. The government could have earned more than ₹5 crore from the sale of vaccines.The report created uproar with various opposition leaders, including Union minister of state Anurag Thakur, SAD chief Sukhbir Badal, Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal, taking on the Punjab government for “making profit from the pandemic”. Nodal officer for the vaccination and senior IAS officer Vikas Garg, who on Wednesday had justified the state government’s decision saying profit will be used only to buy vaccines, said it was only a one-time measure and no private hospital will get the doses henceforth. “The decision of providing vaccine doses to private hospitals was taken on public demand,” he added. However, Hindustan Times has learnt that it was a well-thought-out move to create CSR fund by selling the vaccine procured at ₹400 for ₹1,060. The report also highlighted how private hospitals were further charging at least ₹1,560 per dose from the customers. An official privy to the developments, requesting anonymity, said the ‘one-time-measure’ statement came after discussions among senior health functionaries who were the brain behind the idea of generating funds from vaccines. HT has learnt that the vaccine was provided to some private hospitals on Thursday as well against the advance payments made by them. Earlier in the day, Union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur accused the Punjab government of “black-marketing”. “Punjab has shown a careless and callous attitude towards the people of the state by charging four times from people for the jab. Why should an individual pay over ₹3,120 for two doses when the Centre is providing vaccines free to the state government. Instead of facilitating the vaccination process, Punjab government is looting the people amid the pandemic,” he said. “Will Rahul Gandhi investigate why vaccines have been supplied to Congress cronies who are charging a ‘pandemic premium’ and indulging in black-marketing instead of saving the lives of the poor? And does he have the courage to question his own party government in Punjab,” Thakur said. Former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal also shared the HT report on her Twitter handle, saying, “Amarinder government created an artificial shortage of Covid vaccine in government hospitals and then sold the vials to private hospitals at a premium. Earlier, he handed over ventilators to private hospitals, which charged hefty fee from patient. Profiteering from people’s misery, how low can this government fall!” Reached out by HT, health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu distanced himself from the government’s controversial decision to sell the state’s vaccine quota to private hospitals on premium. “ Only nodal officer for vaccination Vikas Garg and chief secretary Vini Mahajan can reply on vaccinations being sold to private hospitals. I can only tell you about the testing, number of cases and many other things,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/profiteering-from-pandemic-80k-vials-already-sold-officials-now-say-it-was-one-time-measure-101622751433123.html

Director school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “Based on the judgment, we will give the private schools some time to upload their balance sheets online. Action will be taken against those who don’t comply.”Parents’ body welcomes movePresident of the Chandigarh Parents Association Nitin Goyal said, “We had been waiting since 2018 for this to happen. Now schools will be able to show how much money they made during the pandemic and this will help parents, who are demanding fee waivers for the 2021-2022 academic session.”While most schools are rallying behind the ISA’s stance on the issue, the head of a private school, wishing not to be named, said many schools were transparent with their dealings and wouldn’t mind uploading their balance sheets online.The Punjab and Haryana high court on May 28 had upheld the Chandigarh administration’s order mandating private unaided schools to upload balance sheets on their websites. The ISA, a body of 78 private schools, and Kabir Education Society, Chandigarh, had moved the high court last year, challenging various provisions of the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act, 2016, as extended to the UT. The law was adopted by the UT in 2018.The plea was filed after the UT administration had issued show-cause notices to the schools, asking as to why penalties should not be imposed against them for not uploading balance sheets for the last financial year. The schools had also challenged the constitution of the Fee Regulatory Authority, arguing that asking them to upload balance sheets violated their rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/uploading-balance-sheets-online-chandigarh-school-body-to-approach-sc-101622750893025.html

Apple growers have suffered losses to the tune of ₹300 crore so far, besides the damages to the stone fruits.Inclement weather conditions this time have dashed the hopes of farmers, who were expecting good returns after a lean season last year that was adversely impacted by the Covid-induced lockdown. High moisture content has already led to outbreak of many fungal diseases in orchards, including deadly scab that emerged after two decades in 2019. “Weather this time is quite unpredictable. Jagged hailstones hammered the crops between Shilaru and Matiana on Wednesday evening. Hardly any crop is left now. Orchards bore the brunt of spring snow in April and the damages were way too intense,” said Devender Sarswati, a retired government official who owns an apple orchard in Shilaru in Theog subdivision. The hailstones extensively damaged the anti-hail nets used to cover the apple plants. Untimely snowfall in the last week of April and repeated hailstorms have broken the backbone of apple farmers, said Harish Chauhan, president of Fruit, Vegetable and Flower Growers Association. He said the government pegged the crop losses at only ₹250 crore whereas the intensity of the damage was much high. “The government only assesses crop losses. The farmers never get compensated,” he claimed. “We don’t have enough funds to compensate the farmers. The damage report will be sent to the central government,” said Himachal horticulture minister Mahender Singh Thakur. He also expressed serious concern over the insurance companies not compensating the farmers for their losses. The horticulture department will hand over the cases of the insurance companies to special investigating units, he said. “If required, we will get it investigated by central agencies,” he added. The ₹60,000 crore apple economy is the mainstay of over two lakh farming families in Himachal Pradesh. Apples are mainly grown in Shimla, Mandi, Kullu, Kinnaur and a few regions of Chamba , Sirmaur and Lahaul and Spiti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/losses-mount-for-apple-growers-in-himachal-as-hailstones-continue-to-batter-orchards-101622750714255.html

The court also directed that the prayer for interim relief will be considered after the reply is filed by the respondents. A division bench comprising Justice Ravi Malimath and Justice Jyotsna Rewal Dua passed these orders on a public interest litigation, wherein the petitioner has alleged that the toll plaza at Sanwara is illegal and contrary to the National Highway Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, which provide that no toll plaza can be established in the same section within a distance of 60km, whereas other toll plazas are situated at Chandimandir in Panchkula and Parwanoo in Solan, which are within 60km range from Sanwara plaza. He has also challenged the completion certificate issued to GR Infra Projects by the NHAI and has alleged that major part of the construction work of flyover and its underpass at Kumarhatti, Saproon and near Timber Trail Resort in Parwanoo were not complete and the toll was being levied before completion of work. He has also claimed that the toll road has not been maintained properly and part of the stretch is accident prone, as there is no proper barricading of the roads which join the toll road from the towns and villages along the national highway. The petitioner has also prayed to quash the contract, construction, completion certificate issued to GR Infra and scrap the notification fixing the toll charges payable by the vehicles crossing the Sanwara toll plaza. The court in its previous hearing had stayed the collection of toll tax at the Sanwara plaza till June 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/toll-collection-at-sanwara-plaza-himachal-hc-seeks-reply-from-centre-state-nhai-101622750713100.html

04-06-2021||Chandigarh||Lashkar offshoot behind fatal attack on BJP leader in Tral: Police||People’s Anti Fascist Front (PAFF), a previously unknown group, has claimed the responsibility for the killing of the chairman of Tral municipal committee Rakesh Pandita. In a statement to local media, PAFF accused Pandita, a BJP leader, of creating a “network of informers, drug traffickers and immoral activities”. The PAFF said it was “keeping an eye on the activities of these forces”.Police said PAFF appears to be a front of militant organisations active in south Kashmir and added that security forces have cordoned off the attack scene and launched a search operation to nab the assailants. The police said that PAFF is the name created as a cover to Lashkar and other groups active in Kashmir.Pandita was shot dead in Jammu and Kashmir’s Tral on Wednesday night when he was visiting a friend’s house, the police said and added his personal security officers (PSOs) were not accompanying him when he was attacked. The police cited violation of the standard operating procedure and said Pandita, 56, should have avoided going to his native village without his security cover, which was provided to him along with a secured accommodation in Srinagar. The police are investigating why the PSOs were not accompanying Pandita and said action could be taken against his security officers.“He (Rakesh Pandita) had gone to Jammu and left PSOs in Kashmir. After returning from Jammu, he went to Tral without PSOs to meet his friend Mustaq Bhat. The investigations are going on,” said a senior police officer.After the killing, police have issued fresh instructions to political workers and leaders not to move without PSOs.Pandita was shot at around 10.15pm, a police spokesperson said. He added that his friend Mushtaq Ahmad’s daughter also suffered injuries in the shooting and was hospitalised in a critical condition.At least 12 local bodies and panchayat members have been killed since elections at the grassroots level were held in 2018. The members were promised security by the government, but many alleged that no security is being provided to them. In March, two councillors and one PSO were killed when militants entered the municipal council office in Sopore. Later, the police claimed to have arrested people involved in the attack.“We were promised adequate security by the government, but unfortunately, only people who are affiliated with the BJP or the parties which are close to New Delhi have been given security,” said a councillor from Sopore.BJP spokesman Altaf Thakur, who is also BDC member from Tral, said in the last three years, 17 BJP workers have been killed in different militant attacks in Kashmir. “Most of the councillors and panchayat members have been provided security. These attacks won’t deter us from carrying out political activities.”Meanwhile, former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti condemned the killing, saying such senseless acts of violence have only brought misery. “Shocked to hear that BJP leader Rakesh Pandit has been shot dead by militants. These senseless acts of violence have brought only misery to J&K [Jammu and Kashmir]. My condolences to the family and may his soul rest in peace (sic),” she tweeted.Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha echoed her. “Saddened to hear about the terror attack on the Councillor Shri Rakesh Pandita at Tral, Pulwama. I strongly condemn the attack. My condolences to the bereaved family in this time of grief,” he tweeted. Sinha added that “terrorists will never succeed in their nefarious designs” and those responsible for such heinous acts shall be brought to justice. Several senior leaders of J&K Pradesh Congress committee have also strongly condemned the killing of Pandita.Jammu mourns Pandita’s deathPall of gloom descended on Roop Nagar when the mortal remains of Rakesh Pandita were consigned to flames here on Thursday. Pandita’s funeral pyre was lit by his son Paras Pandita. BJP MP Jugal Kishore Sharma, J&K BJP president Ravindra Raina and former MLC Vikram Randhawa were also present. The Kashmiri Pandit community was in a state of shock over the “barbaric killing”, while BJP MP Jugal Kishore Sharma blamed Pakistan for the murder. Pandita is survived by his mother Sharika Pandita, wife Aparna Pandita, son Paras Pandita, besides two brothers Sanjay Pandita and King Pandita. Sanjay said his brother kept democracy alive in Kashmir. “When elections were announced in Kashmir, many parties refused to contest, but my brother contested the election and won. Even though the situation in Kashmir was not good, he used to go to his area so that the problems of the people could be addressed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lashkar-offshoot-behind-fatal-attack-on-bjp-leader-in-tral-police-101622750653051.html

Aman and Prabhjit’s third accomplice Samsher Singh, alias Shera, received a bullet injury in his stomach.Facing eleven criminal cases, including three of murder bid, Landa, a resident of Harike town, had fled to Canada in 2017, said police. He is facing cases under the Arms Act and the NDPS Act in Tarn Taran, Moga and Ferozepur districts, and Chandigarh. Last case against Landa was registered under attempt to murder at Kot Isse Khan police station of Moga district in September 2016.Landa’s name emerged after Tarn Taran police arrested vice-president of a Patti Truck Union Malkit Singh, alias Laddu, who is also an associate of Patti Congress MLA Harminder Singh Gill, for conspiring the Patti killings. Police said Landa demanded ₹20 lakh ransom from a Patti-based person. Aman Fauji, who was known to that person, had refused to give ransom. Holding a grudge, Landa hired notorious criminal Preet Sekhon for executing Aman Fauji and his aides. Sekhon allegedly executed the crime at Landa’s behest, police said. “We have written to the Union government for pressing the Interpol to issue a red-corner notice against Landa, who is presently staying in Canada. A lookout circular has already been issued against him. We will continue to pursue the case until Landa is extradited,” said a senior police official, who didn’t wish to be named. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale confirmed the development. He said efforts to nab Preet Sekhon were also on.Officials said police have also issued a lookout notice against Sekhon, who is facing five criminal cases, including three of murder. He was accused of killing his sister and her mother-in-law in 2011. He had also allegedly killed a bouncer in Amritsar last year. Sekhon had claimed responsibility for the Patti shootout on his Facebook page.Congman held for sheltering accusedPolice on Thursday arrested one Rajwinder Singh, alias Raj Sarpanch, of Talwandi Budh Singh village for sheltering the accused, including Preet Sekhon. The SSP said it came to light that Raj sheltered Sekhon and his aides after the shootout. The pistol used for executing the crime was also kept in Raj’s home. The pistol has been recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/patti-shootout-cops-start-process-to-extradite-gangster-lakhbir-from-canada-101622750413125.html

Amritsar police used to call paramilitary forces on the Operation Bluestar anniversary every year after a clash took place between radical Sikh activists and Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) task force at the Golden Temple complex in 2014, in which several people were injured. However, the central forces have not been called since 2019.The movement of the cops in uniform and civvies around the Golden Temple complex and markets leading to it has been intensified.

The survey involves testing the blood serum to determine the presence of antibodies against the coronavirus. “The samples will be sent to the lab at the King George’s Medical University,” said a senior health official in Lucknow.In September last, the state health department had conducted serological survey in eleven districts including Meerut, Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Kaushambi, Prayagraj, Moradabad, Ghaziabad, Baghpat and Agra to understand development of antibodies among population.“The tests are conducted on samples from the population selected via sampling techniques,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, Association of International Doctors. If the samples are detected with sufficiently high quantities of antibody in people during sero sampling, it suggests that those people have been infected in the past.The result of the sero sampling done in September last year suggested about one in five of the 16,000 people tested showed prevalence of antibodies against the Sars-Cov-2 pathogen that causes the Covid-19 disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/1000-samples-to-be-collected-in-lucknow-during-serosurvey-101622748672319.html

04-06-2021||Delhi||WhatsApp gaining consent by ‘trick’: Govt||The Union government on Thursday told the Delhi High Court that WhatsApp has “unleashed its digital prowess” by obtaining “trick consent” from its users with notifications asking them to accept the new termsThe government also told the court about WhatsApp’s “game plan” to get the users to accept its updated privacy policy before India’s Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill becomes a law.In the plea before the court, the government sought that WhatsApp be “desisted” from any action of “pushing notifications” related to its updated 2021 privacy policy. It also sought directions to WhatsApp to place on record the number of times such notifications were being pushed every day basis, and its conversion rate (notification to acceptance of the updated 2021 privacy policy by users).The affidavit came on a hearing of several pleas challenging WhatsApp’s new privacy policy, which, according to the firm, has come into effect from May 15. The matter was not heard on Thursday as the bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh did not assemble.“WhatsApp is indulging in anti-user practices by obtaining ‘trick consent’ from the users for its updated privacy policy. It is submitted that millions of WhatsApp existing users, those who have not accepted the updated 2021 privacy policy are being bombarded with notifications on everyday basis,” the Centre said in the affidavit.“WhatsApp has unleashed its digital prowess to the unsuspecting existing users and would like to force them to accept the updated privacy policy by flashing such notifications at a regular interval. The game plan is very clear, i.e., to transfer the entire existing user base committed to updated 2021 privacy policy before the PDP Bill becomes the law,” the affidavit added.The company pushed back the deadline for its contentious new privacy policy launched this January. The updated policy will allow WhatsApp to share data about users’ interactions with business accounts with its parent company, Facebook.The social media intermediary is also at loggerheads with the government over the implementation of new IT rules, and has challenged them in the High Court on the grounds that it makes them identify the first originator of all information.It has claimed that the provision of “traceability” in the new IT Rules is a violation of the Right to Privacy, according to Indian law.WhatsApp, in a May 17 hearing on pleas challenging its privacy policy, told the Delhi High Court that it may delete user accounts for not accepting new privacy policy, but would do it in a phased manner by gradually restricting services while persuading users to come on board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/whatsapp-gaining-consent-by-trickgovt-101622747126017.html

I humbly ask your kind self to accept this and relieve me of my moral dilemma, pain and sorrow for the sacrilege of the sacred service we have taken oath to serve and protect,” Nag said on Thursday in Mysuru, about 125 kms from Bengaluru.A 2014 batch officer, Nag’s resignation has rekindled the debate against the functioning of the district administration of Mysuru.Nag made an apparent reference to Rohini Sindhuri, the Mysuru deputy collector, who has been at the receiving end of criticism from other political leaders including the Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Thursday said that he had no knowledge of Nag’s resignation and said that he would comment once he gets all the information.Nag said that she is sending her resignation to the chief secretary.The IAS officer, who has served in various positions in different districts in her tenure, said that she was being targeted and “humiliated” time and again.She said that despite getting most of the work done in her corporation limits, there were calls being made to her office citing dereliction of duty in preparation of the Covid-19 pandemic in the city.“They are meting out insults and spreading misinformation. No one should work with so much arrogance,” she said, making another apparent reference to Sindhuri. “I cannot work in this suffocating environment,” she added.Sindhuri was also the target of her colleagues from other districts when at least 24 persons died due to shortage of Oxygen in Chamarajanagar, about 40 kms from Mysuru.Denying all allegations, Sindhuri on Thursday said, “It is untrue that there was any harassment from me and none has been mentioned even in the statement issued by Smt Shilpa Nag”. She said that her entire focus has been towards managing Covid-19 alone. The Mysuru DC even alleged that Nag had stopped attending Covid-19 reviews.“The Mysuru City Corporation was submitting unsigned and contradictory ward wise Covid-19 figures on new cases, deaths and active cases. I had ordered that same be rectified,” Sindhuri said.She added that by asking Covid care centres to be opened and other pandemic related work “constitutes harassment by any stretch of imagination”.She even said that Nag is yet to furnish details of CSR coming in from private companies towards the pandemic and other works.“It is for everyone to note that over the last 10 days Smt Shilpa has been issuing statements to press and media against the District Administration. A conduct not expected from a Mysuru City Commissioner,” Sindhuri added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/humiliated-mysuru-civic-body-chief-resigns-101622747473638.html
04-06-2021||Other||K’taka announces 2nd financial relief; extends curbs till June 14||Bengaluru The Karnataka government on Thursday extended the ongoing lockdown by one more week and also announced a second financial package. The restrictions will remain in force till 6am on June 14. Announcing the extension, chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Thursday in Bengaluru said, “Even though there is a decline in Covid-19 infections in the existing situation, the spread of the (corona) virus has continued. Based on the advice of medical experts, the existing guidelines and strict restrictions in force at present, it has been reviewed as suitable and decided to be extended till 6 am on June 14.” Besides extending the lockdown, the CM also kept his promise of providing a second financial package by announcing a relief of ₹500 crore. He announced a financial relief of ₹3,000 for power loom weavers which would benefit 59,000 such units that would cost the state exchequer ₹35 crores. “Unorganized workers of film and television Industry will get ₹3,000 relief. This will benefit 22,000 registered workers and will incur an expenditure of (Rs) 6.6 crores,” a statement by the chief minister’s office (CMO) said. Others who are likely to benefit are fishermen, priests Asha and Anganwadi workers among other sections. Yediyurappa had already announced a financial package of ₹1,250 crore last month. The second financial package comes amid criticism from the opposition and trade union activists who have stated that the paltry sums does little to alleviate sufferings of hundreds of thousands of people who have no source of livelihood or income due to the lockdown. “It is going to be a month since these restrictions came into place. People are yet to receive any relief from the first package itself and the government has announced a second package. We had asked that at least ₹10,000 be deposited to their accounts before the lockdown. Where will these people run around to get the money now? And what use is ₹2000- ₹3000 which is not even enough to pay a month’s rent,” Ramalinga Reddy, the working president of the Congress party in Karnataka said on Thursday.Yediyurappa said that at least 70% of those from the first package are beginning to receive payments and the process of paying out from the second package will start in a couple of days. The CM said that excess milk procured from farmers will be converted to milk powder and distributed to school children along with food grains for June and July, costing the state ₹100 crore. “Teachers of unaided schools will be given a relief of Rs. 5000 each. This will amount to Rs. 100 crore. An assistance of ₹5 crores will be given to advocates welfare fund,” according to the statement. The chief minister announced that micro, small, medium enterprises will be given concession for paying fixed charges for the month of May and June which will cost ₹120 crores to the government. Yediyurappa said that though the restrictions would continue across the state but the government did make some concessions. According to the latest guidelines, all establishments which are directly engaged in exports are permitted to function with 30% of their staff strength. The guidelines added that the department of commerce and industry will notify the list of permitted units and establishments. “All such units which employ more than 1000 persons shall do covid-19 test for at least 10% of the employees randomly twice a week,” according to the new guidelines. The document added that a separate SOP will be issued for garment exporting units shortly.On Thursday, Karnataka recorded 18,324 new infections at a positivity rate of 12.20%. There were 24,036 recoveries that further brought down the active caseload to 286,789, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. However, the fatality rate continues to remain at a high of 2.80% as 514 more died in the battle against the virus that takes the state’s toll to 30,531. Yediyurappa said if the positivity rate comes down to below 5% or 3%, then the state is ready to give some kind of relief in restrictions as earlier. A government-appointed technical advisory committee (TAC) had submitted a report earlier this week to the state health ministry on steps required to contain the prolonging of the second wave of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ktaka-announces-2nd-financial-relief-extends-curbs-till-june-14-101622747473028.html
04-06-2021||Dehradun||4 Uttarakhand SDRF trek 5 hours to cremate Covid+ive man’s body, his son refused||Four personnel of Uttarakhand’s state disaster response force (SDRF) of police trekked 5 km for the cremation of a 90-year-old Covid-19-infected man in Pithoragarh district on Wednesday after his family and villagers abandoned the body.The SDRF personnel came to the village from their base camp in Pithoragarh city after receiving a call for help from the dead man’s son on Tuesday night.“The deceased, Mohan Ram, was bed-ridden. He died on Tuesday after which his family undertook his Covid-19 test in which he tested positive. They then abandoned the body as other villagers were refusing to lend a hand in getting him cremated. His son Bheem Bahadur then contacted us on Tuesday at 10.30 pm,” sub-inspector Manohar Kanyal, who led the team of four, said.Kanyal promised to come the following day.“Next morning, we four left our camp at 6.30 am and reached the house at 11.30 am. There, none of his family members or the villagers came forward to help us in getting the body packed or arranging wood at the cremation ground. We did it all by ourselves,” he said.The SDRF officer said after putting the body on a PPE kit, they carried him 1km down towards a motorable road.“From there, we carried it in a hearse till the closest motorable spot to the crematorium ground. We had to carry the body in bamboo on foot, braving the difficult hilly terrain to a cremation ground that was downhill near a river. There, too, we have to arrange the wood on our own to set the pyre to cremate the body,” he said.Kanyal said he and his colleagues don’t “run away from such hard work because it’s the service of humanity in these difficult times”. But it is very upsetting, he said, when well-off people like the family of this man refuse to carry the cremation of their dear ones. “If the family is not financially sound, then we can understand their problem, but at least those who can afford on their own, should not do this,” he said.Six days ago, in another incident, an SDRF team had helped an 82-year-old Covid-19 infected man get admitted to a hospital by carrying him on a stretcher for about 7 km on hilly terrain.As the man used to live alone in the village, nobody came to help him in taking him to a nearby hospital. The SDRF men, after receiving an SOS call, reached there and got him admitted to a Covid-19 hospital.Director general of state police Ashok Kumar said, “The department has been helping the needy ones in this pandemic by providing help like providing oxygen cylinders, arranging ambulances and getting hospital beds for patients.”“We have been doing this all under an initiative known as ‘Operation Hausla’ under which we also cremate abandoned bodies of Covid-19 infected people. We would continue to serve humanity,” said Kumar.In the second wave of the pandemic, police have cremated 792 bodies of Covid-19 infected people till May 31. They also arranged ambulances for 600 people, provided oxygen cylinders to 2,726 people, medicine for 17,609 people and hospital beds for 792 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/4-uttarakhand-sdrf-trek-5-hours-to-cremate-covid-ive-man-s-body-his-son-refused-101622746433043.html

It has decided to categorise districts and cities based on their testing positivity rate and occupancy rate of oxygen beds. Those coming under level 1 are likely to be freed from all restrictions. The proposal was discussed in the state disaster management authority (SDMA) meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. A decision is likely on Friday, the officials said.Districts and cities under level 2 are likely allowed to open up all activities, but they may face restrictions on timings or number of people. Mumbai is likely to be part of level 2. State relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar also clarified that local trains will not be allowed to run, as of now.The state relief and rehabilitation department has proposed to bifurcate districts and cities into five levels. The districts and cities to be made part of level 1 will have less than 5% weekly positivity rate and less than 25% occupancy rate of oxygen beds. Similarly, cities and districts with up to 5% positivity rate and 25-40% occupancy rate will be incorporated in level 2 of the plan, 5% to 9% positivity rate and 40-60% occupancy will come under level 3, 10-20% of positivity rate and 60-75% occupancy rate areas will come under level 4 and areas having 20% and above positivity rate and 75% and above occupancy rate will not be having any change in lockdown restrictions, the relief and rehabilitation minister said.Among cities, municipal corporations with more than 1 million population will be considered as a unit and they will also be eligible to get relaxations on the basis of their current situation.Wadettiwar said, “Those coming under level 1 category will not be having any restrictions. There are some 18 units (districts and cities) that are likely to come under it. It means all the shops, hotels, restaurants, malls, theatres, offices etc. will be allowed to open with 100% capacity. Mumbai is likely to come in level 2 category where all the activities will also be allowed, but with some restrictions limited to number of people or timings.”A senior official privy to the development said there will be no restrictions on inter-district travelling for areas coming under level 1 to 4. “People from these areas will not require any e-pass. However, those who want to enter and leave the areas under level 5 category, also known as red zone, will require an e-pass,” he said.A decision on the five-level unlock plan is likely to come on Friday, he added.The state government on Thursday clarified that the proposal is still under consideration. The clarification was issued, following a statement made by the relief and rehabilitation minister that said that the proposal was approved in the SDMA meeting and will come in force from Friday onwards. Later in the evening, he clarified that he forgot to use the “in-principle” word, while sharing the information with the mediapersons.“We have not stopped the spread and infection of corona completely as yet. The infection is increasing in some rural areas as of now. We will have to think before taking any definite step about relaxing the restrictions in consideration of dangerous and changing mutations of coronavirus. The restrictions imposed in the state are not lifted as yet. The detailed guiding instructions to impose harder restrictions or give relaxation will be notified through a government decision,” said a clarification issued on Thursday evening.“The proposal to relax restrictions on the basis of these parameters is under consideration and the decision regarding its implementation will be taken after taking comprehensive review of the situation from the concerned administrative units of the district. The information regarding this is being examined from the local administration. The official decision will be conveyed after this. Instructions about implementation of this decision will be explained in the abovementioned government decision,” it added.“The proposal was discussed in the SDMA meeting but since health officials were not part of it, the chief minister asked the relief and rehabilitation department to share the proposal with them and take their opinion after which a decision can be taken. Later, Wadettiwar made the announcement,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.This led to a mess and also attracted criticism from the opposition leaders who were quick to allege that there is lack of coordination among the Uddhav Thackeray-led coalition government.State BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said this indicates there is no coordination among the ruling partners. “Maharashtra is facing a situation similar to a confused ruler and a chaotic state. Relief and rehabilitation minister declared a decision of unlocking in a meeting chaired by the chief minister. Later, the state government issued a clarification that it is just a proposal and a decision is yet to be taken,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-prepares-five-level-unlock-plan-101622746212196.html

The camp will be held from 10am to 4pm at Vikas Bhavan auditorium located in Greater Noida, officials said.A target of vaccinating 200 people above 18 years has been set, the officials said.“The department concerned has identified 50 differently-abled beneficiaries, while 70 people have been identified from the old age home run by the social welfare department in Greater Noida. Apart from this, the district magistrate has instructed to include transgenders in the drive as well. Hence, we are publicising among their communities that they can come and get vaccinated here,” said Shailendra Bahadur Singh, district social welfare officer, GB Nagar.He said that the registration of transgenders for vaccination will be done on June 4 and 5 at room number 117, Vikas Bhawan. Since people from other categories have already been identified, their details are with the administration and their prior registration is not required, said the officials.“It is very difficult to convince people in the transgender community to come and get vaccinated. Two days back, I reached out to their community leader over phone but she said that they do not ‘trust’ vaccines. Her brother got fever a day after getting vaccinated so they got scared. However, I tried to make them understand that it is just a side effect,” said Singh.Ram Kali, a transgender who works with the NGO Basera Samajik Sansthan, said that the community follows what their leader tells them to. “Various rounds of counselling are required to get transgenders vaccinated as they only follow what their community leader tells them. We have so far been able to get only around 50 transgenders vaccinated at the Sector 30 district hospital,” she said. The NGO works with over 2,000 transgenders in GB Nagar.As per a statement from the social welfare department, people from the transgender community can contact at 7042563106 for registration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-vaccination-camp-for-specially-abled-transgenders-and-senior-citizens-on-june-7-101622745792721.html

She said the report would be sent to party’s regional and state leadership. A birthday party thrown by BJP’s Kanpur district secretary Narayan Singh Bhadauria at a guesthouse in violation of the Covid-19 protocol was attended by Manoj Singh, who according to the police, has around 27 cases against him. Out on parole granted by the high court, Singh is now on the run. Police are conducting raids to arrest Singh and the BJP functionary. Visuals of the incident showed Bhadauria and his supporters blocking the police team’s jeep from taking Manoj Singh away. The police had arrived at the guesthouse after a tip-off about the presence of some people with dubious conduct there, police officials said. “It’s true that some people managed to free an accused with a history sheet. Cases under appropriate section have been registered and raids are on,” said Raveena Tyagi, deputy commissioner of police, Kanpur (south). Police officials said that the even the BJP functionary had a few cases on him. Bhadauria, who is now on the run, had earlier denied any involvement in the entire case and said he did not know the people who helped the criminal escape.“My presence is natural as I organised the party and I was there to cut the cake. I did not participate in any such activity,” he said.Two other people with allegedly dubious conduct, Vikas Tiwari and Raj Pandit, also out on parole, were reportedly present at the BJP functionary’s birthday function. They too managed to escape, people aware of the matter said. “Stripped of his post already, he could face strict action. A report has been sought and is expected within 24 hours by our district unit,” a senior UP BJP functionary said, admitting that such developments dent the party’s reputation. “I think police are doing their job and the law will catch up with all those who are guilty,” said the BJP leader who asked not to be named.The opposition targeted the BJP claiming this was the latest proof of “goondaraj” (lawlessness) in UP.“I hope the chief minister is watching. This is goondaraj,” said Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Anurag Bhadauria.In the run-up to 2017 UP assembly polls, the BJP had consistently targeted the SP rule claiming there was “goondaraj”. The Congress asked why the BJP functionary wasn’t arrested by the police immediately.“Didn’t he get benefit of being a functionary of the ruling party? Visuals showed him being present, arguing with the police party, when a mob managed to free a criminal from police captivity,” asked Congress spokesman Anshu Awasthi. He said, “If SP rule was goondaraj, then BJP rule is jungleraj.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kanpur-bjp-leader-removed-from-post-after-visuals-of-him-pressuring-police-to-release-alleged-criminal-101622745792220.html

The police team had visited the spot to nab a suspect, Balbeer, 35, in connection with a narcotics case. However, the suspect’s family and locals allegedly attacked the police team, which led to a chaotic situation, said the police.Vishal Pandey, additional deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida said Balbeer was allegedly involved in smuggling marijuana. “Two sub inspectors and two constables had visited his house to conduct a search. However, a number of locals gathered at the spot and started resisting the search operation,” he said.Umesh Bahadur, SHO, Jewar police station, said that three of the police personnel exited the house due to stiff resistance while the suspects held one sub-inspector – Jaideep Singh – hostage and bolted the door from inside. “They manhandled the sub-inspector and tore his uniform,” he said.A video of the incident was circulated on social media, in which the SI was seen sitting on a cot allegedly being held hostage by the suspects. Later, additional force was sent to the spot and the three suspects – Balbeer, his wife Neetu, 32, and a relative Rajni, 30 were arrested.Police said a case has been registered against them under Section 147 (rioting), Section 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), Section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC. “The three suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody.

But he jumped parole and began extorting businessmen,” said Singh.After jumping parole, Pilla, a resident of Mangolpuri, allegedly stabbed a businessman in the same neighbourhood on April 22 for not giving into his extortion demand. An attempt to murder case was registered against him and the police were on his trail ever since.Late Wednesday night, police received a tip-off that Pilla would visit Mangolpuri to meet his family. “We laid a trap near Mangolpuri flyover and noticed him on a motorcycle around midnight. When we asked him to stop, he took out a pistol and fired at a head constable,”said the DCP.After a brief exchange of fire, Pilla was overpowered and a gun with five bullets was recovered from him.He was taken to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital where doctors said he is now out of danger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/murder-convict-who-jumped-parole-injured-in-encounter-101622745732130.html

According to the police, they had allegedly attempted to break and steal an ATM machine from a kiosk around 2am on June 2.“The bank had received an alert and information was shared with us, following which teams were dispatched to the kiosk.

04-06-2021||Delhi||Those with special needs to get dedicated vaccination centres||The Delhi government has directed all district magistrates (DMs) and chief district medical officers to ensure at least one dedicated vaccination centre for the differently abled in every zone, and to provide walk-in facility to all such beneficiaries.The centres will only vaccinate differently abled people older than 45 years, with senior government officials citing shortage of doses as the reason to exclude the 18-45 age group.“In order to facilitate Covid-19 vaccination of persons with disabilities, a decision has been taken for operationalisation of a dedicated Covid-19 vaccination centre (CVC) in each district where facilitated vaccination in walk-in mode, with on-site registration, can be undertaken,” said the order issued by the state health department on Wednesday.Last week, the Delhi government ordered that dedicated vaccination centres for persons with disabilities be set up in each district, following demands from disability rights activists.Cheshta Yadav, DM (northwest), said a special vaccination centre has been opened at a community centre of the Delhi Development Authority in Vijay Vihar, Rohini Sector 1. “To get a vaccine shot at such centres, the beneficiary will have to bring a supporting document as proof of disability. These include PwD identify cards or proof of residence in a PwD shelter home, or centre, or any other relevant PwD certificate,” she said.To ensure a good turnout, the DMs are also roping in NGOs to spread awareness of these centres and provide transportation wherever required. Isha Khosla, DM (north), said she has tasked all sub-divisional magistrates in her district to identify and reach out to such beneficiaries and ensure their safe transportation. “Even at the centre, we have sensitised our officers to be more alert in terms of offering any kind of assistance to those coming to get the jab. We have deployed extra civil defence volunteers to assist beneficiaries on wheelchairs or even in general,” she said.Ankita Chakravarty, DM (south), said they have opened a centre for people with disabilities at the Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Chhatarpur.“Beneficiaries can drop in between 9am and 5pm from Monday to Saturday,” she said.The south-east district has identified the school of excellence in Kalkaji as its model PwD centre. “This institute has all the required disabled-friendly infrastructure, such as ramps and markings for visually challenged, so that the vaccination drive can be conducted smoothly,” said a district official.Muralidharan, general secretary of the NGO, The National Platform for the Rights of the Disabled, said in addition to dedicated vaccination centres, it is also crucial to undertake steps aimed at quelling vaccine hesitancy and generating awareness among the differently abled.However, activists and organisations continue to seek vaccination at home for disabled people since commuting is likely to be a challenge for many. National-level para-athlete Gulfam Ahmed , who is struggling to get vaccinate, said: “There are people who are bedridden due to spinal cord injuries or other issues. Such individuals will not be able to go out for vaccination. The government should consider the possibility of vaccinating these people at home. With mobility issues, it’s not easy to reach vaccination sites located in far-flung areas,” said Ahmed.Dr Satendra Singh, a disability rights activist and a teacher at DU’s University College of Medical Sciences, said the government could conduct door-to-door vaccination for elderly people and disabled people as the country had done in the case of polio vaccination.“Whether it’s a separate PWD centre or near a home vaccination centre, both are futile in some cases. A majority of hospitals and centres are not completely accessible to people with severe disability, or those who are old,” said Singh.With inputs from Sadia Akhtar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-orders-dedicated-vaccination-centres-for-differently-abled-in-each-zone-101622745673259.html
04-06-2021||Delhi||Several elderly residents want shots at home||Padma Ranganathan, a 100-year-old resident of Saket, is finding it difficult to get vaccinated. The centenarian is homebound due to age-related ailments and mobility issues. Ranganathan’s daughter Reena Ramachandran said her mother has not stepped out of the house since the outbreak of Covid-19.“My mother is going to be 101 shortly and lives alone with a caretaker. She lives on the first floor and movement is a problem for her. For the past one year, we have not allowed any visitors and she is in quarantine. However, this cannot continue forever. She needs to get the vaccine,” said Ramachandran.She said the current mechanism of vaccination was not conducive for disabled or elderly people, who cannot visit vaccination sites easily.“The system needs to devise methods to reach out to the vulnerable section of our society. Some states are already doing home vaccination. It’s not a very novel idea for the country,” said Ramachandran. She said nearly 52% of her colony’s residents are senior citizens, which necessitated vaccination on an urgent basis. “These include families where both partners are bedridden and have not been vaccinated. If the administration is not able to vaccinate a section of people in an area, then how will the immunisation process be successful? By leaving out people, the virus gets a window to mutate and multiply,” she said.Ramachandran’s mother is among several people who are homebound due to age-related ailments, and are yet to get vaccinated. Besides underlying health issues, that many of the elderly live alone also becomes a factor that prevents them from visiting vaccination centres.As per Delhi’s electoral roll last revised on January 15 this year, around 1.22 million people are in the age bracket of 60-69 years, 0.67 million are aged 70-79, and 0.23 million aged over 80 years. As of June 2, the number of people vaccinated in the 60+ category stood at 1.03 million.Major (retd) Ranjit Singh, president of the Defence Colony RWA, which is home to many senior citizens, said the association was trying to work on a mechanism of vaccinating old people at home in collaboration with a private hospital.“At least 40% of the population in our colony are above 60,” said Singh.Preeti Johar, CEO of Family of Disabled, said her organisation has been receiving requests from people who cannot visit vaccination centres.“People with severe muscular dystrophy and other ailments need to be vaccinated at home. In fact, people with disabilities need to be prioritised,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhis-senior-citizens-want-vaccines-at-home-101622745672144.html

It asked the secretary (health) of the Delhi government to issue directions to all hospitals to furnish information of patients who were survived by children to the department of Women and Child Development without delay.Advocate Prabhsahay Kaur, representing NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan, submitted that there was a complete lack of information on the number of children made orphans by the pandemic, or their identities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-high-court-directs-govt-to-collate-info-on-covid-orphans-101622745615585.html
04-06-2021||Delhi||Dhankar murder: SUV recovered from stadium was a stolen one, say police||Police on Thursday said the investigation into the killing of wrestler Sagar Dhankar has revealed that the Brezza SUV, which was recovered from New Delhi’s Chhatrasal Stadium, was stolen from outer Delhi’s Rohini a few months ago.The 23-year-old Dhankar had died following a brawl with world champion Sushil Kumar and his associates at Chhatrasal Stadium on the night of May 4. Two of Dhankar’s friends, Sonu and Amit Kumar, were also assaulted by the two-time Olympic wrestler and his aides, police said.A video of the incident had also surfaced on social media, in which 38-year-old Kumar and his associates were seen attacking a man who was lying on the floor with sticks.Police said the stolen vehicle was in the possession of Gulab alias Pehalwan, who is one of nine men arrested so far for Dhankar’s murder. The documents of the car that showed Gulab as its owner turned out to be forged, and the crime branch investigating team is likely to book him for forgery and include forgery charges in the murder case as well, officers associated with the probe said.“Since the vehicle was found to be stolen from the jurisdiction of KN Katju Marg police station, we will soon be informing that police station about the crime. Gulab is presently in jail. The KN Katju Marg police may seek his custody through the court concerned and arrest him separately in the car theft case,” said an investigator, who did not want to be named.Police said 24-year-old Gulab is a member of Kala Asauda-Neeraj Bawana gang and he was arrested along with three other members of the gang – Bhupender alias Bhupi,38, Mohit alias Bholi,22, and Manjeet alias Chunni Lal,29 – from outer Delhi’s Kanjhawala in connection with Dhankar’s murder. They were caught by the Rohini district police on May 25, two days after Kumar was arrested with his associate Ajay Sherawat from Delhi’s Mundka.According to the officer, Gulab, Bhupender, Mohit, Manjeet and a few other associates had reached Chhatrasal Stadium on the night of May 4, after getting a call from another member of their gang, Kala Sethi, who is known to Kumar.“Gulab and the others arrived in two cars – the Brezza and a Scorpio -- and were carrying weapons. They were involved in the assault on Dhankar and his associate. On hearing police sirens, they fled the stadium, leaving behind their vehicles and weapons,” added the officer.At the time of the arrest, the Rohini police was unaware that the Brezza recovered from the stadium was stolen from their jurisdiction. Even the crime branch team was unaware of the vehicle being stolen. But when the ownership documents of the car were verified, they turned out to be forged. The vehicle had a Jharkhand registration plate at the time it was stolen from Rohini, the officer added.Police said they have arrested nine persons, including Kumar and Gulab, for Dhankar’s murder while at least four persons are still absconding. Investigators said the suspects have been identified and searches are on to nab them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dhankar-murder-suv-recovered-from-stadium-was-a-stolen-one-say-police-101622745614416.html

The project is likely to take off in a month or so. “It will be an e-learners’ licence with a validity of six months which will be issued. This is something which has not been tried in any other state in India so far. We used the seven weeks of lockdown to work on the project,” said a senior transport official.The process will require applicants to register on the transport department website to get a virtual appointment to take the learners’ licence test from their homes. The applicant will go through a standard online tutorial and then take the test. The candidates will also have to sit for a test to check for colour blindness, after which the e-learners’ licence will be issued, another official said.“All information regarding learners’ licence fees, required documents, minimum age and eligibility will be available on the dedicated web link in the transport department website. Besides, it will also contain an FAQ and a question bank,” the official said.The learners’ licence test, which has 10 objective type questions, will take 10 minutes. An applicant gets the licence if he/she scores six out of 10 marks in the computerised test.In March and April, HT reported that switching to a completely online mode of issuing learners’ driving licences was part of the second phase of the state transport department’s online services project. From February 18, Delhi had fully shifted 12 transport services, including applying for renewal and duplicate DL or RC, permit or RC transfer, among others, to the online mode. The second phase will include 58 services.Under the online system, the Delhi transport department, in a first, was able to clear 64% of the 77,421 online applications it received for services related to driver’s licence and vehicle RC between February 18 and March 30, HT reported on April 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/learners-license-to-go-online-delhi-transport-dept-says-101622745613790.html
04-06-2021||Noida||Covid second wave doubles traffic police’s role in Noida||Noida: Traffic police officials have been doing a dual role for the past two months in Gautam Budh Nagar. Besides regulating the traffic, they have been helping family members of Covid-19 patients in arranging oxygen cylinders and ambulances. For instance, the traffic control room on Thursday received a call from Mohit Rana, a resident of Sector 22, that his father was in need of an oxygen concentrator at home. The traffic police verified the request and swiftly arranged an oxygen concentrator for him. “First, I searched for an oxygen concentrator in the market but it was not available. I then contacted the traffic police who provided the concentrator with a security deposit of ₹1000,” Rana said.Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), GB Nagar, said that in the last few months the control room saw a decline in the routine traffic-related calls. “Due to the second wave of the pandemic, people started facing new problems. They needed oxygen cylinders and ambulances, among other things. There are also some people who lost jobs and faced problems in arranging food. We then decided to cater to these needs through our control room,” he said.Saha said that the control room number – 9971009001 – which earlier responded to only traffic-related calls, started helping people affected by Covid-19. “As we receive calls from people, we send our team to help them. We have associated with some NGOs who help us in this initiative,” Saha said. Police on Wednesday provided food to about 100 low-income families in Surajpur, the officials said.Omveer Singh, a head constable at the traffic control room, said that the control room randomly calls residents and asks if they or someone in their neighbourhood need any help. “A few days ago, we received a call from an ice-cream vendor. He said that his business is badly affected due to the lockdown and he was unable to arrange food. We immediately sent a team and helped him,” Singh said.The officials said that the Rotary Club also helped them in this initiative. Naveen Kumar Aggarwal, president, Rotary Club Noida, said that the club is running a kitchen for about two months and has provided food to 250 Covid patients living alone. “Our primary goal during the second wave was to provide blood and plasma to people. But we helped people arrange food supplies in this difficult times,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid-second-wave-doubles-traffic-police-s-role-in-noida-101622745612713.html
04-06-2021||Delhi||From June 5, Delhi govt to distribute free grains to those without ration cards||From Saturday, the Delhi government will start distributing free rations to people outside the ambit of the public distribution system (PDS), through a network of 280 government schools, as part of relief measures announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal last month in view of the lockdown that has affected household incomes, said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday.Later in the day, food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain said, “By the night of June 2, the rations have reached 158 schools. Packages will be reaching the remaining schools by June 4. The whole process is being monitored by the chief minister.”Delhi has been under a lockdown since April 19, in an effort to contain the alarming surge in Covid-19 cases which had left the city’s health-care infrastructure overwhelmed -- between April 15 and May 10, the city was reporting over 20,000 Covid-19 cases a day. On May 4, Kejriwal had announced that rations for the 7.2 million PDS beneficiaries will be distributed for free in the months of May and June. On May 18, he announced that free rations would also be given to people without ration cards.The long delay in implementing the scheme, however, has caused more distress to people, said a few daily wagers HT spoke to.“I have had no income since the lockdown was imposed and we are a family of four. For nearly two months now, we have been availing of daily meals at a hunger centre set up by the government. After the CM announced last month that rations would be given to those without ration cards, we were relieved. But we had to buy essentials in May because the government did not give us anything. We are out of savings now. It is a good thing that the scheme is finally taking off,” said Manish Ranjan, who works as a porter at the Gandhi Nagar wholesale garments market.Amardeep Jha, who works at a gear box manufacturing factory in Naraina, said, “We have ration cards from Bihar. But they are not valid in Delhi. So, we had to struggle a lot for food in the month of May. There was no work and my employer did not pay me as the factory was closed the whole month. We were worried about how we would manage in June. We are relieved now to hear about the free ration scheme. If only the government had started it sooner.”The initiative also gain importance considering that Delhi has also not implemented the ‘One nation, one ration card’ policy beyond a pilot project that is so far limited to one municipal ward in Seemapuri assembly segment. The Delhi government has estimated a maximum of two million beneficiaries under the proposed scheme, over and above the 7.2 million beneficiaries under PDS . People who do not have ration cards will be provided five kilos of food grains for free every month. The 280 schools for distribution of the ration have been identified in a fashion that ensures at least four distribution centres in each of the 70 assembly constituencies. The distribution will be done between 10am and 4pm daily, except on Sundays, said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified.The official further said, “People will have to come with some identity document such as Aadhaar card, PAN card, etc. Those who have no document proof will have to sign a self-declaration form. They will be registered on a portal on the spot. All schools have been given log-in IDs to the portal. They have to ensure that beneficiaries are not present in the PDS network and there is no case of one person availing of ration twice.”Anjali Bhardwaj, Right to Food campaigner, who is also a member of the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, said: “It is a good thing that the government has finally announced a date for ration distribution among people who do not have ration cards. The government has a bigger challenge ahead in terms of efficient implementation of the scheme.” The Delhi government had launched a similar scheme in March 2020 too when the nationwide lockdown had happened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-june-6-delhi-govt-to-distribute-free-grains-to-those-without-ration-cards-101622745613236.html
04-06-2021||Noida||Beneficiaries from Delhi-NCR turning towards Ghaziabad vaccination centres||Ghaziabad: Many residents of Delhi-NCR in the 18-45 years age group are now turning to vaccination centres in Ghaziabad to get a Covid-19 vaccine, especially a dose of Covaxin. The district has two government-run centres -- one at Ghanta Ghar Ramlila Ground and the other at community health centre (CHC) in Dasna -- that provides exclusive Covaxin vaccination, according to the district health department. “I got a slot here under the 18-45 category. Today, I got the first dose of Covaxin with ease. I am a resident of West Delhi, and I had expected that there could be some problem regarding the local address proof. But it did not happen,” said a Delhi resident requesting anonymity, who received his first dose at CHC, Dasna. The officials at the vaccination centre admitted that many people from neighbouring cities are turning to Ghaziabad for getting a vaccine dose. “About 20% of the beneficiaries who visit the centre are from Delhi-NCR. We take up their vaccination as they have valid address proof of UP such as Aadhaar card or rent agreement. The trend has started after the Centre allowed vaccination for the 18-45 group. It seems that there is a shortage of Covaxin outside UP,” said an officer at the CHC who wished not to be identified. An HT team had visited the vaccination centre on Wednesday. When asked that the Uttar Pradesh government has mandated that a beneficiary in the 18+ group must produce a residence proof of the state to get the jab, Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said, “Beneficiaries in 18-45 group can book slots online. If they are from outside UP, we ask them for proof of residence and provide them vaccination if they produce valid documents. There are some cases when people insist and we give them doses.”The CMO said that the demand of Covaxin has increased lately. “At present, we are not making new sessions of Covaxin for 45+ category since we have to save the vaccine stock for second dose to be given to beneficiaries under the 18-45 category. Once we receive enough stock of Covaxin, we do start sessions for 45+ age group,” said Gupta. It is not just the Covaxin which is drawing people from outside UP to Ghaziabad, many are also availing walk-in facilities at private centres providing Covishield. “On Tuesday, we vaccinated about 1,000 beneficiaries. Of them, about 7% were from outside areas, including Delhi, Faridabad, and Gurugram,” said a spokesperson of Max Hospital at Vaishali which has recently opened its paid vaccination centre administering Covishield at Cambridge School in Indirapuram. However, officials in nearby Gautam Budh Nagar said that they are allowing vaccination of people who are residing in UP. “We are taking up vaccination of only those who are residing in UP. If they are from outside UP, but have temporary residence in UP, we are allowing them to get a vaccine,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer of GB Nagar. However, private hospitals in GB Nagar are free to vaccinate anyone who has got an appointment on Co-WIN app since it is paid one, Ohri said.According to June 2 figures from the Ghaziabad health department, a total of 562,089 doses of Covishield were administered while 60,780 doses of Covaxin were given to beneficiaries so far since January 16 this year. The figures showed that about 19,914 doses of Covaxin were given to beneficiaries in April while it increased to 23,014 in May. Likewise, 188,953 doses of Covishield were given to beneficiaries in April while 216,156 doses were administered in the month of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/beneficiaries-from-delhi-ncr-turning-towards-ghaziabad-vaccination-centres-101622745612157.html
04-06-2021||Noida||Noida authority to continue oxygen supply service||NOIDA: Even as the demand for medical oxygen has declined to a large extent in the city, the Noida authority on Thursday said that it will continue providing oxygen cylinders and refilling facilities for Covid-19 patients.The authority started supplying oxygen cylinders on May 3 from its two counters set up at community centres in sectors 93B and 135, amid the shortage of oxygen in the city. Currently, it provides, on an average, two cylinders daily in home delivery service while there is a demand for about 15 cylinders daily for refilling, said officials. However, between May 3 and May 20, the authority provided over 1,500 oxygen cylinders to Covid-19 patients in need from its various centres. But the demand declined sharply since then and it supplied just over 200 cylinders from May 21 to June 3, the officials said. “Serving even one patient daily is important for us. Therefore the oxygen supply service will continue,” said Mukesh Vaish, authority’s project engineer who is in-charge of the service.The authority provides the D-type oxygen cylinders of two different capacities -- 40-litre and 5-litre -- for ₹500 and ₹200, respectively.On May 11, the authority decentralized the process and started refilling empty cylinders at eight more locations in the city, said officials. On May 16, it also started home delivery of oxygen cylinders.Meanwhile, the Greater Noida authority that provided around 700 oxygen cylinders in the past one month has shut down two centres (out of four) as the demand declined to seven cylinders daily from 40, said officials.“We have shut down two oxygen counters in the city as the demand has declined due to the decrease in number of patients. Now, anyone who is in need can get cylinders from two centres located in City Park and Saini village,” said Deep Chand, additional chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-to-continue-oxygen-supply-service-101622745492812.html
04-06-2021||Noida||Expecting curfew to end soon, Ghaziabad looks to stakeholders||Ghaziabad: With fewer fresh cases of Covid-19 being reported daily in the district, besides the number of active cases coming down, officials said it is likely that the partial Corona curfew may be lifted as soon as Monday in Ghaziabad. The administration in this regard on Wednesday called on several stakeholders and asked them to make coordinated efforts to uphold Covid protocols.“Since the number of active cases is on the decline due to a lesser number of fresh cases and more patients getting discharged, we expect that the partial Corona curfew may be relaxed by Monday. We are keeping a tab on the daily figures. We have directed all stakeholders to cooperate in order to control the spread of infection so that cases keep below 600,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.According to an Uttar Pradesh government order late April, all districts in the state which have more than 600 active coronavirus disease cases are to observe the partial Corona curfew.On May 30, however, the state government directed that in case active cases fall below 600, the restrictions will ease but if the cases go above 600 again, the restrictions are to automatically come into place. The government had also eased restrictions across the state barring 20 districts, which included Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, under this rule.As per control room figures of Thursday, the number of active cases in Ghaziabad stand at a figure of 727 while neighbouring GB Nagar has a tally of 730 active cases. On May 31, Ghaziabad’s tally of active cases was 1,025 while GB Nagar’s tally of active cases stood at 947.“We have taken note of suggestions made by residents’ welfare associations (RWAs), transporters, traders’ associations and others. Once the relaxations come into play, the suggestions will be evaluated. They have also been asked to take up voluntary community containment directions given earlier by the administration,” Pandey said. The DM said he has asked these stakeholders, as well as auto-rickshaw unions to observe all Covid protocols in order to avoid any spread of the virus. “We have assured the admin that RWAs will cooperate with them, and we are even ready to abstain for community activities in societies; besides, we will form teams which will spread awareness in the community and keep an eye out for people flouting Covid-protocols,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of the flat owners’ federation, who was part of the meeting on Wednesday. He suggested the admin also focus on expediting and increasing coverage of vaccination. “We are ready to make arrangements for vaccination and will also prepare lists of eligible beneficiaries. We will also arrange for doctors, on our part, so that fewer health staff members are engaged and manpower is saved for other Covid related duties,” he added. Markets in the district have been closed since the partial corona curfew was enforced on the night of April 30. “We have suggested that staggered opening and closing time for markets should be done away with and shops should be allowed to open from 8am to 8pm. Otherwise, shoppers panic. Further, we requested that odd-even opening of markets should be avoided as it creates confusion and traders also need to open shops as they have suffered losses during the curfew,” said Rajneesh Bansal, chairperson of Turab Nagar Vyapar Mandal, a traders’ association.He added that a request for vaccination of traders and their staff should also be looked at.“The associations are ready to make arrangements. Majority of our staff do not have access to online booking modes. So, if the administration can arrange for camps, we will make arrangements,” he added.Dilshad Ahmad, president of the Ghaziabad auto-rickshaw chalak sangh, said that auto-rickshaw drivers will cooperate fully, otherwise all stakeholders and residents will suffer if cases go beyond 600. “We will not allow overcrowding in our autos and no passenger will be allowed to board the vehicle without a face mask. All vehicles will carry bottles of sanitisers as well. Helping keep the curfew at bay is the responsibility of all stakeholders. If the number of cases goes above 600, we all will face closure and hence, difficulties,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/expecting-curfew-to-end-soon-ghaziabad-looks-to-stakeholders-101622745492105.html
04-06-2021||Noida||Non-Covid OPDs open at govt hospitals in Noida||Noida: Non-Covid medical services at government facilities in Gautam Budh Nagar are set to start again on Friday. The non-Covid OPD (out-patient department) and IPD (in-patient department) services had been halted in the district on April 14 after a surge in Covid cases.The services are being restarted as per a state government order, which says that OPD and IPD services are to be resumed at all Community Health Centres (CHCs) and Primary Health Centres (PHCs) in the district, with Covid protocols in place, while the surgical OPD will start only at the district hospital.“There are 25 Covid-19 patients admitted at the district hospital, as of now. As per state government orders, we will start surgical OPD at the hospital on Friday. This will help non-Covid patients whose surgeries were pending. Before the surgeries, the patient’s RT-PCR test or TrueNat test will be done to ensure they are Covid negative,” said Dr Renu Aggarwal, chief medical superintendent of the Sector 30 District Hospital.Officials said that as the number of Covid cases in the district go down, opening such services will help non-Covid patients who need medical attention.

The order states that patients who come with Covid symptoms at any of these health centres will be tested at a separate flu corner, so that they stay isolated from other patients. Covid tests of these patients will be ensured,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer.At the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida, some OPD departments were resumed from May 24.“We restarted with antenatal and diabetic OPD services last week, besides immunization clinics. Apart from this, we resumed OPD consultations for post-Covid complications last week. We will open other OPD services gradually in the coming days,” said GIMS director Dr (Brig) Rakesh Gupta.Meanwhile, some private Covid hospitals in the district have also opened their non-Covid OPD and IPD services.“Our OPD service was resumed on May 31 in which, during the first two days, we received around 150 patients whose surgeries were pending, who came for consultations. We are getting over 400 patients daily now,” said Dr Ajeet Kumar, director of public relations, Sharda Hospital.The non-Covid OPDs were opened at all three branches of Yatharth Hospital in the district on June 1. “We have been getting over 350 patients at the OPD on a daily basis at the Greater Noida branch, around 300 per day at the Sector 110 branch and around 110 at the Greater Noida west branch,” said Dr Sunil Balyan, medical superintendent at Yatharth Hospital, Greater Noida.Fortis Hospital in Noida said it opened its OPD last week. “We are getting about 200-250 OPD cases on a daily basis since opening last week,” said Hardeep Singh, zonal director, Fortis Hospital, Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noncovid-opds-open-at-govt-hospitals-in-noida-101622745252165.html

The foundation officials said there was no patient at the facility at the time of the incident.NGO officials said they had a verbal agreement with the owner to use the site till June 30 and then find an alternative site.JP Singh, HR director of Hemkunt Foundation, the NGO, alleged that tents, boards and other items inside the camp were damaged and they were forced to close the facility. A police complaint was lodged in the evening by the foundation at the Sector 65 police station.Police officials said it is a dispute between the landowner and the foundation, but added that a case under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 427 (mischief causing damage) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC was registered. Police said of the 22 people booked, only two, including the landowner, were named in the FIR.Deepak Kumar, SHO of Sector 65 police station, said a police team and the subdivisional magistrate of Badshahpur, Satish Yadav, visited the spot as soon as they received a complaint. “The landowner is planning to set up his own makeshift oxygen centre for residents and they have been asking the Hemkunt Foundation to vacate. There is no legal or written agreement between the parties, due to which they are bound to vacate the private property. We have intervened and given two days to shift their set up,” said Kumar.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said they have deployed police at the site as a precautionary measure. “I will be holding a discussion with them and an appropriate site would be given based on the requirement,” he said.The care centre set up by the foundation had 150 beds and 350 chairs to provide oxygen support to Covid-19 patients.Following the incident, a representative of the foundation took to social media and alleged they were being forcibly evicted by the locals.

04-06-2021||Pune||Pre-monsoon showers put Pune dam levels at highest point in three years||Given the pre-monsoon rain that Pune has witnessed this summer season (March to May), the water level in all four dams is now “good”, as compared to the last three years. Panshet dam, as of June 1, reported holdings at 37.11 per cent of full storage capacity, whereas Khadakwasla, is at 42.84 per cent. As per data furnished by the water resources department, Temghar dam is 9.47 per cent full. In 2020 and 2019, during the same time period, dam storage here was nil, as repair works were on. However, this year, due to good rainfall in the ghat and catchment areas, dam have filled up. As per IMD, from March to May in 2021, Pune received 145.4 mm of rainfall as opposed to the 38.8mm normally expected in the city.HV Gunale, chief engineer of the water resources department, Pune division, said that due to the good rainfall, many farmers do not need any irrigation support for their crops.“As there is good rainfall, water used is also less this time. Moreover, the catchment areas saw good rainfall, which has left the dams with good water storage ahead of the monsoon season,” said Gunale. Irrigation department officials also noted that water from dams has been released twice this summer for irrigation. The water reaches the rural areas via the Mutha canal, ensuring Rabi crops get enough water during the summer season. As of Thursday, there is 7.88 TMC of water in all the four dams, collectively. This is 27.05 per cent of the collective dam capacity. In 2020, in the first week of June, there was 6.85 TMC of water in all four dams collectively, which was 23.52 per cent of collective capacity, said irrigation department officials.As of Thursday, Khadkwasla has 0.85 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water, Panshet has 3.95 TMC, Warasgaon has 2.73 TMC and Temghar has 0.35 TMC of water in storage.Water storage in damns (as percentage of capacity)PanshetJune 2021 -- 37.11June 2020 -- 3.32June 2019 -- 16.10VarasgaonJune 2021 -- 21.34June 2020 -- 21.92June 2019 -- 8.45TemgharJune 2021 -- 9.47June 2020 -- 0June 2020 -- 0KhadakwaslaJune 2021 -- 42.84June 2020 -- 36.65June 2019 -- 41.71||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/premonsoon-showers-put-dam-levels-at-highest-point-in-three-years-101622729111058.html

Pandita was cremated in Jammu on Thursday.People’s Anti Fascist Front (PAFF), the group, claimed responsibility for the killing in a statement that accused Pandita of creating a network of informers, drug trafficking and “immoral activities”. It added it was “keeping an eye on the activities of these forces”.“He [Pandita] had gone to Jammu and left PSOs [Personal Security Officers] in Kashmir. After returning from Jammu, he went to Tral without his PSOs to meet his friend... The investigations are going on,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.Police said PAFF appears to be a front of militant organisations active in south Kashmir and added security forces have cordoned off the attack scene and launched a search operation to nab the assailants. They cited the standard operating procedure and said Pandita should have avoided going to his native village without his security cover, which was provided to him along with secured accommodation in Srinagar.At least 12 local bodies members have been killed since elections at the grassroots level were held in 2018. The members were promised security, but many allege that it was not provided to all. In March, two councillors and one PSO was killed in an attack on the Municipal Council office in Sopore in Baramulla district.“We were promised adequate security... unfortunately, only people affiliated to the BJP or the parties close to New Delhi have been given security,” said a councillor from Sopore, requesting anonymity.Police issued fresh instructions to political workers and leaders against moving without their security covers after the killing of Pandita, whose body was taken to Jammu for his last rites.BJP leader Altaf Thakur, who is also from Tral, said 17 workers of their party have been killed over the last three years. “Most of the councillors and panchayat members have been provided security. These attacks would not deter us from carrying out political activities.”Police were investigating why the PSOs were not accompanying Pandita and said action could be taken against them.Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti condemned the killing saying such senseless acts of violence have only brought misery. “Shocked to hear that BJP leader Rakesh Pandit has been shot dead by militants. These senseless acts of violence have brought only misery to J&K [Jammu and Kashmir]. My condolences to the family and may his soul rest in peace,” she tweeted.Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha echoed her. “Saddened to hear about the terror attack on the Councillor Shri Rakesh Pandita at Tral, Pulwama.

04-06-2021||World||Facebook extends Trump ban till Jan 7, 2023||Facebook has banned former US president Donald Trump for two years citing “gravity of the circumstances” that led to his initial suspension in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection by his supporters at US Capitol. Trump’s Facebook account will remain suspended till January 7, 2023. Facebook had also suspended Trump’s Instagram account then. “Facebook’s ruling is an insult to the record-setting 75M people, plus many others, who voted for us in the 2020 Rigged Presidential Election,” Trump said in a statement repeating false claims the election was rigged. “They shouldn’t be allowed to get away with this censoring and silencing, and ultimately, we will win. Our country can’t take this abuse anymore!”Announcing the decision, Facebook’s vice-president of global affairs Nick Clegg said, “Given the gravity of the circumstances that led to Mr Trump’s suspension, we believe his actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit the highest penalty available under the new enforcement protocols. We are suspending his accounts for two years, effective from the date of the initial suspension on January 7 this year.” Twitter, the other social media platform that Trump had used to great effect in projecting himself and his views, has terminated his account permanently.Facebook’s oversight board, comprised of outside legal experts picked by the social media platform, had upheld the suspension of Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts but had criticised the open-ended nature of the punitive action saying, “it was not appropriate for Facebook to impose the indeterminate and standard-less penalty of indefinite suspension”.A mob of Trump supporters had invaded the US Capitol on January 6 to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s election. Then vice-president Mike Pence, who was presiding over the session, had to flee to safety with lawmakers and returned after the complex was rid of the rioters and completed the certification process.Trump was impeached for inciting the insurrection making him the only American president impeached twice; the first time was in 2019.After January 2023, Facebook will ask experts to assess whether the risk to public safety has receded. “We will evaluate external factors, including instances of violence, restrictions on peaceful assembly and other markers of civil unrest,” Clegg said, adding, “If we determine that there is still a serious risk to public safety, we will extend the restriction for a set period of time and continue to re-evaluate until that risk has receded.”Shut out by Facebook and Twitter, Trump has used his email to issue tweet-length press statements, sometimes many times a day, just as he would have been posting on the social media platforms, multiple times a day. But his reach remains severely curtailed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-extends-trump-ban-till-jan-7-2023-101622829679419.html
04-06-2021||World||US adds over half-million jobs in May, Biden claims 'historic progress'||The United States added over half a million jobs in the month of May, a new report by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics stated on Friday, adding fuel to President Joe Biden's claims of a "historic progress" in job gains amid a ramped up vaccination campaign against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and hopes of post-pandemic economic recovery. “This is historic progress,” the New York Times quoted US President Joe Biden as saying, “Progress that’s pulling our economy out of the worst crisis it’s been in 100 years.”Also Read: UN says Covid-19 pandemic created an 'unparalleled' employment crisisThe employment report published by the US labour department showed that 559,000 jobs were added by American employers in May, which is twice that of April. Although employment is still far below pre-pandemic levels, data shows that the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.8% from the earlier 6.1% while online job postings, too, shot up 27% at the end of May from their level in February last year. The number of people who have been out of work for at least six months is also falling — the report shows that the number has dropped to 3.8 million, approximately 40% of the total.President Joe Biden took the opportunity to claim credit for what he calls "historic progress" in job gains, accounting for the success of his vaccination campaign and $1.9 trillion economic aid deployed in March. "None of this success is an accident, it isn't," Biden was quoted as saying. He lauded the American people for responding to Covid-19 related protocols and calls for vaccination. The "American rescue plan", he said, also played a major role in this success.Also Read: One in three US workers changed or lost jobs in past yearThe employment report, however, contains some less encouraging bits which have become cannon fodder for Republicans looking to train their guns on the Democratic regime. Even though job growth has seen some uneven patches over the past couple of months, the labour force participation rate has steadily caved in, which shows that several workers who dropped out of the workforce during the pandemic have still not returned.It also showed that although Americans across all race and gender were gradually gaining their jobs back, Black and Hispanic women especially found themselves lagging in these areas. Employment of Black women went on a 7% decline since February 2020, while that of Hispanic women was down 7.2%.With the US labour force participation rate falling to 61.6%, Republicans blamed Biden's aid package, alleging that lucrative unemployment benefits -- $300-per-week supplemental package -- are actually "discouraging" workers from returning to their jobs. Debunking these allegations, though, White House economists have said that there's currently no sufficient evidence to suggest that the supplement was discouraging workers from seeking back employment. This phenomenon, they said, could also be accounted to factors like school closures or child care issues which, for example, could theoretically have kept women with children from returning to work, but reiterated that further studies are needed to ascertain the legitimate causes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-adds-over-half-million-jobs-in-may-biden-claims-historic-progress-101622825371027.html
04-06-2021||World||US Senate Republicans reject Biden infrastructure plan, prep new offer||Senate Republicans on Friday panned President Joe Biden's latest infrastructure proposal and are expected to make a new offer as talks grind toward next week's deadline for progress on a bipartisan deal.Speaking after the release of a modest May jobs report, Biden made the case for his robust investment package to push the economy past the Covid-19 crisis and downturn, and into a new era.“Now is the time to build on the progress we’ve made,” Biden told reporters from Rehoboth Beach, Maryland. “We need to make those investments today to continue to succeed tomorrow."Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has indicated that Biden will look to act without Republican support if there is no consensus when Congress returns from its Memorial Day break.While Biden and the GOP senators have narrowed the price gap between his initial $2.3 trillion proposal and the GOP's $568 billion opening bid, they remain far apart on how to pay for what could be a compromise $1 trillion investment.Republicans are showing no interest in Biden's latest proposal for a 15% corporate minimum tax rate that would ensure all companies pay something in taxes, rather than allowing so many write-offs or deductions that they contribute zero to the treasury.A Republican familiar with the talks and granted anonymity to discuss the private assessment said the GOP senators view Biden's latest idea as an unnecessary tax hike.Instead, Republicans led by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, are poised to submit a revised offer when she talks with Biden again Friday, the person said. They will insist on using untapped Covid-19 relief funds to pay for the infrastructure investments, the Republican said. Biden's team has rejected that approach.Still, neither Biden nor the GOP senators appear ready to call off talks, even as Democrats lay the groundwork to use budget rules to pass any big package on their own, without Republican votes.On Friday, House Democrats released a plan for spending $547 billion over the next five years on road, mass transit and rail projects, a blueprint of their priorities and a potential building block for Biden's broader package.The proposal from Rep. Peter DeFazio, the Democratic chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, continues existing programs set to expire and adds key pieces of the larger measure Biden is negotiating with Republicans.DeFazio’s legislation, a reauthorization of surface transportation programs set to expire Sept. 30, doesn’t address how to pay for the projects. He called the effort a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to move our transportation planning out of the 1950s and toward our clean energy future.”In addition to Biden's proposed a 15% minimum tax on corporations — there's no minimum tax now on corporate profits — he envisions additional revenues from increased IRS enforcement. He is seeking roughly $1 trillion in new infrastructure spending. Senate Republicans have countered with only $257 billion in additional spending.The House bill would authorize up to $343 billion for roads, bridges and safety improvements. Another $109 billion would go to public transit programs and $95 billion would go to freight and passenger rail system, including a tripling of funding for Amtrak.DeFazio’s bill is not expected to attract much GOP support, as Republicans unveiled their own legislation recently that would authorize about $400 billion over five years for road, bridge and transit programs.Republicans on the House panel panned the bill in a statement. “Instead of working with Republicans to find common ground on a bill that could earn strong bipartisan support – something our Senate counterparts did successfully last month – this bill moves even further to the left to appease the most progressive members in the Majority’s party."A Senate panel recently passed its version of the highway bill unanimously, but the lawmakers didn’t have to vote yet on how they would pay for it, a focal point of negotiations between GOP senators and the White House.Business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable have called on lawmakers to continue negotiations and work toward a bipartisan compromise.But some Democrats have questioned the merits of that approach and are already unhappy with some of the compromises that Biden has offered. They support using a process that would allow Democrats to pass an infrastructure boost with a simple majority, which they did through a Covid-19 relief measure that delivered $1,400 payments to most Americans.“Getting Republicans on board is not necessary. Getting the American people back on their feet is,” Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., said Thursday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-republicans-reject-biden-infrastructure-plan-prep-new-offer-101622827415022.html

The community shares strong cultural and family bonds with India.The Opposition parties have filed a petition against Oli's move to dissolve the House in the Supreme Court.Nepal President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the 275-member House of Representatives on May 22 for the second time in five months and announced snap elections on November 12 and November 19 on the advice of Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, heading a minority government.As many as 146 members of the dissolved House, including Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, who had staked a claim to form the new government under Article 76 (5) of the Constitution, have also filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking reinstatement of the House.President Bhandari rejected the separate bids of both Prime Minister Oli and the Opposition alliance's claims to form a new government, saying the “claims were insufficient.”Earlier on December 20, the president dissolved Parliament and called snap polls on April 30 and May 10. However, two months later, Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana-led Constitutional Bench on February 23 overturned the decision and reinstated the House of Representatives.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20, last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda'.

But it has also been criticized by those, including Republican lawmakers and some free-expression advocates, who saw the Trump ban as a disturbing act of censorship.Trump's suspension was the first time Facebook had blocked a current president, prime minister or head of state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-suspends-donald-trump-s-account-for-two-years-101622825952153.html
04-06-2021||World||India likely to get largest share of US vaccines||India is expected to get possibly the largest share of the 25 million Covid-19 vaccine doses that the United States announced it will send to partner countries and those dealing with ongoing surges. India figures in two categories of prospective recipient countries.Out of the 25 million doses, 19 million will go through Covax, the WHO-led initiative for global equitable distribution, to countries earmarked by the US. Of this, 7 million will go to Asia, including India and 15 other countries, according to a factsheet issued by the White House.India also figures on a list of recipient countries described by the US as “regional partners and partner recipients”, which also include Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Egypt, Jordan, Ukraine, Georgia and Gaza - 7 million doses have been set aside for this group. India was not in this category in the first factsheet, leading to some confusion because it was included in that category in a statement issued by President Joe Biden. An updated factsheet has India in this category. No country-specific numbers have been released by the US.Taranjit Singh Sandhu, the Indian ambassador to the US, told Hindustan Times, “The vaccine allocation announcement by US and the telephone call between Indian PM and VP Kamala Harris reflect the firm commitment of the leadership of both India and US to work in partnership on global issues.”US Vice-President Harris had called Prime Minister Narendra Modi and three other world leaders to personally notify them of the US allocation plan on Thursday, before the announcement. “I deeply appreciate the assurance of vaccine supplies to India as part of the US Strategy for Global Vaccine Sharing,” Modi had said in a tweet, adding, “I also thanked her for all the support and solidarity from the US government, businesses and Indian diaspora.”President Biden has pledged to share 80 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines with countries that need them - 60 million of AstraZeneca (called Covishield in India), which the US doesn’t intend to use and 20 million of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s - by the end of June.The Biden administration announced the allocation plan for 25 million of 80 million on Thursday, promising, as national security adviser Jake Sullivan has said, “the United States will not use its vaccines to secure favours from other countries”. It was a thinly disguised shot at Russia and China, who, the Americans say, have distributed vaccines seeking to advance their own interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-likely-to-get-large-share-of-us-vaccines-101622825358194.html

But they warned it could be suspended if there is backtracking on progress made in human rights, especially those of women and girls.“As the United States withdraws military forces from Afghanistan, our enduring commitment is clear. We remain engaged through our full diplomatic, economic, and assistance toolkit to support the peaceful, stable future the Afghan people want and deserve,” the State Department said in a statement.  The $266 million in new assistance brings to nearly $3.9 billion the total amount of such aid provided by the United States since 2002, the statement said.The funds will help support some of the estimated 18 million Afghans in need, including more than 4.8 million who are internally displaced, 115,000 of whom have been driven from their homes by fighting this year alone, it said.The funds, it continued, will go to providing shelter, job opportunities, basic healthcare, emergency food, water, sanitation, and hygienic services in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.It also will support protection programs for “the most vulnerable Afghans,” including women and girls “facing particular risks, including gender-based violence,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-more-than-266-million-in-new-humanitarian-aid-for-afghanistan-101622824286232.html

04-06-2021||World||Covid origin: What do we know about Wuhan CDC cave expedition in search of viruses?||A video, meant to promote China’s world-leading viral research, was aired in December 2019 by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV and was widely circulated on social media. The video titled ‘Youth In the Wild - Invisible Defender’ shows researchers scaling cavern walls in search of unknown viruses and the basis of new vaccines. Tian Junhua, one of the bat hunters, boasts about the extreme efforts taken to discover new viruses, calling the caves their “main battlefields.”“Among all the known creatures, the bats are rich in various viruses inside. You can find most viruses responsible for human diseases like Rabies, Sars, and Ebola. Accordingly, the caves frequented by bats became our main battlefields,” says Tian, a researcher at Wuhan Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in the over seven-minute-long video.“If our skin is exposed, it can easily come in contact with bat excrement and contaminated matter, which means this is quite risky,” he continues, as background music enhances the dramatic effect.While the researcher was shown in the video handling sample vials without wearing full protective equipment, he underscores the need for caution during such expedition, saying, “It is while discovering new viruses that we are most at risk of infection.” The high-quality video was aired around the time when Wuhan residents started turning up at hospitals with pneumonia-like symptoms.Also Read | Anthony Fauci calls on China to release medical records of Wuhan lab workersWhat do we know about the expedition?According to a Washington Post report, Wuhan CDC, the health agency that oversaw China’s early pandemic response, has not disclosed to the world if they found any viruses in the caves, frequented by bats, during the particular expedition shown in the video. It is not even clear when that expedition took place.The hypothesis of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 through a laboratory incident has gained credence in recent weeks, with a renewed demand for a new “transparent” investigation into the virus origin. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, the Wuhan CDC, which moved a laboratory on December 2, 2019, denied disruptions or incidents caused by the move. It also denied any storage or laboratory activities involving bat viruses before the coronavirus outbreak.“[A] stance hard to reconcile with Tian’s boasts in the video about having visited dozens of bat caves and studied 300 types of virus vectors,” the Post said in its report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-origin-what-do-we-know-about-wuhan-cdc-expedition-in-search-of-viruses-101622819353984.html

On Friday, the demonstrators held candlelight vigils and shouted slogans outside Dhaka’s Baitul Mukarram Mosque. One of the banners used during the candlelight visit read “Genocide Day”.On June 4, 1989, hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers suppressed student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing in a bloody crackdown, now remembered as the Tiananmen Square massacre. Since then, China has not allowed any discussion on the mainland of its bloody crackdown. With increased powers under China’s draconian national security law, Hong Kong, a former British colony, has also extended the ban on any discussion or commemoration of the massacre.US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Thursday honoured the "sacrifices of those killed 32 years ago, and the brave activists who carry on their efforts today in the face of ongoing government repression." "Named after the nearby Gate of Heavenly Peace, the square is instead synonymous with the brutal actions by the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1989 to silence tens of thousands of individuals advocating to have a say in their government and exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms," Blinken said in a statement.Also Read | China uses coercive policies in Xinjiang to drive down Uyghur birth rates: ReportThe Bangladeshi demonstrators were also seen wearing blue masks to highlight gross human rights violations, including suppression of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region.Several leaked documents have revealed China’s brutal and systematic crackdown on Uyghurs in which they have called it a “struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism”.

Many got scared," Lang Khan Khai from the Zomi Care and Development aid group told Reuters from the town of Tonzang, just over 20 km (13 miles) from the border with India. "People rarely go out."Reuters was unable to reach the health ministry for comment.Medics are concerned that few cases are being detected. The ratio of confirmed infections to tests rose to over 11% on Thursday - the highest since just before the last big peak in cases.Coronavirus testing collapsed after the coup as many health workers joined a civil disobedience movement to protest against the junta that ousted elected ruler Aung San Suu Kyi, whose government had brought two waves of infection under control.Tests averaged just over 1,500 a day in the seven days to Friday compared with well over 17,000 in the week before the coup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-cases-spike-in-myanmar-after-outbreak-near-indian-border-101622821934680.html
04-06-2021||World||WHO warns of June-July Covax doses shortfall||The World Health Organization said Friday a shortfall in Covid-19 vaccine doses going through the Covax programme in June and July could undermine the efficiency of the roll-out.Covax was set up to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, particularly to low-income countries, and has already delivered more than 80 million doses to 129 territories.But that is "about 200 million doses behind where we want to be", Bruce Aylward, the WHO's Covax frontman, told reporters in Geneva.So while wealthy countries had pledged to give some 150 million doses so far -- on top of the doses Covax procures with donated funds -- that would not resolve the problem."We are setting up for failure if we don't get early doses. We are not on track yet: we don't have enough doses from enough countries early enough to get the world on track to get out of this," Aylward said.While the pledges to donate 150 million doses through Covax was a "great start", Aylward said there were "two big problems"."Number one, very little is committed to the June-July period, which means we're going to still have this gap," Aylward said."The other problem is just the volume. If we are going to get on track to get at least 30-40 percent of the world population vaccinated this year we got to get another 250 million people vaccinated between now and the end of September."- Supply problems -Covax is an international scheme co-led by the WHO, Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.It intends to procure enough vaccines for 30 percent of the population in 92 of the poorest participating territories -- 20 percent in India -- with donors covering the cost.Covax has been hit by inequalities in the global vaccine roll-out, but also delivery delays.AstraZeneca shots making up 97 percent of doses supplied so far -- the rest being Pfizer-BioNTech.The Serum Institute of India, producing AstraZeneca doses, was to have been the backbone of Covax's supply chain. However, New Delhi restricted vaccine exports to combat a devastating domestic surge.SII said Wednesday that it hoped to resume supplies to Covax over the next few months.Covax was set up to combat the likelihood of rich countries buying up most available vaccine doses -- which occurred as predicted.On Thursday, the world hit the milestone of two billion Covid-19 vaccines having been injected around the world, according to an AFP count.But of those doses, 37 percent have been administered in high-income countries accounting for 16 percent of the global population.Just 0.3 percent have been administered in the 29 lowest-income countries, home to nine percent of the world's people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-of-june-july-covax-doses-shortfall-101622815901574.html

Compensation could be kept to a minimum to ensure affordable prices.Medical humanitarian group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said the EU proposal was pushing only voluntary action by companies rather than the concrete legal solution a waiver would offer.It added the existing "compulsory licensing" had critical shortcomings and that the EU plan was limited to vaccines.(Reporting by Philip BlenkinsopEditing by Mark Heinrich and Andrew Heavens)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-resists-patent-waiver-on-covid-19-vaccines-submits-three-part-plan-to-wto-101622814139996.html
04-06-2021||World||US yet to fix country-specific vaccine allocation, FDA nod for AstraZeneca jabs likely soon||The US is yet to decide country-specific allocations for the first tranche of 25 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines it will donate though figures will be determined in consultation with governments and the WHO-backed COVAX facility, a top American official said on Friday. Gayle Smith, the state department coordinator for the global Covid-19 response, told a virtual news briefing that the US will match donations from its surplus stock of vaccines to doses used by countries in their national immunisation programmes. Smith declined to set a timeframe for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) giving its approval for the 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine the US plans to donate, but said the American side is hopeful the clearance will come soon. President Joe Biden on Thursday unveiled US plans for sharing the first tranche of 25 million doses out of a total of 80 million doses around the world, with 75% or 19 million doses to be rolled out through COVAX. This includes seven million doses for Asia, six million for South and Central America and five million for Africa. The US will share another six million doses directly with partners, and India is the only country expected to get doses both directly and through COVAX. Smith said, “In terms of the actual number of doses, we’ve done some notional planning but the refinement of the actual dose numbers will be determined in consultation with governments and their health experts, the state of their vaccine plans and delivery, and with COVAX. “So we want to be careful about putting a number out there out because we want to work all of those pieces to make sure we’ve got the numbers right. But I think they will be substantial numbers.” With the first tranche comprising Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, Smith said the US “will be trying to match vaccines to [national] vaccine programmes where we can” so that the doses can be effectively deployed. The US will also take into account factors such as regulatory approvals and cold chain facilities, she said. Smith said the US’s ability to roll out its surplus stocks of AstraZeneca vaccines will depend on clearance from the FDA. Since the FDA is an autonomous regulatory public health agency, the administration cannot interfere in its work, she noted. “So we are hopeful we will get a clearance soon. We are not in a position to say when that will come through because that’s the purview of the FDA,” she said. In response to a question from a journalist from Bhutan, which carried out the first round of its vaccination programme with AstraZeneca jabs donated by India but now has no vaccines for its second round, Smith said the US is aware of this issue and the AstraZeneca doses will be key to addressing the matter. “Many countries are in urgent need of vaccines, this is only the beginning. We have in excess of 60 million doses to deploy,” she said. Jeremy Konyndyk, the executive director of the USAID Covid-19 task force, who also addressed the briefing, said the donation of 25 million doses will play an important role in helping COVAX manage some of its supply gaps and tide over a shortage of jabs. COVAX is a key partner in the equitable distribution of doses because of its logistics for global distribution and legal regulatory agreements with various countries, he said. He, however, acknowledged it will take “quite a while to vaccinate the world” and said the US, in the interim, will help countries tackle surges through funding for diagnostics to detect and manage transmissions and for bolstering health systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-yet-to-fix-country-specific-vaccine-allocation-fda-nod-for-astrazeneca-jabs-likely-soon-101622814677428.html
04-06-2021||World||Putin invites foreign nationals to visit Russia for Covid shot||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday praised his country's response to the Covid-19 pandemic and called for a stronger global response to global warming.Putin's speech at an economic forum in St. Petersburg came less than two weeks before his summit with United States President Joe Biden. U.S. and Russian officials said the agenda of the June 16 meeting in Geneva will likely include climate change and efforts to counter the coronavirus among other issues.Addressing the forum, Putin lauded the efficiency of Russian-designed vaccines and bemoaned what he described as “politically-motivated bans” in some countries on their purchase.Last year, Russia boasted of being the first in the world to authorize a coronavirus vaccine, but it has since moved slowly in getting its population immunized. The slack pace of vaccination has been partly attributed to public skepticism about the vaccines amid controversial signals from the authorities.Experts have questioned whether Russia will be able to meet the government’s target of vaccinating more than 30 million of the country’s 146 million people by mid-June, and nearly 69 million by August.Putin on Friday again urged the Russians to move more quickly to get the shots, noting that the Russia-designed vaccines have been “proven to be the safest and most efficient” and emphasizing that there have been no fatalities linked to their use.Putin invited foreign nationals to visit Russia to get the coronavirus shots, saying he would instruct the government to move quickly to facilitate that.In his speech, Putin also emphasized the need to strengthen the international response to climate change, noting that melting permafrost has mounted a major challenge to Russia's Arctic regions.“We have entire cities built on permafrost,” he said. “What will happen if it all starts melting?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-invites-foreign-nationals-to-visit-russia-for-covid-shot-101622812339918.html

"Suddenly, [they] disappeared and none of them answered my phone...They didn't message me at all. I tried to send a message. None of them responded," he told Al Jazeera.Hussein believes that his 85-year-old father, mother and siblings have been transferred to what he describes as a "concentration camp" - large-scale detention centres that have reportedly detained over one million Uyghur Muslims.The president of the Uyghur Association of Victoria, Alim Osman, said at a recent parliamentary inquiry there were about 5,000 Uyghurs living in Australia, with about 1,500 of them thought to be in Adelaide, a city of 1.3 million people on the south coast. Out of these, many Uyghurs living in Australia have similar stories of loved ones being detained or disappearing together.Mayila Yakufu, the elder sister of Marhaba Yakub Salay, another Australian citizen of Uyghur ethnicity, is also currently imprisoned in Xinjiang for the second time, reported Al Jazeera.Yakufu was was first detained for 10 months in 2017, though she did not say where she had been."She didn't say anything, but she said, 'Don't worry about us - the Chinese Communist Party is looking after us very well," Salay said, adding that he believed she was calling from another location under government supervision.That was the last time they spoke and in May 2019, Yakufu was arrested again. She was arrested "on suspicion of financing terrorist activities", according to an email from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) - which Al Jazeera has seen.This money, Salay said, was not for terrorism, but to buy a home. "It's black and white evidence - but the Chinese government still accuses my sister of supporting terrorism overseas," he said.Salay further believed that such charges have been invented by the Chinese government for the purposes of detaining her Uighur sister, with the DFAT email stating her sister was likely to be held "in a traditional prison, rather than a re-education camp".Almas Nizanidin, another resident in Australia, said his wife Buzainafu Abudourexiti was sentenced to seven years to prison in 2017 on what he says is "no charge" and with "no evidence".Nizanidin had planned to return to China to help his wife emigrate to Australia, where he has been living since 2009, but she was interned before he could do so, and he has no knowledge of her whereabouts, Al Jazeera reported.He also said that his mother - a 55-year-old high school maths teacher - was also arrested and sent to a detention centre for more than two years. Though she was eventually released last year, Nizanidin maintained that his mother would not say anything about her experience.Hussein, Salay and Nizanidin all said that the Australian federal government has provided support for investigations into what has happened to their loved ones.Amid the backdrop of China's gross human rights violations against ethnic minorities, relations between Beijing and Canberra have also spiralled downwards.Tensions between China and Australia have escalated over a slew of issues which have now led to a point where the Chinese state-media threatened ballistic missile strikes if Canberra gets involved in a potential military conflict over Taiwan.Meanwhile, China has also been globally rebuked for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities, and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-uyghurs-in-despair-over-disappearance-of-relatives-in-china-101622802285828.html
04-06-2021||World||Explained: What is 'ranked-choice voting,' the new system for New York's mayoral election?||When New York City voters go to the polls on June 22 to select their party's mayoral nominee, they will fill out a new kind of ballot that allows them to pick up to five candidates in order of preference in a system known as ranked-choice voting.What is ranked-choice voting (RCV)?Most U.S. elections are "winner-take-all": the candidate with the most votes wins even if he or she falls short of 50%. Under RCV, voters can rank multiple contenders instead of choosing just one.Dozens of cities, including San Francisco, Minneapolis and Salt Lake City, use RCV for local elections. Maine began using it statewide in 2018, and Alaska will implement it for all state and federal general elections starting next year, including the 2024 presidential race.Countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Ireland use a form of RCV. Members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have for more than a decade voted for the Best Picture Oscar using this preferential system.How will the system work in New York?RCV was approved in New York by voter referendum in 2019 and first used in special city council elections earlier this year.In New York's mayoral election, voters can list up to five names. That will allow more flexibility in particular for Democratic voters, who are choosing from a crowded field of more than a dozen candidates.Ballots are tabulated in what may best be described as a series of instant runoffs. In the first round, if any candidate receives 50% or the vote, he or she is declared the winner, and the election is over.If not, the candidate who finished in last place is eliminated, and any ballots that had him or her as the top choice are reallocated to the No. 2 candidate on each ballot. The votes are counted once again. If no candidate has yet reached 50%, the candidate in last place is eliminated, and his or her ballots reallocated, and so on, until someone exceeds 50%.RCV will be used in the primary elections for mayor, comptroller, public advocate, borough president and city council. Judicial contests and the race for Manhattan district attorney will use the traditional winner-take-all system.Though some preliminary results may be available on the night of June 22, the mayoral nominees likely won't be known for weeks. Absentee ballots, which are expected to be widely used, can legally arrive up to a week after Election Day, and voters are allowed to "cure" any errors until July 9, which could delay the tabulation of voters' ranked choices.What are the arguments in favor of RCV?First, voters can freely cast ballots for their favorite candidate, without worrying about "wasting" votes on someone who is unlikely to win."In a ranked-choice voting system, voters do not have to settle for the lesser of two evils," said Susan Lerner, the executive director of the good government group Common Cause New York. "You don't have to worry that the polls tell you this person has no chance."Some advocates say RCV encourages more diverse candidates, possibly because voters may be more willing to support them if they know they can include more choices. Research shows RCV elections feature more candidates of color, according to FairVote, a nonprofit group that favors the system.RCV can have a positive effect on campaigns, Lerner said. Candidates may be less inclined to attack their opponents to avoid alienating any supporters who might be willing to rank them second, third or fourth.RCV also ensures the eventual winner must appear on a majority of ballots, providing an incentive for campaigns to reach out to voters across demographic and geographical lines for the broadest possible appeal, rather than relying on a political base that may only represent a plurality of voters, Lerner said.Are there any concerns?Some voters may find the new ballot confusing, said Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham University."I'm incredibly concerned, and I've been ringing the alarm for months now," she said.Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration announced a $15 million voter education initiative in April. Lerner is overseeing an education campaign, Rank the Vote NYC, that has reached tens of thousands of voters, she said.Some academics have noted that RCV can lead to "exhausted ballots," in which a voter's candidates are all eliminated before the last round of tabulation and thus are not included in the final tally. Others have argued that a more complicated process could decrease voter turnout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-is-ranked-choice-voting-the-new-system-for-new-york-s-mayoral-election-101622802261764.html

The team, led by researchers from the Francis Crick Institute in the UK, determined neutralising antibodies in the blood of 250 healthy individuals, who had received either one or two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, against five SARS-CoV-2 strains.Across all variants of concern, the researchers found lower levels of these antibodies with increasing age, while no correlation was observed for sex or body-mass index. They, however, also noted that the levels of antibodies alone do not predict vaccine efficacy against the variants and that prospective population studies are also needed.The research paper was published on the backdrop of the UK's decision to reduce the gap between two doses of vaccine to address the concerns about the spread of the B.1.617 variant, named by the World Health Organization (WHO) as ‘Delta’. The study supports the UK's current vaccination plan since the researchers found that people are less likely to develop the level of neutralising antibodies against the Delta variant as high as those seen against B.1.1.7, or the Alpha variant, first found in Kent.Also Read | Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine approved for 12 to 15-year-olds in UKHere are some of the key findings:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-covid-jab-produces-less-antibodies-against-delta-variant-lancet-study-101622809201346.html
04-06-2021||World||German cardinal offers to quit over Church's 'mishandling' of sexual abuse cases||A leading German cardinal and confidante of Pope Francis, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, offered to resign Friday over the Catholic Church's mishandling of clergy sexual abuse cases, declaring in an extraordinary public gesture that the church had arrived at “a dead end."The archdiocese of Munich and Freising, where Marx serves as archbishop, published his resignation letter to the pope online, in multiple languages, and the cardinal said Francis had given him permission to make it public.“It is important to me to share the responsibility for the catastrophe of the sexual abuse by Church officials over the past decades," the 67-year-old Marx wrote in the letter. But he also issued a challenge of sorts for his fellow bishops to use the opportunity of the scandal to save the church and reform it.There was no immediate comment from the Vatican, where Marx sits on powerful financial and political bodies. A Vatican spokesman said that information about resignations is announced in a daily bulletin, and Friday's edition did not mention Marx. The German cardinal noted that Francis had told him to “keep performing my service as bishop until his decision is made."Marx, who led the German Bishops' Conference from 2014 until 2020, wrote that investigations during the last decade showed there had been “a lot of personal failures and administrative mistakes but also institutional or ‘systemic’ failure.”In 2018, a church-commissioned report concluded that at least 3,677 people were abused by clergy in Germany between 1946 and 2014. More than half of the victims were 13 or younger when the abuse took place, and nearly a third of them were altar boys, according to the report.Earlier this year, another report came out about the church officials' handling of alleged sexual abuse in the country’s western Cologne diocese. The archbishop of Hamburg, a former Cologne church official who was faulted in that report, offered his resignation to the pope and was granted a “time out” of unspecified length.Marx himself has not been implicated in any of the investigative reports to date, but he said all members of the hierarchy shared blame for the failures. A report is expected this summer about the handling of sexual abuse cases in Marx’s archdiocese, German news agency dpa reported.In his letter to the pope, Marx said that his offer to resign could be seen as “a personal signal for a new beginning, for a new awakening of the Church, not only in Germany.”“I would like to show that not the ministry is in the foreground but the mission of the Gospel,” he added.Marx’s offer to resign was an extraordinary gesture and laid bare the credibility crisis that the sexual abuse scandal created in Germany, as it has in other countries. To try to recover that credibility, Marx has spearheaded a process of reform and debate with the powerful German laity to address the structural problems that contributed to abuse being allowed to fester unchecked for decades.But the so-called “Synodal Path” has sparked fierce resistance inside Germany and out, primarily from conservative bishops and priests opposed to opening any debate on issues such as priestly celibacy, women’s role in the church and homosexuality.Resistance has also come from the Vatican and bishops outside Germany, including culture warriors in the United States who have broken with church protocol to pen essays critical of the reform process under way in Germany.In his letter, Marx made no mention of his status as a member of Francis’ kitchen cabinet, a group of cardinal advisers who have been meeting regularly to draft a new reform of the Vatican hierarchy and who advise the pontiff on other matters.The head of a powerful laypersons' organization, the Central Committee of German Catholics, or ZdK, said he was “deeply shocked” by the cardinal's offer.“The wrong person is leaving," ZdK President Thomas Sternberg told Germany's Rheinische Post newspaper. “What Marx did for ecumenical Christianity, for the Synodal Path and also when it comes to the processing of sexual abuse (revelations) is very important.”The ZdK has participated in the Synodal Path meetings for more than a year with the German Bishops' Conference. The meetings. which are set to conclude in the fall, feature discussions about allowing priests to get married, the ordination of women and a different understanding of sexuality, among other reforms. The process was launched as part of the response to revelations of clergy sexual abuse.The head of the German Bishops' Conference, Limburg Bishop Georg Baetzing, expressed respect for Marx’s decision.“His resignation offer makes clear that the church in Germany needs to continue the Synodal Path,” Baetzing said in a written statement. “The Synodal Path was created to look for systemic answers to the crisis. The basic, theological discussions which determine the Synodal Path are therefore a significant and important part of this process.”Other top cardinals and bishops previously offered to resign for more direct involvement in abuse-related failings, only to see Francis sit on the decision for some time.French Cardinal Philippe Barbarin offered to resign in 2019 after a French court convicted him of failing to report a pedophile priest. Francis refused to accept the resignation pending the outcome of Barbarin’s appeal, though he eventually accepted it the following year, by which time Barbarin had been acquitted.Francis allowed Australian Cardinal George Pell, his economics minister, to take an extended leave of absence in 2017 to return home to face trial for old sexual abuse charges. Pell’s conviction was overturned by Australia’s High Court last year, but by that time, Pell was just a year shy of retirement age and Francis had already named a successor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-cardinal-offers-to-quit-over-church-s-mishandling-of-sexual-abuse-cases-101622808460807.html

"These are the big manufacturers and it may be that we will start the first trials in Arab countries combining Sputnik with a number of Chinese vaccines," Kirill Dmitriev was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency.A combination trial using the Sputnik V vaccine and the AstraZeneca jab has already been conducted and no negative side effects have been reported so far, Russian news agency Interfax reported.Dmitriev also said Russia expects the World Health Organization (WHO) to approve the Sputnik V vaccine within two months. He said the European Medicines Agency (EMA) which is also reviewing Sputnik V "was provided with all basic existing information, there is no critical remarks for now at all".RDIF helped finance the production of the Sputnik V vaccine and also markets the shot around the world, and so far it has been approved for use in over 60 countries worldwide. EMA, WHO and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are yet to approve the jab.The Sputnik V vaccine is the first foreign-made vaccine to be approved in India and is currently being distributed in the country by Dr Reddy's Laboratories. On Thursday, the Serum Institute of India (SII) applied for a test license to manufacture Sputnik V in the country.RDIF claims that Sputnik V demonstrates the efficacy of 79.4 per cent when administered in a single dose and 91.6 per cent when administered in two doses. However, many US universities have asked students to get re-vaccinated with a WHO-approved vaccine if they have been administered Sputnik or India’s Covaxin, before colleges in the US open for the fall semester, news agency ANI reported on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-may-start-trial-of-covid-19-vaccine-combining-sputnik-v-chinese-shots-rdif-chief-101622802826356.html

04-06-2021||World||US students who took Covaxin, Sputnik V, asked to get re-vaccinated||Since March, over 400 US colleges and universities have announced students get Covid-19 vaccinations, ahead of the Autumn semester but those who have been inoculated with India's indigenous Covaxin or the Russian-made Sputnik V are being asked to re-vaccinate as these vaccines have not yet been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).Rukmini Callimachi reports in the The New York Times that Milloni Doshi, a 25-year-old student from India, who is due to start her master's degree this fall at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, has been administered two doses of Covaxin. Now, Columbia has told her that she will need to be revaccinated with a different vaccine once she arrives on campus."I am just concerned about taking two different vaccines. They said the application process would be the toughest part of the cycle, but it's really been all of this that has been uncertain and anxiety-inducing," Doshi wrote via a messaging app.Campuses are proposing different measures, out of which the more complicated scenario is if students received a vaccine that has not been approved by the WHO, like Sputnik or Covaxin. Many colleges are proposing that those students will need to be revaccinated, which presents both medical and logistical conundrums.This is primarily because no data exists on whether combing vaccines from different companies is safe. "Since Covid-19 vaccines are not interchangeable, the safety and effectiveness of receiving two different Covid-19 vaccines have not been studied," said Kristen Nordlund, spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Nordlund also advised that people vaccinated outside the US with a vaccine not authorised by WHO should wait for a minimum of 28 days before taking the first dose of one of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-sanctioned vaccines.American students have access to the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, three of the eight doses authorised by the global health body. This disparity could hinder colleges that have made it a major priority to retain international students, who brought in close to USD 39 billion in tuition dollars in the year before the pandemic, according to an analysis."Universities want to enroll international students because they add diversity to the campus community -- and they bring money... It's why this has been a subject of intense discussion," said Terry W Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education.According to The New York Times, the situation is particularly challenging for students from India, which sends around 200,000 international students to American colleges every year. It is becoming increasingly hard to secure an appointment for a vaccine that will be accepted by American campuses."Every day, we get 10 to 15 messages and inquiries, saying 'What does this mean? How does this impact me?'" said Sudhanshu Kaushik, who runs the North American Association of Indian Students, which is working to help fellow students.Indiana University's vice president for international affairs, Hannah Buxbaum, said that the administrators of the institution are working overtime to answer the roughly 200 phone calls and 300 emails that are pouring in every day from the university's roughly 6,000 students overseas."Ringing off the hook doesn't begin to describe. There is no question that there is anxiety and concern among our international students," she said.Many universities are only accepting the students who have been vaccinated with a WHO-approved Covid-19 vaccine. At Columbia, where one-third of the student body is from overseas, international students will be asked to present either their WHO booklet or a letter from a physician confirming they have received the requisite doses of one of the vaccines vetted by the world body, said Donna Lynne, the chief operating officer of the university's medical centre.Callimachi writes for The New York Times that those who will not succeed in securing a vaccine before the start of the fall semester are facing a potentially problematic process.Many universities were vague on how they plan to deal with the logistical complexity of spacing out these unrelated vaccines, beyond saying that they planned to accommodate students undergoing this process, reports The New York Times.At least six regional governments in India have announced emergency clinics in the past week to vaccine students going to US universities, in wake of mounting pressure from confused and anxious students, wrote Callimachi.However, Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech on Thursday said that biopharmaceutical company Ocugen Inc will have exclusive co-development, manufacturing, and commercialisation rights of its Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin in Canada, in addition to its existing United States rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-students-who-took-covaxin-sputnik-v-asked-to-get-revaccinated-101622799821644.html

The agreement could revive supersonic passenger travel, which was wound down in 2003 with the retirement of the Anglo-French Concorde.Under the agreement, United Airlines will purchase 15 ‘Overture’ airliners, a supersonic aircraft with 65 to 88 seats, from Boom Supersonic once the aircraft meets safety, operating and sustainability requirements. The Chicago-based American airline will also have an option to buy an additional 35 aircraft.Overture airliners are slated to roll out in 2025, fly in 2026 and expected to carry passengers by 2029. The supersonic jet is expected to be the first large commercial aircraft to be net-zero carbon from day one.

DeJoy previously served as chief executive at North Carolina-based New Breed Logistics.The Washington Post first reported the investigation. FBI agents have interviewed current and former DeJoy and New Breed Logistics employees and have issued a subpoena to DeJoy, the Post reported.The Post reported last year that some New Breed Logistics employees said they were pressured by DeJoy or his aides to attend fundraisers or make political contributions to Republicans and then were repaid through bonuses. DeJoy in congressional testimony denied making such reimbursements, calling it an "outrageous claim." New Breed was sold to XPO Logistics Inc in 2014.Mark Corallo, a DeJoy spokesman, said in a statement that DeJoy "learned that the Department of Justice is investigating campaign contributions made by employees who worked for him when he was in the private sector. He has always been scrupulous in his adherence to the campaign contribution laws and has never knowingly violated them."Corallo said DeJoy "intends to work with DOJ toward swiftly resolving it."The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A USPS representative declined to comment.The chairwoman of the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Committee, Carolyn Maloney, said if the allegations are true DeJoy "must resign immediately." She called on the postal board "to immediately disclose what information it had about these allegations and whether it has reviewed them."Some Democrats last year accused DeJoy of making service changes with the intention of impeding the delivery of mail-in ballots for November's presidential election to help Trump, which DeJoy denied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-postal-service-chief-faces-fbi-probe-over-campaign-fundraising-101622796569755.html
04-06-2021||World||UN agency for Palestinian refugees withdraws director from Gaza after threats||The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says it has recalled its Gaza director after he faced threats over remarks in which he appeared to praise Israel's “huge sophistication” in carrying out precision strikes during last month's Gaza war.UNRWA, which provides essential health, education and other services in the territory, said late Thursday that it was “seriously concerned” about the threats, including a “very large protest” outside its Gaza headquarters on Monday.It said Gaza director Matthias Schmale and his deputy have been recalled to UNRWA's headquarters in east Jerusalem for “consultations.” The agency cited media reports that “Palestinian factions” had declared Schmale and his deputy persona non grata in Gaza but said it received no formal notification to that effect.In an interview with Israel's Channel 12 TV last month, Schmale was asked about Israeli officials' assertions that airstrikes carried out during the 11-day war with the territory's militant Hamas rulers were "very precise."“I'm not a military expert but I would not dispute that," Schmale replied, adding that there was “huge sophistication” in how Israel struck targets. But he also said colleagues told him the strikes were “much more vicious in their impact” than in the 2014 Gaza war.Schmale later expressed regret over the remarks and said any civilian deaths were unacceptable.“Many people were killed or have been severely injured by direct strikes or collateral damage from strikes,” he tweeted. “In a place as densely populated as Gaza, any strike will have huge damaging effects on people and buildings."His original remarks were widely circulated in Israeli media and online, where they were seized upon by Israel's supporters as an endorsement of its conduct and provoked outrage among Palestinians.Israel carried out hundreds of airstrikes on Gaza during the 11-day war, in which Hamas and other militant groups fired more than 4,000 rockets at Israel. At least 254 people were killed in Gaza, including 67 children and 39 women. according to the Gaza health ministry. Hamas has acknowledged the deaths of 80 militants. Twelve civilians, including two children, were killed in Israel, along with one soldier.UNRWA provides essential services to some 5.7 million refugees in the occupied West Bank, Gaza, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. They include Palestinians who fled or were driven out of what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation and their descendants.It provides food aid and other vital services in Gaza, which has been under a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Most of Gaza's population of 2 million are registered refugees. At the height of the war, some 70,000 Gazans sheltered in UNRWA schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-agency-withdraws-director-from-gaza-after-threats-101622796673759.html
04-06-2021||World||As Trump prepares to resume rallies, Republicans fear 'revenge tour'||Donald Trump will be back on stage this month with one mission at the top of his agenda -- seeking revenge against Republican incumbents who turned on him by backing their challengers in 2022 primaries.That worries some GOP leaders. As the former president prepares to resume his trademark rallies, they fear another round of grievances about the 2020 election results and championing untested candidates over incumbents could hurt the party more than it helps in next year’s midterm elections.Trump has been banned from social media for encouraging supporters who broke into the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. He has issued statements on news topics that have generated little coverage. This week, he abandoned a blog he had started less than a month ago that had attracted relatively few readers.He is scheduled to be the keynote speaker on Saturday at the North Carolina Republican Party’s convention, which will be live-streamed.The schedule for the rallies hasn’t been released but they will likely begin this month or next, according to senior adviser Jason Miller. One of the first will be in Ohio for Max Miller, a former White House aide who’s challenging Republican Anthony Gonzalez, one of 10 House incumbents who voted to impeach Trump. The two Millers are no related.Jason Miller said there are also plans for an event in Alabama, where Trump has endorsed Representative Mo Brooks in his campaign to replace retiring Senator Richard Shelby. Brooks helped lead the Jan. 6 challenge to the certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the Electoral College.Trump is also planning rallies in Florida and Georgia, where he is backing Representative Jody Hice against Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, though those events might not be for specific candidates, Miller said. The unusual event of a former U.S. president getting involved in a race for a state bureaucratic post follows Raffensperger’s high-profile opposition to Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to Biden in Georgia.Matt Schlapp, head of the Conservative Political Action Conference, announced on Twitter that Trump would be speaking to CPAC’s Texas meeting in July.Trump’s campaign against Republican incumbents could end with a slate of candidates who are weaker than an entrenched incumbent in a general-election matchup with a Democrat in the fall, diverting resources from other competitive races in 2022. Republicans need to flip only one seat in the Senate and five in the House to regain control and stymie Biden’s agenda for the remainder of his term.It’s unclear whether the rallies will draw the crowds that showed up when Trump was a presidential candidate or in the White House. But he remains the de facto head of the Republican Party and demands fealty from candidates and officeholders.“I’m tickled to death” Trump will be holding rallies, said Fred Beardsley, chairman of the Oswego County Republican Committee in upstate New York.Beardsley said he views Trump hitting the stump is good thing for the party, even if it hurts some GOP congressional candidates in 2022, including local Representative John Katko, who also voted to impeach the former president.Having Trump front and center would keep voters focused on 2020 and relitigating the election results at a time when prominent Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell want to focus the midterm messaging on Biden’s economic plans and electing a Republican-controlled Congress that could stop them.McConnell opposed plans for a bipartisan commission to examine the Jan. 6 riot because, he said, it would distract from the 2022 midterm message and focus too much on the past.“Politics is about the future, and as long as Trump looks forward and is focused on helping nominate candidates that can win in the fall, it’s a good use of time and it’s good for the party,” said Scott Reed, the former chief political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “If it just becomes a forum for re-litigating the past loss, it’ll have a negative impact on the party.”Trump’s fixation on settling scores doesn’t fit with the GOP’s aim to be unified, said Doug Heye, a former Republican National Committee communications director and Trump critic.“What Donald Trump is saying is that he is not going to allow Republicans to do anything but look back, and that is something that will gum up the works potentially for 2022,” Heye said.Miller countered by noting that the former president is the party’s most popular figure, and cited the 74 million votes he received for re-election.“Everybody wants his endorsement, and he’s committed to helping elect America First conservatives who can help Republicans take back the House and Senate in 2022,” Miller said.Republicans must channel Trump’s energies into revving up the GOP base and uniting Republicans behind candidates the entire party supports, said Matt Gorman, a GOP strategist who used to be communications director for the National Republican Campaign Committee, the House GOP campaign arm.“If we talk about the future and we talk about Joe Biden, we will win,” Gorman said. “It’s when we re-litigate the past and issues that voters aren’t as concerned about that we get ourselves into trouble.”If his past rallies are any indication, Trump could draw much of the attention to himself and away from 2022 candidates as his unscripted speeches meander through a series of topics that rarely exhibit message discipline.“Republicans absolutely should be concerned that the Trump rallies will be problematic, depending on the outcome,” said Dan Eberhart, a longtime GOP donor. “I just worry that attacking other Republicans at this point in the cycle just has no benefit.”Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of the House Republicans that Trump has targeted for their impeachment vote, said he hopes the rallies expose the former president’s weaknesses.“I do think that’s going to be fatiguing with people, and eventually folks besides the most hardcore are going to say, ‘OK, it’s time to move on,’” Kinzinger said in a Politico interview streamed online last week. “My hope is that actually in those rallies, people realize this is starting to get nuts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-trump-prepares-to-resume-rallies-republicans-fear-revenge-tour-101622790450290.html
04-06-2021||World||India, Canada resume talks on stalled trade pact||After languishing for nearly four years, India and Canadian negotiators have resumed discussions this week towards a possible trade pact.The discussions, held virtually, were undertaken by officials of India’s commerce ministry and those from Canada’s international trade department. They revisited the stalled Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement or CEPA, which has been under consideration for a full decade after talks were initiated under then Indian prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh and then Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper.There is some optimism a deal may finally be possible, as Kendal Hembroff, director-general, Trade Negotiations for Global Affairs Canada, tweeted, “Great discussions this week towards a possible trade agreement with India. Canadian and Indian negotiators were hard at work!”India’s high commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria responded, “Great to see constructive engagement between trade teams this week on a trade pact and when done, should boost trade and investment in the bilateral economic corridor.”The last round of negotiations was held in August 2017. While Canadian officials wanted to clinch a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement or FIPA prior to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s visit to India in February 2018, New Delhi was more interested in concluding CEPA first. However, with relations declining following that disastrous visit, fresh talks were not scheduled outside of routine stocktaking.Relations have improved this year with Canada appreciative of India’s delivery of 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine in March, followed by Canada’s generosity as India faced the destructive second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.However, a senior Indian official said the discussions are centred around a “CEPA-lite”, which will take into account areas of interest between the two nations.Interestingly, the last ministerial-level dialogue on CEPA was held in September 2016 by two leaders who are now both finance ministers in India and Canada - Nirmala Sitharaman, then commerce minister and Chrystia Freeland, then minister of international trade.Global Affairs Canada describes India as a “priority market”, and India is 9th largest export market, and 10th largest trading partner overall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-canada-resume-talks-on-stalled-trade-pact-101622783535354.html

City spokeswoman Sarah McKenzie said a fist sculpture, which stands several feet tall, will remain. The city said the effort was led by a community group known as Agape and several city departments were involved.The intersection had been closed to traffic since Floyd's death in police custody on May 25, 2020, but some residents and businesses expressed frustration that it had been closed for so long.Traffic briefly flowed through the intersection Thursday morning after the concrete barriers were removed, but community members quickly erected new makeshift barriers. Dozens of people gathered near the intersection, singing, chanting Floyd’s name and giving speeches expressing frustration and urging people to continue organizing.Police were not seen at the intersection on Thursday morning and there was no visible police presence later in the day. Mayor Jacob Frey said avoiding clashes between activists and police was of utmost concern, and going forward, the police will patrol the area just like any other neighborhood in the city.Frey said a phased reopening of the intersection was necessary to promote healing, restore area businesses, and provide social and city services that have been lacking for a year. He said artwork from the memorial will be preserved, and that the city wants to ensure the location where Floyd died “never has tires run over it again.”“This intersection will forever be changed and we need to be investing in that transformation,” Frey said at a news conference. “This can be a critical location of gathering, not just for our city but the entire world.”City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins said she has talked with residents and business owners who have struggled with the loss of revenue and sleep, and some who feel trapped in their homes. “It’s time for us to begin a process of rebuilding this community,” she said.Frey acknowledged the reopening would not happen all at once and declined to say when the intersection would fully reopen to traffic.The square sprang up organically in the days after Floyd’s death. As people gathered to express their grief and anger, community members set up makeshift barricades to block traffic, which the city eventually replaced with concrete ones.Frey and other city leaders pledged to reopen the intersection, but activist leaders said they wouldn’t step aside unless the city met their 24 demands. Among them: recall the county prosecutor, fire the head of the state’s criminal investigative agency, and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on programs to create jobs, combat racism and support affordable housing.Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the removal of the memorial was an attack on Floyd's legacy.“This space is a space that has now become a national memorial, a national memorial for victims of police violence all over this world,” Hussein said during a news conference.“We will not give up this space," he said. "We will save it for George Floyd.”Violent crime at the intersection and the blocks immediately surrounding it rose dramatically in 2020, though crime also increased citywide. There were 19 nonfatal and fatal shootings in the area in 2020, including 14 from May 1 through Aug. 31. That’s compared with three shootings in all of 2019 and none during the summer months.Shots were fired in the area last week, just hours before an event to mark the anniversary of Floyd’s death. One person was injured.McKenzie said Agape has a contract with Agape to reopen the intersection. The contract, which will have a maximum cost of $359,000 and runs from June to the fall, includes community building and health and safety services associated with the reopening. Most of the cost of the contract covers the hourly rate for Agape personnel. Several city departments are involved and coordinating with Agape, she said.Steve Floyd, one of Agape’s founders, said he admires the demonstrators’ efforts to maintain the square but that they had to engage the city in that process “instead of letting them come in here with bulldozers.”“As far as controlling this and maintaining it, that’s a noble job. We don’t disrespect the protesters, everything can stay the same,” said Floyd, who isn't related to George Floyd. “They can still do it. But we just let them in here to fix what we have and develop it.”Former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck for about 9 1/2 minutes as he pleaded for air.Chauvin has also been indicted on federal charges alleging he violated Floyd’s civil rights, as well as the civil rights of a 14-year-old he restrained in a 2017 arrest.The three other former Minneapolis officers involved in Floyd’s arrest and death were also charged with federal civil rights violations. They await trial in state court on aiding and abetting counts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-barriers-put-up-at-george-floyd-square-in-minneapolis-soon-after-old-ones-removed-101622778257366.html

Did they really get sick, and if so, what did they get sick with?" the report https://on.ft.com/3igFTgU quoted Fauci as saying.The origin of the virus is hotly contested, with U.S. intelligence agencies still examining reports that researchers at a Chinese virology laboratory in Wuhan were seriously ill in 2019 a month before the first COVID-19 cases were reported.However, Chinese scientists and officials have consistently rejected the lab leak hypothesis, saying the virus could have been circulating in other regions before it hit Wuhan and might have even entered China through imported frozen food shipments or wildlife trading.Financial Times reported that Fauci continues to believe the virus was first transmitted to humans through animals, pointing out that even if the lab researchers did have COVID-19, they could have contracted the disease from the wider population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/anthony-fauci-calls-on-china-to-release-medical-records-of-wuhan-lab-workers-101622777151935.html
04-06-2021||World||‘Everyone, so-called enemy’ saying I was right about coronavirus’ origin in Wuhan: Donald Trump||Former US president Donald Trump on Thursday reiterated his stance that coronavirus originated from a laboratory in China’s Wuhan and called for imposing a fine on the Asian country for the "death and destruction" it has caused. "Now everyone, even so-called "enemy", are beginning to say that President Trump was right about China virus coming from Wuhan Lab,” Trump said in a statement, according to news agency ANI.Trump, since the beginning, blamed China for the pandemic and said Sars-Cov-2, which causes the coronavirus disease, leaked from the Wuhan laboratory. In March 2020, he referred to the virus as the 'China virus' calling the country out for the global health crisis.Also read: Covid-19 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’, created in lab, new study claims“The correspondence between Dr Fauci and China speaks too loudly for anyone to ignore China should pay USD 10 trillion to America, and the world, for the death and destruction they have caused!” Trump also said in his statement as he referred to top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci.This comes after private emails of Fauci were released to the press that sparked off the claims of the virus originating from the Wuhan lab. More than 3,000 pages of emails, dated from January to June 2020, were obtained by the Washington Post, Buzzfeed News and CNN via the requests of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).The revealed emails detailed that the top US expert and his colleagues noted, in the initial days, that Covid-19 may have leaked from the lab in China.Also read | ‘Our society is totally nuts’: Fauci emails on public fascination with himLast week, President Joe Biden announced that he has given fresh orders for further US intelligence probe into the origin of Covid-19, the report of which should be submitted in 90 days.The virus leak from the lab theory has evolved from scepticism and entered mainstream conversations. Fauci has even demanded China release medical records of the Wuhan lab workers, who got sick in 2019. He said those records might aid in the in-depth exploration of the theory."I would like to see the medical records of the three people who are reported to have got sick in 2019.

04-06-2021||World||US govt finds no evidence that mysterious aerial sightings were alien UFO: Report||US intelligence officials have found no evidence that a series of unidentified aerial phenomena observed by Navy aviators in recent years were alien spacecraft, but the sightings remain unexplained in a highly anticipated government report, The New York Times reported on Thursday.The newspaper, citing senior Biden administration officials briefed ahead of the report's release to Congress later this month, also said the report found that the vast majority of incidents documented over the past two decades did not originate from any American military or other advanced US government technology.Many of the 120-plus sightings reviewed in the classified intelligence study were from US Navy personnel. But one unnamed senior US official briefed on the report told the Times there was concern among American intelligence and military officials that China or Russia could be experimenting with hypersonic technology, perhaps accounting for some of the aerial phenomena in question.An unclassified version of the report expected to be submitted to Congress by June 25 will present few other conclusions, the newspaper said.Senior US officials cited in the Times article said the report's ambiguity meant that the government was unable to definitively rule out theories that the unidentified phenomena might have been extraterrestrial in nature.Pentagon officials have publicly acknowledged that a special Defense Department body called the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) Task Force was established in the past few years to examine military reports of "incursions" into restricted airspace and training ranges.US defense officials have said such incidents are of a concern to Pentagon and intelligence agencies because of their national security implications.Responding to Reuters' questions about the forthcoming task force report requested by Congress, Pentagon spokeswoman Sue Gough said in an email reply earlier on Thursday: "We do not publicly discuss the details of the UAP observations, the task force or examinations."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-govt-finds-no-evidence-that-mysterious-aerial-sightings-were-alien-ufo-report-101622773476170.html
04-06-2021||World||Israel eyes end of an era after Netanyahu foes strike deal||Israel was approaching the end of an era after the last-minute formation of a motley coalition that could in the next few days oust veteran leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the country's longest-serving prime minister.Opposition leader Yair Lapid announced the deal just minutes before a midnight Wednesday deadline, prompting celebrations into the early hours by the premier's opponents and a defiant show of support by his fans.On paper, the prospective coalition commands a slender majority in parliament but a confidence vote is not expected for several days, giving Netanyahu time to woo potential defectors among the unlikely bedfellows ranged against him.With the threat of possible jail time hanging over him in his ongoing trial on corruption charges, the 71-year-old is unlikely to allow his record 12 straight years to end without a messy fight, analysts warned.On Thursday, the master political operator was already on Twitter, seeking to play on any last-minute misgivings among right-wing lawmakers about allying with the left against him."All lawmakers who were elected with votes from the right must oppose this dangerous left-wing government," he said.On Twitter, Netanyahu's Likud party called on former right-wing allies to "immediately withdraw" their signatures.The new coalition would see the religious-nationalist Naftali Bennett serve as prime minister for two years before Lapid, a secular centrist, would take the helm.Should last-minute defections scupper the "change" alliance, Israel would likely have to hold yet another election, the fifth in just over two years."Opening the champagne right now is a bit hasty," said Tamar Hermann, a political scientist at the Israel Democracy Institute.'I succeeded'Lapid, 57, a former TV presenter who heads the centrist Yesh Atid party, put his own prime ministerial ambitions on hold to broker the coalition deal."I succeeded," he proclaimed, less than an hour before the deadline."I promise that this government will work in the service of all of the citizens of Israel, those who voted for it and those who did not," he wrote on Facebook.The announcement capped four frenzied weeks of negotiations since President Reuven Rivlin tasked Lapid with trying to form a government after Netanyahu failed.Bennett, 49, an estranged former protege of Netanyahu, was the linchpin of the deal to unseat him.On Sunday, Bennett, head of the far-right Yamina bloc, announced he would join Lapid to end the "madness".On the right, the new coalition includes the hawkish New Hope party of Netanyahu's former ally Gideon Saar, and secular nationalist Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beitenu party.Also part of the alliance are the Labor party, the dovish Meretz party, and the centrist Blue and White party of Defence Minister Benny Gantz.For the first time in Israeli's history, the embryonic coalition also includes an Arab Israeli party, the Islamic conservative party Raam.It released pictures of its leader Mansour Abbas signing a coalition agreement alongside Bennett, a staunch supporter of the Jewish settler movement.Speaking on army radio Thursday, Abbas said: "We obtained the legitimacy to influence the Israeli political system and not just to be present there in the Knesset."Raam previously ran as part of the Arab-led Joint List but broke away over differences with its communist and Arab nationalist members. Joint List lawmaker Aida Touma-Sliman said she would oppose the new deal because "getting rid of Netanyahu and keeping his path is a political mistake."Emulate Trump?Allies of Netanyahu lashed out at the coalition.Far-right lawmaker Bezalel Smotrich, head of the Religious Zionism party, attacked the coalition's dependence on the votes of Arab lawmakers and accused Bennett of cooperating with "a terrorism supporter who identifies with Israel's enemies".Yamina member Matan Kahana hit back, telling public radio: "I'm convinced this government will be even more right-wing than the government of Netanyahu."Netanyahu's son Yair called Bennett "filth" in a tweet.Netanyahu biographer Ben Caspit predicted the incumbent would fight the new government tooth and nail, doing everything he could to block its formation and then battling it from the opposition benches if necessary.Caspit said Netanyahu could try to emulate his ally, former US president Donald Trump, who gave an incendiary address to supporters before they launched a deadly raid on the US Capitol."He is trying to burn it all," Caspit said of Netanyahu. "He still thinks he will succeed against all odds."Washington on Thursday assured it would remain a staunch ally of the Jewish state regardless of who is in power."Regardless of what happens, regardless of what government is in place, our stalwart support, our ironclad support for Israel will remain," State Department spokesman Ned Price said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-eyes-end-of-an-era-after-netanyahu-foes-strike-deal-101622773169074.html
04-06-2021||World||Australia's Victoria detects Delta Covid-19 variant in latest outbreak||Australia's Victoria state authorities said on Friday genomic sequencing has detected for the first time the Delta Covid-19 virus variant among infections in the latest virus outbreak in state capital, Melbourne."That variant is the Delta variant, it is now infamous in India and increasingly found in the United Kingdom. It is a variant of significant concern," Victoria state Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton told reporters in Melbourne.Sutton said the new variant had not been linked to any sequenced Covid-19 infections cases across Australia from hotel quarantine or elsewhere.So far, two Victoria cases have the so-called 'Delta' variant of concern, which is likely the strain that caused the latest devastating wave of Covid-19 in India."It is a concern that it is not linked to other cases but we are chasing down all those primary-case contacts ... and looking into where it might have been acquired," Sutton said.Victoria, Australia's second-most populous state, is battling to contain its latest outbreak - 65 cases since May 24 - after more than three months of no cases, placing tough restrictions on movement of people and shutting down large parts of its economy. The government has linked all the cases to a single traveler released from quarantine after testing negative.Melbourne is into a second week of hard lockdown after it was extended for another week until June 10, but some curbs elsewhere were eased in the state from Thursday night.Authorities blamed the extension of tough curbs in Melbourne on the Kappa variant, first detected in India, which they described as a highly infectious strain, although new cases have remained in single digits for eight days in a row.Four new locally acquired cases were reported on Friday, versus three a day earlier.Snap lockdowns, regional border restrictions and strict social distancing rules have largely helped Australia rein in prior outbreaks and keep its Covid-19 numbers relatively low at just over 30,100 cases and 910 deaths.More than 4.6 million vaccine doses have been administered as of Wednesday in Australia, which has an adult population of about 20 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-victoria-detects-delta-covid-19-variant-in-latest-outbreak-101622772597602.html

Many are subsidiaries of companies already included.The sanctions target companies involved in Chinese surveillance technology used to "facilitate repression or serious human rights abuses," which "undermine the security or democratic values of the United States and our allies," according to a White House statement.The initial list published under Trump included major telecoms, construction and technology firms such as China Mobile, China Telecom, video surveillance firm Hikvision, and China Railway Construction Corp.China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) was added in January -- causing S&P to remove the company from its stock index -- and remains on Biden's list.The investment ban takes effect August 2 and current shareholders have a year to divest.Strained relationsThe move was among a series of measures by the White House aimed at the Asian power that have left ties between the two countries severely strained.Earlier in the day before the Biden order was released, Beijing repeated its outrage at the Trump-era blacklist and vowed to protect the rights of Chinese companies, saying the measure was "politically motivated" and "ignores the facts and actual situation" of the firms involved.The ban "severely undermines normal market rules and order" and "damages... the interests of global investors, including US investors," foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said at a routine briefing.Previously, the sanctions and choice of targets were tied to a congressionally mandated Defense Department report but will be managed by the Treasury Department.While the Biden administration has pledged to take a more diplomatic approach with China following the upheaval of his predecessor, he has said he will keep to a tough line on several issues including defense and technology.Biden has lamented that the United States is falling behind, saying China is "eating our lunch."A tough line on China has rare cross-party support in Congress, with lawmakers determined to keep a lid on its growing global clout.Republican senators Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio, alongside Democrats Gary Peters and Mark Kelly, published a bi-partisan letter earlier this week urging the administration to publish a new list."The US government must continue to act boldly in blocking the Chinese Communist Party's economic predation against our industrial base," they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-blacklists-more-chinese-firms-to-us-investors-over-military-links-101622772492348.html
04-06-2021||World||Trump and I may never see 'eye-to-eye' on Capitol riots: Mike Pence||Former Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday that he wasn’t sure that he and former President Donald Trump would ever see “eye to eye” over what happened on Jan. 6 but that he would “always be proud of what we accomplished for the American people over the last four years.”Pence, speaking at a Republican dinner in the early voting state of New Hampshire, gave his most extensive comments to date on the events of Jan. 6, when angry Trump supporters broke into the Capitol building, some chanting “Hang Mike Pence!” after the vice president said he did not have the power to overturn Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory.“As I said that day, Jan. 6 was a dark day in history of the United States Capitol. But thanks to the swift action of the Capitol Police and federal law enforcement, violence was quelled. The Capitol was secured,” Pence said.“And that same day, we reconvened the Congress and did our duty under the Constitution and the laws of the United States," Pence continued. “You know, President Trump and I have spoken many times since we left office. And I don’t know if we’ll ever see to eye on that day."It was a rare departure for Pence, who spent four years standing loyally beside his boss amid controversy, investigation and impeachment. It comes as Pence considers his own potential 2024 White House run and as Republicans, some of whom were angry at Trump in the days after the Jan. 6 insurrection, have largely coalesced back around the former president.Pence praised Trump several times during his nearly 35-minute speech at the Hillsborough County Republican Committee’s annual Lincoln-Reagan Awards Dinner in Manchester. He tried to turn the events of Jan. 6 back around on Democrats, saying they wanted to keep the insurrection in the news to divert attention from President Joe Biden's liberal agenda.“I will not allow Democrats or their allies in the media to use one tragic day to discredit the aspirations of millions of Americans. Or allow Democrats or their allies in the media to distract our attention from a new administration intent on dividing our country to advance the radical agenda,” Pence said. "My fellow Republicans, for our country, for our future, for our children and our grandchildren, we must move forward, united.”He accused Biden of campaigning as a moderate but becoming the most liberal president since President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He said the administration forced through Congress “a covid bill to fund massive expansion of the welfare state” and was pushing a “so-called infrastructure bill” that was really a “thinly-disguised climate change bill” funded with cuts in the military and historic tax increases.“I just say enough is enough,” he said, adding that “we’re going to stand strong for freedom.”Pence also hit upon several favorite themes of conservative Republicans, emphasizing the need for states to shore up voter integrity around the country. He also praised law enforcement as heroes, suggesting that “Black lives are not endangered by police. Black lives are saved by police every day.”He also pushed back against “critical race theory,” which seeks to reframe the narrative of American history.Its proponents argue that federal law has preserved the unequal treatment of people on the basis of race and that the country was founded on the theft of land and labor. But Republicans have said concepts suggesting that people are inherently racist or that America was founded on racial oppression are divisive and have no place in the classroom.“America is not a racist country,” he said, prompting one of several standing ovations and cheers during his speech.“It is past time for America to discard the left-wing myth of systemic racism,” Pence said. “I commend state legislators and governors across the country for banning critical race theory from our schools.”His choice of states, including that April appearance in South Carolina, is aimed at increasing his visibility as he considers whether to run for the White House in 2024.Trump is increasingly acting and talking like he plans to make a run as he sets out on a more public phase of his post-presidency, beginning with a speech on Saturday in North Carolina.Since leaving office in January, Pence has been doing work with the Heritage Foundation and Young America’s Foundation. His team said he plans more trips, including stops in Texas, California and Michigan.Along with his visits to South Carolina and New Hampshire, Pence has been hitting the fundraising circuit. He is set to speak next week at another fundraiser hosted by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, will travel to North Carolina for a Heritage Foundation donor event, and will then head to California, where he will take part in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute’s speakers’ series, a Republican National Committee donor retreat and a Young America’s Foundation event, according to aides.Among other prominent Republicans, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said in April that she would stand down if Trump decided to run in 2024. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has undertaken an aggressive schedule, visiting states that will play a pivotal role in the 2024 primaries and signing a contract with Fox News Channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-and-i-may-never-see-eye-to-eye-on-capitol-riots-mike-pence-101622768142999.html

Tens of thousands defied the ban and rallied anyway in the park.Police later arrested some two dozen democracy figures who attended that rally, some of whom have been given prison sentences, including other members of the Hong Kong Alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-detain-democracy-leader-on-tiananmen-anniversary-report-101622767593754.html

04-06-2021||World||After Trump ban, Facebook to end 'newsworthy exception' for politicians: Report||Facebook plans to eliminate an exemption for politicians that allows them to post content deemed deceptive or abusive, and will hold them to the same standards as other users, news website The Verge reported Thursday.The controversial exemption, given to politicians under the auspices of their posts being newsworthy, could end as soon as this week on the leading social network, the news site said.Facebook did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment on the matter.The policy reversal would come after an independent oversight board said Facebook was right to oust former president Donald Trump for his comments regarding the deadly January 6 rampage at the US Capitol.Trump was suspended from Facebook and Instagram after posting a video during the attack by his fired-up supporters challenging his election loss, in which he told them: "We love you, you're very special."However, the panel gave Facebook six months to justify why his ban should be permanent -- putting the ball in company chief Mark Zuckerberg's court and spotlighting weaknesses in the platform's plan for self-regulation.Oversight panel co-chair Michael McConnell said in a May 9 interview on Fox News Sunday that Trump encouraged the Capitol rioters and so earned his Facebook ban, but the social media giant's rules are in "shambles" and need fixing.Zuckerberg has stressed his belief that private companies should not be the judges of truth when it comes to what people say.Democrats have slammed online platforms for failing to stem misinformation while Republicans have contended that social networks are biased against conservatives.Facebook is also planning to be more transparent about "strikes" issued to accounts for breaking content rules, according to the Verge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-trump-ban-facebook-to-end-newsworthy-exception-for-politicians-report-101622764699586.html
04-06-2021||World||Harris dials Modi as US gives details of first vaccine tranche||The US will donate six million of its unused coronavirus vaccine doses to India, Mexico, Canada and South Korea, President Joe Biden said on Thursday, after which Vice President Kamala Harris called up several world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to discuss the decision.Modi said he “deeply appreciated” the assurance of supplies to India and thanked Harris for the support and solidarity from the US government.The donations are part of a first tranche of 25 million doses, of which 19 million will go to the Covax Facility, a WHO-led vaccine distribution mechanism among low- and middle-income countries. The remaining six million will be shared directly with a clutch of countries, including India.India will also receive some of the Covax doses, of which six million will be sent to a list of 16 Asian nations including India.The White House also announced it was lifting restrictions invoked under the Defense Production Act that will allow sharing of raw materials needed for the AstraZeneca, as well as Sanofi and Novavax vaccines, which are also not authorised in the US.“As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable,” President Joe Biden said, adding, “And the US is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated at home.”Overall, the White House aims to share 80 million doses globally by the end of June, most of them through Covax.Although country-specific allocations are not available at present, India is expected to be the largest beneficiary from the dose given to Covax. This will be in addition to the $100 million worth of supplies such as oxygen converters, PPE and therapeutics already sent by the Biden administration, along with relief worth $400 mn more from private sector companies and individuals.Vice-President Kamala Harris called PM Modi, Mexico’s President Andres Manuel López Obrador, Guatemala’s President Alejandro Giammattei, and Chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Trinidad and Tobago’s Prime Minister Keith Rowley to personally convey to them the US decision to send them vaccines, along with other countries.“Spoke to @VP Kamala Harris a short while ago. I deeply appreciate the assurance of vaccine supplies to India as part of the US Strategy for Global Vaccine Sharing. I also thanked her for the all the support and solidarity from the US government, businesses and Indian diaspora,” said Modi in a tweet after the phone call.“We also discussed ongoing efforts to further strengthen India-US vaccine cooperation, and the potential of our partnership to contribute to post-Covid global health and economic recovery,” he added.The ministry of external affairs in New Delhi later released a statement saying Modi “expressed the hope to welcome Vice President Harris in India” once the pandemic abatedBiden previously announced that the US will share 80 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines with the rest of the world, including 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca (called Covishield in India) vaccine, which America had ordered but has no plans of using, and 20 million shots of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.More than 50% of Americans and 60% of the eligible population of 12 years of order have received at least one dose.A White House official later said the AstraZeneca doses Biden promised to share have still not been cleared by the US Food and Drugs Administration.Numbers in a factsheet issued separately by the White House on the vaccine donations were somewhat different from what Biden announced, but people familiar with these developments pointed to President Biden’s statement as the final word.National security adviser Jake Sullivan said the allocation formula was shaped by “factors” that included the goal of achieving global coverage, “surges and other specific urgent situations” and public health needs, and the aim to help as many countries as possible that had requested vaccines, and neighbours.“This is only the beginning,” Sullivan said, pointing to the US president’s commitment to share 80 million doses in all by the end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harris-dials-modi-as-us-gives-details-of-first-vaccine-tranche-101622765736656.html
04-06-2021||World||UNSC to meet on June 8 to recommend next secretary-general||The U.N. Security Council will meet June 8 to make its recommendation for the next secretary-general and almost certainly approve current U.N. chief Antonio Guterres who is the only candidate.The recommendation from the 15-member council will then be sent to the president of the 193-member General Assembly, which must approve a resolution selecting the world’s top diplomat.The Security Council revised its program of work late Thursday to add a private meeting next Tuesday morning entitled “Recommendation for the appointment of the secretary-general of the United Nations.”Estonia’s Ambassador Sven Jurgenson, the council president for June, told a news conference Tuesday that even though there is only one candidate “the process is still the same.”Traditionally, candidates for the U.N.’s top job have been nominated by a U.N. member state, but that is not a requirement in the U.N. Charter or a resolution adopted by the General Assembly in 2015 that made the previously largely secretive selection of the secretary-general more open and transparent. It allowed the world body’s member states for the first time to see basic information about all candidates, including their resumes, and to meet and question them at open sessions.Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister and U.N. refugee chief, was elected by the assembly to succeed Ban Ki-moon after a hotly contested and transparent race in October 2016 that initially included 13 candidates -- seven women and six men. Guterres took office on Jan. 1, 2017.This year, seven individuals submitted applications to be secretary-general without backing from any government, including most recently former Ecuadorian President Rosalia Arteaga.Guterres, whose five-year term ends Dec. 31, was the only applicant nominated by a U.N. member state, his home country Portugal. He followed the 2015 process, holding a lengthy open question and answer session with U.N. diplomats in the General Assembly last month and then meeting privately with Security Council members.General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir told reporters last month “the rule” is that an applicant can only become a candidate when a letter signed jointly by the presidents of the assembly and the Security Council is sent to all member states.He said, “It looks like the Security Council has the opinion that, traditionally, only applicants supported by a country can become a candidate,” so the only joint letter has been sent on behalf of Guterres. Estonia’s Jurgenson confirmed the council’s position, noting the other applicants but telling reporters Tuesday that “legally and officially only states can present candidates.”Jurgenson said the Security Council will hold a private meeting and adopt a communique on the discussion and outcome. Then, a draft resolution will be circulated with the council’s selection, which hopefully will be adopted by acclamation though any member can call for a vote, he said.Jurgenson said he will then send the resolution to the assembly president with a letter, and Bozkir will then decide when to hold a General Assembly meeting to adopt the recommendation in a resolution. “Hopefully, it will all happen quite soon, inside one week or so,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-to-meet-next-week-to-recommend-next-secretarygeneral-101622764543323.html

The 62-year-old left his home to go for dinner at a restaurant, and was never seen again. A manhunt ensued amid swirling rumours that he fled to Cuba. Three days later, Choksi was apprehended in Dominica on the basis of an Interpol yellow notice, triggering frantic efforts by India to deport him.Choksi was put in jail and his lawyers, and wife Priti, alleged he was abducted with the help of a woman, brought to Dominica, and tortured in custody. Meanwhile, India sent a private jet and a team of investigators to convince Dominican authorities to repatriate the fugitive.He is now part of two legal cases: one in a Dominican court on charges of illegally entering the island and another at the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (ECSC) on a habeas corpus petition filed by his lawyers.‘Illegal entry charge’On June 2, after Dominican authorities alleged that he entered the country illegally, justice Bernie Stephenson at ECSC ordered that Choksi will face “illegal entry” charges. Following ECSC’s order, Choksi was produced in court, where he pleaded “not guilty” and sought bail. A Dominican state attorney Sherma Dalrymple said Choksi entered the country illegally and deemed him a “flight risk”. The magistrate refused bail. adjourning the matter to June 14.India, not a party yetIndia is not a party to the ECSC proceedings in the habeas corpus, or writ that seeks to bring a prisoner or detainee before the court to determine if the detention is lawful. Legal experts said for India to seek Choksi’s deportation, a separate plea will have to be filed.Dominica’s positionThe island nation is yet to make it clear whether it is keen to repatriate Choksi to India. On May 27, Dominica issued a statement that it would repatriate Choksi to Antigua once details of his citizenship are ascertained.Vocal Antigua and Barbuda PM Gaston BrowneBrowne has said he will not accept Choksi back, and that Dominica should hand him over to India. He has denied allegations of Choksi’s lawyers and opposition that the fugitive was abducted by the country’s police and with Indian agents.The jet and India’s silenceAuthorities in New Delhi have been silent over reports of a private jet sent last Friday along with a team of 7-8 officials, and case files and documents to prove that Choksi is one of the top white-collar criminals wanted in India.The mystery womanBrowne claimed Choksi left the country with his “girlfriend”, who has not been traced. Choksi’s lawyer said the woman was friendly with the Choksi family, and invited him to her house the day he went missing.Wife fears for his lifePriti Choksi has alleged that her husband was abducted. She told HT that if he is sent to India, his life would be in danger.The citizenship questionOfficials said that Choksi’s Indian citizenship was not cancelled when he surrendered his passport, grounds on which it will oppose arguments that he is an Antiguan citizen and should be sent there.What next?After India submits documents in the court in Dominica seeking Choksi’s deportation, it will be heard in the court whether he should be sent to India or Antigua.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/illegal-entry-charge-to-citizenship-question-decoding-the-cases-101622756290041.html
04-06-2021||World||IMF, World Bank ask G7 to release surplus Covid-19 shots, call vaccine makers to ramp up production||The heads of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank on Thursday urged the Group of Seven advanced economies to release any excess Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries as soon as possible, and called on manufacturers to ramp up production.In a joint statement to the G7, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass also called on governments, pharmaceutical companies and groups involved in vaccine procurement to boost transparency about contracting, financing and deliveries."Distributing vaccines more widely is both an urgent economic necessity and a moral imperative," they said. "The coronavirus pandemic will not end until everyone has access to vaccines, including people in developing countries."Malpass and Georgieva will meet in person on Friday and Saturday with finance officials from the G7 countries - Britain, the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy, France and Japan - with the Covid-19 pandemic set to be a central topic.Both organizations welcomed US plans to distribute the first 25 million of 80 million vaccine doses that Washington has pledged to share globally by the end of this month."It’s a good start, and I am hoping that more doses will be made available, especially for countries with deployment programs," Malpass told Reuters.The novel coronavirus has killed more than 3.7 million people worldwide, according to a Reuters tally.While about half the population in the United States has received at least one dose of the vaccine, the percentage in developing countries is still in the single digits, said Mamta Murthi, vice president for human development at the World Bank.The World Bank, World Health Organization and World Trade Organization this week endorsed a $50 billion IMF plan to end the pandemic by expanding access to vaccines.Malpass and Georgieva said vaccines should be shared as soon as possible, in a transparent manner, with developing countries that have adequate distribution plans in place.They also called for a bigger push to increase transparency regarding vaccine contracts, options and agreements; vaccine financing and delivery agreements; and doses delivered and future delivery plans.Murthi told Reuters the World Bank had published data on the $2.4 billion it has already committed to help 25 developing countries buy vaccines, and was urging other multilateral banks to do the same, to improve planning and better target aid."It's like the blind man and the elephant," she said. "No one really knows how much capacity is out there, how much has been dedicated to whom, what is the remainder that can be ordered, when are the deliveries scheduled for, and so on."She said it was critical to ensure that countries receiving doses had logistics in place, noting that Malawi had actually destroyed some doses that were nearing expiration dates because it was unable to deliver the doses in time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-world-bank-ask-g7-to-release-surplus-covid-19-shots-call-vaccine-makers-to-ramp-up-production-101622750325922.html

Work from home where you can, and practice ‘hands, face, space, fresh air’ at all times.If you are eligible and have not already done so, please come forward to be vaccinated and make sure you get your second jab. It will save lives,” she said. According to the breakdown of official figures, this week 278 people with the Delta variant attended hospital in an emergency.Last week, 201 people attended hospital.“Once again, the majority of these had not been vaccinated,” PHE said.The areas most affected by the Delta variant remain in the north west of England with Bolton, where cases have risen by 795 to 2149, and Blackburn with Darwen which has seen 368 new cases, bringing it to 724 in total.PHE said there are “encouraging signs” that the transmission rate in Bolton has begun to fall and that the actions taken by residents and local authority teams have been successful in reducing spread.Experts continue to urge people to “remain cautious” as the country approaches the next stage of the roadmap, with June 21 scheduled as a date for an end of all lockdown restrictions.“Variant cases are on the increase in several areas and it is absolutely crucial that everyone plays their part in preventing their spread,” PHE said.In Bolton, local teams have gone door to door in targeted areas on consecutive weekends to distribute test kits, share vital safety messages and encourage people to get the vaccine at a local drop-in centre.Take up of both testing and the vaccine was described as "positive".Blackburn with Darwen has also seen local teams making door-to-door visits, and over 10,000 additional PCR tests have been given out.Mobile testing units have been deployed to the area and wastewater sampling continues, in order to track the spread of the variant.PHE said its health protection teams continue to work with local authorities and schools to carry out surveillance of Covid-19 cases in schools to understand and reduce transmission in these settings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-now-dominant-in-uk-as-cases-rise-by-5-472-in-a-week-101622749767449.html
04-06-2021||World||'Unacceptable': Iran says as UN suspends country's voting rights||Iran on Thursday slammed the United Nations' decision to suspend its voting rights for failing to pay its dues as "fundamentally flawed, entirely unacceptable and completely unjustified".Tehran argues that the $16.2 million it owes to the UN is the result of Washington's crippling sanctions, imposed after former president Donald Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew the US from a nuclear deal with Iran.Iran's voting rights at the UN General Assembly were suspended in January under rules for countries whose arrears are equal to or exceed their contributions due for the past two years.Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif expressed his "strong dismay" at the loss of voting rights, in a letter sent Thursday to UN chief Antonio Guterres."Iran's inability to fulfil its financial obligation toward the United Nations is directly caused by 'unlawful unilateral sanctions' imposed by the United States," Zarif wrote, according to the letter posted on his Twitter account.Zarif said Iran rejected the suspension of its voting privileges because Tehran's "incapacity to transfer its financial contribution has been entirely beyond its control".Guterres, in a May 28 letter to the UN General Assembly, said five nations were barred from voting due to their failure to pay arrears, but added the UN could permit them to vote if it were deemed to be "due to conditions beyond the control" of the member state.Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Guterres, said there had been "very intense discussion" with Iran to find a solution."It is not from lack of trying, either on our side or their side... but the country falls under a number of bilateral sanctions which makes it a bit challenging," Dujarric told reporters."These discussions are continuing in good faith."Zarif urged the UN leadership to "remain true to the purposes and principles" of the UN charter, and to "refrain from any decision that betrays the spirit of sovereign equality of member states, and weakens multilateralism."The US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and re-imposition of sanctions led to Iran stepping up its nuclear activities.US President Joe Biden has signalled his readiness to revive the accord, and global powers have been meeting in Vienna since early April in a bid to do so, with a fresh round of talks slated to begin next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unacceptable-iran-says-as-un-suspends-country-s-voting-rights-101622749007597.html
04-06-2021||World||Joe Biden to tell Vladimir Putin to act against Russia's ransomware criminals||President Joe Biden will press President Vladimir Putin at their meeting this month to crack down on criminal hackers based in Russia, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday.The US president’s message at the one-on-one meeting in Geneva on June 16 will be that “responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals, and responsible countries must take decisive action against those ransomware networks,” Psaki said.Hackers have disrupted critical US services in a series of attacks, demanding that companies pay a ransom to unfreeze data and computers. Victims have included Colonial Pipeline Co. and JBS SA, the world’s largest meat processor.Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Thursday that Biden’s message needs to be clear and definitive: “You continue to do this, you will pay a price. Period,” Panetta said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Balance of Power” program.“President Biden has to make very clear that there are lines here that the Russians cannot cross,” Panetta, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, he said. “Putin only understands very strong talk.”Although Panetta, a former Democratic congressman, didn’t specify what steps could be taken against Russia, he mentioned that the US has developed capabilities to mount offensive cyber operations.US officials have determined that criminal hacking groups behind the attacks were probably operating from Russia. The Russian government has denied knowing about or being involved in the attacks, a claim that Panetta said he doesn’t believe.“These criminal organizations are operating under the cover of the Russian government, and they’re basically doing what the Russian government supports, which is to undermine the United States of America,” Panetta said.The Biden administration also needs to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy that involves working with the private sector and developing cutting-edge technologies, Panetta said.Panetta added that it’s “dangerous” for companies to keep paying ransoms to hackers. “If they pay off these ransoms, what they do is they send a signal to these criminal organizations to continue to do what they’re doing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-tell-vladimir-putin-to-act-against-russia-s-ransomware-criminals-101622748747675.html
04-06-2021||World||US lawmakers welcome announcement on global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines||Top American lawmakers on Thursday welcomed the decision of the Biden Administration to ship 25 million Covid-19 vaccines abroad, including India.“I welcome the news that the Biden Administration will be sending 25 million vaccine doses to our partners abroad to help them combat their COVID-19 outbreaks, but this is an unfortunately small step forward when drastic, rapid action is needed,” Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said.President Joe Biden on Thursday announced that the US will allocate 75 per cent - nearly 1.9 crore of the first tranche of 2.5 crore doses - of unused Covid-19 vaccines from its stockpile through the UN-backed COVAX global vaccine sharing programme to countries in South and Southeast Asia as well as Africa as part of his administration’s framework for sharing 80 million (8 crore) vaccines globally by the end of June.Vice President Kamala Harris spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and three other world leaders and informed them that the US will start sharing the first 25 million (2.5 crore) doses of Covid vaccines to their respective countries.Krishnamoorthi, 47, said US can put more efforts in the direction.“As coronavirus outbreaks continue to rage across the world, we’ve passed the time to talk about millions of doses —- we need to be talking about billions, and how we can distribute and administer them as soon as possible to save lives both abroad and in the United States,” he said.“That means dramatically expanding our vaccine production capacity into the billions, our rate of vaccine procurement, and the scale of our international partnerships to ensure that vaccines reach those who need them, and that we effectively protect ourselves in the process,” he added.Krishnamoorthi said that he will be introducing a legislation next week to address these challenges and to end the pandemic across the world to prevent new variants from sparking another Covid-19 outbreak in America.Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, the founding Co-chair of the Caribbean American Caucus and a senior member of the House Homeland Security Committee, praised Biden and his administration for his announcement in this regard.“Let me be very clear: As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, we are all still vulnerable. I am proud the United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated right here at home,” she said.“The allocation of approximately 6 million doses to the Caribbean and Latin America is a poignant step in the right direction that will dramatically stem the tide of COVID’s deadly progression in the region,” Clarke said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-welcome-announcement-on-global-distribution-of-covid-19-vaccines-101622747460077.html
04-06-2021||World||US announces plan to share Covid-19 vaccines with India, others||The United States on Thursday announced it will send 6 million of the first lot of 25 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to India, Mexico, Canada and South Korea, saying “it’s only the beginning”. The remaining 19 million doses will go to other countries through the World Health Organization-run Covax initiative for equitable global access to vaccines.India will also get vaccines from the tranche going through Covax, as 7 million doses are earmarked for distribution in Asia (India and 15 other countries and entities). Though country-specific allocations are not available at present, India is expected to be the largest beneficiary from this lot. This will be in addition to the $100 million worth of supplies such as oxygen converters, PPE and therapeutics already sent by the Biden administration, along with relief worth $400 million more from private sector companies and individuals.“As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable,” President Joe Biden, said, adding, “And the United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated at home.”US VICE-PRESIDENT CALLS INDIAN PMUS vice-president Kamala Harris called Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mexico’s President Andres Manuel López Obrador, Guatemala’s President Alejandro Giammattei, and chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago Keith Rowley to personally convey to them the US decision to send them vaccines, along with other countries.Calls had been growing over past weeks and days to send India a generous consignment of Covid-19 vaccines in view of the devastating second wave of the pandemic. “So far, the country of over 1.3 billion has delivered first doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 12% of its population, including 3% who are fully vaccinated,” Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the US Senate, wrote in a letter to the president on Tuesday, adding, “I urge you to send a robust allotment of Covid-19 vaccine doses to India to help bring a swift end to this global crisis.”THE SHARING FORMULAPresident Biden has said the United States will share 80 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines with the rest of the world, including 60 million doses of AstraZeneca (called Covishield in India), which America had ordered but has no plans of using, and 20 million shots of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines that it can spare, because of its own rising number of vaccinations (more than 50% of Americans and 60% of the eligible population of 12 years of order, have received at least one dose).At least 75% of these 25 million doses - nearly 19 million - will be shared through Covax, which is run jointly by WHO and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, according to a statement issued by President Biden. It will include about 6 million doses for Latin America and the Caribbean, approximately 7 million for South and Southeast Asia, and approximately 5 million for African. The remaining doses, just over 6 million, will be shared directly with countries “experiencing surges, those in crisis, and other partners and neighbours”, including Canada, Mexico, India, and the Republic of Korea.Numbers in a factsheet issued separately by the White House were somewhat different, but people familiar with these developments pointed to President Biden’s statement as the final word. The factsheet said 19 million will be shared through Covax, and will go to Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador, Paraguay, Bolivia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, Haiti, and other CARICOM countries, as well as the Dominican Republic.Nearly 7 million will go to Asia for distribution among India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Maldives, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, and the Pacific Islands.About 5 million were set aside for Africa, to be shared in coordination with the African Union, and approximately 6 million will be “targeted” towards regional priorities and partner recipients, including Mexico, Canada, and the Republic of Korea, West Bank and Gaza, Ukraine, Kosovo, Haiti, Georgia, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen, as well as for United Nations frontline workers.National security adviser Jake Sullivan said the allocation formula was shaped by “factors” that included the goal of achieving global coverage, “surges and other specific urgent situations” and public health needs, and the aim to help as many countries as possible, that had requested vaccines, and neighbours.“This is only the beginning,” Sullivan said, pointing to the US president’s commitment to share 80 million doses in all by the end of June. “This is a unique moment in history, and it requires American leadership, American science and ingenuity, American perseverance, and the world’s democracies to step up to the plate. Today, I’m proud to say that that effort is underway.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-plan-to-share-covid-19-vaccines-with-india-others-101622744052689.html

The meeting was attended by top leaders including defence minister Rajnath Singh, home minister Amit Shah, and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, among others. “PM was briefed about the current availability of vaccines and the roadmap for ramping it up. He was also apprised about the efforts undertaken to help various vaccine manufacturers ramp up production of vaccines. Government of India is actively working with vaccine manufacturers & helping them in terms of facilitating more production units, financing and supply of raw materials,” said a statement released by the PM’s office.The Prime Minister was also briefed about technical measures taken to make the vaccination process more people-friendly.The review meeting comes a day after the US announced that it will distribute Covid-19 vaccines to India as part of its “strategy for global vaccine sharing”. Soon after the President’s announcement, US vice-president Kamala Harris called up PM Modi about the decision.The vaccines India received will be part of the first tranche of 25 million doses of the 80 million to be donated by the US to several countries. India is part of two baskets -- through Covax and directly from the US -- but the exact numbers have not been released yet.According to health ministry data, the cumulative number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in India has exceeded 227.5 million, including more than 3.3 million doses administered on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-reviews-inoculation-drive-highlights-wastage-of-vaccines-101622829798474.html
04-06-2021||India||4-yr-old mauled to death by leopard in Kashmir||At around 7.40pm on Thursday, Adha Yasir’s parents heard a sharp cry.The four-year-old girl was playing on the lawn of her house in Jammu and Kashmir’s Budgam district. Her parents, who were in the house, and neighbours in Ompora Housing Colony remember the girl running about. The parents rushed out, only to find their daughter nowhere. They alerted the neighbours, the local police and launched a massive search operation.Roughly one hour later, local residents found the girl’s necklace and slippers from the forest that surrounded the colony. “This raised suspicion that the girl was taken away by a leopard, which are common in the area,” said Ehsan Fazili, a neighbour. In the early hours of Friday, their fears came true. Police found Yasir’s mutilated body in the forest nursery located one kilometre from her house, said an official who was part of the search team. “After receiving the information, a police team, locals and the wildlife department constituted various teams to trace the girl. After massive searches, the teams recovered the mauled body of the girl from the nearby forest nursery. Preliminary investigation suggests that the girl has been attacked and mauled by some wild animal (probably Leopard), said senior superintendent of police (Budgam) Tahir Saleem. Grandfather of the girl, Ghulam Hassan Mir, said that they have been urging the authorities to address the issue for a long time, but all the efforts were in vain. “The pain of losing our dear girl will never be healed. But fixing the problem could save other lives.”Local residents and politicians blamed the wildlife department for the death of the girl. “This is the nursery not the forest so they could have easily cleared trees from this place,” said Shabir Ahmad, another neighbour. Former minister and legislator Ruhullah Medhi termed the incident a case of “criminal negligence”. “Given the fact that incidents involving the same wild animals occurred multiple times in the recent months in areas as close to district collector’s office. People then were lucky, but this time this innocent little soul had to pay with her life,” he said.Budgam deputy commissioner Shabaz Mirza chaired a high level meeting with senior officials of police and forest department to decide on measures to prevent such incidents in the future, including immediate removal of fallen material trees from snow and bushes and other cultural operations (like removal of bushes) in Ompora forests and other areas.A spokesperson for the J&K administration assured action within two days.“DFO (Divisional Forest Officer) Budgam will immediately take steps for erection and strengthening of existing chain-link fencing at Ompora forests and will also submit DPR (detailed project report) to higher authorities for sanction of funds. He will also process the proposal/ case for sanction of thinning of the forest immediately. Wild life Warden Budgam will deploy staff well equipped with machinery for elimination of the wild animal (leopard), which has turned man-eater,” said the spokesperson, adding that the family of the deceased girl will also be compensated.DC Budgam Shabaz Mirza and SSP Tahir Saleem visited the house in the afternoon and assured them this type of incident wont be repeated and expressed condolences with the family. The range officer (Wildlife) in Ompora has also been put under suspension.Chief Wildlife warden, Suresh Kumar said they have set up the Control Room in Budgam and also put trapping cages in area. “One leopard was rescued from the area few months back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4yrold-mauled-to-death-by-leopard-in-kashmir-101622829797890.html
04-06-2021||India||Cong unlikely to field candidate against Didi for Bhowanipur bypoll||New Delhi: The Congress party, which drew a blank in the recent West Bengal assembly elections, is unlikely to field a candidate against chief minister Mamata Banerjee in her by-election from Kolkata’s Bhowanipur seat in a move that might assume significance for the long-term equations of India’s Opposition parties.While the Banerjee-led Trinamool won Bengal, she lost to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram, and now needs to win a bypoll to retain her seat. West Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, considered as one of the staunchest critics of Banerjee, said on Thursday that he feels the Congress should not filed a candidate against her out of political courtesy. Former Congress president Pradip Bhattacharya too, echoed the sentiment. “So far, AICC (All-India Congress Committee) has not communicated us anything formally. We are part of an alliance with the CPI(M) and the issue has not been discussed there as well. But I am also of the opinion that the Congress can avoid fielding a candidate against the chief minister,” he told HT. Two Congress strategists in Delhi said that Congress president Sonia Gandhi has informally conveyed her unwillingness to put up a candidate against Banerjee. “Apart from her excellent personal equation with Mamata, the Congress president is perhaps looking at wider scopes of Opposition unity,” said a senior Congress leader. The party’s reluctance also seems to stem from its worst-ever poll performance in the recent Bengal elections as the BJP emerged as the principal opposition in the state.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, too, recently spoke about Banerjee in a press conference when he said, “If PM Narendra Modi can be on the same page with (Chhattisgarh CM) Bhupesh Baghel and (West Bengal CM) Mamata Banerjee, the door will be shut for coronavirus.” Congress insiders maintain that any opposition pact inside or outside Parliament would not be possible without India’s only woman CM, especially after she won Bengal for the third time, defeating the BJP in a direct fight. Banerjee, too, plans a mega rally when the Covid wave subsides, and is likely to invite leaders from non-BJP parties who congratulated her after the victory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-unlikely-to-field-candidate-against-didi-for-bhowanipur-bypoll-101622829378818.html
04-06-2021||India||CM Mamata likely to give more responsibility to Abhishek: TMC leaders before key meet||Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee may give more organizational responsibility to her nephew and the party’s youth wing president Abhishek Banerjee, senior leaders said before the TMC’s strategy meeting in Kolkata on Saturday. The young Lok Sabha MP is seen in the party as the chief minister’s political heir. This is the ruling party’s first big meeting after the assembly polls in which the TMC bagged 213 seats against 77 won by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Bengal has 294 seats. The Congress and the Left parties could not win a single seat. This has turned the state’s political scenario into a bipolar one for the first time since Independence. TMC leaders said Banerjee has asked all senior leaders to be present at the TMC headquarters where the next course of action will be decided. She will also make some important organizational announcements. “We are waiting for the outcome of Saturday’s meet. Only the party chief will take the final call in regard to projection of young leaders which has been the salient part of the TMC’s internal strategy since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in which the BJP bagged 18 of the state’s 42 seats and our tally went down from 34 to 22,” a senior TMC leader said on condition of anonymity. The chief minister and Abhishek Banerjee became the BJP’s prime targets in the campaign speeches of all leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, during the eight-phase elections. They were referred to as pishi (aunt) and bhaipo (nephew) in almost all speeches and the chief minister was accused of establishing dynastic rule. The BJP has also alleged that Abhishek Banerjee is involved in the coal smuggling case that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing. The investigation got a boost on December 31, when the agency raided the residences of businessman and TMC youth front general secretary Vinay Mishra. He has been declared an absconder. It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several thousand crores of rupees, have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs several mines. The CBI has already questioned Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Banerjee and her sister Maneka Gambhir. The latter’s husband, Ankush Arora and his father Pawan Arora have also been interrogated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-mamata-likely-to-give-more-responsibility-to-abhishek-tmc-leaders-before-key-meet-101622829199081.html

04-06-2021||India||India opposes 'vaccine passport', Harsh Vardhan says idea 'discriminatory'||Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Friday conveyed India's strong opposition to the idea of vaccine passport at a G7 plus ministerial session. Dr Vardhan said that it is still immature to implement such a move — in which countries may allow only vaccinated travellers — as the vaccination coverage of developing countries is less than the developed countries."At this stage of the pandemic, it is pertinent to also discuss India's concern over the idea of a vaccine passport. Considering the fact of the lower levels of vaccination of the population in developing countries in contrast to the developed countries and given the still-unaddressed issues related to equitable and affordable access, supply and distribution of safe and effective vaccines, India would propose that the implementation of a vaccine passport will be hugely discriminatory and disadvantageous to the developing countries. India would suggest that the same should be implemented duly taking into consideration emerging evidence of the efficacy of vaccines and under the over-arching coordination by WHO duly attending to the anomaly of access and affordability as it exists today," the health minister said.US taking 'very close look' at vaccine passports for travelExpressed India's concern & strong opposition to 'Vaccine Passport' at this juncture of the #pandemic With vaccine coverage as a % of population in developing countries still low compared to developed countries, such an initiative could prove to be highly discriminatory.@G7 pic.twitter.com/zh6nhkEfbvThe minister tweeted that with India being invited as a guest nation for this year's G7, he had the privilege to address the health ministers meeting via video conference. "Expressed India's concern & strong opposition to 'Vaccine Passport' at this juncture of the #pandemic. With vaccine coverage as a % of population in developing countries still low compared to developed countries, such an initiative could prove to be highly discriminatory," the minister tweeted. The Group of Seven is an intergovernmental organisation comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.According to reports, the United States is taking a close look at vaccine passports for travel. The European Union and some Asian governments are reportedly working on some digital vaccination certificates to resume international travel. All this is at the negotiation level as the World Health Organization doesn’t recommend vaccination proof as a requirement for international travel, citing "unequal distribution of vaccines". The Centre too clarified earlier that there has been no consensus in this regard. As talks regarding vaccine passports are going on, it was apprehended that Indians inoculated with Covaxin will not be allowed international travel as Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is yet to be approved by the World Health Organization. While the Centre has clarified that no country has taken such a move, it confirmed on Friday that it is actively pursuing Bharat Biotech's application for WHO emergency listing with both Bharat Biotech and WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-opposes-vaccine-passport-harsh-varshan-says-idea-discriminatory-101622826648951.html

This variant was also reported to be one of the major drivers of the second Covid-19 wave in India," said professor Royana Singh, who heads the Multidisciplinary Research Unit.The B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus was first detected in India, and it also had a sub lineage, the B.1.617.2.“Just as in most of India, the B.1.617.2 variant (aka Delta variant) was the most common one in the samples we studied.

04-06-2021||India||When will Bharat Biotech's Covaxin get WHO nod? Govt answers||The government is looking forward to receiving recognition from the World Health Organization for its indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research. This will be a milestone for the India-made vaccine, Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said, during the press briefing on Friday."We are working with both Bharat Biotech and WHO to make it happen. Data sharing is going on. we are very keen that this milestone is achieved as soon as possible," Dr Paul said, explaining that the process entails various stages of data sharing. The government will pursue the case on both the front, he said.Bharat Biotech on May 24 conveyed to the government that it has already submitted 90 per cent of the documents for obtaining the emergency use listing for Covaxin. The approval is expected by September, the Hyderabad-based company said.China's Sinovac has recently got approval from WHO, making it the second Chinese vaccine to be recognised by the international body for emergency listing. Sinopharm’s Covid-19 vaccine was already recognised by the organisation.Among the vaccines that are being administered in India, Serum Institute's Covishield has been granted emergency use approval by WHO.Why does it matter? WHO emergency listing gives international recognition to vaccines. Though there has been no decision on vaccine passport, it was speculated that countries may allow travellers inoculated only by the vaccines which have WHO approval. It was apprehended that Indians vaccinated by Covaxin may not be allowed to travel to other countries. But the Centre has clarified that no country has come up with such a practice and a negative RT-PCR report remains valid for the entry.According to the 'Status of COVID-19 Vaccines within WHO EUL/PQ evaluation process' guidance document dated May 18 on the WHO website, Bharat Biotech submitted EOI (Expression of Interest) on April 19 and "more information (is) required".

We have around 150,000 people who got the first dose and are due for their second doses. They will be given their second doses within the 42 days’ time limit,” health minister Keshab Mahanta said. At present Assam has around 320,000 doses of Covishield and 20,000 doses of Covaxin. The state will receive around 50,000 doses of Covaxin within the next few days and some more later. The government also fixed rates of treatment at private hospitals in the state for Covid-19 patients. The rates have been fixed in two categories—for general hospitals and super-specialty hospitals. From now Covid-19 patients staying in general hospitals will have to pay a maximum of ₹4,000 daily for stay in general wards, ₹5,000 for private wards, ₹9,000 daily for ICU without ventilator and ₹12,000 for ICU with ventilators. For super-specialty hospitals, the rates would be ₹5,000 daily for general wards, ₹6500 for private wards, ₹10,000 for ICU without ventilator and ₹15,000 for ICU with ventilators. The rates would include registration, bed, boarding (food), nursing and consultation charges and tests and medicines but exclude high-end tests, costly medicines like Remdesivir and treatment for co-morbid conditions. “These are the maximum rates which private hospitals can charge per day. To give relief to patients, these hospitals can charge less than the amounts mentioned. The rates were fixed after consultations with private hospitals,” Mahanta said. From now all patients with co-morbidities will have to stay in Covid Care Centres or hospitals. Earlier it was mandatory only for patients above 50 years of age. The government decided to set up paediatric ICUs at all seven medical college hospitals in the state. The daily vaccination dose administered across the state, which is at present around 50,000, to be increased to nearly 70,000 doses with focus on Kamrup (Metropolitan), Nagaon, Sonitpur, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia and Cachar districts. The government also decided to provide interest free loans (for three months) to private hospitals in the state to procure Covid19 vaccines from producers. As per Centre’s guidelines, 25% of vaccines allotted to states will be given to private healthcare centres. “Due to cooperation of the public and restrictions in place, the daily Covid19 figures for Assam, both for new patients as well as deaths, have come down slightly in the past few days,” Those not able to visit vaccination centres due to age, disabilities or disease will be provided with jabs at homes or at places close to their homes. Assam recorded 4309 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday and 46 deaths. The positivity rate in the state has dropped from around 8% few weeks ago to 4% at present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-stops-1st-dose-of-covaxin-due-to-scarcity-fixes-covid-19-treatment-rates-for-pvt-hospitals-101622824278172.html

04-06-2021||India||PM Modi says vaccine wastage still high, asks officials to look into it||Vaccine wastage in the country is still on the higher side and this remains an issue that needs attention, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told officials on Friday as he reviewed the Covid-19 situation and the ongoing vaccination drive of the country. As the peak of the second wave of the pandemic is flattening with every state reporting an improvement in the Covid-19 situation, PM Modi chaired a high-level meeting to review the progress of the vaccination drive.At the review meeting, where several Union ministers including Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah, Harsh Vardhan, Prakash Javadekar among others were present, officials briefed the prime minister about the current availability of vaccines and how the vaccine manufacturers are ramping it up. The PM was told that the government was actively working with vaccine manufacturers to facilitate more production units, financing and the supply of raw materials.The prime minister was briefed on advance visibility being provided to states on vaccine availability, with officials noting that states have been asked to pass on this information to the district level so that there is no inconvenience to people, a statement from the PMO said.Vaccine wastage can take place owing to various reasons starting from vaccine hesitancy to the breaking of the vials during transportation. A few weeks ago, the Centre released data showing Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh as the highest vaccine waters, but the state contested the claim and said that the Centre did not have complete data. The Centre on Friday said India has overtaken the US in terms of the number of people who have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The number of India is 17.2 crore while the United States stands at 16.9 crore, the Centre said.In India, around 45 per cent of 60 plus population has been covered with at least one dose, Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said. "We have overtaken the US in terms of the number of people who have received at least a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine. It is reassuring that we are steadily improving and intensifying the vaccine campaign and it will be intensified so much more in the days to come," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-says-vaccine-wastage-still-high-asks-officials-to-look-into-it-101622820053558.html

Trashing Congress' narrative that it is opposing the project because of the pandemic, the Union minister asked if Congress-ruled states have halted infrastructure projects because of the pandemic."Rajasthan government has given approval to reconstruction and infrastructure work to the tune of ₹125 crore. The Rajasthan Chief Minister is busy laying the foundation stone for a ₹60 crore auditorium, a ₹20 crore stadium and spending crores on beautification of roads etc. Maharashtra government is constructing a residential hostel facility at Nariman Point for its legislators worth ₹900 crores," the minister said. Why Rahul Gandhi is not asking his chief ministers to utilise these funds towards vaccination "instead of charging the poor four times the cost", the minister said. The Delhi high court on Monday dismissed a plea against the construction of the Central Vista amid the pandemic and said the project is vital, essential and of national importance. The bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh imposed a cost of ₹one lakh on the petitioners."Unlike in the Congress party, it is neither named nor owned by one ‘family’. I can understand the frustration of the Congress party as they have missed an opportunity to name it after the ‘Gandhi Family’. Congress leadership needs lessons in civics, the official residences and offices belong to the nation, not an individual,” Anurag Thakur said adding that the project belongs to the people of India and the demand for a new Parliament building was raised by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-is-frustrated-with-central-vista-because-anurag-thakur-s-jibe-at-opposition-101622818632127.html
04-06-2021||India||SC notice to Rajasthan for medical treatment to Asaram||The Supreme Court on Friday sought the response of the Rajasthan government on a plea by self-styled godman Asaram Bapu seeking bail for his medical treatment. Asaram requested for treatment at the Prakash Deep Institute of Ayurvedic Sciences, Raiwala, situated on the Haridwar-Rishikesh highway in Uttarakhand.The 83-year-old is serving a life term at Jodhpur Jail for raping a minor at his ashram. After contracting Covid-19 recently in jail, he was admitted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur for treatment. After recovering from the disease, the doctors advised him a follow-up for his gastrointestinal bleeding. Asaram approached the Rajasthan High Court for suspension of his sentence or bail to be treated through Ayurveda and not allopathy. The High Court dismissed his petition on May 21.A Vacation Bench of Justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari issued notice on Asaram’s plea for the limited purpose to know the response of the Rajasthan government to shift the petitioner to the medical institute of his choice situated in Uttarakhand. The bench posted the matter for June 8.Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra who appeared for the petitioner pointed out that the condition of his client was critical due to the gastrointestinal bleeding. He also has age-related medical complications for which he was given blood thinners by AIIMS, Jodhpur. “He needs holistic treatment and Ayurveda preferably.”The petition filed by Asaram requested for suspension of sentence or interim bail for two months, the period required for his treatment. A special court at Jodhpur had convicted and sentenced the self-styled godman in April 2018. He is also facing trial in another alleged rape case in Gujarat.The Rajasthan High Court while dismissing Asaram’s petition had noted that the treatment for gastrointestinal bleeding was available at MDM Hospital at Jodhpur. The HC had called for a medical report from AIIMS, Jodhpur where Asaram’s condition was found to be stable. Even his haemoglobin levels had improved.Asaram had expressed in writing to the Court that he does not desire to take the allopathic line of treatment and should be allowed to undergo Ayurvedic treatment at his Jodhpur ashram. The HC considered all aspects and noted that his release on bail will affected the other pending trail in Gujarat. Further, the HC noted that whenever the convict is taken out of prison for attending court during trial, his followers would form huge congregations resulting in a law and order situation that would increase the risk of spreading the Covid-19 infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-rajasthan-for-medical-treatment-to-asaram-101622818218044.html
04-06-2021||India||Indian Railways aims to become 'net zero carbon emitter' by 2030||The Indian Railways said on Friday that it is working on a mission to become a 'net zero carbon emitter' before 2030, and in the process become the largest 'Green Railways' in the world. The statement by the national transporter came on the eve of World Environment Day, which is celebrated annually on June 5 to encourage climate action and protection.To demonstrate its commitment, the Indian Railways said that country's railway network is being electrified to reduce pollution and carry on transportation in an environment-friendly way. This project to electrify the railway tracks has increased nearly ten times since 2014, the national transporter said, adding that all the balance Broad Gauge (BG) routes are set to be completely electrified by December 2023. "Head-On-Generation systems, bio-toilets, and LED lights recreate the train itself into a travel mode that's kinder to the environment while maintaining comparable passenger comfort," it said.The Indian Railways also has plans to develop its dedicated freight corridors as a low carbon green transportation network with a long-term low carbon roadmap, "which will enable it to adopt more energy-efficient and carbon-friendly technologies, processes, and practices."Several railway projects have also received climate certification, which legitimises carbon-friendly technologies, processes, and practices, it said. According to Indian Railways, it signed an MoU with the Confederation of Indian Industry in July 2016 for the facilitation of Green initiatives on IR. Moreover, several workshops, production units, loco sheds, and one store depot have also been 'GreenCo' certified.Green certification mainly covers the assessment of parameters having a direct bearing on the environment, such as energy conservation measures, use of renewable energy, greenhouse gas emission reduction, water conservation, waste management, material conservation, recycling, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-railways-aims-to-become-net-zero-carbon-emitter-by-2030-101622814895795.html
04-06-2021||India||India overtook US in number of people vaccinated with at least one dose: Govt||India has overtaken the US in terms of number of people who have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, the government on Friday said and noted that the vaccination campaign will be further intensified in the coming days.Addressing a press conference, NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul said 43 per cent of the 60 plus population has been covered with at least one dose and over 45 years, 37 per cent of the population has been covered.Citing the ourworldindata updated on Thursday, India, in terms of number of people who received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, has administered 17.2 crore doses and the US which was leading the pack is 16.9 crore."We have overtaken the US in terms of number of people who have received at least a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine. It is reassuring that we are steadily improving and intensifying the vaccine campaign and it will be intensified so much more in the days to come," Paul said."I want to appeal to enhance the pace of their vaccination and I want to appeal to senior citizens to get themselves vaccinated. Let us hope to make it to 50 per cent in the coming few weeks," he said.Paul said while the second wave is declining in the context of global data it may be worth mentioning that Covid-19 cases per 10 lakh population in India are 20,519, while the world average is still higher at 22,181."So even with the second wave the overall burden experienced, adjusted for population, is relatively modest. Covid-19 deaths per million in India are 245 per million population, while the world average is 477," he said.Noting that this situation was achieved due to strong action by the people of India, states, UTs, municipalities, districts, villages, panchayats and families, Paul asked the people to maintain discipline even when the restrictions are lifted."What is working is we are not back to wearing masks more diligently, what is working is now the testing is more generous. What is working is we have imposed restrictions in many many districts and that is making it difficult for the virus to reach other people."It is not the wish of the virus to forget us but we are making it difficult for the virus to travel. The connotation is when we reverse this process the situation can again become unacceptable and that is something we need to keep in mind," he said.He said if containment measures, Covid-19 appropriate behaviour or vaccination pace slackens, the situation can again go into a difficult phase."...if we suddenly get into the same behaviour what we were doing in January and February as a society it (peak) will come back again in a certain way," he said.Paul underscored the need to buy time to achieve high vaccination coverage."We have to buy time and we have to buy time particularly to ensure that we achieve a high coverage of our vaccination and that is the duration of intense discipline that we want to exercise."So remember the journey is still tough and we have to be responsible. This situation is a result of efforts and these efforts need to be continued in a calibrated way for us to open up but not to allow the virus to overtake us," he said.Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said there has been a continuous decline in the daily new Covid-19 cases."Almost 68 per cent decline in Covid cases has been noted since the highest reported peak of cases on May 7," he said.He said there has been a decrease in active cases by more than 21 lakh since the peak of active cases on May 10. Registering a decline of 56 per cent after around 50 days, active cases have been recorded at 16,35,993."The number of districts reporting more than 100 average daily new Covid-19 cases have decreased from 538 (between April 29 to May 5) to 257 (between May 27 to June 2)," he said.Agarwal said there has been a steady decline in weekly case positivity even while testing increased multifold since the last four weeks."The number of districts reporting less than 5 per cent case positivity has increased from 92 (on week ending May 7) to 377 (on week ending June 3)," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-overtook-us-in-number-of-people-vaccinated-with-at-least-one-dose-govt-101622815958596.html

A better recovery rate is an indicative of milder cases in the state and lesser deaths.Under its Covid-19 control strategy of ‘Trace-Test-Treat’, the Yogi Adityanath-led state government has conducted 3,18,714 Covid-19 tests in the last 24 hours, out of which nearly 1.40 lakh were RT-PCR examinations.The Uttar Pradesh government has also crossed the 50 million Covid-19 tests frontier earlier this week. The state has so far tested 5,07,23,809 samples for the coronavirus infection.With 1,175 positive cases on Thursday, the daily test positivity rate (TPR) has come down to 0.3% and has been lesser than 1% for over a week now. The weekly positivity rate stands at nearly 0.475%.The daily positivity rate (TPR) is much higher in Kerala (15.22%), followed by Tamil Nadu (nearly 15%), West Bengal (nearly 12%) and Maharashtra (nearly 6%). It is to be noted that Covid-19 testing in the above mentioned states has also been much less as compared to Uttar Pradesh.Uttar Pradesh has also been able to prove wrong the apprehensions of specialists that the state would become a hot spot of Covid-19 cases, where more than a lakh cases would surface every day and active cases would reach 30 lakhs.On the contrary, the active caseload in Uttar Pradesh has declined to 22,877 cases from a high of over 3,10,783 cases in the span of just 35 days and the fresh cases have been below 2,000 for six straight days in a row. On April 30, the number of active cases stood at 3.10 lakh.Signalling control over the spread of coronavirus infection, two districts of Uttar Pradesh--Kanpur Dehat and Shravasti reported no fresh case of Covid-19 infection, whereas as many as 37 districts logged fresh cases in just single digit and no district reported fresh cases in three digits in the last 24 hours. The patients in home isolation have also been reduced to nearly 12,000 now.The special testing drive in ne 97,941 revenue villages to save rural areas from Covid-19 disease with the help of over 4 lakh members of 73,441 surveillance committees has been playing a crucial role in checking the spread of the infection.The government is getting nearly 2 lakh tests through 8,000 Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) done in the rural areas of the state everyday. Surveillance of 17,16,24,758 people have so far been done by the surveillance committees in the remote areas of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ups-covid-19-recovery-rate-inches-close-to-97-4-higher-than-national-average-101622812221970.html

The woman is being kept in a room at the Hailakandi police station after she tested positive for Covid-19.Police officer Pranab Kumar Saikia said Rumpi Malakar and Himangshu Malakar, arrested from their house on Friday morning, were among those who had assaulted Dr Gaurav Bhattacharjee after a Covid patient died within minutes of being admitted on May 27. The patient’s relatives and friends blamed the hospital for the death.“The patient had severe breathing issues. He died within a few minutes of reaching the hospital. We could not even start the treatment,” said Dr Bhattacharjee. The young doctor said it was his job to declare the patient dead.“But they started shouting at me and some family members started beating me. I was saved by my colleagues but no immediate action was taken against the culprits by the police. Not only me, but my colleagues are also afraid of going to hospitals because at any moment we can face such assaults,” Dr Bhattacharjee said.Superintendent of police of Hailakandi Ramandeep Kaur said strict action will be taken against the two accused. She also promised security arrangements at the district’s health care centres will be upgraded.Asked about the week-long gap between the incident and the arrest, said the police had received a complaint from Dr Bhattacharjee’s mother. “But the problem was that the doctor could not identify the culprits. He was also hesitant to lodge a complaint initially and they came to the police station a day after the incident. Now the accused have been arrested and we are also working on increasing security arrangements inside all the health centres in the district,” she said.Dr Bhattacharjee’s family, however, is apprehensive about him joining back.“In this pandemic, doctors and health workers are risking their lives but it seems people do not try to understand this. We are not happy and convinced with the way the administration and police are dealing with the case. After my son was assaulted, we lodged a complaint in the local police station. I requested the police to ensure the security of my son and other doctors when they work in government health centres. But it took seven days to arrest the accused who were living not far from the police station. I’m still afraid to send my son to duty.”Dr Sudip Chakraborty, superintendent of Hailakandi civil hospital, said they needed better security for staffers. “We want more security arrangements inside our hospital so that doctors and health workers feel safe while working. We are also planning to install CCTV cameras at the Civil Hospital.,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-police-arrest-2-for-assaulting-junior-doctor-at-hailakandi-hospital-101622813358289.html

The hospitals were, in turn, administering the vaccines for ₹1,560 a dose.Also Read | Profiteering from pandemic: 80k vials already sold, officials now say it was one-time measureThe authorities earlier justified the move, with an official saying that it was “only a one-time measure”.Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday accused the Punjab government of profiteering by selling Covid-19 vaccines to the public “at a premium” and to private hospitals “at a profit”. In a video message, Javadekar alleged 140,000 doses of Covaxin were sold to the state for ₹400 per dose. He added they were then sold to about 20 private hospitals for as much as ₹1,000 per dose. “The private hospitals are selling these doses to the people for ₹1,500 in turn,” he alleged.“The whole state is affected by the pandemic. However, vaccine management is poor, and the government has not even paid attention to testing.

This is a big sin being committed by Congress. Rahul Gandhi, instead of giving lectures to others, should first ensure that work is done being properly in the state,” Javadekar said.Union minister Anurag Thakur, Shiromani Akali Dal leaders Sukhbir Badal, Harsimrat Kaur Badal also hit out at the Punjab government for profiteering from the pandemic.Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday demanded a high court-monitored probe into the manner in which the Congress government “is creating an artificial shortage of vaccines for the common man by selling doses at a hefty profit to private hospitals.”“A case should be registered against state health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu for diverting vaccines meant for the common man to private institutions,” Sukhbir said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-to-ask-private-hospitals-to-return-covid-19-vaccines-after-criticism-101622812637729.html
04-06-2021||India||No deaths reported in those infected with Covid-19 after vaccination, finds AIIMS study||The All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), New Delhi, has conducted a study on individuals who tested Covid-19 positive after vaccination and revealed that there was no fatality. The study was conducted during April-May when the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak.Out of the 63 individuals — 41 male, 22 female —enrolled in the study, 10 individuals were administered Covishield, while 53 received Covaxin. 36 people were administered two doses, and 27 individuals received at least one dose of either Covid-19 vaccine. The patients were aged between 21 and 92 and had no comorbidities.Viral load, the measure of the total number of viral particles in a particular volume of fluid, was high at the time of diagnosis even in vaccinated patients and they also reported high temperature persisting for 5-7 days, similar to symptoms of unvaccinated patients."Viral load at the time of diagnosis was high in all the patients irrespective of vaccination status or type of vaccine received and the initial course of disease with high-grade non-remitting fever lasted for five to seven days in the vaccinated group, similar to the clinical presentation in unvaccinated patients," the report said.The study found that in case of breakthrough infection, which is when someone contracts Covid-19 in spite of being fully or partly vaccinated, the Covid-variants of B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.7 were the two variants of concern."While antibody levels for a subset of patients were available, they became infected nevertheless and presented to the emergency just like other patients, putting in doubt the protection offered and or clinical relevance of total immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a surrogate of COVID-19 immunity," the report added.Cases of infection in vaccinated individuals have also been reported in the US. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that a total of 9,000 individuals had been infected after being vaccinated at the end of April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-deaths-reported-in-those-infected-with-covid-19-after-vaccination-finds-aiims-study-101622812241655.html
04-06-2021||India||On World Environment Day, India’s top ten concerns||The 2021 World Environment Day is being observed at the most difficult of times with India battling on two fronts — the second wave of Covid-19 has caused devastation, and evidence shows that the country has not augured well on environmental norms. Water and air continues to be as polluted, and forest degradation continues, as India tries to revive its economy.India has contributed 30% of the global Covid-19 deaths in May and unlike the first wave, the second wave has spread more to rural areas than cities. In May 2021, 52 % of new cases and 53% of the deaths were from rural areas and health ministry data showed that spread of Covid in villages started from April and it got steam in May.Data from the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)‘s annual state of environment report shows that bad environment with the Covid-19 pandemic can have a devastating impact on rural India, where health infrastructure is very poor. There is a 78% shortage of medical human resource and 32% of health infrastructure in villages as compared to urban areas, the report said.Even as India battles these twin crises, the key to the future lies in ecosystem restoration — the theme for this year’s World Environment Day. Ecosytem restoration basically means reviving old water bodies, building natural forests, providing space to wildlife and reducing water pollution to restore aquatic life. Healthier ecosystems, with richer biodiversity, yield greater benefits such as more fertile soil, bigger yields of timber and fish, and larger stores of greenhouse gases. The UN has dedicated this decade for ecosystem restoration.Also Read | World Environment Day 2021: History, significance and themeIndia needs to work on ecosystem restoration as its water and air quality is deteriorating and the impact of the climate crisis on people and agriculture is clearly visible. Here are the 10 major environmental concerns for India.Climate crisisThe year 2020 was the eighth warmest year on record, and 2016 was the warmest ever, followed by 2009. 12 of the 15 warmest years were recorded during the past 15 years (2006-2020), and 2011-20 was the warmest decade on record.This is a warning for India, with the average yearly temperature in 2020 being 25.78 degree Celsius. India Meteorological Department (IMD) data shows that warming is happening in all seasons, with average difference in summer and winter temperature being five degree Celsius as compared to four degree Celsius in 1901. CSE report also highlighted that the poorest and populated states of India such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Odisha and Chhattisgarh were most vulnerable to the climate crisis. The vulnerability index is based on 14 indicators which include social-economic condition of people and ability of states to adapt to climate change.The biggest human consequence of the climate crisis is large scale displacement. India is the fourth-worst climate induced disaster hit country in the world, according to Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), and has suffered several disasters such as floods, storms and cyclones in 2020 and 2021 till May. India is also prone to other sudden and slow-onset hazards including earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, storm surges and droughts. The 2011-2020 decade saw 33 cyclones, the highest since 1971. An average of around 3.73 million people a year got displaced between 2008 and 2020 in India, the majority by flooding during the monsoon, the CSE said in its report.AgricultureEnvironmental degradation is a major cause of concern for Indian agriculture, with rising use of insecticides and pesticides, which is contaminating soil and ground water. According to Jal Shakti ministry, around half of ground water in agriculture rich districts of Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan is contaminated. Ground water is also depleting in these states because of excess use. A study done by University of Michigan published in March 2021 said that depleting ground water will cause a fall in agriculture produce, especially in wheat growing states such as Haryana and Punjab by 20% by 2025.Also Read | Indian tourists most concerned about polluted beaches, overtourism: SurveyThe impact of the climate crisis is clearly visible on agriculture, with IMD reporting increase in extreme weather events such as hailstorms, excess rain and storms. These factors, various studies have found, have contributed to high farmer suicides in India. According to National Crime Records Bureau, 5957 farmers died by suicide in 2019 as compared to 5763 in 2018.Even though the government of India has launched a mission for organic farming, only two percent of India’s 140 million hectares of farm land is used for organic farming. Organic farming is the highest in Sikkim (100%) followed by Andaman and Nicobar Islands (60%) but is very low in agriculture rich states of Punjab (0.4%) and Haryana (0.7%), said CSE’s state of environment report.WaterAbout 80% of surface water in India is polluted due to dump sewage and garbage, and an alarming percentage of ground water is contaminated by various organic and inorganic sources, said a study Water Sources and Challenges in India published in March 2020.Water bodies in most places are shrinking and according to minor irrigation (MI) census, water bodies declined by about 8% between 2001 and 2006 and another 10% were not in use because of poor quality of water.Less than half of country’s 1.3 billion people receives safe drinking water, though, to be sure, the Jal Shakti ministry has ambitiously and actively been working on its mission of connecting every home with a tap drinking water by 2024.Contrary to general belief, the water quality of India’s 19 major rivers did not improve significantly during the Covid-19-induced lockdown. While Ganga and four other rivers became dirtier, the water quality in another seven rivers remained unchanged, showed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report. Discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage and no freshwater discharges from the upstream are main reasons for pollution levels in rivers.According to CPCB report, India’s major rivers such as Ganga, Yamuna and Godavari have not seen any significant improvement in water quality despite the government spending a huge amount of money for setting up affluent treatment plants to prevent sewage from flowing directly into rivers.Air pollutionOf the 6.67 million deaths due to air pollution in 2019, 1.67 million were in India, the second highest after China, according to a Lancet report. According to a CSE report, deaths because of particulate matter 2.5 pollution have increased by 2.5 times in the past decade, with air pollution rising in most places in India, especially the Indo-Gangetic plains. Also Read | Kerala retains top spot, Bihar at the bottom in SDG India IndexJust five states — Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal and Rajasthan — account for half of the deaths due to air pollution in 2019. The economic cost was equivalent to 1.36% of India’s GDP. The only positive news is that in the past two decades, household air pollution has reduced by about 40% due to use of cooking gas instead of fire-wood.Brown industriesThere is an eight percentage point increase in polluting industries between 2019 and 2021, with 35% increase of such industries in Uttar Pradesh and 12% in West Bengal. Any industry which discharges waste water more than 100 kilolitres a day and/or 429 hazardous chemicals used by the industry as specified under the Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemical Rules of 1989 under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 are considered polluting industries.According to Jal Shakti Ministry, industries in Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Delhi, Bihar and Arunachal have poor compliance with environmental norms. With the rise in hazardous industries between 2017-18 and 2019-20, total waste generation has gone up by almost 7 %. Almost 50% of the hazardous units are in five states and generate 65% of the total waste, says the CSE report.Unsustainable citiesMany Indian cities are environmentally unsustainable. Only 28% of sewage generated in India is treated to remove environmentally hazardously effluents before being released to water bodies. In the last 15 years, India’s sewage treating capacity has increased by only 15%. 10 states in India, including Bihar and Assam, have almost negligible facility for treating sewage. The water bodies have shrunk by about 20% in the last 20 years. This is just one facet of a larger decline in environmental standards across various parameters in Indian cities. BiodiversityIndia is one of the world’s most bio-diverse countries, with 7% of the world’s animal and plant species and 21% of its geographic area under forest cover. To pursue higher economic growth and meet aspirations of people, India is sacrificing a part of its biodiversity. And measuring the health of forest is the best way to understand country’s biodiversity status.Also Read | NGT forms committee to review environmental impact of inland aquacultureAccording to CSE, timber and non-timber forest produce services in India are on decline, suggesting overexploitation of the forest resources. Another indicator of poor forest health is that 14 states have seen a fall in carbon retention services with diversion of forest for projects. The highest fall was reported in Jharkhand, followed by Karnataka and Telangana.Forest firesThe warming of temperature and reduction in rainfall has also led to increase in forest fires in India. As of May 1, the number of fire alerts recorded by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) was 433,581. This is quite a jump, even though the official forest fire season of the country is from February to June. The year 2016, the hottest on record when India’s annual temperature rose 0.71°C over the annual average of 25°C, saw 541,135 forest fires—the most in a decade, CSE report said.The Global Forest Watch report clearly shows that higher the variation in temperature from normal, more forest fires take place. 16 states have seen a significant rise in forest fires, including Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand. However, the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala saw fewer fires than usual.Wild speciesIndia has over 45,000 species of plants and 91,000 species of animals. The IUCN Red List monitors 1,212 animal species in India, and over 12% of them are endangered. Of the 148 endangered species in India, 48 are mammals, 56 reptiles and 23 amphibians. Of the world’s top 35 biodiversity hot spots, four are in India — Western Ghats, Himalayas, Sunderbans and Indo-Burma region. Less than 10% of these hot spots are protected and the vegetation in these hot spots has fallen by up to 50% in the last four decades or so. Despite the increase in climate-induced weather events, spending on disaster resilience measures was either reduced or not increased significantly by most states in 2019-20.EnergyTo save the environment, India has tried to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy and has met almost 55% of its ambitious target of installing 175 GW of renewable capacity by 2022. With one year remaining, the country is unlikely to meet the target, primarily because of small hydro and biomass projects. The country is, however, lagging in meeting it’s solar (35% met) and wind energy (69% met) targets. India has decided to develop 39 solar parks but is yet to operationalise even one of them. Of 40,000 MW target for rooftop solar by 2020, India has only 4,324 MW, according to ministry of new and renewable energy.India’s target of providing around the clock electricity is still elusive, even though agreements about this signed with all states in 2019. Despite stiff resistance from across the world, India’s dependence on thermal continues with 60% of electricity generated from coal based power plants. India will continue to depend on high carbon emitting coal for its electricity for at least another 30 years. India has also refused to agree to net zero emissions aim being propagated by the developed world before Glasgow climate change conference to operationalise the Paris climate agreement. Net zero would mean India will have to set target to phase out usage of coal. Navigating the diplomatic challenge where India resists the target for its economic goals, but continues to shift to renewables, will be a challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-world-environment-day-india-s-top-ten-concerns-101622810777515.html

However, one of the professions which have found itself especially vulnerable in the face of the pandemic in this country is frontline workers, more specifically, the doctors treating Covid-19 patients.Also Read: 624 doctors lost their lives during second Covid-19 wave, says IMAThe Covid-19 second wave has so far claimed the lives of 66 doctors in both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, combined. According to the Indian Medical Association (IMA)'s latest report, as many as 624 doctors have died of the disease so far across the country. The majority of doctors' deaths could be accounted to the second wave of the pandemic, according to the IMA. The organisation added that as many as 34 doctors in Andhra Pradesh and 32 doctors in Telangana also lost their lives in this duration.The Indian Medical Association on Thursday released the figures in this regard. The second wave killed the highest number of doctors in Delhi, with the death toll being 109, it was seen. In the second spot was Bihar, whereas many as 96 doctors lose their lives to the coronavirus disease. 79 doctors died in Uttar Pradesh, 43 in Rajasthan, and 39 in Jharkhand.The IMA estimated that 748 doctors had died across the country in the first wave of Covid-19. As many as 34 lakh cases were registered on Wednesday. In addition, 2,887 people lost their lives due to the pandemic.With this, the number of positive cases has peaked at 2,84,41,986. On the other hand, the total number of deaths spiked to 3,37,989.

04-06-2021||India||'Next Covid wave will reach its peak faster if...': Centre's warning as Covid 2nd wave flattens||As the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has started flattening in the country with every state registering a significant dip in the number of daily infections and fatalities, the Centre on Friday issued a warning saying the situation has not improved because the virus has changed its mind. "If we again start doing what we were doing as a society in December, January, the situation can again go into a difficult phase," Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul said."More of that we do higher will be the wave but if we proceed slowly and continue the tightrope walk, the wave will small. Maybe there will be no wave at all," he said. According to the health ministry's data, there has been a 68 per cent decline in daily cases from May 7, when the highest peak of the second wave was reported. Around 377 districts are reporting less than five per cent case positivity and only 257 districts are reporting more than 100 daily Covid-19 cases.Covid-19: Four steps that can help India avoid a third wave"This is not happening automatically. There are no crowds.. a price that we pay. But we have made it difficult for the virus to travel. But we have to remembers that when the peak is declining, if we start doing what we were doing in January, it will come back again. This is mathematically valid and also valid by common sense," Dr Paul said."If we suddenly go back to the situation of January, February, the next wave will be fast and will reach its peak faster. But if we maintain Covid appropriate behaviour, the wave will be smaller and may not come. We have to buy time to ensure that we achieve high coverage of vaccination before that," Dr Paul said.According to experts, a third wave of the pandemic in India is very much possible the way the second wave struck the country. But its timing and impact can not be predicted as it will depend on the lifting of restrictions and the extend of vaccine coverage etc. It has also been predicted that the third wave might impact children for which state governments are ramping up Covid care facilities for children. The Centre has also issued guidelines for the care and protection of the children infected by Covid and fixed responsibilities for the states, district magistrates, police, Panchayati Raj institutions and urban local bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/next-covid-wave-will-reach-its-peak-faster-if-centre-s-warning-as-covid-2nd-wave-flattens-101622809038832.html

04-06-2021||India||Will Pfizer be allowed for children in India? Will local vaccine makers get indemnity? Govt answers||The Centre on Friday said the issue of granting legal protection to Indian vaccine manufacturers is under watch, a day after reports said Pune's Serum Institute of India has requested the Indian government to extend legal protection. "The issue of indemnity has come up in the context of foreign companies raising the demand. In principle, they expect us to indemnify from legal suits as they are protected in other countries too. We have also checked with other countries and the World Health Organization. This appears to be the fact that they are protected legally protected in other countries," Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul said, during the briefing of the health ministry on Friday.As far as local vaccine makers, like Serum Institute of India, raising a similar demand is concerned, the issue is under watch, Dr Paul said. No decision has been taken as a decision in this regard has to be taken in totality, he said, adding negotiations with Pfizer are on.Will Pfizer be administered to children in India?On being asked whether Pfizer — with which India's agreement is nearing finalisation — will be considered for children between the age of 12 and 15 years as the UK has approved the vaccine for children, Dr Paul said India has its own vaccines being readied for children. "We have to understand that the child cohort is not a small cohort. When we are talking about children, we are talking about at least 13-14 crore population and to cater to them, we will need 26-28 crore doses. So we will have to make a decision based on how many doses of what vaccines are available," Dr Paul said adding that apart from Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, which is now under trial for children, Zydus Cadila's vaccine could be an option as the vaccine is already tested on children. "Bharat Biotech's trial will not take much time. Zydus Cadila's vaccine too will come for licence soon. When it comes, we will have more insight into the matter as this vaccine has already been tested on children," Dr Paul said.As India is expanding its vaccination drive, it is in negotiation with Moderna and Pfizer. While Moderna will be able to share its vaccines with India only in 2022, Pfizer is ready to share 5 crore doses with India but it has imposed two conditions. The US pharma company will only deal with the Centre and it has sought legal protection from the government which means no lawsuit will be filed against the company in India. The demand has raised similar demand from Serum Institute of India as its CEO Adar Poonawalla earlier batted for similar cover for vaccine makers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/issue-of-indemnity-for-india-s-covid-vaccine-makers-under-watch-says-govt-101622804660840.html

He said India wants to be self-reliant in agriculture to astronomy, disaster management to defence technology, vaccines to virtual reality, and biotechnology to battery technology. Modi added India is showing the way to the world in sustainable development and clean energy. He said the country is playing an important role in progress in other countries with its role in software and satellite development.Self-reliance emerged as the cornerstone of the government’s policy response to the coronavirus disease last year.“Coronavirus pandemic has come before the whole world as the biggest challenge of this century, but history is witness to this, when there is a big crisis on humanity, science has given better future ways to be prepared,” he said in his address to a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Society gathering.Also Read | Delhi man detained after night-long search over PM Modi threat callHe praised the scientific community for making Covid vaccines in India in a record time while expressing gratitude to doctors, other medical staff, and front-line workers for their outstanding work despite the adverse circumstances during the pandemic.Modi praised the CSIR for breakthroughs in technology, which he said are a source of pride for the country. “This institution of ours has given so many talents and scientists to the country. A great scientist like Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar has given leadership to this institution,” he said. “India used to wait for years to get hold of innovations achieved outside, now our scientists [are] working at a same quick pace. Today, our scientists are serving the people by working alongside their foreign counterparts.”Modi warned the world about the challenges of the future and said that the climate crisis will become the biggest challenge in the coming times. “We have to prepare for this from now on.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/selfreliant-and-strong-india-remains-the-resolve-says-modi-101622802676703.html
04-06-2021||India||Decline in water due to increase in human, cattle population: Javadekar||There has been a decline in availability of water due to an increase in human and cattle population, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Friday, emphasising on the need to save water.In his keynote address at the curtain raiser event of TERI's World Sustainable Development Summit (WSDS) 2022 and discussion on sustainable, equitable and resilient water use, Javadekar said new technologies must be used to ensure zero wastage of water.The event comes ahead of the World Environment Day, which is celebrated on June 5."India has only four per cent water share of the world's fresh rain water resources. So, there is a basic necessity to save, reuse and repurpose. When India became independent, the availability of water was 5,000 litres per capita now it has become 1,100 litres. There is a basic decline in availability of water due to human and cattle population growth," he said.India has 18 per cent of the world's human population and 18 per cent of the cattle population of the world.The minister said efforts should be made in the field of agriculture to save water as it was consuming nearly 85 per cent of the water."Agriculture is consuming nearly 85 per cent of the water. So, the first saving should come from agriculture. There are new technologies like sprinkling, drip irrigation and other methods to save water which should be used," he said.Javadekar also highlighted the issue of sinking of rivers and lauded the Ken-Betwa River linking project, saying such projects are environmentally important."The best news this year has been the Ken-Betwa agreement between Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh because if the deficit rivers get water from overflowing rivers, that really helps. In Gujarat also, two local rivers are exchanging their waters. Such projects are environmentally important," he said.Acknowledging that several rivers were sinking, the minister said there was a need to replenish water sources in forests where major rivers originated."Rivers are also sinking. In forest areas the major rivers originate. We have decided to augment water and fodder in jungles so that animals also don't come out of the habitat," he said.The minister also spoke about light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology being used for conducting surveys of forests in all states."This year we have used a new technology called the LiDAR survey (light detection and ranging), which will be for all states. We have selected one forest campus in each state and all are being surveyed through this technology. After this our detailed project reports (DPRs) will be ready and after rains, work on watershed development at correct places will start in all states,” he said.Javadekar also said that the Ministry of Environment has provided funds through the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) for this survey and ₹40,000 crore has already been given for compensatory afforestation programme."For 15 years, this money was not getting used because of the Supreme Court judgement. We changed the basis of the Supreme Court decision and distributed funds to all states. I am warning the states repeatedly that these funds be used for the purpose they are meant for,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decline-in-water-due-to-increase-in-human-cattle-population-javadekar-101622799277488.html

Justice Rekha Palli issued notice and posted the matter for August 28.The petition filed by 8 family members of the 21 deceased has claimed that the city government’s finding is a cover up of its failure. The plea filed through advocate Utsav Bains has also sought compensation for the families while also seeking directions to seize the CCTV footage of the hospital.Hindustan Times had first reported on May 4 the findings of a committee constituted by the Delhi government to collate the data of the deaths that had taken place due to the alleged shortage of medical oxygen for the purposes of compensation. On April 27, the Delhi high court had asked the Delhi government to provide a list of the people who had died due to the shortage of oxygen.Quoting HT, the petitioners said that they first got to know about the finding from the news report. The plea has said that there was complete inaction and failure of the city government to provide adequate supply of oxygen in spite of having knowledge that any shortage would be fatal for the life of Covid-19 patients and immediately cause their death.It alleged that the report prepared by Delhi government’s committee is “erroneous and has been prepared to favour the Delhi government”. “..the cause of the death of the deceased has been mentioned as respiratory failure by the doctors for the reason that proper oxygen supply was not given to the deceased on time. It is the case of the hospital that when the oxygen supply did not come on time the deceased were put on oxygen cylinders, however, the requisite pressure was not there and due to same, the patients died while suffocating for oxygen," the plea read“The observation by the committee that the patients were receiving some form of oxygen therapy has been made to mislead the court. The Committee did not examine the issue of demand and supply of oxygen to the hospital and also has not taken statements by families of victims on record,” it added.It said that the authorities in the present case have rendered themselves not only liable to pay compensation to the families of the deceased victims but also for criminal prosecution under section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The petition said that shockingly, the hospital authorities did not even inform the family members about the shortage otherwise they would have arranged for at-least Highflow Oxygen Cylinders and this would have saved the life of their loved ones.“It is submitted that most of the patients (now deceased) were recovering inasmuch as they were regularly informing their family members about improvements in their health. The deceased victims were in constant touch with their family members and were stable. However, suddenly in the intervening night of 23/24th April, 2021, the Petitioners were informed by the respondent hospital about the demise of the patients,” the petition read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-issues-notice-on-plea-seeking-cbi-probe-in-deaths-due-to-shortage-of-oxygen-at-jaipur-golden-hospital-101622799267711.html
04-06-2021||India||Include history, personalities of northeast in NCERT textbooks: Student unions||The recent racist remarks by a Punjabi YouTuber Paras Singh against Arunachal Pradesh has triggered a Twitter campaign demanding the inclusion of the “history, ethnicity, culture, lifestyle, personalities, natural resources and patriotism” of the northeastern states of India in the NCERT textbooks. The Twitter storm is scheduled to take place from 6-8pm on Friday.The Twitter storm was triggered by a video uploaded by Singh, a 21-year-old YouTuber from Ludhiana, last week. In the video, he commented on former MP Ninong Ering’s appearance saying he did not “look Indian” and claimed that Arunachal Pradesh is not a part of India, but is in China.“Educating the masses is the only viable solution to such kind of racism,” said Ashmita Bharadwaj, vice-president of Northeast Student Union (NESU) Vadodara. NESU Vadodra is the organiser of this campaign against racism geared towards northeastern states.Also Read | Arunachal court remands Punjab YouTuber to six days in jail in racial slur caseAfter NESU Vadodara reached out to universities across the eight northeastern states, over 40 of them, including Dibrugarh University, Manipur University, Mizoram University, NIT Agartala, as well as student unions in Delhi, Manipur, and other parts of the country have come on board to participate.“Our aim is to only humbly appeal to our Central authority for an obligatory place in the NCERT textbooks for northeast India’s history, ethnicity, vibrancy, diversity, special features, eminent personalities and contribution to India’s development,” said Bharadwaj. On being asked why NCERT, the NESU president said, “NCERT textbooks are widely used in educational institutions across the country. These books can be availed online as well as offline from every nook and corner of India and [NCERT] functions under the Central government. It has a pan-India effect.”Prerna Das, a third-year law student from IP University, New Delhi, said, “I am glad an organisation is taking the initiative of spreading awareness about a part of India which most people are not even aware of.”“If I go to a fifth grader, a ninth grader or a twelfth grader and ask them about any key topic of northeastern history, their response would be the same, regardless of which class they are in. It’s not their fault, we are never taught. If the nation is serious about integrating its ‘peripheral’ areas, then changing the educational curriculum to include the northeast would be a start,” said Neha Sharma Sangma, who is a part of Garo Student Union. “Northeast Indians facing racism in their own country is nothing new. Almost everyone I know has been subjected to some form of racial slur or discrimination because apparently we don’t look ‘Indian enough’. I have been asked numerous times to speak in Chinese, which is almost amusing because of the level of ignorance,” she added.The plan is to tag chief ministers, education ministers and other concerned authorities to bring the issue to their notice, Bharadwaj said. A few politicians such as K Therie, former finance minister of Nagaland, MLA Kuzholuzo Nienu from Nagaland, as well as Arunachal Pradesh’s Ninong Ering have extended their support to the Twitter storm.Speaking to HT, Ering said, “The way forward is the introduction of the northeast to mainland India. If some kind of knowledge on the northeast is provided at the primary or even secondary level, then such instances of racism would not be there. The students want to showcase northeast as part of India and they want to feel included. It is for a good cause.”Talking about racism and stereotypes faced by northeasterners, he said, “The mindset has to change and the mindset should be changed in childhood. Unless and until the idea of inclusion is not there, racism will always prevail.”In 2017, Ering had introduced a Private Member Bill ‘The Compulsory teaching of North-East culture in Educational Institutions’ in the Parliament, but it was not taken up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/include-history-personalities-of-northeast-in-ncert-textbooks-student-unions-101622801716630.html

In a press conference announcing her resignation, Nag said, "There is no conducive atmosphere for me to discharge my duties. No one should ever face a situation like this."Also Read: ‘Humiliated’: Mysuru civic body chief resignsRohini Sindhuri, on the other hand, denied the allegations levelled against her and blamed IAS officer Shilpa Nag for submitting "contradictory" ward-wise Covid-19 data.Here's a rundown of the controversy surrounding these two IAS officers in Mysuru:What is the controversy about?At its heart, the controversy in Mysuru centres on two IAS officers accusing each other of showing personal grudge.Shilpa Nag, a 2014-batch IAS officer who has been the Mysuru city commissioner (MCC) since February earlier this year, alleged that Mysuru district deputy commissioner Rohini Sindhuri has been "targetting" her after media reports stated that the MCC has been doing a decent job in controlling the Covid-19 outbreak in the city.Shilpa Nag's accusationsShilpa Nag said that Rohini Sindhuri held a "personal grudge" against her and resented the praise that the MCC was getting for managing the Covid-19 situation. Nag said that she is sending her resignation to the chief secretary."Today I am resigning. There is no conducive atmosphere for me to discharge my duties. No one should ever face a situation like this," said Shilpa Nag in a press conference on Thursday.Nag said that despite getting most of the work done within her corporation limits, there were calls being made to her office citing dereliction of duty in the preparation of the Covid-19 pandemic in the city.“They are meting out insults and spreading misinformation. No one should work with so much arrogance,” she said, making another apparent reference to Sindhuri. “I cannot work in this suffocating environment,” she added.Rohini Sindhuri's responseRohini Sindhuri, a 2009-batch IAS officer, denied all the allegations levelled against her as "false" and "baseless", and in turn, accused Shilpa Nag of dereliction of duty. “It is untrue that there was any harassment from me and none has been mentioned even in the statement issued by Shilpa Nag,” said Sindhuri on Thursday.Rejecting the allegation of harassment as untrue, the deputy commissioner of Mysuru district said, "The Mysuru city corporation was submitting unsigned and contradictory ward-wise Covid-19 figures on new cases, deaths and active cases. I had ordered that same be rectified."Rohini Sindhuri also said that Shilpa Nag had of late stopped attended coronavirus review meetings convened by her. She even said that Nag is yet to furnish details of CSR coming in from private companies towards the pandemic and other works.“It is for everyone to note that over the last 10 days Shilpa has been issuing statements to press and media against the district administration. Such conduct not expected from a Mysuru city commissioner,” Sindhuri added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mysuru-dc-rohini-sindhuri-accused-of-harassing-mcc-s-shilpa-nag-all-you-need-to-know-101622797575038.html
04-06-2021||India||Tikait says farm laws will be gone by 2024, vows to fight till then||Rakesh Tikait, leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, a key farm organisation behind the ongoing farmers’ agitation, celebrated his birthday on Friday with a vow to not rest until the three agricultural laws at the heart of protests were scrapped, but predicted the legislation would be gone by 2024. “(The) government will definitely agree to (scrap the laws). The laws will be withdrawn by 2024. It’s certain. In three years, the laws will go,” he said. The ruling National Democratic Alliance’s current term ends in 2024, when it will face the next Lok Sabha election. Asked what made him so confident since the government has said it was willing to suspend the laws for 18 months, not repeal them, Tikait said: “Why will they not withdraw it? What do you mean by ‘no, it looks impossible’ (withdrawal of the laws)?” The farm leader, however, did not clearly state the reasons behind his assertion. Asked if he had any word with the government on rescinding the laws, he said: “No, we have talked to the public. The public will decide and the laws will go. The government will have to withdraw them.” Also Read | Farmers slam central, state govts for labelling them Covid super-spreadersTikait said he had talked to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath recently over the phone. “Yes, I talked to him over phone. No meeting. In UP, there are arrears of ₹23,000 crore payable to sugarcane farmers. We raised these issues of pending sugarcane dues, and rising diesel and electricity prices that are hurting farmers,” Tikait said. “We will meet the (UP) chief minister when corona subsides,” he said. Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, are demanding the rollback of three laws passed in September last year, mounting a political challenge for the Modi government. Tikait has entrenched the protests firmly in his home turf, the politically crucial sugarcane belt of western Uttar Pradesh. The Tikaits belong to the Baliyan khap, a dominant clan among the Jat agrarian community in western UP, most of who are sugarcane growers. They voted overwhelmingly for the ruling BJP in the past elections. So far, 11 rounds of talks between 40 farm leaders and the government have failed to resolve the agitation. Both the government and farmers had called off the series of discussions on January 22, citing lack of progress. Under Tikait, the farmers’ protests have branched off into a regional uprising. He has built a groundswell of support for the agitation by raising local farm issues, such as the problems of sugarcane growers and growing cultivation costs, aside from the demand of scrapping the laws. The government has said the agricultural laws would spur investments and give farmers freedom to sell their produce directly to large buyers in a sector that accounts for nearly 15% of India’s $2.9 trillion economy and employs half its workforce. Farmers say the laws will threaten their livelihoods by forcing them to sell to corporate giants at poor prices instead of government-run markets, which offer assured prices. “The farmers’ agitation will not only impact but may well be a deciding factor in the UP’s state elections in 2022. The BJP claimed the agitation was limited to western UP, but lost some key seats in Ayodhya, Varanasi and Gorapkhpur in the panchayat polls,” said Sudhir Panwar, who teaches at Lucknow University. On May 21, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a platform of farm unions leading the protests, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to resume dialogue to end the agitation. Reacting to the letter, farm minister Narendra Tomar had said since the farmers had rejected all the government’s proposals, they should come up with a new proposal before talks could be held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-laws-will-be-gone-by-2024-vow-to-fight-till-then-saystikait-101622800516820.html

"The release is also subject to the undertaking given by Panacea Biotec that 20 per cent of the sale proceeds will be deposited by it with High Court Registry," the division bench of Justice Manmohan and Justice Najmi Waziri said.Panacea Biotec filed an application in the court for the release of its arbitral award money, which was awarded to it in 2019 in a 2010 case. The company said if it gets the money now, it can use it to manufacture the Sputnik V vaccine in India. The company has already manufactured trial batches of Sputnik V in collaboration with the Russian Direct Investment Fund, it said.In an earlier hearing of the case, the Centre opposed the plea and said that the manufacturing of Sputnik V will not be beneficial to the country as it will supply the vaccines to the international market. The Centre also said that the company had not even got the licence to produce the Russian vaccine.The court commented that there is untapped potential for vaccine making in the country and "some people should be charged for manslaughter if they are sitting on untapped potential”.“There is a lot of scope and infrastructure which is available for manufacturing of vaccines. This untapped potential has to be utilised... People from abroad are coming. You have good vaccines in India. You handhold these vaccine manufacturers and take them all over India and tell them this hub is available and use this. There is an emergency,” the division bench of justices Manmohan and Najmi Waziri told the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/release-rs-14-crore-to-panacea-biotec-if-it-gets-nod-to-produce-sputnik-v-delhi-hc-to-centre-101622800057328.html

It is estimated that the tourism industry of the state has suffered losses worth ₹1,600 crore in 2020 due to the pandemic."We have submitted a proposal to the chief minister seeking a relief package to inject life into our embattled tourism industry," Tourism and Culture Minister Satpal Maharaj said on Friday. "Tourism is our bread and butter and it has suffered at multiple levels due to the pandemic. A relief package at this stage will do a world of good to people in the sector," Maharaj told PTI in an interview.Citing the findings of a study conducted by IIM, Kashipur, the minister said Covid caused losses worth ₹1,600 crore to the tourism industry of Uttarakhand in 2020 besides rendering around 23,000 people jobless.The losses caused by the second wave of corona this year have not been estimated yet, he said. The relief package has been sought for hoteliers, owners of roadside eateries, tour and travel operators, and people connected with adventure tourism like rafting and trekking who are facing a livelihood crisis with no tourists arriving due to the pandemic."While Kumbh had to be scaled down for people's safety due to a raging second wave, the Chardham yatra has been hit hard by the Covid induced restrictions for the second consecutive year. It has been a big blow to the tourism industry," the minister said.Hotels in tourist hubs like Nainital and Mussoorie have suffered bulk cancellation of bookings in recent months due to the second wave of the pandemic which had shown signs of abating in February-March. Tour and travel operators have also suffered from no tourists around. Covid curfew has been in force in Uttarakhand for several weeks now and vehicle operators are almost off the roads, he said.    "A relief package for the tourism industry at this hour will give it the much needed shot in the arm," Maharaj said adding that the chief minister has also been asked to include folk artists as beneficiaries of the relief package as they do not get a chance to perform and earn with no cultural programmes being held by the tourism and culture department for more than a year. Maharaj said he has also requested the chief minister to go for a phased opening of the Chardham Yatra after the Covid curfew is lifted in the state.Although the famous Himalayan temples of Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri are open for daily prayers, they have been kept out of bounds for pilgrims in view of Covid.  Pilgrimage to the Himalayan temples faced similar hurdles last year and opened finally with mandatory restrictions like a negative RT-PCR test report which limited the footfall of devotees to around 3.5 lakh only during the entire yatra season. However, the minister said the tourism scenario though bleak should not lead to despair."Covid is a global crisis. Many tourist hubs in the world have battled it and overcome the challenges. We should draw inspiration from them and look forward with hope," he said citing the instance of Dubai where the tourism industry is already showing signs of recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-tourism-industry-faces-livelihood-crisis-seeks-covid-relief-package-101622796350607.html

Now he will be sent to judicial custody.Pithani's arrest comes just almost a year after Sushant Singh Rajput's death into which a multi-agency probe is going on. The NCB has been probing the drugs angle of the case after the Enforcement Directorate shared some chats related to drug purchase and procurement with the NCB.After Pithani's arrest, the NCB arrested drug peddler Haris Khan in connection with the same case. Khan is believed to have links with gangster and drug peddler Parvez Khan alias Chinku Pathan, an associate of fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim.In the latest development of the Sushant Singh Rajput case, the NCB has recently interrogated two former domestic workers of the late actor — Neeraj and Keshav.Sushant's friend Rhea, her brother Showik, and several of his staff members including Samuel Miranda, Deepesh Sawant, were arrested in connection with this case and the NCB said many have disclosed that Pithani was also involved in the procurement of drugs.Pithani's association with Sushant Singh Rajput started around 2017 as Sushant's friend Ayush Sharma introduced them. In 2019, Pithani came to Mumbai and stayed with the late actor for some time. At that time, Pithani was working on Sushant Singh Rajput's Dreams 150 project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-drug-case-sushant-singh-rajput-s-friend-siddharth-pithani-sent-to-14-day-judicial-custody-101622796081067.html

In the wake of the second wave, the second Covid package of ₹20,000 crore is being announced to address the emerging health, social and economic challenges," Balagopal said, according to news agency ANI."The package provides ₹2,800 crore for health emergencies, ₹8,900 crore for direct disbursement to people, and ₹8,300 crore for various loans and interest subsidies aimed at financial revival," he added.Balagopal said the effort would be to reduce the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensure there is no third wave of the coronavirus disease in the state. "We will consider the concerns over the third wave of the pandemic. The health emergency existing is a challenge to the development prospects of the state," he added."The central government is withdrawing from the obligation to vaccinate persons above 18 years of age. But the state government cannot shirk its primary responsibility. Therefore, I set apart ₹1,000 crore for the purchase of free vaccine for all those above 18 years of age and ₹500 crore for the purchase of allied equipment. A flawless system will be planned for the distribution of the vaccine," said the finance minister in the state assembly.In the agricultural sector, Balagopal promised infrastructure refinancing from National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) to Primary Co-operative Societies (PACS) at a 4% interest rate to be made available through Kerala Bank. "The aim is to provide loans of ₹2,000 crore in the financial year 2021-22. The government will also provide low-interest rate loans for new ventures in the agro-industrial and service sectors, for the revival of existing dormant enterprises, and for a new commercial. The target is to provide loans of ₹1600 crore by 2021-22," Balagopal said.He said that ₹1,000 crore credit will be provided to Kudumbashree self-help groups through bank loans during the financial year 2021-22.Kerala on Thursday registered 18,853 fresh coronavirus disease cases, taking the total number of those affected to 25.54 lakh.

04-06-2021||India||How the second wave devastated the elderly in India||One evening, in late-May, Neeta Malhotra, a senior citizen, needed help to cremate her elderly mother, in a South Delhi colony.In March, just before the number of Covid-19 cases started increasing and spiralling out of control, her family had four living members. Towards the end of May, Sharma found herself all alone. Her husband, an able-bodied ex-army officer contracted the virus and never made it back from hospital. Her mother-in-law and mother died of old age. They were both 94.That evening in May, she was bereft. The doctors advised her to go through with the cremation as soon as possible. It was already 6pm. She picked up her phone and called Gaurav Khosla, the president of the resident welfare association, who in turn, quickly called the local member of the legislative assembly, Somnath Bharti.“My sorrow is mine and I am learning to deal with it but one must never forget the acts of kindness,” she says, narrating how Bharti reached her home, arranged for a hearse and accompanied her for the cremation. For a while at least, she forgot that the family had been reduced from four members to one. Malhotra acknowledges the help and is grateful for it. She now spends her mornings teaching her support staff’s children.Twenty kilometers away, in a slum colony in east Delhi, Shokat Ali, 73, who has three daughters and two sons, is confronting another set of challenges. He is dependent on help from Agewell Foundation, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that works with the elderly. Their offices are shut but their services are not.Through a network of 80,000 volunteers, across states, Himanshu Rath, the organisation’s founder, is working overtime to help the elderly destitute, including Ali who worked as a plumber but can work no more. He gets dry rations and one of his daughter comes by with food, once in a while. What do you do when you’re hungry? “I can cook Maggi (instant noodles),’’ he says.Also Read | Despite Covid, our resolve of Aatmanirbhar Bharat remains: PM ModiCovid-19 has changed Ali’s life completely. He cannot stir out of his jhuggi. There are no parks in the neighbourhood and everyone around him is trying to survive and subsist. “If 10 out of 100 are suffering from Covid, the remaining are suffering from the fear of Covid. We work for a better tomorrow but the elderly are at a loss. They don’t know if they will survive,” says Rath.The living abandoned, the abandoned deadAt 140 million, India has the second largest population of old people in the world, as per the 2011 census. Several NGOs working with the elderly are finding themselves totally stretched. From providing dry rations to cooked meals, medicines to hospital beds, psychological counselling to physical hand holding in homes for those with dementia and Alzheimer’s, social workers are also helping rescue the “living abandoned” and the “abandoned dead”. Most of them work with the police and social welfare departments and receive urgent calls for help.HelpAge India, an NGO that is focusing on the elderly, has 176 mobile health units, each equipped with a doctor, a pharmacist and a social protection officer. Says Imtiaz Ahmed, Mission head, AgeCare division, “The units, which take health care to the interiors and to the doorsteps of the bed-ridden, are now doubling up as ambulances. The saddest aspect of this pandemic is that the elderly are being abandoned.”AgeCare’s statistics speak volumes of how cruel the second wave has been on India’s senior citizens. The total number of calls for help in the January to May period for 2020 and 2021 has shot up by 36%. Distress calls that include pleas for rescue of the abandoned elderly are up by 82.7% and information pertaining to the missing or the dead are also up by 60%. There is a 65% rise in those seeking medical assistance. Those reporting abuse, domestic violence and property dispute issues are also up by 19%.The mental health impact Agewell Foundation’s Rath has received several calls from the elderly complaining that they are being pressured into writing their wills. When written, family disputes break out, on why a particular son has been given more of the share of the property or jewellery. “There have been cases where the elderly have been denied food. That’s the family’s way of punishing the parent for writing the will a particular way. This adds to the insecurity of the senior citizens who, already isolated, are then denied food and medicines,” says Rath.Senior psychologist Suresh Kumar, who counsels Agewell’s client base, is dealing with a host of issues. “We are providing a confidential space to the elderly who are grappling with property issues, post-retirement blues, job losses, the fear of dying and a deep sense of loss. There was less panic during the first wave. This time, the fear of death has become real.” says Kumar.Also Read | RBI announces additional measures to mitigate impact of second Covid-19 waveAn Agewell survey, based on 5,000 respondents, found the elderly complaining of depression, anxiety, fear and a sense of loneliness and isolation. According to the study, released last month, there has been an over 50% rise in the number of older people seeking help for psychological issues.The elderly are grappling with innumerable questions.“Will I get a hospital bed if I get Covid?”“Will I die?”“Will our children die before us?”“Will our children lose their jobs?”“What kind of world are we leaving behind for our grandchildren?”The answers are not easy.Some of the elderly don’t have enough food to eat and many more are dependent on the network of NGOs for medicines and vaccines.As part of its medical kit, Agewell is also distributing adult diapers for the severely ill, who are bed-ridden. Says Rath, “They also suffer humiliation and a loss of basic human dignity. They are totally dependent on family members, some of who are understanding while many are not. They too are grappling with the sheer grind of life.”The care infrastructure Some of the elderly are in a position to afford care giving services. Samvedna is one such organisation which provides senior care service for a price. “The children find us,” says its founder, Archana Sharma. Packages can cost up to ₹30,000 a month and include a “care at home” model.Also Watch | 124-year-old woman administered Covid vaccine in J&K’s Baramulla“While last year’s lockdown saw us providing groceries and medication, this time, mental health issues have surfaced. It has gotten closer to home for all of us and the elderly are scared of losing family members.”Jayashree Dasgupta, Co-Founder, Samvedna, is catering to the psychological aspects of elderly clients who have children living far away in different cities. “We are seeing an increase in clients but we also lose a lot of clients due to mortality. The elderly under our care can’t visit their children and relatives; they can’t go for the last rites of members they’ve lost and they struggle with this a lot. The pandemic has turned lives upside down.”Caring for the elderly is a constant firefighting operation and Mumbai-based Silver Innings is trying to focus on engagement with the elderly. Its founder president, Sailesh Mishra, has tied up with Tata Trust and the All India Senior Citizen Confederation to devise quiz programmes and art and music therapy sessions. “We have co-opted the grandchildren to help grandparents get online through WhatsApp and Facetime calls,’’ says Mishra.He points to a crucial fault line that is affecting the elderly: Old age care is not yet an essential service. He also has a problem – like many of his colleagues across the NGO network – with the concept of social distancing. “Physical distancing is important but how do you distance yourself socially when loneliness lies at the heart of this fight?’’ he asks.It is not an easy ride for the NGOs. Sonali Sharma, HelpAge’s communication head points to a basic problem. “The able-bodied run faster than the elderly when our teams are out distributing ration. How do you differentiate between a hungry child and a hungry elder?”The government has now devised a policy for children orphaned by the pandemic. It needs to do the same for the elderly.Agewell has submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. The primary objective of the proposal, titled, “National Initiative for Emotional Empowerment of Older Persons,” is to inculcate a sense of belief for a better tomorrow, to help the older people deal with Covid-19.That is key. The ill, the fearful, the hungry, the abused, rich and poor, are living in the hope of a better tomorrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-the-second-wave-devastated-the-elderly-in-india-101622793016328.html

It is part of a larger basket of aerosols that impact climate change directly and indirectly, according to Hartwig Schafer, vice president of the World Bank’s South Asia region.“Recent devastating flash floods attributed to a collapsing glacier in the Himalayas were a sobering reminder of the sometimes disastrous effects of climate change and the dangers we have to protect against,” said Schafer.He added that as glaciers shrink, the lives and livelihoods of many people downstream are affected by changes in the water supply. "We can slow glacier melt by collectively acting to curb the black carbon deposits that are speeding the thinning of the ice. Regional cooperation to protect these resources will pay important dividends for the health and well-being of the people in the region,” he added.How to control it?The World Bank said that countries in South Asia must work together to manage hydropower resources, an important source for the region’s clean energy needs and a generator of energy trade and security. Unstable water flow from glacier melt and more variable precipitation underscore the need to stabilise availability over the longer term to make hydropower more viable.It also said that regional cooperation will be necessary to create joint adaptation strategies, adding that a first step could be sharing information about the evolving state of glaciers and risks associated with it.“Water resource management policies must evolve because the trends we are observing point to a different and more challenging future,” said Muthukumara Mani, lead economist in the World Bank’s South Asia region and a lead author of the report.“Success will require an active and agile cooperation between researchers and policymakers so both groups can continue to learn about the problems at hand,” he added.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heres-how-black-carbon-deposits-causing-glaciers-snow-melt-in-himalayan-ranges-101622789118845.html

04-06-2021||India||Indian tourists most concerned about polluted beaches, overtourism: Survey||As many as 24% of 18,327 people surveyed for international digital travel agency Agoda’s sustainable travel trends survey believe governments have the responsibility when it comes to making changes to help make travel more sustainable. At least 20% said they themselves have to ensure it. The survey found pollution of beaches and waterways, and “overtourism” in India were the top two concerns among the tourists. The single-use plastics and energy inefficiencies (including overconsumption of electricity/water) ranked third.The survey launched to mark World Environment Day on Saturday highlighted tourists globally consider governments most accountable for making positive environmental changes around travel, followed by tourism authorities and individuals. Tourists from Indonesia and UK were most likely (36%) to hold governments most accountable followed by those from China (33%), Australia (28%), Malaysia (27), and India (24%).Also Read | UK unlikely to relax foreign travel curbs amid Covid-19 surgeManaging their waste including using less single-use plastics, switching off the air conditioners and lights when leaving their accommodation, and looking for eco-friendly accommodation were the responses of the respondents when asked how they will make the post-Covid travel scenario better.“...when asked about what Indians associated the most with sustainability, the top three results were renewable resources (36%), natural cleaning products (32%), and eco-friendly design/furniture (31%),” the survey report said.John Brown, chief executive officer of Agoda, said what is also clear is that while globally the message is governments need to take the lead on managing sustainable travel, there is recognition that some responsibility lies with people’s own behaviour. “This past year at Agoda, we have seen a shift in travel patterns as people, limited to domestic travel, explore lesser-known areas. If managed well, not only does this help support independent hoteliers and accommodation providers that rely economically on the tourist dollar, but it can also help lessen the environmental burden on overcrowded areas.”The survey found respondents from South Korea (35%), India (31%), and Taiwan (31%) were keener on the need to travel more sustainably. “It is concerning that many people see sustainable travel as less important today than they did before Covid-19, but I hope that is just a short-term effect, driven by people’s thirst to get back out there and travel any way they can,” Brown said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-tourists-most-concerned-about-polluted-beaches-overtourism-survey-101622786900009.html

The request by Arunachal Pradesh Chakma Students Union (APCSU) was in response to a recent directive by Centre authorising officials in 13 districts of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Punjab to approve citizenship applications of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan in those districts. The memorandum submitted through email said 14,888 Chakma-Hajongs, who are Buddhists and Hindus, migrated to India between 1964 and 1966 from Chittagong Hills Tract (CHT) of then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) to escape religious persecution and were settled in North East Frontier Agency (now Arunachal Pradesh). They were settled under a rehabilitation plan, allotted land and provided financial assistance, depending on the size of their families. In January 1996, the Supreme Court directed the Centre to grant them citizenship as per provisions of the Citizenship Act, 1995. Hearing another petition, the apex court in September 2015 directed the Centre to process the pending citizenship applications of 4,627 Chakma and Hajongs within three months. Also Read | How India’s water mission is overcoming the challenge in the Northeast“However, the apex court direction has not been complied with and is getting delayed for one reason or the other,” said APCSU president Drishya Muni Chakma.The memorandum urged Shah to grant citizenship to 4,627 Chakma-Hajongs immediately, instruct the Arunachal Pradesh government to allow enrolment of all eligible Chakmas and Hajongs in electoral rolls, and also include the two communities in central and state welfare schemes. “Shah had indicated two years ago that the Chakma-Hajong problem will be resolved before October 2020. We seek his urgent intervention in granting citizenship to 4,627 and also ensure that those who got citizenship are able to enjoy all facilities and rights,” said Chakma. As per 2011 census, there are 47,471 Chakmas and Hajongs in Arunachal Pradesh of which nearly 90% have got citizenship by birth under Section 3 of the Citizenship Act, 1955.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/grant-citizenship-to-chakma-hajongs-in-arunachal-student-body-writes-to-shah-101622786066194.html
04-06-2021||India||RBI Monetary Policy highlights: From unchanged repo rate to reduced economic growth forecast||The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday announced it will maintain the status quo on its key rates. RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that it was decided to keep the repo rate and the reverse repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and 3.35 per cent respectively to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on the economy."Enduring lesson from Covid-19 experience in the Indian context has been the deployment of unconventional monetary policy measures that distribute liquidity among all stakeholders," Das said.Also read: Sensex, Nifty trade flat ahead of RBI’s monetary policy announcementDas said that the policy committee has decided to maintain the accommodative stance to continue as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth and ensure that inflation remains within the target.Here are the key highlights of the MPC announcement:1. Besides, unchanged repo rate and reverse repo rate, the MPC decided to keep the bank rates the same too at 4.25 per cent.2. The economic growth forecast was cut to 9.5 per cent for the current fiscal from the previous 10.5 per cent, announced Das. Das said 18.5 per cent real GDP growth is expected in the first quarter, 7.9 per cent in the second quarter, 7.2 per cent in the third quarter and 6.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2021-22.3. RBI's MPC has projected the consumer price inflation (CPI) at 5.1 per cent during 2021-22. RBI governor Das announced 5.2 per cent CPI in the first quarter, 5.2 per cent in the second quarter, 4.7 per cent in the third quarter and 5.3 per cent in the fourth quarter.4. Das especially commended the resilience of the farm economy, however, the dent in urban demand and spread of infection in rural India poses risks to the normalisation of the economy, he said. A normal monsoon, resilience of agriculture and farm economy, adoption of Covid-compatible business models and gathering momentum of global recovery can help revive the domestic economy when the second wave of coronavirus disease abates, the governor said.5. The governor said it has been observed that the mobility indicators declined but were seen above the levels of last year. The impact on economic activities due to the second wave of the virus is expected to be relatively contained in comparison to that of the first wave, with restrictions on mobility being nuanced and regionalised.Also read | Banks shouldn’t cite 2018 crypto note: RBI6. Further on the assessment of growth and inflation, the MPC observed that India's exports in March, April and May 2021 have been on an upswing. "Conducive external conditions are forming for a durable recovery beyond pre-pandemic levels, targeted policy support for exports is need of the hour," Das said.7. The governor of the central bank said that the focus of RBI is turning from systemic liquidity to equitable distribution. He also added that the vaccine policy of the country is expected to gather steam in the coming months and should help normalise economic activities.8. RBI took several steps to inject liquidity in the economy as it conducted regular Open Market Operations (OMO) to the tune of ₹36,545 crore till May 31, Das said. This was in addition to ₹60,000 crore under the G-SAP 1.0.9. Das also highlighted that the country's foreign exchange reserves touched $598.2 billion as of May 28. The forex reserves are at a striking distance of reaching $600 billion.10. Policy measures decided by the MPC panel to boost economic recovery include opening ₹15,000 crore window till March 2022. Banks can provide fresh lending support to restaurants, adventure and heritage, aviation ancillary, private bus operators, rental car service providers among others in the hospitality industry that suffered significant damage from the pandemic.11. To ensure further support to the medium, small, micro enterprises (MSMEs), RBI has lent ₹50,000 crore support to all Indian financial institutions. Of this, ₹15,000 crore support is provided to the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) for aid to the MSMEs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rbi-monetary-policy-highlights-from-unchanged-repo-rate-to-reduced-economic-growth-forecast-101622781067505.html
04-06-2021||India||Why Google showed Kannada as 'ugliest language of India': Explained||Google attracted a massive backlash in the country recently after it showed Kannada, a language predominantly spoken in the southwest part of India, as the answer to the search query "ugliest languages".Kannada language speakers slammed the search engine giant for insulting the historically significant language, which dates back over 2,000 years. According to the image shared widely on social media, the answer to the question, “What is the ugliest language in India?” was Kannada. “The answer is Kannada spoken by around 40 million people in south India,” according to a screenshot of the search results.The Karnataka government also condemned this on Thursday and warned of appropriate action against Google. "This is a very condemnable thing. If Google or anyone else behaves in contempt of Kannada language or insults Kannada, appropriate action will be taken against them," said Arvind Limbawali, minister for forest, Kannada and culture in Karnataka.Limbawali also said that the secretary of the department has been briefed about the matter and has been instructed to issue a notice to Google immediately.Meanwhile, the tech giant has deleted the response and apologised, saying the search results weren’t always perfect. Google also said that the concerned team takes a swift corrective action when it is made aware of the issue. It also said that the it is working to continuously to improve the algorithms and "does not reflect the opinions of Google."So what exactly happened?The search results on Google are algorithm-based and depend on keywords for websites and their online content. When a user enters their query, the algorithm looks across the internet for websites and articles that have related keywords and brings the result that it thinks is the best fit.This is commonly known as search engine optimisation or SEO. Hence, experts say that the real culprits here are sites that may have written content based on these lines and used the keywords.In December 2018, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told US Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren that how the company has little to no control over the search results after it showed Donald Trump's images to a query related to the word "idiot." During the House Judiciary Committee hearing, Pichai explained that the search results are based on Google search indexes, webpages and the keywords, images attached to those pages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-google-showed-kannada-as-ugliest-language-of-india-explained-101622784047314.html

As per a list provided by the central secretariat services forum (CSS), a representative body of central secretariat service officers, 60 officials in various government departments have lost their lives during the second wave of the pandemic. As many as 119 officials working in the Central Board of Direct Taxes and 110 in the Central Board of Indirect Taxes have also lost their lives to the pandemic, as per government sources. The All India Banking Employees Association (AIBEA) that also has asked the Centre to ensure that rules are relaxed for appointments on compassionate grounds. AIBEA general secretary CH Venkatachalam said there have been about 1,400 casualties in the banking sector since the pandemic began in 2020. In a letter to department of personnel & training minister Jitendra Singh on May 26, the CSS forum said, “As per official figures reported in India till now, 0.03% of citizens of age 21 and above have died due to Covid-19 whereas a whopping 0.6% of CSS offices have died due to Covid 19 till date, which is 20 times of the national average.” Seeking a relaxation in rules for appointment, it said there is already a long list of requests for compassionate appointments which are pending with almost all department heads in different ministries and departments. Also Read | States lifted full PMGKAY quota in May, says CentreA member of the CSS union said since there is no provision of ex gratia for civil servants like in the armed forces; families can only get help on the basis of family pension, gratuity, insurance etc. “Taking cognisance of delays in release of terminal benefits to families of the deceased particularly in states, the union had urged the process to be expedited,” the member said. An official aware of the details said while the government is working to expedite the release of terminal benefits, there is little it can offer by way of jobs on compassionate ground. “As per a Supreme Court order, jobs on compassionate grounds cannot exceed 5% of the total direct recruitment quota. Such jobs are limited to group C. The vacancies that have arisen are across levels and some are at senior positions... It may not be possible for fill these on compassionate grounds,” the official said. AIBEA’s Venkatachalam said the federation wants the banks to relax the rules for compassionate appointment and also ensure the vacancies are filled within a month. He also said while the banks had decided to give ₹20 lakh as compensation to those who died in service, it is not being uniformly implemented across private sector banks. He said that the guidelines for bank employees are not extended to those in contractual service, business correspondents, deposit collectors, and those who are engaged in gold appraising. “There is also a need to declare bank employees as frontline workers and expedite their vaccination,” he added.Last month, the finance ministry directed all the government departments to settle all claims on a priority basis for those employees who died on account of Covid while in service. The first official quoted above said that since 2016, there is a specific instruction to the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) that “all death case claims submitted by families or legal heirs of the EPF members have to be settled within seven days from the date of submission of the claims. In some cases, this is not followed, sometimes it is owing to inconsistencies in the claims.” The Union ministry of labour and employment also announced on May 31 that members of the Employees’ Provident fund Organisation can take a second non-refundable Covid-19 advance to meet any financial exigency during the pandemic. EPF subscribers can take a non-refundable advance of basic wages plus dearness allowance for three months or after 75% of the amount in their account, whichever is lesser.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-employees-forum-wants-ex-gratia-jobs-for-officials-succumbing-to-covid-101622783115298.html

04-06-2021||India||States lifted full PMGKAY quota in May, says Centre||The Food Corporation of India, the state-run grain-handling agency, has distributed 4.8 million tonnes of cereals under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) to ameliorate Covid-19 distress, official figures show. As many as 31 states and Union Territories have “lifted” or utilised 100% of their quota under the free-food programme for the month of May, according to the figures, while five, Arunachal Pradesh, Lakshadweep, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Puducherry, have withdrawn that for June as well. Under PMGKAY’s third tranche, announced on April 24, the Centre is providing 5 kg of free foodgrain per person, per month, to nearly 793.9 million beneficiaries for May and June 2021. These recipients are also covered under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) and therefore also receive subsidised food on a monthly basis. “The scheme has provided a big relief to the beneficiaries during ongoing Covid pandemic period,” a statement from the food ministry had said on May 25. Also Read | Centre asks states to give food cover to ‘most vulnerable’Some independent studies have showed that although federal food aid schemes, like the PMGKAY, have reached their targeted beneficiaries, distribution needs to be more widespread and strengthened to fully protect vulnerable people. As soon as stocks are lifted by states, their share is replenished regularly to maintain adequate foodgrains in all the states, an official said. Migrant workers covered under NFSA can withdraw their share of grains at any designated fair price shop in the country under the ‘One nation, one ration card’ programme. The programme is however operational in 32 states currently, the official said. According to the food ministry, a survey conducted by Dalberg firm showed a “very high level of satisfaction among the beneficiaries”. The ministry called it an “independent survey”, although it was commissioned by the finance ministry. Some food security experts however say food insecurity has been exacerbated by the pandemic. According to Amit Basole, associate professor of economics, Azim Premji University, who has conducted a study, overall 68% of households did receive at least some extra grains under the Centre’s Covid-19 food relief, which suggests not everyone eligible got the full benefits. In an article published in the journal EPW in February 2021, Basole writes that during the first lockdown in 2020, a “worrying 20% of households reported no improvement in food intake since the lockdown”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-lifted-full-pmgkay-quota-in-may-says-centre-101622780056174.html

04-06-2021||India||Row over ex-Bengal chief secy’s transfer, Centre’s notice: All you need to know||Former West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay on Thursday replied to the Centre’s notice issued to him for skipping Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s May 28 meeting on Cyclone Yaas. The notice has divided opinion on whether the Centre could have sent it. Some believe it did the right thing by seeking an explanation while others argue the Centre could not have issued the notice since Bandopadhyay was part of the state administration.What has happened so farThe Centre on May 24 granted Bandopadhyay, a 1987 batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, a three-month extension after the West Bengal government sought it saying his services were required to combat Covid. Days later, chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Bandopadhyay arrived at the venue of Modi’s meeting. But they left within minutes after giving a representation to the Prime Minister and without attending it and triggered a political row. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and Union ministers accused Banerjee of insulting Modi.The same evening the Centre asked Bandopadhyay to report for New Delhi by 10 am on May 31, his last working day, while directing the state government to release him immediately. Banerjee wrote a five-page letter to Modi urging him to withdraw the transfer order while refusing to release Bandopadhyay. She said she allowed Bandopadhyay to retire on his request and appointed him as her chief adviser for three months.Also Read | PM Modi phones Mukul Roy a day after TMC leader visits latter“I am shocked and stunned by the unilateral order…,” wrote Banerjee. She added it would be very unfortunate if there is a correlation between the Centre’s decision to recall the bureaucrat to Delhi and Modi’s meeting. Banerjee said she had reservations about the presence of Suvendu Adhikari, who defected from her Trinamool Congress (TMC) to BJP and defeated her in assembly polls, and governor Jagdeep Dhankhar at the meeting. “….an individual MLA [Adhikari], having no locus attending the meeting was unacceptable,” said Banerjee.She later hit out at Modi and Amit Shah saying she has never seen such a heartless Prime Minister and Union home minister. “I wrote the letter to the Prime Minister, but the reply came to him [Bandopadhyay] and not me. The Centre did not even mention why it needs him. You [Centre] have added insult to injury. I see only political vendetta. Why? Is it because you do not like Mamata Banerjee? Is it because you lost the elections?” asked Banerjee. She added she was made to wait at the meeting venue before she could meet Modi.The Centre on June 1 sent the show cause letter to Bandopadhyay, accusing him of violating Section 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act by skipping Modi’s meeting and failing to make a presentation on Cyclone Yaas and relief work. He was asked to reply within three days. Banerjee a day later said the state government will stand by Bandopadhyay and added “the chapter is over”.Bandopadhyay’s transfer and the Centre’s viewThe Centre has said the Department of personnel and training (DoPT) is the cadre controlling authority of IAS and has the right to transfer an official from the state to the Centre. Normally, it is done in consultation with the state governments and also depends on the willingness of an officer to join the Central government. The Centre has argued the state government was obliged to relieve Bandopadhyay. It has pointed out the Centre granted him a three-month extension as well.West Bengal government viewIt has argued an official can be transferred in consultations with the state government. In the case of Bandopadhyay, the state government was not consulted before his transfer order. Also Read | Bengal BJP divided over Centre’s notice to ex-CS, politicians’ arrestThe state government has called the transfer hours after Banerjee skipped the meeting with Modi as a vindictive action. It has argued the extension in service was granted for Covid work and hence Bandopadhyay could not have been transferred to the Centre.Show cause notice and Centre’s viewIt has argued Bandopadhyay as the chief secretary, an all-India services officer, could not have ignored his Constitutional duties. The Centre has said no presentation was given to Modi and Bandopadhyay left the meeting without giving any reason for it. It has said seeking his explanation was within the civil service rules. The Centre has argued as the cyclone is a disaster, it can invoke its powers under the Disaster Management Act and issue directions to state government officials. It said skipping the meeting to review disaster relief amounted to a violation of the law and therefore the notice was issued under its Section 51 (b). The Section provides for jail of up to one year for failing to comply with orders issued under the law.West Bengal government viewIt has said the show cause was issued after Bandopadhyay’s retirement and therefore it has no legal value. The state government has argued the notice to attend the meeting was not issued under the Disaster Management Act and therefore, the notice under it cannot be issued. It said the show cause was an afterthought after Banerjee named Bandopadhyay as her chief adviser. The state government has said his transfer order had become null and void and the notice was issued to harass him.“This is a vindictive action by the BJP which cannot get over its humiliating loss in the recent polls. This will go down in the history of dirty politics. A bureaucrat is being recalled before his retirement when he is touring cyclone-hit areas. This proves how anti-Bengal and anti-Bengali BJP’s central leaders are,” said Trinamool Congress spokesman Kunal Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-ex-bengal-chief-secy-s-transfer-centre-s-notice-all-you-need-to-know-101622779575224.html

Choksi, wanted in the multi-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case, remains at Dominica-China Friendship Hospital under police guard.The Indian team, which went there along with the documents, has also returned, the people cited above saidalso added that the flight’s destination is not known.Indian-born Choksi disappeared from Antigua and Barbuda, whose citizenship he holds, on May 23 but was detained by Dominican police three days later on charges of illegally entering the island, nearly 100 nautical miles away.Also read | Illegal entry charge to citizenship question: Decoding the casesPrime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda Gaston Browne said last week that the Bombardier Global 5000 business jet of Qatar Executive landed at Dominica’s Douglas Charles airport May 29. Browne also told a radio show in his country that Choksi may have left Antigua and taken a boat ride to neighbouring Dominica to have dinner or a “good time” with his girlfriend.On Thursday, a court in Dominica denied bail to the 62-year-old businessman and remanded him to police custody for roughly two weeks on charges of illegally entering the island nation. And, the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court adjourned hearing in a habeas corpus petition filed by Choksi’s lawyers and the government of Antigua, where the 62-year-old spent three years as a citizen before he went missing on May 23, reiterated that it favoured deporting the businessman to India.Also watch | Dominican court denies bail to Mehul Choksi in illegal entry caseIndia said it was making all efforts to bring back Mehul Choksi. “He (Choksi) is currently in the custody of Dominica with some legal proceedings underway.

Virtually, no element of Indian society has been left untouched by this horrible scourge. That is why we have spoken of the focus on increased manufacturing in India," State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters."The increased manufacturing capacity in India, the volume of capacity has the potential to be a game changer well beyond India's borders. And that's precisely why this arrangement was reached and announced in the context of the Quad," he said.Early this year at the first virtual Quad summit, composed of leaders from Australia, India, Japan and the United States, it was decided to work together to increase the Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing capacity of India.So far, the United States has contributed USD500 million in Covid-19 assistance to India. This includes USD100 million from the government alone. The entire US government, including Secretary of State Tony Blinken, has led an effort to galvanise the private sector to chip in, he said.“We have been really gratified to see that, together between the US government contributions as well as private sector contributions, we have seen some USD0.5 billion in support go to India in its time of need,” he said.The Biden Administration on Thursday announced that it will send 25 million of its vaccines to other countries, including India.“There remain some 55 million doses that the administration has committed to send abroad by the end of this month,” Price said, adding that the announcement in this regard could come in the coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/increase-in-covid-19-vaccine-production-in-india-to-be-game-changer-beyond-borders-us-101622767157662.html
04-06-2021||India||SC gives CBSE 2 weeks for evaluation formula||The Supreme Court on Thursday set a two-week deadline for the Centre to come up with a “well-defined objective criteria” for the assessment of Class 12 students of the Central Bureau of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) following the cancellation of their examinations due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Attorney general KK Venugopal, who appeared for the Centre, shared an official communication intimating the court about the cancellation.A bench of justices AM Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari said they were happy over the “in principle” decision to cancel the examinations, but asked the government why no decision was taken on the criteria of assessment. “...what will be the objective criteria to assess students? It has not been spelt out in your letter,” the bench said.Venugopal said that the decision was pending as the government needed to determine whether to include the performance from Class 10 onwards, or restrict the assessment to Class 12 alone. “There is another issue of which subjects to assess. All this may take at least three weeks.”Senior advocate JK Das, appearing for CISCE, sought four weeks to come out with a scheme. “This time, unlike last year, we have asked for data from all principals with regard to all subjects,” Das said. Venugopal, however, agreed to a two-week deadline after the court said that in the age of videoconferencing, a decision could even be taken overnight.The court told Das that students were concerned about college admissions not just in India but abroad as well. “Impress upon your clients that this is a matter of urgent basis,” it said.The Centre on Tuesday cancelled the CBSE Class 12 examinations and ended uncertainty for roughly 1.4 million students who were to appear in them.The decision was taken at a meeting chared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi amid appeals by students and parents, who feared the exams could be a superspreader event particularly because those under the age of 18 are not eligible for vaccination yet. Hours later, CISCE also scrapped its Class 12 exams or ISE exams. The CBSE and ICSE Class 10 board exams were cancelled in April.The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned the matter to June 17, and said that it was mindful of the interest of students in schools affiliated to state boards, and will address their concerns after the objective assessment for CBSE and CISCE was settled.The court’s deadline came on a petition filed by advocate Mamata Sharma, who sought an objective assessment scheme within a specified time frame.The petitioner referred to state boards, pointed out that most of them were yet to cancel the Class 12 examination, and sought uniform directions for students across the country. The court asked Sharma to be patient and said her petition sought directions for Class 12 students of CBSE and CISCE only but was now “asking for heaven”.“Interests of the student community will be taken care of... First let us settle for CBSE, CISCE and then we will go into other issues,” it said.Last year, the top court faced a similar predicament when a demand was made to scrap Class 12 Board examinations. The petition by Amit Bathla and others came up at a stage when some subject examinations were yet to be held. After the court’s intervention, CBSE scrapped Class 10 exams. It devised an assessment scheme for Class 12 based on papers already given and their overall performance in the year.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in New Delhi’s Rohini, said, “A well defined objective criterion as stated in the decision of cancellation of examinations requires a lot of deliberation and discussion. It requires time to come up with a criteria to ensure objectivity and satisfaction.”AK Jha, principal of a Delhi government co-ed school, said sufficient time is required to make an “error free” criterion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-gives-cbse-2-weeks-for-evaluation-formula-101622758255531.html
04-06-2021||India||Govt books 300 million doses of new Indian jab||India made its first advance commitments for a coronavirus vaccine under development, announcing a ₹1,500 crore deal with Hyderabad’s Biological E to stockpile 300 million doses of its candidate that has shown promising signs but is currently in the last stage of clinical trials.The commitment, announced by the Union health ministry on Thursday, represents the first time the government has placed an advance purchase order, which typically helps secure large volumes of doses, and has been a strategy used by countries that managed to procure doses early. “The arrangement with Biological-E is part of the wider endeavour of Government of India to encourage indigenous vaccine manufacturers by providing them support in research & development and also financial support,” the ministry said in a statement.The move comes a day after the Supreme Court pulled up the government for its vaccination policy and gave it two weeks to submit all files and notings that “reflect its thinking and the culmination” of its vaccination policy, which judges said appeared to be “arbitrary and irrational”.The criticism around the Covid-19 vaccination drive stems from an acute shortage of doses in the country, where under 19% of the 940 million eligible people have received at least one dose.The order that the government disclosed on Thursday will help India get guaranteed access to large doses of the vaccines made by Biological E once the dose is approved. The amount committed will go towards development as well as stockpiling of the doses in advance, which will help push large quantities as soon as clearances are secured. The vaccine is likely to be marketed as Corbevax, according to names previously disclosed by the company.The 300 million doses appeared to be the cumulative capacity that Biological E told the Centre it will be able to produce for the rest of 2021. Niti Aayog’s VK Paul on May 13 said the company’s 300 million doses was among the 2.16 billion doses of various vaccines that the government was expecting to be available between August and December. It was not immediately clear when the 300 million doses will begin to become available since Phase III trials were only approved in late April, and the developers – Biological E and its partner, Texas-based Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) – are yet to release data from the Phase 1/2 studies.Dr Peter Hotez, the dean of BCM’s National School of Tropical Medicine and one of the scientists involved in the development, said in an interview to an Indian TV channel last month that clinical trials have shown there will be cross-protection against a number of variants of concern. The vaccine is made using a tried-and-tested platform that is also used in the development of the Hepatitis B vaccine, which Biological E has past experience of making.In an interview to HT in January, BCM’s Maria Elena Bottazzi said that the vaccine could particularly help inoculate children. “A hepatitis vaccine platform will also help be reassuring for paediatrics use since mRNA and viral vectors have never been used in children,” she said.Bottazzi said Biological E has worked on the technology for long and the Texas-based institute transferred the technology in summer of 2020. “They were very quick not only in scaling up and reproducing (necessary biologicals) -- we now know they can make 1.2 billion doses of the protein -- but they are also very quick at doing the formulation science,” she said.Experts welcomed Thursday’s announcement.“I am just glad that the government is taking some risk now, to do advance purchase of products that might be useful. They should have done this a year ago. Knowing you have a commitment to buy and an advanced paid from the government will encourage vaccine manufacturers to ramp up production even as they do clinical trials,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of country’s top vaccinologist and physician-scientist, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.“They should also look at supporting Gennova for their mRNA product,” she added.A senior public health expert, who asked not to be named, however, asked Biological E to release clinical trial data. “Permission to progress to the next phase cannot be given unless you have submitted trial results of the previous phase; therefore I don’t see why the vaccine makers should hold on to the data. If results are promising put them out for other experts to scrutinise who were not a part of the trial,” said this person“How are they so sure that phase III results will be favourable; those who understand science know that earlier phases of clinical trials are about promise and the third phase is actually what determines the real performance,” the expert added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-books-300-million-doses-of-new-indian-jab-101622757968694.html

We have also helped to expedite the introduction of Sputnik-V vaccines.”He added, “We are also looking forward to WHO’s approval for India’s indigenous vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech.”India’s vaccination programme has been hit by a shortage of jabs and the government has ramped up efforts to both buy doses from abroad and ramp up domestic production.Later in the day, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said: “We are also engaged with the US administration to ensure that necessary components and raw materials for vaccine production in India are readily available... It is in our mutual interest to combat the global pandemic by expediting vaccination efforts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-on-with-us-firms-to-source-jabs-shringla-101622753511683.html

It added it was “keeping an eye on the activities of these forces”.“He [Pandita] had gone to Jammu and left PSOs [Personal Security Officers] in Kashmir. After returning from Jammu, he went to Tral without his PSOs to meet his friend... The investigations are going on,” said a police officer, requesting anonymity.Police said PAFF appears to be a front of terrorist organisations active in south Kashmir and added security forces have cordoned off the attack scene and launched a search operation to nab the assailants.“Pakistani terrorists have once again bled the Kashmir Valley. Pandita’s martyrdom will not go in vain,” Jammu and Kashmir BJP chief Ravinder Raina said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-cremated-terror-group-says-it-s-behind-attack-101622751728298.html
04-06-2021||India||Biological-E: Hyderabad company to give another shot in the arm||Bengaluru: The Centre on Thursday announced that it has inked a deal with Hyderabad-based Biological E for 30 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, which is in clinical trials, and will make an advance payment of ₹1,500 crore to procure the same.A statement from the health ministry said that these vaccine doses will be manufactured and stockpiled by Biological-E from August to December this year. The statement also said that the Covid-19 vaccine of Biological-E is currently undergoing phase-3 clinical trials after showing promising results in phase 1 and 2 trials. The vaccine being developed by Biological-E is a RBD protein sub-unit vaccine and is likely to be available in the next few months, it added.The Centre’s announcement comes at a time when India continues to remain in the grip of the second wave of Covid-19. With the present production not being able to meet the rising vaccine demand, the Union government has approached other companies like Biological E to scale up manufacturing and help ease the supply constraints.“The proposal of Biological-E was examined and recommended for approval after due diligence by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC),” the health ministry statement said. Biological E could not be reached for a comment on the latest development on Thursday.In a statement on June 1, it said that it has partnered with Canada-based Providence Therapeutics Holdings Inc which will provide necessary technology transfer to manufacture mRNA vaccines in India, with a minimum production capacity of 600 million doses in 2022 and a target capacity of 1 billion doses.A December 2020 article by Forbes on Biological E titled ‘The Dark Horse in India’s Vaccine Race’ had described how the company has emerged as one of the biggest facilities to produce the life-saving vaccine. The company is already working with four Covid-19 vaccine candidates, including Johnson & Johnson, according to the report. Founded by Dr D V K Raju in 1953, Biological E commenced operations as a biological products company, manufacturing liver extracts and anticoagulants.The company gradually began producing Heparin, a drug to prevent blood clots, and barely a decade later in 1963, the company became the first private sector player in India to enter the vaccine business.Biological E has made quick and significant strides since then, producing anti-tetanus serum and developing vaccines for Japanese Encephalitis among others. In 2019, the company commenced its commercial operations in the USA.The firm envisions to become the “largest Indian vaccines company and be among the top few Indian companies in complex generics and specialty pharmaceuticals” by 2025, according to the organisation.The company at present is led by its managing director and chief executive officer, Mahima Datla. At present, only Pune-based Serum Institute of India and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech are producing the Covishield and Covaxin vaccines, respectively, in India. As the second most populous country in the world, India would require inoculating 1.3 billion people in its fight against Covid-19.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biologicale-hyderabad-company-to-give-another-shot-in-the-arm-101622749992437.html
04-06-2021||India||BJP chief in Kerala accused of giving bribe to candidate to remain in NDA||Thiruvananthpuram: After a humiliating defeat in the assembly elections in which it lost its lone seat, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Kerala has found itself embroiled in a controversy for its alleged links with a purported highway heist of more than ₹3 crore in Thrissur district in April. On Wednesday, a purported audio tape of party state president K Surendran surfaced, in which he is heard reportedly talking to tribal leader and candidate from Wayanad constituency C K Janu, promising her ₹10 lakh. HT could not independently verify the authenticity of the audio clip. While one of the office-bearers of Jana’s erstwhile party (Janadhipathya Rashtriya Sabha) has claimed that she had sought ₹10 crore from the saffron party to remain in the National Democratic Alliance and that the ₹10 lakh was an advance amount, both Janu and Surendran said the money was part of the poll campaign expenses. “We are ready for any probe. The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) is playing dirty politics to link the BJP with a money-snatching incident. Like CPI(M) leaders, we won’t get admitted to hospitals to avert questioning,” Surendran told reporters in Kozhikode on Thursday, adding that he was ready to appear before agencies for a probe. Police have already questioned several district BJP leaders and expected to summon party state office-bearers in connection with the alleged heist which took place on April 3 in Kodakara on the Thrissur-Ernakulam highway. A man named S Shamseer alleged that he was transporting ₹25 lakh cash when he was reportedly waylaid by a group of people and looted after being assaulted. Four days after the incident (April 7), he filed a police complaint in which he alleged that the money was meant for a property transaction.Shamseer later named a local Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader, Dharmajan, who claimed that the money was collected from several people and was meant for election activities.While the police noted several inconsistencies in Shamseer’s version of events, after making 20 arrests, it found that the recoveries were more than ₹25 lakh.As per latest information, the amount involved was supposedly ₹3.5 crore and police have recovered ₹1.25 crore so far.During the probe, Dharmajan reportedly told police that the money was meant to be handed over to BJP Alappuzha treasurer K G Kartha and that party state organising secretary M Ganeshan was aware of the transportation. However, the case took a turn when one of the main accused P Deepak was found at the BJP district office in Thrissur after the incident, police said. BJP leaders, however, claimed that Deepak visited the office as part of an internal probe being carried out by the party. The entire incident led the police to suspect the role of some party insiders who were aware of the transportation of cash in the heist. When contacted, investigating officer deputy superintendent of police V K Raju refused to comment on the case, saying an investigation was underway. CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan alleged that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is hesitant to probe the case since it involved the BJP. The central agency is already probing the Kerala gold smuggling case which was a huge point of contention between the state and Union governments in the run up to the elections. “We have seen the ED taking up even minor cases in the state. But the central agency is keeping silent now. It exposes the central agency’s partisan attitude,” he said. Meanwhile, an existing internal feud in the party over the elevation of Surendran as the Kerala unit president in February intensified after party OBC Morcha leader Rishi Palppu questioned the leaders over the source of money and heist. He was later expelled from the party.Reports suggest that the party central leadership is also upset with the recent developments in the state unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-chief-in-kerala-accused-of-giving-bribe-to-candidate-to-remain-in-nda-101622749692435.html
04-06-2021||India||Waiting for oxygen became like waiting for God: TN health minister||Tamil Nadu health minister M Subramanian sounded confident that the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic will be under control in another ten days. In an interview with HT, he recalled several touch-and-go situations when hospitals made SOS calls for oxygen, but the state overcame such challenges by scaling up infrastructure soon after forming the new government. Subramanian, the former mayor of Chennai, is one of chief minister MK Stalin’s most trusted aides. They have been together since 1976 when Subramanian joined the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) youth wing. At 62, he is known for his fitness. He clocked a 10-km run in little over an hour on the morning of June 2. Edited excerpts Covid-19 cases have started to decline in Tamil Nadu, but we faced multiple crises. What were the major challenges? We formed the government on May 7 when there were around 20,000 cases daily and it rapidly increased and went up to 36,000. At that stage there was a huge shortage of beds, oxygen-supported beds and ICUs. Patients were waiting for a long time in hospitals for admission… Almost all patients are requiring oxygen support in the second wave, which spread rapidly and caused more lung damages to patients. Shortage of hospital beds with oxygen was a major challenge. How did you overcome the crisis of oxygen shortage? Almost every night, the chief minister’s office received a call from hospitals and residents alike. Complaints received on social media were diverted to us. A hospital made an SOS to the CM that if they don’t receive oxygen within two hours, 20 lives were at risk. We immediately diverted oxygen and avoided any of these incidents from turning into a major disaster, like the one in Andhra Pradesh, where 21 people died. We only had 230 MT of oxygen per day until May 7 in government and private hospitals together. But today, we have 660 MT per day while our requirement is 540 MT. We have created a situation where we have more supply than demand. The chief minister was constantly in touch with concerned ministers in the Union government and even spoken to the Prime Minister to increase oxygen allocation for Tamil Nadu. One night, we were waiting at 2 am to receive oxygen from Rourkela. Waiting for oxygen and Remedisivir became like waiting for God for us. Now, there is no more oxygen shortage anywhere. As on June 1, the state has 8,072 oxygen beds, 618 ICUs and 16,644 non-oxygen beds available. Ten days ago, patients were scrambling to find even a single bed and that has now changed to more than 25,000 beds being vacant. In the three-week period, we were able to develop the infrastructure. The CM appealed to the public to turn this into a people’s movement. We have received ₹200 crore in donations to the Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund to fight Covid-19. Besides, industries, corporates and clubs have donated oxygen concentrators worth crores. In Covid Care Centres, we also offered Siddha, Yunani, Homeopathy and Yoga in 61 centres. Each of them had a 100-bed capacity. Cases are now declining fast in all districts with more patients recovering and getting discharged. The difference between the number of new positive cases and discharges are also increasing. This has given us a huge confidence. But the death toll in state is still on the higher side with over 400 fatalities every day. People weren’t vigilant and delayed testing and treatment even if they had symptoms like a fever. Only when they have respiratory distress do they show up. But by then, they develop severe lung infection, which is why deaths are high. The deaths aren’t due to any shortage. Treatment protocol is fine. We have been raising awareness for people to approach hospital during the onset of symptoms. As cases reduced in Chennai, it began rising in the western region. What are the specific problems there? Cases are being contained there too. I’ve visited these regions thrice in the past 20 days and the CM went twice and conducted review meetings with district collectors. IAS officers as nodal officers as well as ministers have been appointed in these districts. Forest minister and food minister have been made in-charge in Coimbatore. We are also scrutinising if there is any nexus between private labs and private hospitals. According to complaints, in Tiruppur, a private lab, Medall, had entered 4,000 negative cases as positive. (The department of public health temporarily cancelled Medall’s RT-PCR testing, but the lab explained that it was an encryption error.) In Coimbatore, I made a surprise inspection at a lab. The Erode district collector inspects private labs everyday by randomly selecting 10 positive samples and sending it to a government lab for re-checking. As compared to the first wave, there have been more problems in terms of shortage of oxygenated beds, ICUs, remdesivir and other drugs. What do you think went wrong during the second wave? The difference from the first wave is that the virus is more virulent in the second wave. So, the number of cases is high, the virus spreads rapidly, and it has led to more critical patients now. There are more cases of patients with serious lung involvement and respiratory distress. It took a year to contain the first wave. But we have crossed half the well in a month. As far as I know, in another ten days, we will come out of it. The infrastructure we have increased now was not required in the first wave. Experts say TN should have ramped up testing to 300,000 daily, as against only 170,000 when cases had peaked. Why was it low? TN’s 170,000 is the highest number of RT-PCR tests conducted in India. There will always be an opinion to do more, that’s natural. We have been able to bring cases under control because we were testing in high numbers. You had announced suspending vaccine drive on June 1 and that evening the Union government sent more doses. How are you going to address vaccine shortage? Our only issue is vaccine shortage. Earlier there was vaccine hesitancy and now we are waiting for vaccines. From January 16 until May 7, during the AIADMK government for 103 days, they vaccinated 61,000 people daily on an average. In the last 20 days, we have crossed an average of 100,000 people every day. People’s awareness has increased especially for those in the 18-44 age group. People have come to an understanding that vaccination is the only solution. We have paid ₹85.48 crore for vaccines for those in the 18-44 age category. We have received 1.3 million vaccines and we are yet to receive another 1.3 million. We were worried earlier that we have to suspend vaccination on June 2, 3 and 4 because we hadn’t received the full supply that the Centre allocated for May. The health secretary and I both told the media about it after which we received 494,000 vaccine doses on June 1 evening. We distributed it to all the districts on the same night. So, vaccination has continued. This will last another few days and before it gets over, the Centre will re-stock. So, we are confident we will continue inoculation. The Centre has also allocated 4.2 million vaccines for us in June. Is the Centre to be blamed for the vaccine shortage in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere? This isn’t a time to complain and blame. We have been requesting for more. We are not just solely depending on the Union government. We have released a global tender for 35 million vaccines. On June 5, we will know the tender participants. We have also asked about the integrated vaccine complex in Chengalpattu. If we get a reply from the Centre to hand over the plant to us on lease, it will offer protection for Tamil Nadu on a huge scale. What about a request on behalf of the state to Jesse Jackson (Sr) of Rainbow PUSH Coalition to request US President Joe Biden to release at least 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines for India including Tamil Nadu? We haven’t finalised it for now. We are trying all avenues and we will take a call after we review global tenders on June 5. How is our situation in terms of mucormycosis? So far, the state has reported 518 cases of mucormycosis, of which 17 patients have died and 20 have been discharged. We have formed a committee of 13 with the best doctors including Mohan Rajan (Rajan Eye Care Hospital), ENT professor Mohan Kameswaran (director of Madras ENT Research Foundation) and doctors from government and private hospitals. They will research this infection’s cause, effects and treatment. Mostly they will submit their report this week and it will be submitted to the CM. We have opened a separate ward for mucormycosis treatment in Omandurar hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. We have instructed all Tamil Nadu medical college hospitals to open similar wards. Doctors say that if we detect it in the early stages, we can save lives. We are also starting to build awareness among the public, so they do not miss the early symptoms. Has the new government put in place a mechanism to ensure that Covid deaths aren’t missed and under-reported? I’ve visited 16 districts so far and inspected rural and urban areas. At the end of it, our advice to the district collectors and all stakeholders is to not hide deaths and positive cases. Only if we know the true numbers will the public also have a combined feeling of fear and awareness. During the previous AIADMK regime (in 2012), it was evident that 21 people had died due to Cholera in north Chennai. I had released a statement. The Greater Chennai Corporation responded to it during a council meeting and lied that they died due to cardiac arrest. We don’t have such intentions in our government. We don’t have to hide anything. What is your vision for the health sector of Tamil Nadu? When I finish my responsibility and leave my position, I want to have created a situation where people of Tamil Nadu look towards government hospitals if they are sick. They should have an intention that they will be taken care of well in a government hospital and it isn’t necessary to go to a private hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/waiting-for-oxygen-became-like-waiting-for-god-tn-health-minister-101622748492336.html
04-06-2021||India||Cong grapples with Punjab infighting||An incumbent Congress chief minister who just a few months back looked set to return to power, the characteristic in-fighting that has come to be the norm in many state units of the party, and a high command that appears to be encouraging the dissidents to speak up.All are part of a high-stakes drama being played out in Punjab and Delhi, with there being no certainty that a meeting between state chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and a three-member committee (Mallikarjun Kharge, Harish Rawat and JP Aggarwal) set up by the party high command to resolve the issue, will result in anything substantive.At the core of the issue, according to one camp, is the chief minister’s style of functioning; according to the other, it is the ambition of some of the Captain’s rivals, including Navjot Singh Sidhu.But the issue has become larger than that now -- something that should worry the party ahead of next year’s state elections that it looked set to win under the Captain, largely on account of the farm protest that broke the partnership of the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Bharatiya Janata Party, leaving the former on a weak wicket and ensuring the temporary oblivion of the latter in the state.Captain Amarinder Singh’s team says there’s no problem at all. “It’s just a checklist before the polls,’’ said finance minister Manpreet Badal , on the meetings the committee has been having. “There is no rebellion at all.’’Yet, HT learns that the 79-year old chief minister is particularly miffed that the party’s high command has asked an intermediary to encourage legislators to speak out against him.“Harish Chaudhary, a Rajasthan minister and former AICC secretary in charge of Punjab elections, has been calling up MLAs for the past 10 days,’’ said a person close to the CM who asked not to be named. “Chaudhary was speaking to dissidents and encouraging them to speak out and he was supposedly acting on behalf of the party leadership. The CM has spoken to Rahulji (Rahul Gandhi) about this.’’Congress spokespersons did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment, but the fact that calls were being made was confirmed by one of Gandhi’s aides who insisted it is part of a feedback gathering mechanism. Chaudhary denied calling MLAs for this purpose. “I was in the state for seven years, so of course, I have a relationship with many people. We were checking on each other, to help each other during Covid. I have nothing to do with the upcoming elections.”HT also learns that Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar politely told the committee that the problem is above their pay grade. Pointing out that the CM is senior to them all, he said the problem could only be solved by the Gandhis.Jakhar’s position is key because it’s his job that Sidhu wants. The former cricketer quit Amarinder Singh’s cabinet in July, 2019 when his portfolio was changed. While the CM has told Delhi that Sidhu is welcome to have his job back, Sidhu wants to be PCC chief. Sidhu is believed to be close to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was instrumental in getting him to join the party in 2017.But the larger issue is how the party has handled the whole affair, said a key Punjab Congress leader who asked not to be named. “It’s not about Sidhu being a threat to the CM or even Partap Singh Bajwa (another dissenter) being a threat. It’s just that this should have all been sorted out a year ago; the high command has just let it linger. ’’The CM, who reached Delhi on Thursday afternoon, will meet the three-member committee at 11am on Friday. On reaching the Capital, he went into a huddle with aides and advisers at Kapurthala House. The committee, meanwhile, completed its discussions with other party leaders, even many of the 37 party candidates who lost in the 2017 state polls. Agarwal said the committee would give its report in the next two to three days. “The meetings went off smoothly. There was no serious groupism. There are a few leaders who have some disagreements but nothing that cannot be sorted out. That’s why the committee has been formed,” he said.Interestingly, before Singh left for Delhi , he inducted three rebel AAP MLAs, including former leader of Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira and two first-timers Jagdev Singh Kamalu and Pirmal Singh Khalsa, into the Congress, a move that will only strengthen his hand.The chief minister said their induction has been approved by Congress president Sonia Gandhi. “Since AICC general secretary (in-charge of Punjab) Shri Harish Rawat and PPCC president Shri Sunil Jakhar were busy in the consultation process with the three-member committee in Delhi, their blessings would be sought in a few days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-grapples-with-punjab-infighting-101622748372811.html
04-06-2021||India||Tussle over Puducherry cabinet structure ends after talks between Rangasamy, Shah||Chennai: Puducherry chief minister N Rangasamy’s Covid-19 infection and ally BJP’s demands have delayed the formation of the union territory’s cabinet, said leaders privy to the ground situation. They however said an arrangement was reached after Rangasamy and union home minister Amit Shah spoke over the phone on Tuesday. This led to the Puducherry unit of the BJP to make one confirmation on Wednesday -- that the speaker post will be taken by the party. The high command would decide on the number of ministers, the candidates and portfolios, said BJP’s Puducherry chief V Saminathan. But for the three nominated MLAs in 2016-2021 assembly and an elected MLA in 2001, the BJP had had no presence in the erstwhile French colony and it will now have a strong cabinet representation. The NDA alliance led by Rangasamy’s All India NR Congress (AINRC) in Puducherry won the assembly elections that were declared on May 2. Rangasamy took oath on May 7 and the next day he tested positive for the virus. From May 9 to 17, Rangasamy was under treatment at a private hospital in Chennai. He continued to quarantine and on May 26, pro-term speaker of the legislative assembly K Lakshminarayanan of AINRC administered the oath of office to the newly elected MLAs.The BJP is likely to get two cabinet ministers, said an AINRC leader, not wishing to be named. “BJP had demanded three ministers. Our stand was that they either get three ministers and no speaker post or two ministers plus a speaker. That negotiation took about for four days and finally we reached agreement on second option,” he said.The BJP had also asked for a deputy chief minister’s post which is till now not a position in Puducherry. “That is also in process,” said Saminathan. “Our high command will make a decision and before June 14 the cabinet will be formed.” The national party’s high command is also expected to meet Rangasamy in person in the coming days.But AINRC and BJP members said that the month’s gap in expanding the cabinet was largely due to Rangasamy’s health and the matter has been solved. When he was hospitalised, the union government nominated three BJP members as MLAs to the Puducherry assembly. The elected strength is 30 seats plus three nominated seats. “The cabinet will have the chief minister, five ministers and a speaker,” said AINRC secretary NSJ Jayabal. “The speaker has to be elected but since we have given that to the BJP, we will not nominate anyone and we will present the new cabinet for the L-G’s approval.” On Wednesday, the Madras high court upheld the nominations of the three BJP MLAs, dismissing a plea filed against it. In the previous regime also, the three nominated seats were from the BJP who, thanks to a Supreme Court order, have voting rights on the floor of the House. They were instrumental in the fall of the previous Congress government that couldn’t prove majority owing to a spate of resignations since January and came under Governor’s rule. Despite drawing a blank in the previous 2016 elections, the BJP poached some Congress heavyweights, gave them seats and won six out of nine constituencies they contested this time. AINRC won 10 seats. Their ally AIADMK drew a blank. The Congress just has two MLAs while its ally, the DMK, has six. A record number of six independent MLAs were elected this time. The BJP also now has the support of three independent MLAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tussle-over-puducherry-cabinet-structure-ends-after-talks-between-rangasamy-shah-101622748372270.html
04-06-2021||India||SC allows name change in CBSE school certificates||The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to allow changes in name or date of birth in school certificates issued by it even after the publication of results.The court took the decision while hearing a batch of petitions challenging the CBSE’s Examination Byelaws of 2007 that did not look into any request for correction or change in name or date of birth of the candidate or name of parent(s).The byelaws underwent amendments in subsequent years after which such changes were permitted only “before publication of result” and provided there was a court order or gazette notification.A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court found this condition as “arbitrary” and “unreasonable” and carved out two categories of requests – first requiring correction or change in name or parent(s) name or date of birth based on public documents and second, where change of name, parent(s) name or date of birth is not backed by any document and is purely based on choice of a person to be known by a different name.The bench in its 132-page judgment observed, “An individual must be in complete control of his/her name and law must enable (him/her) to retain as well as to exercise such control freely for all times. Such control would inevitably include the aspiration of an individual to be recognized by a different name for a just cause.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-allows-name-change-in-cbse-school-certificates-101622748313494.html
04-06-2021||India||‘We’re better prepared for next wave’: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has been in the news. First over his handling of the Covid situation in India’s most populous state; then, over the results of the panchayat polls; and finally, on account of a two-day meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s central leadership in Lucknow that sparked off speculation about changes in the government and the party organisation ahead of next year’s assembly elections. In an interview with Sunita Aron, Adityanath, who travelled to all 18 administrative divisions of the state between April 30 and May 27, spoke about the devastating second wave of Covid-19, his state’s preparedness for the third wave, and the challenge of 2022. Edited excerpts:We believe the recent meetings of the party in Lucknow were to assess the political situation and discuss changes in the organisation and government? Do you think there should be a reshuffle months before the elections?Every individual performs according to his or her capacity. One should have expectations accordingly. The ministers were touring their constituencies and it is only because of the joint efforts of my cabinet colleagues, party workers, officials and the medical staff that we could face the challenge of the first and the second waves. Look at the state’s recovery and positivity rate today. Our positivity rate has come down to 0.4% when compared with 22% in April while the recovery rate stands at 97.1%. Uttar Pradesh has also become the first state to cross the five-crore (50 million) testing mark.Do think you need a cabinet reshuffle months before the elections?The government and the organisation will together take a call and do what is needed. The media cannot decide that.Then what was discussed ? We believe another meeting is scheduled in Delhi on June 5?We regularly hold meetings and discussions. It’s a normal practice in our party. We meet every six months but because of the pandemic, there was some delay. Similarly, there is nothing new in PM meeting CMs. Definitely when we meet we discuss both achievements and shortcomings and take appropriate decisions.So, it was a preparatory meeting to discuss the forthcoming elections?BJP will form a majority government in 2022. Remember my words, we will meet again after that. As for the poll strategy, it is not discussed or decided by media. It’s an internal exercise. The poll issues will be spelt out in the manifesto. But certainly, government’s performance — security, good governance and development — will be issues people will judge and vote for.Why did the BJP perform so badly in the panchayat polls? Are you worried?Panchayat polls are not fought on party symbols. Mark my words. SP won in 90% of panchayat seats in 2016 but lost in 90% of seats in the 2017 assembly elections. They will again lose 2022 badly. Otherwise also, the panchayat elections are only half done.The forthcoming election will be fought under your leadership and will be a referendum on your government’s performance while the 2017 polls was primarily fought on the charisma of the Prime Minister.The state has acquired a new image in these five years — a progressive state in the country. No riots, improved law and order, no discrimination in distribution of central and state government welfare schemes, the ease of doing business, the investment summits. Yes, the pandemic may have slowed down the pace, but could not stop the overall growth. Work on Ram temple construction too got delayed but it will soon pick up speed. And now we are again gearing up on our various development projects while simultaneously preparing for the third wave.Are you confident because the Opposition is fragmented?We will win elections on our strength and mission.The Opposition has been very critical of your management of Covid.I believe it is easier to be a critic from the comfort of your home through statements on social media. I would like to invite them to visit the rural areas and see for themselves how the state government has managed the second wave and the figures clearly reflect the same.During your extensive tour of the state, what were the major shortcomings that you thought needed immediate attention?I wanted to assess the on-ground situation. I have travelled more than 6,000 km by helicopter and by road across 45 districts, including the ones which were most affected, to assess the ground situation and motivate the local health staff and district administration. I spoke to citizens, Covid-19 patients, doctors and administrators to review the situation and give directions to the staff. Also, being a team leader, I think me being on-ground motivates and inspires others.There is a possibility of third wave coinciding with the election dates? The decision to hold West Bengal elections has been criticised world over. You think it would be judicious to defer elections in case third wave proves as devastating as the second wave?Elections should be held on time though it is for the Election Commission to decide. We are poll ready. The second wave has been contained in a month’s time and we are better prepared for the third wave .UP has been accused of fudging or concealing real Covid dataAbout 2,000 delegates of World Health Organisation visited the state. WHO has also appreciated the UP model of triple Ts — test, trace and treat. Should people believe data or of those who, because of some wrong perceptions in their mind, doubt the fact that the state has actually contained the second wave efficiently.They can’t believe that the state with over 240 million population saw 64 deaths per million while United States with 328 million population saw 1,796 deaths per million.Wasn’t it upsetting to see bodies floating in the river?Yes, it’s very painful, but this is not the first time bodies were seen floating in the river. Similar scenes were witnessed in 2012, 2014, 2016. Besides starting an awareness programme, my government had only last year alerted local bodies. Jal Pravah (water burial) is a tradition and now the saints have also joined the campaign to stop this practice.The only way to fight Covid-19 is by vaccination and there is a shortage of vaccines. Do you think the Centre should come up with a better distribution formula?The Centre has evolved a formula and all states should follow that. We are quite happy with the current formula of vaccines being supplied by the Centre.By July adequate vaccines would be available in the country. We have already vaccinated 1.90 crore (19 million) people till date and have an ambitious vaccination plan for July. We are committed to free vaccination for all in the shortest time possible.Global tenders for vaccines have not worked.Uttar Pradesh was the first state to float a global tender to procure 40 million doses of vaccines. In the pre-bid meeting of the global tender, representatives of six companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, also participated. We have revised the tender and now the manufacturers of vaccines requiring storage or transportation at temperatures like -20 degrees Celsius, -70 degrees Celsius or -80 degrees Celsius can also participate. We are in touch with all manufacturers across the world and these companies have communicated with us too.There is wide reluctance to get vaccinated among some communities. Women in rural areas are generally reluctant to go for a test or vaccination. How would you motivate them?We are trying to raise awareness and bust myths. The Opposition is spreading misinformation. However, we are helping people in rural parts to register on the app via 133,000 common service centres across districts.Is there a need to launch a polio like campaign across the state involving community and religious leaders?Uttar Pradesh is already reaching the last mile with its micro- management strategy and door-to-door visits. I have myself held meetings with religious leaders, sportspersons, gram pradhans and we will continue to consult with every group and community to spread awareness and create interest in vaccination in the state.In retrospect, you think holding panchayat polls was a blunder? Many believe it triggered infection in the rural pockets.Panchayat elections are the most difficult elections to hold but polls were also held in Tamil Nadu as well as in Kerala and West Bengal. You can compare their positivity and recovery rate with that of UP and see the difference. Secondly, there were no elections in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh or Rajasthan or Delhi. Let’s focus on ground realities, The last phases of panchayat polls were held on April 26 and 29 and counting took place on May 2. The peak of 38,000 cases per day was reached on April 24. Thereafter, the number of cases started coming down steadily. Thus, it is not based on data and figures that the virus spread because of panchayat elections. In fact, the extent of cases has come down since polls in UP.Do you think somewhere the state too has to own responsibility for large number of deaths as there was a delay in improving health infrastructure, including medicines, oxygen supply, beds, etc?Despite the sudden surge of Covid-19, our cases per million and death per million has been much less than many states of the country and much less than the most developed nations of the world. I think we should avoid doing politics on such issues.We were the first state to create a system where oxygen supplies to medical colleges or private colleges and overall oxygen supply was managed very efficiently. We didn’t have in-house manufacturing plants, but we made arrangement to get oxygen from various places as far as Jharkhand. We received ample assistance from the Central government. Also, we were the first state to implement “oxygen audit” which has been replicated by many other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/were-better-prepared-for-next-wave-yogi-adityanath-101622748072978.html

He was responding to a question on reports of China increasing military deployment and creating fresh infrastructure at friction points on the LAC.“I would like to reiterate what I have shared earlier – that the process of disengagement remains unfinished,” he said.“The two sides have agreed that in the interim, they would maintain stability on the ground and avoid any new incidents. It is our expectation, therefore, that neither side should do anything that is not in keeping with these understandings,” he added.There have been numerous reports in recent weeks of China moving in new military equipment and formations into Tibet and Xinjiang and bolstering air defence and missile positions and airports on its side of the LAC amid the border standoff with India, which began more than a year ago.China’s People Liberation Army (PLA) recently integrated air force and army elements to create a combined air defence system for the western theatre command, which is responsible for operations along the LAC.The disengagement of frontline troops along the LAC stalled following a drawdown of forces and armoured units by both sides on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February. Diplomatic and military talks have not led to a breakthrough at other friction points such as Depsang Plains, Gogra and Hot Springs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disengagement-on-lac-unfinished-china-should-maintain-stability-mea-101622748072292.html

According to farmers, this year’s yield has dropped by 65-70% and lack of exports due to the pandemic has resulted in the prices dropping in the local markets.In Bengaluru’s markets, various mango variants are being sold at ₹20-30 less than their normal prices. Banganapalli mangoes, which sell around ₹70-80 per kg were being sold at ₹45-50 in several markets in Bengaluru on Thursday. According to traders, since the lockdown is in effect, the demand for mangoes is less, forcing them to sell at a lower rate. “People aren’t coming out to buy fruits. We are left with most of our stock during the week. While we get some orders from delivery apps, it is usually small scale. Now we are really left with no option but to reduce the prices,” said Arogya Das, a fruit vendor in the Frazer Town in East Bengaluru. Karnataka is among the top mango growers in India, cultivating the crop on 168,000 hectares in 16 districts, including Bengaluru Rural, Kolar, Chikkaballapura, Dharwad and Ramanagara. Karnataka grows Badami, Mallika, Neelam, Malgova, Kalapad, Sindhura, Alphanso, Totapuri and other varieties of mangoes. Srinivas Gowda, president, Chickballapur Mango Growers’ Association, which is one of the largest growers of mangoes in the state, said the production of the seasonal fruit has come down drastically. “Compared to our capacity, we are producing only 30-35% of the yield. Several table variants like Malgova, Alphonso, Raspuri and others have seen big slash in production,” he added. Gowda said the unseasonal rain was one of the reasons for the limited production. “There were heavy wind, rains, and even hailstorms in several parts of the state during the flowering season and harvest,” Gowda explained. Even though the production has reduced, the prices of the mangoes didn’t see a hike like it should have as per the market conventions, but instead, there was a drop in prices. Gowda cited the lack of exports as the main reason for this. “Just to give example of our region, we used to see around 250 tonnes exported to several countries like the US, UK, Canada, Australia and the Gulf countries. But this year, because of the pandemic and regulations, we could send only 1 tonne. This is just our region. Now you can imagine the situation of the rest of the state,” he said. Even the Karnataka State Mango Development and Marketing Corporation agreed that there was a massive reduction in export. While this year’s figures were not readily available, according to senior officials of the corporation, in 2020, an estimated 1,000 tonnes of exports were reported in the state against the normal 50,000. “It could be worse this year. We will know the exact figure at the end of the season,” said a senior corporation official. In its attempt to promote mango sales during the lockdown, the corporation had launched an online portal, where mangoes would be delivered through the India Post. However, the project has not covered much distance. Meanwhile, the lack of exports has also resulted in the overload of mangoes in the retail market and that had resulted in the drop in the prices, added Gowda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unusual-rain-lockdown-trigger-dip-in-mango-production-prices-in-state-101622747532331.html
04-06-2021||India||Drawing flak, Google says sorry for Kannada blunder||Bengaluru Google, the USA-based search engine giant, on Thursday found itself at the receiving end of severe criticism over its search results for Kannada, which had a descriptor as the “ugliest language”.The backlash from the Kannada language speakers, which is one of the national languages in the country, was so spontaneous that #Kannada was trending on microblogging site, Twitter across the country.Other hashtags like #KannadaQueenOfAllLanguages also continued to trend on Twitter.According to the image shared widely on social media, the search result for the ugliest language in India came up as Kannada.“What is the ugliest language in India?” was the question, to which the answer was shown as “Kannada spoken by around 40 million people in south India,” according to a screenshot of the search results.“Kannada language has a history of its own, having come into existence as many as 2,500 years ago! It has been the pride of Kannadigas all through these two-and-a-half millennia,” Arvind Limbavali, Karnataka’s minister for forest, Kannada and culture said in a twitter post.“If Kannada is now called ugliest language in India, it is merely an attempt by @Googleto insult this pride of Kannadigas. Demand apology from @Google ASAP to Kannada, Kannadigas. Legal action will be taken against @Google for maligning the image of our beautiful language!,” he added.“Home to the great Vijayanagara Empire, #Kannada language has a rich heritage, a glorious legacy and a unique culture. One of the world’s oldest languages, Kannada had great scholars who wrote epics much before Geoffrey Chaucer was born in the 14th century. Apologise @GoogleIndia,” PC Mohan, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Bengaluru Central posted on Twitter.Politicians from all major outfits in Karnataka took to social media to condemn the Indian-born Sundar Pichchai-led companies to apologise on the content.“This blunder is not acceptable. When it comes to language, whoever it is should be careful. Especially when it comes to Kannada, twice the care should be taken. Otherwise, there will be no surprise if the self-respect of Kannadiga’s that became a wave in just one hour, can turn into a Tsunami,” HD Kumaraswamy, former chief minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader said in a post in Kannada on Twitter.The search engine giant, in a response to Hindustan Times, apologised for the misunderstanding and to those whose sentiment may have been hurt.“Search isn’t always perfect. Sometimes, the way content is described on the Internet can yield surprising results to specific queries. We know this is not ideal, but we take swift corrective action when we are made aware of an issue and are continually working to improve our algorithms. Naturally, these are not reflective of the opinions of Google, and we apologize for the misunderstanding and hurting any sentiments,” a Google spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drawing-flak-google-says-sorry-for-kannada-blunder-101622747472364.html
04-06-2021||India||India defends decision to abstain during UNHRC vote on Israel-Hamas conflict||India on Thursday defended its abstention in a vote at the UN Human Rights Council that led to the setting up of an inquiry into rights violations during the Israel-Hamas conflict, saying it had also acted in a similar manner in the past.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi outlined the country’s position a day after it emerged that Palestinian foreign minister Riad Malki had expressed concern over the abstention in a letter sent to his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on May 30.Malki’s letter had stated that India’s abstention during the vote on May 27 “stifles the important work of Human Rights Council at advancing human rights for all peoples, including those of the Palestinian people”.Asked at a weekly news briefing whether India’s decision to abstain during the vote at the UN Human Rights Council was contrary to the country’s long-standing position on the Palestinian issue, Bagchi replied that this was not a “new position”.“Regarding the letter from the Palestinian foreign minister, I understand that Palestine has written similar letters to all the countries that abstained during the UN Human Rights Council vote,” he said.“The position that we took is not a new position. We have abstained on previous occasions. I think that explains our position quite clearly and addresses these questions,” he added.A resolution calling for a commission of inquiry into human rights violations during the Israel-Hamas conflict, which was presented by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Palestinian delegation, was adopted by 24 votes at the Human Rights Council. Israel rejected the move.India, Brazil, France, Italy and Nepal were among 14 countries that abstained during the vote.New Delhi also dropped its traditional reference to support for the “just Palestinian cause” in at least three recent statements at the UN Security Council, General Assembly and Human Rights Council. The statements, however, retained the usual support for a two-state solution to be achieved through direct negotiations to ensure lasting peace between the people of Israel and Palestine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-defends-abstention-at-unhrc-on-israel-hamas-conflict-101622747112222.html

At a meeting on Tuesday chaired by the PM, it was decided to call off the Class 12 exams conducted by CBSE in view of the raging pandemic.The PM asked students how they feel about the cancellation of board exams, and advised them not to get stressed. He said that the decision to cancel exams was taken in the interest of students.“...we learn from these tough times. You will gain a lot of strength from these tough experiences. You will achieve new feats in whichever field that you choose. We always speak about team spirit; we are given lessons about united strength. However, during the pandemic, we got an opportunity to learn, understand and experience the strength of unity. We witnessed how people collectively helped each other and how the country, through team spirit, faced a tough challenge. The experience of public participation and team spirit (gained during the pandemic), will give us a renewed strength,” Modi said.During the interaction, several students and parents shared their experiences with the Prime Minister about how the announcement of the cancellation of exams brought relief for them and ended a long spell of uncertainty.Nandan Hegde, a Class 12 student from Karnataka, said, “This was not the last exam of my life and we are really grateful that the government has decided to cancel them prioritising the interest of students.”Students also said that the cancellation of exams will give them more time to prepare for their competitive exams.Appreciating the “positive attitude” of students, the PM said, “After interacting with you, I have realised that India’s youth is positive as well as practical…”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/youll-gain-from-tough-times-pm-tells-students-101622747052273.html
04-06-2021||India||Every journalist entitled to protection from sedition: SC||Every citizen has a right to criticise the government’s policies so long as it does not incite people to violence or creates public disorder, the Supreme Court said on Thursday while quashing a sedition case.The bench of justices Uday U Lalit and Vineet Saran underlined a 1962 constitution bench judgment in Kedar Nath Singh’s case to assert that a journalist could not be prosecuted under Section 124A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for “disapprobation of actions of the Government and its functionaries”, and quashed a case registered last year against journalist Vinod Dua in Himachal Pradesh over a YouTube show.“A citizen has a right to criticise or comment upon the measures undertaken by the government and its functionaries, so long as he does not incite people to violence against the government established by law or with the intention of creating public disorder,” said the court, referring to the Kedar Nath’s case while highlighting the basic requirements for registration of a first information report (FIR) under Section 124A.Sedition is punishable with either imprisonment ranging from three years to a lifetime, or a fine, or both. It is only when the words or expressions have pernicious tendency or intention of creating public disorder or disturbance of law and order, said the bench, that Sections 124A and 505 (statements creating or promoting enmity) of the IPC must step in.“Every journalist will be entitled to protection in terms of Kedar Nath’s judgment, as every prosecution under Sections 124A and 505 of the IPC must be in strict conformity with the scope and ambit of said Sections as explained in, and completely in tune with the law laid down in the judgment,” it said.The bench emphasised its 1962 judgment that laid down the fundamental requirements before registration of a sedition case, as it turned down Dua’s plea for constitution of a committee in every state for approving FIRs against persons belonging to the media with at least 10 years of standing in the profession. Dua pleaded that every state should have a committee comprising the chief justice or a judge of the high court concerned, the home minister of the state, and the leader of the Opposition. But the bench said that constitution of such a panel will amount to encroachment upon the rights of the legislature.The ruling came two days after another bench of the SC expressed concerns over the misuse of India’s sedition law, stating that it will define the contours of the colonial era penal provision to indicate what does and does not constitute sedition.On April 30, another bench led by justice Uday Lalit had agreed to examine constitutional validity of the penal law on sedition in India and sought assistance of attorney general KK Venugopal. In this case, journalists Kishorechandra Wangkhemcha and Kanhaiya Lal Shukla challenged the validity of Section 124A. This case will be heard next in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/every-journalist-entitled-to-protection-from-sedition-sc-101622746992245.html
04-06-2021||India||At Cong poll loss review meet, call for state units’ overhaul echoes||The Congress panel reviewing the party’s performance in recent assembly polls has, in the course of its meetings, encountered demands for sweeping changes in the party’s state leadership in Kerala, Assam and Puducherry, two members of the panel said on condition of anonymity.In all three, the local leaders also cited Covid as a major factor that restricted the party’s political activities for the past year and claimed that this had a fallout in the electoral prospects of the Congress.The five-member panel, led by former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan, met the rank and file of the Congress units as well as the top leaders in these three regions. The Congress failed to win in Assam, Puducherry and Kerala, and drew a blank in West Bengal. In Tamil Nadu, it is part of the ruling alliance, courtesy its partnership with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. The Congress was the incumbent in Puducherry and its failure to win Kerala broke a 24-year trend where the Congress-led and the Communist Party-led groupings alternate in power. The latter was the incumbent.The panel has submitted its report on Assam, Kerala and Puducherry to party chief Sonia Gandhi while the Bengal report is still being prepared. The panel has made several recommendations to strengthen the organisation. “In all the three regions, the major demand was to change the current party organization and bring in new faces. Leaders accused each other and infighting marred several interactions,” said a member of the panel. who asked not to be named.In the last CWC meeting, where the general secretaries in charge of states were asked to report on the poll results, they too, pointed to factional feuds in states such as Assam and Kerala as one reason for the party’s poor performance.The other reason highlighted by many leaders was that the Covid situation forced them to abandon many programmes in the run up to the elections. “Political agitations against the incumbent government, and party’s outreach to the voters was severely curtailed and the long spell of inaction of the Opposition helped the ruling party that was visible through relief measures and Covid-related activities,” said another Congress leader .The panel spoke to 20-25 leaders in Puducherry and Kerala. In Assam, the panel interacted with more than 40 Congress leaders, according to a party functionary.The panel also comprises Salman Khurshid, Jothi Mani, Manish Tewari and Vincent H Pala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-cong-poll-loss-review-meet-call-for-state-units-overhaul-echoes-101622746812214.html

On May 17, the CBI arrested two cabinet ministers, Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, TMC legislator Madan Mitra and former mayor Sovan Chatterjee.Even though a special CBI court granted them interim bail on the same day, later that evening the CBI moved the high court. The division bench of acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal and justice Arijit Banerjee stayed the bail and the leaders were sent to judicial custody. Later, on May 21, they were put under house arrest and the court constituted a larger five-judge bench to hear the bail petitions. On May 28, the five-judge bench granted them interim bail.The agency sought that the May 17 proceedings at the special CBI court be declared as vitiated as top TMC leaders, including party supremo Mamata Banerjee, staged protests after the four were arrested. The CBI also sought transfer of the case.The bench, however, questioned the CBI on what terms the proceedings could be declared as vitiated and the case be transferred. The bench also questioned what would happen to the rights of the accused.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, said the May 17 proceedings of the special CBI court were vitiated “by corrupting the atmosphere”. He said that he had to argue his case over mobile phone as he was not allowed to step out. Even the case diary was not presented, he said.The bench will again take up the matter for hearing on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-questions-cbi-claim-of-bias-in-narada-case-points-to-rights-101622746752199.html
04-06-2021||India||Bengal ex-chief secy responds to Centre notice||Former West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay on Thursday responded to the Union home ministry’s show-cause notice sent to him for missing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s May 28 meeting, said officials at Nabanna, the state secretariat in Kolkata.State officials told PTI that Bandyopadhyay argued that he left the Cyclone Yaas review meeting as per the directive of chief minister Mamata Banerjee and went to another meeting in Digha, a resort town in Purba Medinipur district that was ravaged by the powerful storm.The Centre sent the notice on May 31, insisting that Bandyopadhyay’s decision to leave the PM’s meeting was a violation of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The political firestorm began after Banerjee briefly met Modi and told reporters that she took the PM’s permission before leaving the venue -- a fact later disputed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders. She also indicated her objection to the presence of her protege-turned-rival Suvendu Adhikari, who is the leader of Opposition in Bengal.Soon after this, Bandyopadhyay was sent transfer orders from Delhi and told to report to the Centre’s department of personnel and training on May 31. The 1987-batch Indian Administrative Service officer was due to retire that day but had received a three-month extension from the central government.The order was unusual because it didn’t specify what post he was to hold. Banerjee declined to release him. On Monday, she also wrote to the PM to request that the transfer order, issued without consulting the state, should be withdrawn. On May 31, she said she allowed Bandyopadhyay to retire and appointed him as special adviser to the CM for three years.The Centre, which initially suggested that it would initiate action against Bandyopadhyay for not coming to Delhi, issued the show-cause notice under a provision of the disaster management law that requires everyone to abide by any direction given by officials during a disaster. “By this act of abstaining himself from the review meeting taken by the Prime Minister, who is also the Chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority, in the aftermath of Cyclone Yaas as part of his visit to cyclone affected areas in the state of West Bengal, Sri Alapan Bandopadhyay, chief secretary, government of West Bengal, acted in a manner tantamount to refusing to comply with lawful directions of the Central government and is thus violative of Section 51 (b) of the Disaster Management Act 2005,” read the letter signed by Ashish Kumar Singh, under secretary to the government of India.Bandyopadhyay sent his reply on Thursday, but officials at Nabanna refused to divulge the contents of the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-ex-chief-secy-responds-to-centre-notice-over-missing-pm-meeting-101622746692194.html
04-06-2021||India||Govt considers single jab-purchase channel||Is the Centre considering procuring vaccines on behalf of the states? According to three people familiar with the matter, it is discussing the modalities of a centralised channel for vaccine procurement. The agency in charge of this channel will negotiate terms with vaccine manufacturers, and supply jabs on a pro rata basis to states, the people added, asking not to be named.Govt books 300 million doses of new Indian jabThe chief ministers of some states, including Odisha’s Naveen Patnaik, Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal and Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan have taken a public position that the Centre should procure vaccines centrally after global tenders raised by many states evoked no real response. Some large pharma companies, including Pfizer and Moderna have also told states that they prefer dealing with the federal government.“States first demanded decentralisation of vaccination. Hence, they were allowed to float global tenders. Now, they find merit in a collective centralised mechanism, which is under consideration. However, a final decision on this issue will be taken by the competent authority,” one of the people cited above said.“It also depends on consensus among states on this matter,” a second person said. The empowered group on vaccination, the Prime Minister’s Office, the Niti Aayog, and ministries of finance and health did not respond to email queries .Under Phase 3 of its vaccine drive, the Centre opened up vaccines to all people over the age of 18 years and shifted the onus of acquiring such vaccines to states, albeit under a quota devised and monitored by it. It also allowed private hospitals to acquire and administer vaccines. With vaccines in short supply, the result has been chaotic, with not enough jabs to go around. The widely varying charges levied by private hospitals presented another problem. The Supreme Court on Wednesday termed the policy for 18-45 year olds “arbitrary and irrational”.Till Wednesday, India vaccinated 45.3 million people completely and another 130 million have received one dose.In a letter to chief ministers, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday said global vaccine manufacturers were unwilling to get into supply contract with individual states. “The best option available is for the Government of India to centrally procure the vaccines and distribute it among the States so that our citizens are vaccinated at the earliest,” he said in the letter, a copy of which has been reviewed by HT.He, however, reaffirmed states’ demand of a decentralised vaccination programme.Similar sentiments have been expressed by chief ministers of Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Punjab. On May 26, Kejriwal tweeted that the global tenders by states could not elicit any vaccine manufacturer. Hence, the Centre should give vaccines to state as per their needs.While some states are willing to pay for their quota of vaccines procured under a centralised system, others, such as Kerala want the Centre to bear the entire burden. “While payment responsibility is another issue to be resolved as health is a state subject, it is certain that a collective negotiation will reduce to cost of vaccines by 25%,” a third person said.On May 31, Vijayan wrote to 11 chief ministers “in the spirit of Cooperative Federalism” demanding the Centre to take the responsibility of procurement. On May 24, he wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that competition among states to procure vaccines would push up their prices.Audit and consulting firm EY India, in the latest edition of Economy Watch, said that if the Centre procures vaccines, the average price would be much lower than if individual states get involved. Conservatively, it estimates savings of over ₹43,000 crore or 40% of the total cost. “For vaccinating India’s total population aged 12 years and above at 108.5 crore (1.08 billion) , total required doses would be 217 crore (2.17 billion) considering two doses per person. At an average price of ₹300 per dose, the total vaccination cost would be ₹65,108 crore. If states’ involvement pushes up the average price to say ₹500 per dose, total vaccination bill would unnecessarily go up to ₹1.09 lakh crore,” it said.DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor of EY India said: “This cost enhancement, which may be higher if the average vaccine price increases even more, is clearly avertible apart from avoiding the confusion ensuing from states’ involvement in vaccine procurement and implementation.Union Budget 2021-22 allocated ₹35,000 crore for vaccination programme. “The budget will not be a constraint and the government will enhance the vaccination budget, if required,” the third person mentioned above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-considers-single-jab-purchase-channel-101622746632216.html
04-06-2021||India||Serum seeks DCGI nod to manufacture Sputnik||Serum Institute of India (SII) has sought approval to manufacture the Russian-made coronavirus disease vaccine, Sputnik V, in India, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.SII, applied to Indian regulator, the drugs controller general of India (DCGI), Dr VG Somani, on Wednesday to seek approval for grant of licence.“Yes, it is true that SII has applied to the drugs regulator. They have applied for a test licence,” said one of the people cited above.A test licence, according to the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) website, is granted for the import of small quantities of drugs for purposes of examination, testing or analysis. According to industry insiders, SII is also hoping for grant of indemnity, as is being considered for foreign Covid-19 vaccine makers by the Indian government, as they raised the issue last year.During Carnegie India’s Global Tech Summit 2020 in December, SII chief executive officer, Adar Poonawalla, talked about the need for the government to provide indemnity to vaccine manufacturers against frivolous complaints.Sputnik V is currently being distributed in India by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, which signed a pact with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) that globally markets the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute. As part of the deal, Dr Reddy’s will distribute the first 250 million doses of Sputnik V.RDIF has also tied up with six other local companies to produce its vaccine, and its chief executive officer, Kirill Dmitriev, said earlier that it was also in talks with other manufacturers to ramp up production in India, which is likely to start some time in July. By current estimates, RDIF is looking at a production capacity of about 850 million Sputnik V vaccine doses per annum from India. The companies with which it has a manufacturing tie-up include Hetero Biopharma, Gland Pharma, Stelis Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, and Virchow Biotech.India granted emergency use authorisation to Sputnik V on April 13.Queries to SII remained unanswered till press time, and RDIF representatives said as of now there was no official information that they could provide.SII Is already manufacturing the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine locally under the brand name Covishield, which is one of the two jabs being used under the national Covid-19 immunisation programme.Government officials aware of the matter recently said SII has informed that the company is ramping up its vaccine production capacity, and will likely produce 100-120 million doses a month by June.SII has also started manufacturing and stockpiling the United States’ Novavax vaccine that it will be locally manufacturing under the brand name Covovax. However, regulatory approval for Novavax is still awaited in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serumseeks-dcgi-nod-to-manufacture-sputnik-101622746512189.html
04-06-2021||India||MK Stalin writes to centre, asks to ramp up supply of black fungus drug||The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday urged the Centre to allocate adequate number of Amphotericin B drug, used for treating black fungus disease, as the state detected 673 cases so far and the demand for the medication has 'increased manifold'. In a letter to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, Chief Minister M K Stalin said, ".. the emergence of mucormycosis among the patients and sufficient supply of liposomal Amphotericin B, which is being allotted by the Government of India, are increasingly becoming critical issues which need urgent intervention." With the state government declaring 'mucormycosis' as a 'notified disease', Stalin said Tamil Nadu has initiated large scale prevention efforts by creating greater awareness about its likely causes. The state government has also set up mucormycosis clinics and dedicated wards in government hospitals. So far, 673 cases of mucormycosis or black fungus have been detected in the state and hence the demand for "liposomal Amphotericin B has increased manifold", he said in the letter. Noting that his government already placed orders for 35,000 vials of the anti-fungal drug, he said the supply was according to the allocation made by the Centre. ".. the state has received only 1,790 vials, which is woefully inadequate to treat the growing numbers of mucormycosis patients. I would request you to kindly instruct the concerned officials to immediately allocate at least 30,000 vials to Tamil Nadu," the CM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mk-stalin-writes-to-centre-asks-to-ramp-up-supply-of-black-fungus-drug-101622744724439.html
04-06-2021||India||In rare relief, no heatwave yet, none likely this summer: IMD||The Capital has not recorded a single heatwave day this summer. And with the forecast of another spell of rain at the end of next week, it is unlikely that Delhi will record any day of extreme heat this summer – a phenomenon experts said has never happened before in the city.Weather scientists said that two cyclonic storms, along with a series of western disturbances through April to June were the primary reasons behind this year’s mellow summer in Delhi, a city known for its scorching heat this time of the year.Between March 1 and June 3, Delhi has not recorded a single “heatwave” day, which India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said is a “rare” phenomenon for the city. IMD scientists also said that this could “very well be the first summer in Delhi’s history” that the city did not experience a single heatwave day.HT reported last week that the Capital has been on a streak of weather records from August 2020. On June 1, the minimum temperature in the city dropped to 17.9 degrees Celsius, the lowest ever recorded in June.In the plains, heatwave days are classified when two things happen – when the maximum temperature crosses 40 degrees Celsius, and when the day temperature exceeds the region’s normal maximum temperature by 4.5 degrees Celsius. A severe heatwave is when there is a rise of 6.5 degrees Celsius or above from normal temperature.RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD, said a combination of conditions favourable for a cool summer have been seen in Delhi, which has resulted in no heatwave days. “We have not seen such conditions ever... This time of year is known for its scorching heat and high temperature. There have been years when the maximum temperature in May has even touched 48 degrees Celsius. We will have to wait till the end of June to declare if we have broken an all-time record of the coolest summer,” Jenamani said.In Delhi, heatwave days occur between March and June, with April and May generally being the hottest. Towards the middle of June, the heat starts to abate with the onset of pre-monsoon and monsoon rains.This year brings much-needed relief from the extreme heat in recent years. Last year, Delhi reeled under a severe heatwave spell from May 22 to May 30, with temperatures up to 47 degrees Celsius. Delhi recorded six heatwave days in 2019 and three such days in 2018.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said under the impact of cyclone Tauktae, Delhi broke the record for the highest single-day rainfall for the month ever on May 19-20, with 119.3mm of rain. This kept mercury low through May, with day temperatures dropping to 23.8 degrees Celsius on May 19, the lowest ever recorded in the month.“Even after the cyclone’s impact, we got a consistent series of fresh western disturbances that passed over Delhi, which led to smaller spells of rainfall over the region. This helped keep mercury levels from rising,” Srivastava said.He said that after Tauktae, Delhi also witnessed several days of cloudy skies due to cyclone Yaas. “Most of your extreme recordings are seen till June 15, because after that Delhi starts witnessing pre-monsoon activities, because of which temperatures start going down. So it is quite likely that we will not record any heatwave days this year,” Srivastava said.IMD records show that Delhi’s Safdarjung observatory recorded zero heatwave days in 2014 and 2011. However, other weather stations in the city recorded heatwave conditions in both years. Srivastava’s claims were also confirmed by IMD’s latest forecast of fresh western disturbance passing over the region on June 11 and June 12, which is likely to bring rainfall by the end of next week.Experts said that heatwaves are common in Delhi during this time of year as the region comes under the country’s core heatwave zone (CHZ), as categorised by IMD. Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, West Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Vidarbha in Maharashtra, parts of Gangetic West Bengal, Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Telangana come under CHZ, where high recordings are witnessed in summer. According to IMD, regions in CHZ experience at least six heatwave days every year.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, Skymet India Weather Services, however, said that while conditions indicate a below-normal summer season, it is too early to claim that temperatures will not rise as June progresses.“It is true that heatwave conditions recorded in May are likely to last longer, compared to those reported in June because the intensity of heat often dies down sooner due to the onset of southwest monsoon. But there are years where we have seen extreme recordings (even in June),” Palawat said.On June 10, 2019, Delhi’s Palam observatory recorded a maximum temperature of 48 degrees Celsius, breaking the previous all-time record of 47.8 degrees Celsius (June 9, 2014).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-heatwave-days-this-season-met-officials-said-could-create-a-new-record-101622745674903.html
04-06-2021||India||Delhi govt schools asked to scale up vaccinating teachers||The Directorate of Education (DoE) has directed all its schools to take immediate steps to vaccinate all the teachers. All the Delhi government schools have been asked to submit data of teachers who have not been vaccinated as of now. On Monday, HT reported that around 100 teachers have died of Covid-19 since March last year. Even as schools were immediately closed when the pandemic hit the national capital last year, teachers were deployed in Covid-related duties.In a letter to district education officers and school principals, director (DoE) Udit Prakash Rai said, “Government school teachers have been spearheading the Covid response of the Delhi government. Teachers have been deployed on several fronts to contain the spread of coronavirus. Teachers have gone beyond the call of duty in management of containment zones, airports, vaccination drive, ration distribution, oxygen management etc.”“The teachers of DoE who are the frontline workers for the Delhi government have led the efforts of the government in containing the infection and breaking the transmission. They have also spared no efforts in managing the second wave Covid -19 crisis which unfolded in the months of April and May 2021,” he added.Rai said all the government school teachers shall get vaccinated at the earliest. “Accordingly, all DDES and HOSS are hereby directed to take all necessary steps towards vaccination of all the government school teachers. They should ensure that all the concerned teachers are facilitated and vaccinated at the earliest,” he said in the letter.Officials at the DoE said the government might set up a separate vaccination centre for teachers in the coming days. “It will be decided after collecting data from all schools,” an official said.Several principals of Delhi government schools said that they have already sent data to their district officers between Wednesday and Thursday. Harpreet Kaur, principal of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya (SKV) in Tilak Nagar, said, “Only 28-29 of the total 60 teachers employed at the school have been vaccinated yet. We were sending our teachers for vaccination in batches in March-April. Then the second wave of Covid-19 hit the capital. We will now prioritize the vaccination of all our teachers.”Dr Devendra, principal of Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Rouse Avenue, said they also submitted the data with the district officials. “Although 80% of our teachers are already vaccinated, it will be better to complete the vaccination of all teachers before we restart the teaching-learning process again after the summer break,” he said.Schools in the Capital are scheduled to reopen virtually from June 10 after the summer break.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-schools-asked-to-scale-up-vaccinating-teachers-101622745614970.html

He needs a lung transplant that will cost them ₹1.2 crore.Amrit Pradhan, a software engineer from Berhampur town of Odisha, was wheeled into an air ambulance of Chennai’s Apollo Hospital waiting at Bhubaneswar airport after the city police created a green corridor for the 10 km stretch from AIIMS Bhubaneswar.“The Apollo Hospital team had brought an Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) machine which would keep him alive till he gets a lung transplant,” said Chidanand Tarei, his brother-in-law. An ECMO pumps his blood to a heart-lung machine that removes carbon dioxide and sends oxygen-filled blood back to tissues in the body, bypassing the heart and the lungs.Doctors at AIIMS-Bhubaneswar told his family that the entire treatment including a lung transplant and 2-month long hospitalisation would cost ₹1.2 crore.“For a middle class family like us with health insurance, the maximum cover that we have is ₹10 lakh. We had lost all hopes when we decided to appeal on social media as well as fundraising site Milaap. By Thursday evening, we had collected ₹60 lakh from 5,400 people. The amount of support and love that Amrit received was incredible,” Amrit Pradhan’s brother-in-law Tarei said.The ECMO supported air ambulance alone costs Rs. 30-40 lakh. “We are hoping to achieve the ₹1.2 crore figure that we aimed at,” said Tarei, who will fly to Chennai with his wife on Friday.Techie aspiring to be civil servantPradhan, described by his family as a happy go-lucky man, had taken up a job as a software engineer in a Bangalore-based IT firm after passing out from a premier engineering college in Bhubaneswar. During the pandemic, he left his job and started preparing for the civil services.However, his life was disrupted after his 56-year-old mother was hospitalised due to Covid. Some time later, his father, a retired banker, also tested positive and was hospitalised. And then, Amrit Pradhan and his sister Manisha, who had been running around for their parents to arrange medicines, also tested positive for Covid.Amrit tested positive for CovidEveryone else in the family recovered, not the 24-year-old. Doctors said he had developed pneumonia and septicaemia in the lungs.Amrit Pradhan was initially admitted to a private hospital but as his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to AIIMS-Bhubaneswar on May 2. He was initially put on NIV non-invasive ventilation support and for the last 20 days, has been on ventilator support.“Around May 24, doctors at AIIMS advised us that my brother-in-law would need to be admitted to a hospital having facility for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support and lung transplantation which is not available in Odisha,” said Tarei.Tarei said the spirit of camaraderie that he saw for Amrit’s treatment amid the Covid pandemic was moving. “We are too overwhelmed with the response that we received from unknown quarters.

We will continue to make all efforts to ensure he is brought to back India,” foreign ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told reporters.This is the first time the Indian government has officially commented on the issue since Choksi disappeared from Antigua and was found three days later in Dominica, roughly 100 nautical miles away.“Let me emphasise that India remains steadfast in its efforts to ensure that fugitives are brought back to India to face justice,” Bagchi added.India-born Choksi, who is wanted in a R13,500 crore bank fraud case, faces two separate legal proceedings in Dominica. A magistrate’s court in the Dominican capital Roseau is hearing the government’s charge that the businessman entered the country illegally. And, Choksi’s lawyers have moved the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, alleging that he was abducted and asking him to be sent back to Antigua.In the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, justice Bernie Stephenson adjourned the matter to allow Choksi’s legal team and Dominican prosecutors to meet and agree on the language to be used in the injunction filed to stop his removal from Dominica, according to local media.As the hearing was underway, some protesters demonstrated outside court and sought a probe into Choksi’s presence in Dominica.In the court of magistrate Candia Carrette-George, Dominican state attorney Sherma Dalrymple argued that Choksi entered Dominica illegally at Toucari beach on May 21 -- two days before he was officially reported missing from Antigua -- and was a flight risk.Dalrymple cited an Interpol notice against him, 11 alleged offences in India, and extradition proceedings in Antigua. She said Choksi had no ties to Dominica, therefore could flee the island if given bail, local media reported.Choksi’s lawyer, Waye Norde, sought bail and said his client was kidnapped, beaten, and unwillingly brought to Dominica. He said Choksi was not a flight risk given his poor health and added that the Interpol notice and extradition proceeding in Antigua were reasons for Choksi to not leave Dominica.He asked the magistrate that stringent conditions could be added to the bail and proposed a sum of East Caribbean $10,000, double the maximum penalty for illegal entry. Dalrymple objected to the offer.Norde cited Section 4 of the bail law and said a defendant was entitled to bail as a right unless the offence was serious. But the court rejected his plea for now and set the next date of hearing on June 14.Choksi was sent back to the Dominica-China Friendship Hospital, where he was admitted earlier this week. He will be sent to police custody when he is discharged.The controversy over Choksi’s disappearance and alleged abduction has stirred a political storm in both Antigua and Dominica. On Thursday, the Antiguan cabinet said Choksi will become a “problem” if he was sent back to the island, where he has citizenship protections.“Choksi has become Dominica’s problem at this time. If he finds himself in Antigua, the problem reverts to Antigua and Barbuda. The preference of the cabinet of Antigua and Barbuda is for Choksi to be repatriated to India from Dominica,” an Antiguan cabinet note stated.Meanwhile, four days after Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne claimed Choksi left the island with his girlfriend, the Antiguan information minister Melford Nicholas on Thursday refused to divulge details on the matter. Responding to questions about the identity and nationality of the woman, Nicholas said, “The cabinet has been briefed by the intelligence agencies about the circumstances of departure and removal of Mr Choksi but I am not obliged to disclose the details as it may prejudice the investigations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksi-denied-bail-dominica-prosecutor-says-he-entered-illegally-on-may-21-101622701749695.html
