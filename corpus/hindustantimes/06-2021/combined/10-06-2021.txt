10-06-2021||News||Are ‘remunerative’ MSPs boosting rural demand?||On June 9, the union cabinet approved Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for the 2021-22 kharif marketing season. MSP for paddy, the most important kharif crop as far as procurement is concerned, will be ₹1940 per quintal, compared to ₹1868 last year. The press release issued by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) says that the latest MSP offers a 50% mark-up over the projected cost of cultivation in 2021-22.The cost measure which has been used in calculating this mark-up is the A2+FL category. This has been described, in the CCEA release, as a “comprehensive cost which includes all paid out costs such as those incurred on account of hired human labour, bullock labour, machine labour, rent paid for leased in land, expenses incurred on use of material inputs like seeds, fertilizers, manures, irrigation charges, depreciation on implements and farm buildings, interest on working capital, diesel/electricity for operation of pump sets etc., miscellaneous expenses and imputed value of family labour”.To be sure, many farmer organisations have been demanding that the government use the C2 measure of cost of cultivation — this includes the imputed rental value of owned land and interest on value of owned fixed capital, thereby including the opportunity cost of practising agriculture — in making sure that MSP offers 50% returns.This A2+FL versus C2 controversy notwithstanding, a more important question is worth our engagement. How useful is MSP when it comes to boosting rural demand for the economy at large? An HT analysis shows that the answer is complicated.Nominal growth in MSPs has been low in recent years Although the government claims that latest MSP announcements fulfil the 50% mark-up over A2+FL criteria, the increase in nominal terms is not much. Paddy and wheat MSPs for the 2021-22 kharif and rabi marketing seasons have increased by 3.9% and 2.6% respectively. A long-term analysis of MSP for paddy and wheat, the two most important crops which are procured, shows that nominal growth in MSP has been declining under the second Narendra Modi government.Also Read | Cabinet clears hike in kharif crop MSPsWhile the first Modi government increased nominal MSPs at a slower pace than the rate of increase in most years under the first and second United Progressive Alliance (UPA) governments, it announced a big hike in the 2018-19 marketing season, which could have been tactically aligned with the 2019 elections.Nominal MSPs are not enough to access the demand impact To be sure, nominal MSP growth numbers could be misleading as far as its impact on farm incomes and hence rural demand is concerned. Here is why. MSPs, directly or indirectly (in terms of creating a price floor), affect the prices received by farmers, and hence their nominal incomes. Demand, on the other hand, is a function of purchasing power, which is determined by relative prices.An example can make this clear. A wheat growing farmer sells his wheat and expects to use his earnings to buy other things. Let us assume that the farmer in question wants to buy a fertiliser, motorcycle and tractor with his earnings. If wheat prices double in a year and motorcycle, fertiliser and tractor prices increase by only one-and-a-half times, then the farmer is in an advantageous position. However, if wheat prices increase at a slower rate than other commodities, then the farmer is at a disadvantage.The best way to capture this dynamic is to look at the terms of trade — ratio of prices received and prices paid — for agriculture. The ministry of agriculture publishes this data. This is better than a simplistic retail inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index for rural areas) comparison because farmers are both consumers and producers at the same time. As is obvious from the list of commodities given above, the motorcycle, fertiliser and tractor capture spending by the farmer on consumption, intermediate and capital goods. A typical CPI index is not meant to capture prices of intermediate or capital goods.Unfortunately, terms of trade data are available with a time-lag and the latest numbers are for 2018-19. The statistics show that terms of trade were improving for farmers from 2004-05 to 2010-11, stagnated at unfavourable levels till 2016-17, and started declining after that. A worsening of terms of trade for farmers entails a decline in their purchasing power and therefore rural demand.Disaggregating the terms of trade deterioration Because the headline terms of trade number is contingent on what is happening to prices of consumption, intermediate and capital goods, it is important to find out the relative contribution of these items.The ministry of agriculture data actually gives the index of prices paid for these three categories and their respective weights in a farmers’ spending basket. Intermediate consumption has the highest share of 43.4%, followed by final consumption (38.2%) and capital formation (18.4%). Calculation of individual terms of trade — the ratio of prices received and paid — for each of these categories shows that headline terms of trade have deteriorated despite an improvement in terms of trade for intermediate consumption.The rural wage factor in intermediate consumption terms of trade What explains the improvement in intermediate consumption terms of trade while the other two heads have deteriorated? A rural wage squeeze could be the answer.Wages account for more than 60% and almost one-third of A2+FL cost of cultivation for paddy and wheat. Rural wages, which were rising at a fast pace until 2014-15, have stagnated in the recent past. This is bound to have generated headwinds for intermediate costs for farmers and hence overall cost of cultivation.However, this is likely to have generated a second order squeeze on rural demand. If agricultural labour and farmers experience a squeeze on income (rural wages and imputed value of wages), this will put a pressure on purchasing power and therefore rural component of aggregate demand, including that for farmers. Large parts of India’s rural poor are also net buyers of food items.The chicken-egg connection between terms of trade for agriculture and aggregate demand The discussion so far underlines an interesting paradox in the Indian economy. Even though the government is offering remunerative MSPs year after year, this might not have generated strong tailwinds for overall demand because the terms of trade for farmers have been deteriorating leading to a squeeze on their purchasing power. Of course, the situation would be worse if MSPs did not exist.Two factors might further worsen the terms of trade for farmers going forward. The profit-led nature of recovery and poor labour market conditions in the post-pandemic phase will further squeeze mass incomes and hence demand for food items, putting downward pressure on prices. A rise in the cost of items such as diesel and some fertilisers (the government has announced a hike in subsidies for urea) could lead to the actual cost of cultivation being higher than the projected costs used for calculating the latest MSPs, which only started rising after May 2021.“It is unrealistic to think that the farm economy will keep delivering even though the non-farm part is in crisis. Farm sector is the shock absorber in terms of the labour market and the longer it takes for the non-farm labour market to recover, the more difficult the farm sector will find to cushion incomes”, said Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. “This is why it is important that the government provides a fiscal stimulus to both the labour-intensive component of both farm and non-farm sectors”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/are-remunerative-msps-boosting-rural-demand-101623326716480.html

According to her, the mother of a girl was responsible for the deeds of her daughter. Meena Kumari was in Aligarh on Wednesday to listen to women’s complaints. Later, when she interacted with the media, she was asked about increasing crimes against women. “Society should also be held accountable for increasing crimes against women. Families should keep a watch on where their daughters are going and mixing with what kind of boys. Parents should keep a watch on the mobile phones of their girls,” she suggested. “It has been seen that girls talk on mobile phones with boys and then elope with them. There are many such cases where girls have married after such conversations on mobiles,” she said. “I would appeal to families to not give mobile phones to girls and if given, then vigil should be maintained. Mothers in particular should keep an eye on the daughters as all that is happening is the outcome of laxity by mothers,” said Meena Kumari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dont-give-mobile-phones-to-girls-swc-member-101623349759650.html

Progeria is a rare genetic disease which causes a person to age prematurely. The patient may be a child but normal growth is hampered and the appearance is like an aged person with wrinkles and hair fall. Doctors say that a progeria patient usually survives for 20 years. The second son of trolley puller Rampati Bhartiya of Dhanecha village of trans-Ganga, Rupesh showed symptoms of progeria some years after his birth. His parents visited many doctors but no one was able to cure him. The doctors at a medical camp diagnosed the disease as progeria but no steps were taken for treatment. Rupesh’s parents also accepted it as an act of God. However, Rupesh’s mother Shanti Devi took good care of him and the family rejected the offer of a local circus to take him away in return for ₹4 lakh. In 2017, Dr Girish of local Ashutosh Memorial Trust started taking care of Rupesh and he provided all possible treatment. He made the family aware of Amitabh Bachhan’s movie ‘Pa’ which was based on a progeria patient. The administration also came forward for Rupesh’s help when news about his plight was published in Hindustan Times. Dr Girish said that Rupesh’s memory was strong. He was good at aiming glass balls and often used to laugh in front of the mirror. He was provided with a mobile for listening to music but his diet was quite low. He said he wished Rupesh could have broken the record of Liyon Botha (26) of South Africa who was the longest progeria survivor .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/progeria-patient-rupesh-dies-at-23-101623349579778.html

Nineteen more plants are to be inaugurated within a day or two. The Delhi government has already installed three oxygen storage plants till now of 57 MT each ( total capacity 171 MT) and work is being done on a war footing,” said Kejriwal during his visit to a site at north west Delhi’s Siraspur where one storage tank has been installed.“The Siraspur facility has a 12.5 MT oxygen generation plant. The other two oxygen storage plants have been set up in the premises of Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital and DDU hospital,” he said.“In the second wave, the biggest challenge we faced was shortage of oxygen, because of which people of Delhi had to struggle a lot for a few days. Therefore, preparations are being made so that in case a third wave emerges, there should be no shortage of oxygen,” said the chief minister.Kejriwal further said, “All over Delhi, facilities for oxygen storage and oxygen generation are being created. We faced a lot of problems regarding tankers such that when we had to get oxygen from Haryana and other states, we did not have tankers. So, we are also getting tankers. All preparations are in full swing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-o2-tanks-with-combined-capacity-of-171-mt-set-up-across-capital-101623346941371.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal hails Centre’s policy to buy vaccines for states||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday appreciated the central government’s policy to buy vaccines for all beneficiary groups for distribution among states from June 21 even as he highlighted the role of the Supreme Court in this regard and expressed concerns over low production of vaccines in the country.“Vaccine shortage is concerning. It is a good thing that the central government has decided to buy vaccines and distribute it among states from June 21. We welcome the decision, even though it was done after the Supreme Court’s intervention and its pressure. Better late than never,” said Kejriwal during his visit to a site of an oxygen storage system in northwest Delhi’s Siraspur.On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Union government was taking over the responsibility of procuring vaccines and distributing them to the states. The action comes in the wake of growing demand for vaccines from the states, sharp criticism from the Supreme Court and increasing concerns that supply shortages and the insistence of foreign vaccine makers to deal only with the Union government could derail India’s vaccine drive.The Union government will continue to allow private hospitals to buy up to 25% of the vaccines made in India, although it has capped the service charge they can levy on these at ₹150 a dose. “The details of India’s new vaccine policy will be worked out in consultation with the states in the next two weeks, and will be out on June 21,” said Modi.Kejriwal further said on Thursday, “The biggest question that looms large is where will the government avail vaccines from? Production capacity in the country is still very low. If we have sufficient number of vaccines, and other states follow Delhi’s model, the whole population can be vaccinated in three months.”Kejriwal highlighted the city government’s ongoing initiative of engaging 13,000-odd booth level officers in the city and MLAs to visit every household and convince people aged 45 years and above to get vaccinated at the earliest in temporary vaccination sites set up at the polling booths close to their residences.Delhi has a population of 20 million, of which 15 million are aged above 18 and are eligible for vaccination. Government records show around 5.79 million people in the city have so far received at least one dose of the vaccine and 1.34 million have taken both doses.With vaccine supplies slowly stabilising, the Delhi government has been opening more vaccination centres. Delhi now has 739 centres administering vaccines to 45+ group and 231 centres offering vaccines to the 18-45 group, up from 482 and 95 recorded on Wednesday, showed the government’s health bulletin.While all government-run vaccine centres for the 18-45 group were forced to be suspended for more than two weeks because of shortage of vaccines, the number of sites for the 45+ group had reduced to 414 earlier this week.AAP legislator Atishi, while reading out the government’s vaccine bulletin in a video briefing on Thursday, said, “We are shocked that central government has written to several states, including Delhi, directing them not to disclose vaccine stock numbers. We urge them to invest more on vaccine production and supplies instead of focussing on reducing transparency on stock positions.”Govt to vaccinate delivery agents Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday issued directions to the health department to tie up with companies – especially in the retail and food aggregator sectors – to ensure that their delivery agents are vaccinated.His office said in a press statement: “Deputy Chief Minister Shri Manish Sisodia on Thursday directed the Health Ministry to tie up with organisations such as Amazon, Flipkart, Zomato, Swiggy, Dunzo, and other organisations, to ensure vaccination for the delivery persons working for these organisations.”“Delhi has received vaccines for the 18-44 years (18-45) age group and has begun vaccination drives for this segment of the population... We now need to focus on people who have been working as delivery persons. They are at extra risk as their job involves travelling home to home and meeting multiple people throughout the day. Hence, these agents are making sure that people stay within homes and avoid crowding markets etc, and we should vaccinate them at the earliest,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kejriwal-hails-centre-s-policy-to-buy-vaccines-for-states-101623346940737.html

The total case count rose to 180403, and the death count was at 860. According to the district’s health department data, active cases were at 581, of which only 48 were hospitalised while the rest were in home isolation. Gurugram chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Virender Yadav said, “Covid-19 cases are reducing gradually in the district, but people still have to be careful and should avoid stepping out if not necessary.” The city has been under lockdown since May.‘Vaccine shortage’There are 31 primary health centres and six dispensaries across the district and all of them allow for on-spot registration. Kanika Sharma a resident of DLF Phase 1, said that there seemed to be a shortage of vaccines in the district. She said she had visited three government centres in the last three days. “The staff asked to come early morning on Monday but by the time I reached, they said that had run out of stock and that they had only 100 doses,” she said. Samarth Singh of Emerald Estate in Sector 65 said that vaccine tokens got over within hours and they have to visit the centres again and again. “For working people, it is difficult to visit health centres again and again, and with the long queues, it’s even worse. It took three visits to get my first jab,” said Singh, an executive with an IT company. A few even travelled to the city outskirts to get their vaccine. There, they said, the footfall at vaccination centres were low. “My wife, mother and I went to Sohna on Wednesday to get the first jab,” said Sandeep Shukla of Sector 56. “That was after we could not get a token even after two days of trying.” CMO Dr Yadav said, “We are regularly receiving vaccines (from the state). On Tuesday and Wednesday, we got 10,000 doses each that have been distributed. (With Centre planning to provide vaccines from June 21)... things will improve and there will be smooth drives by end of this month.”According to the health department, 799,562 doses have been administered in the district till now, of which 17,198 doses were administered on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/at-27-lowest-daily-covid-case-spike-in-ggm-since-feb-22-101623346939981.html
10-06-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram restaurants and bars seek liquor licence fee waiver||Owners of restaurants, pubs and bars in Gurugram have sought a waiver of the quarterly liquor licence fee, citing a loss of revenue in view of their outlets remaining shut since this April, after the government enforced restrictions to curtail the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Owners said they had already paid the first quarter fee of this fiscal in advance, but since then, their establishments have remained shut in view of the rising number of Covid-19 cases, which were at its peak from mid-April to mid-May. The excise department is yet to consider their requests and have instead asked them to pay the next quarter fee by the end of the month. Officials said they have started receiving applications for surrendering liquor licences and the numbers may go up in the months to come as restaurants stare at an uncertain future due to the pandemic. Inderjeet Banga, the owner of Prankster and Pirates of Grill and the head of the Gurugram chapter of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said they have requested the state government and the excise department to consider their appeal and provide some relief. “Due to the lockdown and the current situation, the industry is badly hit. We had demanded that the government should waive liquor licence fee for the lockdown period,” he said. The liquor licence fee for a five-star hotel in the district is ₹25 lakh per annum, while it is ₹24 lakh per annum for bars and restaurants, and ₹10 lakh for microbreweries. Restaurants and bars have been shut since April when lockdown-like restrictions came into effect to contain the spread of Covid-19. They have now been allowed to open on Mondaybut only at 50% capacity. Lalit Ahlawat, the director of Soi Hospitality in CyberHub, Adda in Sector 29 and Striker on Golf Course Road, said they were hopeful that the industry will get back to its glory days soon. “In the current circumstances, we all are trying to revive our businesses. We have appealed to the government and we are hopeful that they will consider our request and will waive at least this quarter’s fee. With corporates still working from home, there is hardly any footfall at restaurants and pubs,” he said. Restaurateurs said despite the fresh guidelines announced on Sunday, allowing them open from 10 am to 8pm starting Monday, the footfall is yet to pick up. Rohit Mann, director, Raise the Bar brewery at Clarens Hotel in Sector 29, said they get the maximum business after 7pm, but now the guidelines stipulate that they have to close at 8pm. “We have already paid the quarterly fee and with in the current situation, we will suffer losses as people are not stepping out. The department will have to consider our situation and give us relief so that we can stay afloat,” he said. Restaurateurs said with the present operational timings, they cannot earn much revenue by only opening for lunch hours. Arjun Sagar Gupta, founder, Piano Man, said revenues will take a while to revive. “Without night operations we cannot earn revenue and the industry is in distress. Considering our request will be a booster for us,” he said. VK Beniwal, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (east), however, said they have already extended the time to pay the quarterly fee by a month, but cannot waive the fee completely. “If they have already written to higher authorities, it might bring some relief, but we are unaware of any appeal filed by them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-restaurants-and-bars-seek-liquor-licence-fee-waiver-101623346939223.html

Another survey is scheduled next week and after that the construction work would be taken up again.“It is not a big issue, and can be sorted out during the joint survey. This will not have any impact on the project,” he told HT adding that the work is underway in the other areas where there are no issues.Two AIIMS were approved by the central government in 2019, one in Jammu and another in Kashmir. The projects were scheduled to be completed by 2025, however, army’s objection could delay the construction of Kashmir’s first premier medical institute.During the review meeting held by Pole, army had raised serious concerns over the construction of AIIMS building close to army installations in Pulwama district and said the Central Public Works Department was violating WODA rules.Srinagar-based defence spokesman Lt Col Emron Musavi said that army has been advising AIIMS authorities right from the inception of the project in 2016 that the WODA guidelines have to be honoured for all projects in the vicinity of military establishments.“The final clearance for all such projects is granted by the defence ministry. It was only in January 2021 that the campus construction plans were shared with the army by CPWD. By then the construction had already begun in violation of WODA,” he said.He said the divisional commissioner has assured the army that their security concerns will be factored into the construction plans.“Indian Army, in close coordination with the civil administration, remains committed to extend all assistance to the AIIMS authorities for early execution of the project.”As per the officials, the master plan and construction of AIIMS in Awantipora had been finalised and is scheduled to be completed by 2025.Meanwhile, locals said that army’s objections shouldn’t affect the project. “Kashmir does not have good medical infrastructure or a hospital of the standard of AIIMS. The project should be completed on time,” said Showkat Ahmad, who lives close to the area where the AIIMS will come up.Another local, Abdul Qayoom, opined that army should have sorted out the matter with the authorities much earlier. “Things like approvals and objections usually happen at the beginning. But in this case, army is now raising these issues, which will just delay the work of this much-needed project,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aiims-pulwama-hits-a-wall-as-army-red-flags-construction-101623343944215.html

As per the vaccine data from the National Health Mission (NHM), Jharkhand administered around six lakh doses of the Covid vaccine from May 26 to June 8. On May 26, the vaccine coverage in Jharkhand was 4,012,142 doses, which increased to 4,607,189 doses by June 8. “Similarly, till May 26, net vaccine availability at the state government was 4,207,128 doses, of which 4,012,142 doses were administered. While on June 8, net vaccine availability was 4,676,990, of which 4,607,189 doses were administered. It resulted in bringing wastage down to 1.5% from earlier 4.5%,” a health department official said. Wastage of vaccination ignited a political controversy last month. The Centre claimed that Jharkhand, with 37% wastage, was on top of the list of states that reported wastage. However, the state government countered the Centre’s claims saying the wastage was only 4.65%. “In May, the state government started a drive across Jharkhand to make people aware of the importance of taking the jab and other relevant information. More than 23 lakh women of Sakhi Mandal, under JSLPS, were trained to hold a mass awareness drive across the state,” an official said. In many parts of Jharkhand, it is very difficult to reach by a four-wheeler due to the difficult terrain and positioning of villages, but the government is putting in every effort to ensure the availability of the vaccine to them also, he said. The official said many districts have adopted bike vaccination drive with the on-spot registration facility, which has helped not only in spreading awareness among the rural population but also mobilised a large population to the nearby vaccination centres. Different districts across the state are also operating mobile vaccination van to ensure vaccination in the distant parts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/vaccine-wastage-falls-to-1-5-from-earlier-4-5-in-j-khand-state-health-dept-101623342318341.html

Besides, for combating the third wave of Covid, which is said to be dangerous for children, Mishra informed that the district administration has already set up 20-bed paediatrics ward at the community health centres in 10 blocks.District social welfare officer Sneh Kashyap informed him during a review meeting that the district has fixed a target of identifying a total of 50 children who lost their parents to Covid. “The district sent a report to the government on June 1 for fund allotment for providing help to identified children,” said DSW officer Sneh Kashyap.Mishra, who reached Dhanbad on Wednesday evening after assessing preparation for protection of children from Covid third wave in six districts of Santhal Pargana, said Dhanbad is the first district in the state that has demanded funds so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-third-wave-niti-aayog-reviews-preparation-for-protection-of-children-in-dhanbad-101623342261073.html

10-06-2021||Ranchi||Monsoon likely to hit J’khand on Saturday||The southwest monsoon, considered crucial for agriculture, is likely to hit Jharkhand on Saturday with an expectation of normal shower during four-month of the seasonal rainfall, officials said on Thursday. Major parts of Jharkhand witnessed a change in weather on Thursday with cloudy sky and light to moderate rainfall due to an approaching low-pressure system, which would help accelerate the monsoon in the state, weather officials said. “Conditions are favourable for further advancement of south-west monsoon in Jharkhand, West Bengal and some parts of Bihar by June 12. Under its influence, widespread rainfall activity along with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely over the districts of Jharkhand between June 12 and June 15,” said Abhishek Anand, senior scientist at Ranchi centre of India Meteorological Department (IMD).He said, a low-pressure area is likely to form over the northwest Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood during the next 24 hours, which is likely to move westwards across Odisha. The development will trigger monsoon in Jharkhand, he said.This is expected to be another year after 2020 when monsoon onset is likely to be almost on time in the state. Monsoon had hit Jharkhand on June 13 in 2020, while the normal date for monsoon onset in Jharkhand is June 10.The seasonal rainfall has not been on time for many years. The monsoon hit Jharkhand on June 21 in 2019, June 25 in 2018, June 16 in 2017, June 17 in 2016 and June 21 in 2015.Anand said they are expecting to receive normal rainfall from June to September. “Rainfall in June would be encouraging. Overall, the rain is expected to be normal in Jharkhand this year,” he said.Anand, however, alerted of lightning activity with the arrival of the monsoon. “During the onset of monsoon, lightning activities increase in Jharkhand. Therefore, people need to be alert and protected,” he said.With the prediction of a timely and normal monsoon, the state agriculture department is also set to cash in on the opportunity. State agriculture department director Nisha Oraon Singhmar said they, for the first time, started the distribution of seeds much in advance of monsoon onset.“Due to lockdown, we had some limitations. Despite, we have made all efforts to make farmers aware about the availability of subsidised seeds in their respective locations through SMS, publicity and Krishi Rath,” she said.She said, “We have a database of 35 lakh farmers in Jharkhand with their Aadhaar and mobile numbers. They are receiving messages on these numbers. Field workers have also been deployed to make farmers aware of seed and fertilizer distribution. In a bid to maintain transparency in distribution, we have introduced seed token.”“Very soon, we will register all farmers and provide them Aadhaar like unique ID. Under this unique ID, farmers will be given the benefit of all government schemes. The initiative will minimize the scope of repetition and role of middlemen,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/monsoon-likely-to-hit-j-khand-on-saturday-101623342258934.html

They also announced a complete weekend lockdown from 4pm on Saturday to 6am Monday across the state. Nine districts were left out of the relaxations last week under Unlock-1.“Lockdown regulation on shops and trades under five-six categories have been discontinued in Jamshedpur as a precautionary and preventive measure. The Covid-19 curve was consistently coming down, but 348 new patients and five deaths were reported on Tuesday. It seemed to have tilted the decision. We feel this regulation will help us, and if things show downward swing, Jamshedpur too will get the relaxations next week,” Suraj Kumar, Jamshedpur DC, said on Thursday.The DC said that the number of new patients shot up drastically on Tuesday because the pending RTPCR tests came that day. “But it is also a matter of concern that Jamshedpur has still been reporting highest number (40-45) new Covid-19 patients on a daily basis in the state,” added Kumar.Jamshedpur had reported 827 new Covid-19 patients and 20 deaths between June 1 and 8, while 1,222 patients were cured during the period.

10-06-2021||Other||AQI of Bihar cities worsens despite huge investment, policy support||PATNAHuge investments, policy support and tie-ups with multiple expert groups notwithstanding, air quality index (AQI) of top Bihar cities remains a major worry. The average AQI of Patna, Gaya and Muzaffarpur in the first week of June this year was found to be worse than the corresponding period of last year, which passed under the lockdown phase. This is despite the fact that the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) started striving for stringent implementation of the clean air action plan and spending of around ₹208 crore to check air pollution. As per the Central Pollution control Board (CPCB) data, average AQI of Patna was found to be 92.25 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) parts per million (ppm) between June 1-8 this year as compared to last year’s 85.75 µg/m3, which too was beyond the permissible limit of 60 µg/m3. Similarly, average AQI of Gaya and Muzaffarpur was found to be 61 µg/m3 and 100.62 µg/m3 respectively against last year’s 58.57 µg/m3 and 68.57 µg/m3 during the corresponding period. The state environment and forest department and the BSPCB had signed agreements with various agencies like United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Development Alternatives Group, Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI), etc, for different types of intervention to check air pollution over the last couple of years. The BPSCB has also inked a deal with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, to help identify the major factors responsible for release of toxic contents in the ambient air. “The study would help up check those factors, which generally affect the air quality,” said Ghosh. BSPCB chief Ashok Ghosh said that meteorological conditions should be taken into account while comparing the data. “The board has been actively pursuing the goal of implementing the clean air action plan, which was formulated with support from the ADRI a year and half ago. The action required convergence of roles of different government departments. A committee headed by the chief secretary has been formed to implement the action plan, but the outbreak of Covid19 pandemic slowed the process,” Ghosh said. Principal secretary, department of environment and forest, Dipak Kumar Singh, said improvement of air quality was a long-term process and hence the change could be visible in so quickly. “Dust particles is a major issue for a state like Bihar that has a large tract of alluvial soil in Gangetic plain. Construction is another important irritant. We are coordinating with different departments to check the pollutants, but desired result remains elusive so far,” he said. Environmentalist and public health expert Gopal Krishna said the Bihar government had done a lot on paper, but it was unable to implement the policies and schemes which could really bring about perceptible change. “Neither the common people nor the government agencies are bothered about the issues of air pollution. The government could not be serious to improve the air quality until it is linked with public health. BSPCB is grappling with infrastructure issues. The act related to air pollution, which was enacted in 1981, also needs to be amended,” said Krishna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/aqi-of-bihar-cities-worsens-despite-huge-investment-policy-support-101623342138924.html

10-06-2021||Other||Heat in HC after Buxar led to Covid toll revision||PATNAIt’s thanks to the rigourous questioning by the Patna high court, which has been hearing a public interest litigation on Covid-19 management in Bihar, that the state government has finally corrected the figures of fatalities due to pandemic, putting the combined toll during the first and second wave to 9,375 after verification of data.The trigger was Buxar, where 81 corpses were found floating in the Ganga river last month, sparking a widespread outrage. On May 18, a bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar, detected inconsistency in figures of death in Buxar and expressed its anguish over failure to update websites for death registration even in the digital era. The court had sought details of the deaths – be it Covid or non-Covid. “We are ‘aghast’ at the manner in which the affidavits are being filed. We notice that the official website maintained by the State of Bihar for recording the births and the deaths has not yet been updated. We see no reason as to why the deaths, whatever be the number and wherever they may have taken place, would not have been updated on the official website. Deaths may have also taken place in home isolation, at care centres, private hospitals etc. This would apply to all the districts of Bihar,” the bench observed. On May 21, when former additional solicitor general SD Sanjay drew the attention of the bench to the issue of delay in issue of death registration certificates, which was causing problems to the kin of victims in availing insurance claims and other compensations, the court said Buxar was a test case and threatened “if the officials of the panchayati raj institutions and others don’t comply with the court’s order within a week and fail to update death registration, we will stop their salary and even seize their powers.” On May 25, when the bench reiterated that it was important to that every death was recorded and documented from every village, block, district or town, as it could go a long way in helping the state prepare for the third wave with an overall view of the ground situation, the AG said that the chief secretary had directed all the district magistrates for the same and sought 10 days of time. The bench had then said it would not mind giving more time, but every death must be documented. On June 1, the court again said it had been insisting from day one that the Centre’s digital programme for death registration be put in place, as it would help the state in forward planning with a clear picture. “If correct and up-to-date data is not there, how can the state plan?” the court askedAdvocate General (AG) Lalit Kishore admitted before the court that the registration of deaths needed to be expedited and that he would pass on court’s directions. Kishore said on Thursday he would present the details before the court during the next hearing later this week.Dr Sunil Kumar, state secretary of the Indian Medical Association, said the actual death toll could go higher still as the state was still considering the positive reports of the rapid antigen test (RAT) and RT-PCR only as the yardstick, while there were many who just did not go for any test and were in home isolation or others who tested negative in RAT and RT-PCR but were positive as per chest scan. “The data collection In the rural areas is also very weak and so is the level of awareness. A large number of people remained in home isolation and those deaths are not reported in the absence of test reports,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/heat-in-hc-after-buxar-led-to-covid-toll-revision-101623342080877.html

Deaths at many private hospitals weren’t included either. A proper scrutiny was made and all such cases were included in our attempt to ensure that the bereaved families get the ex gratia,” Jaiswal said.The three-time Lok Sabha MP said such practices were also followed in states like Delhi and Maharashtra. “There is nothing wrong in that. A fresh study was made to maintain the data transparency,” he said.The state government on Wednesday said the death count had gone up by 3,951, which, in effect, is a whopping 72.84% after verification of deaths across each of its 38 districts, as directed by the Patna High Court on May 18. The state’s Covid-19 cumulative death toll jumped to 9,375 on June 8, as against 5,424 reported a day earlier.Meanwhile, Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) dubbed the revised toll as “death scam” and demanded a judiciary inquiry into the matter. “The government was forced to present data only after being rapped by the high court. As per our estimates, the death toll is 20 times higher than what the government has shown in its revised data. The manner in which Covid tests were ignored, a large number of deaths are still unaccounted and need to be looked into by a judicial magistrate,” RJD spokesperson said.Mrityunjay Tiwari said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-bjp-chief-defends-revised-covid-toll-rjd-smells-blood-101623342079634.html

The state had released ex gratia funds for 3,737 Covid-19 victims so far, but it was not sure how many of them had received it. “We will have to check that and then revert,” Bihar’s additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit had said at a press conference on Wednesday. The government had included deaths due to post-Covid complications as well while revising its cumulative death toll, leading to an increase in the death count by 3,951 on June 8. The state’s Covid-19 cumulative death toll jumped to 9,375 on June 8, as against 5,424 reported a day earlier. As per the Centre’s changed norms, a Covid-19 negative report was not necessary at the time of a patient’s discharge from a health facility. Patients with no Covid-19 symptoms like cough, cold or fever for three consecutive days could be discharged after 10 days hospitalisation, without RT-PCR negative test report. “Many health facilities had not accounted for post-Covid deaths. We issued instructions to the district magistrates and civil surgeons to include all such deaths as well while verifying Covid-19 deaths,” Amrit had said on Wednesday. He, however, did not specify the duration till when such deaths will be treated as post-Covid deaths and the next of kin of the deceased will be entitled for compensation. The government also did not share the break-up, leading to the built-up of Covid deaths post-verification even as Amrit said the increase was due to deaths reported at private hospitals, in transit to health facilities, under home isolation and those dying of post-Covid complications. He, however, said the government would take stern disciplinary action against lax and insensitive officers responsible for this. A day later on Thursday, the health department still did not respond to requests for sharing break-up of deaths reported from private hospitals, crematoria, home isolation, people dying in transit and due to post-Covid complications. Top health officials did not respond to phone calls or text messages. Patna, for instance, which reported 87.48% rise in deaths—up for 1,223 on June 7 to 2,293 on June 8 — saw an uptick of 1,070 deaths, but the district administration did not share a break-up of where the additional deaths had been reported from. “We verified Covid deaths from different sources, including private hospitals, crematoria, the district control room and other sources,” said Chandrashekhar Singh, Patna’s district magistrate. He did not elaborate. Dr Sahajanand Prasad Singh, president (elect) of the Indian Medical Association, however, praised the government. “The state government has done a course correction and it has been transparent enough to mention the actual number of Covid-19 deaths in the state,” said Dr Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ex-gratia-for-post-covid-deaths-too-101623342080159.html
10-06-2021||Kolkata||Punjab gangster Bhullar shifted to Kolkata apartment week after killing 2 cops||Kolkata: A Haryana man who claimed to be an automobile parts dealer, took the New Town apartment on rent for the Punjab gangsters, Jaipal Singh Bhullar and Jaspreet Jassi, who were shot dead in an encounter on Wednesday afternoon.Sumit Kumar, the businessman from Haryana completed the paperwork on May 22. The following day, the two gangsters moved into the second floor apartment at Sukhabrishti, a complex built by the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, the criminal investigation department (CID) of the West Bengal police said on Thursday.Jaipal Singh Bhullar, son of a retired assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of Punjab Police, was on the run after he and three others killed two police officers in Ludhiana’s Jagraon on May 15. He was already wanted in several states in connection with over 45 cases, including murder, kidnapping, robbery and smuggling.On Wednesday, Bhullar and Jaspreet Singh were killed in an encounter with the Special Task Force (STF) of West Bengal Police in the eastern outskirts of Kolkata. STF inspector Kartick Mohan Ghosh was shot in the shoulder in the gunfight.Akbar Ali, who owns the apartment and lives at CIT Road in central Kolkata, told the media that he did not know the tenant and the broker, Sushanta Saha, prepared the legal documents. Sumit Kumar allegedly told the broker that the apartment was required for a man who worked for a private company and was coming to Kolkata on transfer.Incidentally, Sumit Kumar initially contacted Kolkata-based property dealer Saurav Kumar looking for an apartment. Saurav Kumar referred him to Sushanta Saha, a broker who operates in the New Town area, said officers probing the case.Sushanta Saha told the police that Sumit Kumar took on rent apartment No 201 at Block B of Sukhabristi, an upmarket residential complex that has a few hundred apartments.Residents and security guards at the complex told the investigators that once Bhullar and Jassi moved in, they never left the apartment and ordered food from local outlets. One of the delivery boys told the media that the duo always ordered north Indian dishes. They rarely opened the windows.CID officers said Bharat Kumar, who drove the black luxury sedan used by the two to reach Kolkata, revealed their new address in Kolkata after he was caught by the Punjab police on his return. The car was also caught on a security camera at Gwalior. The vehicle, which has a West Bengal registration number, was reportedly sold six years ago by a Kolkata-based company but the new owner did not register it in his name.Residents of Sukhabristi apartments said this wasn’t the first time that the police had arrested some criminals from the complex; it was the first incident where shots were fired. They alleged that many apartment owners do not even live in Kolkata and rent out their properties without checking the background of tenants.Bengal housing minister Firhad Hakim on Thursday said, “Many of the residents are tenants. It is difficult to keep track of these people. The apartment owners are supposed to keep the local police informed about the identity of the tenants but many people do not comply. We cannot force them as there is no stringent law which makes it mandatory.”Bharatiya Janata Party’s Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh on Thursday criticised the state’s law and order situation on this issue. “This is not the first time that terrorists and gangsters from Punjab have been nabbed or killed in Bengal. Punjab terrorists were killed here during the 1990s as well, when the Left Front was in power. Criminals see Bengal as a safe haven. The National Investigation Agency should look into this,” said Ghosh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/haryana-auto-parts-dealer-rented-kolkata-apartment-for-punjab-gangsters-cops-101623341900915.html

A brief spell of dust storm was followed by heavy rain that continued for around an hour. Not only the city but rural areas of trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna region also received heavy rains. The maximum temperature in the city settled at 33.1 degrees Celsius while the minimum was 23.8 degrees Celsius. The city received 33.9 mm of rainfall, said the local weatherman. The rain also led to waterlogging and disruption in power supply. Several localities and roads were submerged in knee-deep water. Be it the road under the rail under bridge near Niranjan cinema hall, the road leading to Sant Nirankari Bhawan, Rambagh, the under bridge at Kydganj, Alopibagh and many others remained water logged for several hours. “These pre-monsoon showers would come at regular interval till first week of next month when the city would witness full-fledged monsoon. Although, the second fortnight of the present month would be hot with temperature reaching around 47 degrees but hot winds and right conditions are critical for proper monsoon,” said emeritus professor at department of Geography, AU, HN Mishra.Villages in Phulpur, Meja, Karchana etc in Prayagraj and Kunda in Pratapgarh too received heavy rain for around one hour giving the farmers a much-needed relief. “The pre-monsoon showers have come at an appropriate time as even in rural areas, people were facing the brunt of the hot and humid conditions. This will also help the crop of mango to ripe and become sweeter. Besides, we can now prepare the nursery for getting the sampling for paddy which would be planted with the advent of monsoon,” said Ram Awadh Mishra, a farmer of Jasra development block of the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/premonsoon-shower-brings-relief-from-hot-humid-weather-in-prayagraj-101623341898946.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||Smog tower in Connaught Place to come up by August 15: Gopal Rai||The Delhi government’s pet protect, the construction of a smog tower in Connaught Place, will be completed by August 15, environment minister Gopal Rai announced on Thursday. Rai, who visited the site where a 25-metre-high smog tower is being constructed, said that the work had slowed down because of the Covid-19 lockdown but the pace of construction has picked up again. “The country’s first smog tower is being set up here as a pilot project by the Delhi government. We surveyed the site today. Because of Covid-19, the work had slowed down and it should be sped up now. If this pilot project is successful, more such towers will be set up in Delhi,” Rai said. He added, “The tower will be made functional by August 15 and its performance will be monitored by experts, based on which further plans will be made.” The Delhi government is funding the construction of this smog tower, which is being built on directions of the Supreme Court on a budget of ₹20 crore by its private partners, Tata Projects Limited. IIT-Bombay is providing technical support to the project in collaboration with IIT-Delhi, and the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) is a project management consultant. Another such tower is being set up by the Centre, at east Delhi’s Anand Vihar, under the expertise of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Both towers were earlier supposed to be built by June, but Covid-19 induced lockdown delays have slowed down completion. Officials said that both the towers will use 1,200 air filters, developed by a team of experts at the University of Minnesota in the United States. “The towers are estimated to reduce the concentration of PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) by 50% to 70% in an about one-kilometre radius around them,” the Delhi government said in a statement on Thursday. Each tower would have 40 fans and 40 noise control devices and would cover an area of 28 square metres. Air would be pulled in from the top of the towers, passed through the filters and released at the bottom, officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/smog-tower-in-connaught-place-to-come-up-by-august-15-gopal-rai-101623341478958.html

The state board on Wednesday issued a notification about the evaluation plan for Class 10 with instructions to principals and teachers on how to assess students. Dinkar Patil, MSBSHSE chairman, said principals and teachers from across Maharashtra participated in the online webinar. “We are expecting to get the results by July 3 and will need another 10 to 15 days to declare the class 10 results,” said Patil. Ashok Bhosale, secretary of MSBSHSE, said that out of 100 marks, 50 marks will be evaluated based on the performance of Class 9. “Principals are instructed to calculate the marks of class 9 out of 100. And then convert and consider the marks out of 50 to include in the class 10 evaluation,” said Bhosale. “Schools who have not conducted the first semester exam and tests throughout the academic session due to the pandemic should evaluate students based on one or more activities, including class test, projects and homework. Subject-wise students should be evaluated for 30 marks,” said Bhosale. In its notification, the state board has issued instructions that repeater students who have appeared for one or more subjects will get marks out of 80 from their previous scores conducted earlier by the board. “Students who have enrolled through Form 17 should be evaluated out of 80 based on tests arranged by their centres,” the board officials said. The board has also directed schools to form a seven-member committee at every school headed by the principal. “These exam committees will ensure that exam results are unbiased and fair. They will strictly adhere to the notification given by the board,” said Bhosale. The teachers and principal will be given a detailed training on the same on June 10. “Schools are expected to work on the evaluation till June 20. Till June 24, the exam committee of respective schools will assess the evaluation. And final evaluation by the schools is to be submitted to the board by June 30. The divisional board and state board will then take necessary action from July 3,” said Bhosale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ssc-assessment-principals-teachers-undergo-one-day-training-101623337637741.html

The trust has no links with the Missionaries of Charity founded by Mother Teresa.Earlier this week, two minor girls had escaped from the children’s home, alleging sexual abuse and torture, following which the police had lodged an FIR against its director, his wife who is chairperson of child welfare committee in East Singhbhum district, and three others. All of them, booked under the Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and for other offences, are at large.“I have forwarded the SSP’s report, copy of the FIR and investigating officer’s report to the state social welfare and women and child development department for further action. The IO has stated in his report that Pushpa Rani Tirkey, a named accused and wife of the main accused, continuing in the post of CWC chairperson might influence and hamper the ongoing investigation,” East Singhbhum DC Suraj Kumar said.The DC said removing CWC chairperson from the post was not within his powers as their appointments are done at the departmental level in Ranchi. “Hence, I have neither recommended any action nor sought any guideline. I have sent the case details to the department concerned,” Kumar said.The DC said he has formed an 11-member committee consisting of doctors, police and administrative officials to investigate the charges of sexual abuse, child labour, misappropriation of government funds and private donations by MTWT director and other accused. Meanwhile, police were yet to nab director Harpal Singh Thapar, his wife Tirkey, warden Geeta Singh, her son Aditya Singh and trust employee Tony David, who are the named accused. A Delhi Court last year had convicted 19 persons, including main accused Brajesh Thakur, in connection with sexual and physical assault of girls at a shelter home in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/child-rights-panel-seeks-report-on-sex-abuse-in-children-home-101623336977462.html

One of them waved a gun and warned those present against raising an alarm. They also disabled the alarm system and thrashed the branch manager when he resisted their loot attempt. Another robber picked cash from the strong room at gun point. Police said it took the robbers nearly 20 minutes to execute the crime and flee the spot on two bikes after snatching mobile phones of all the bank employees and customers and locking them inside the building.After they were gone, vendors nearby rescued the staff and reported the matter to the police. Inspector general (Tirhut range) Ganesh Kumar and Vaishali superintendent of police (SP) Maneesh later visited the spot. The SP said they were trying to identify the miscreants through footages of CCTV cameras installed inside and outside the bank. “We have started an investigation. District borders have been sealed to prevent the robbers from escaping,” he said. The IG said the case was a challenge for police and a special investigation team has been formed under the supervision of Deputy SP (Sadar) to crack the case. Locals in the area said that in February this year, criminals had looted ₹43 lakh from AXIX bank just three kilometres from the HDFC branch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/robbers-loot-rs-1-19-cr-from-hdfc-branch-in-vaishali-101623336978085.html

The case has been registered after a complaint filed by the University administration.According to the police, a group of 15-20 students vandalised the glass of the BR Ambedkar Library at JNU, had altercations with the security guards and forcibly entered the library at around 11 am on Tuesday. “Some of them spent the night there and the next day too they refused to leave. Thereafter, the university administration approached the police and filed a complaint, alleging that the students were not complying with Covid-19 guidelines and damaging public property, the police said. “We have registered a case of disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant, damaging public property and obstructing government officials in the discharge of their duties. Nobody was injured in the incident. No arrest has been made in the case, so far,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (southwest) Udit Pratap Singh.Like other educational institutions in the national capital, JNU is also shut for students in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Students had been demanding the reopening of the library and other facilities for the last few months. On Wednesday, the JNU students union had also written to the administration requesting it to reopen the central library following Covid-19 protocols.The JNU administration on Thursday also issued a statement saying that some “unruly” students entered the library forcibly on Tuesday. “When no amount of persuasion by the Librarian and the security personnel convinced these students against violating the law and Covid-19 guidelines, the JNU Security Office lodged a police complaint in view of the seriousness of the issue. It has been found that these students did not even use masks or follow other related Covid-19 guidelines,” the statement read.“It is underlined that the curfew imposed by the Delhi Government is still in place and no new guidelines have yet been announced regarding resuming normal academic activities. The Chief Proctor Office in the meantime has been tasked with taking necessary disciplinary action against these students as per the university rules,” it added.JNU students’ union (JNUSU) vice president Saket Moon said, “Students, especially research scholars, have been witnessing several issues due to the prolonged closure of the central library. Instead of addressing their issues, the administration has filed a police complaint against students. It clearly displays their so-called students’ friendly approach.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-lodge-fir-against-group-of-jnu-students-for-breaking-into-library-101623335957968.html
10-06-2021||Lucknow||Food joints back in business, awaiting dine-in nod!||With corona curfew being relaxed on weekdays, Lucknow’s popular chaat, kebab, curry and biryani joints are back in business. Earlier only accepting online deliveries, these joints are finally open for takeaways too. Though the food joints and restaurants are still waiting for dine-in to resume along with the relaxation in closure timings (7 pm) as that is the peak hour of the business. Some of the joints were operational during the corona curfew for home deliveries and now with markets being functional they are witnessing a swift rise in takeaway numbers. Popular street food joint Bombay Pav Bhaji saw a takeaway rush and many requesting dine-ins. “We are just offering takeaway to patrons. Many are asking for dine-in and in-car service which is not allowed for now as per the guidelines. We hope soon dine-in starts and 7 pm restriction is relaxed,” said Padmesh Sharma. Their Soya Chaap joint is yet to open and is operational with restricted menu. He informed that due to heavy losses they had to permanently shut three of their joints in the city. Delicacies at Moti Mahal and chaat at Royal Café too have started drawing foodies to pick delicacies for takeaway and some were witnessed savouring the chaat sitting at the pavement benches in Hazratganj. Restauranteur Jatin Ahuja said, “All our restaurants are back in service with takeaways and home delivery. We are making live chaat but only providing takeaways and not allowing people for dine-in. Pandemic is still on, and we need to follow guidelines strictly.” On a rainy Thursday, Madhurima Restaurant too saw large number of foodies turn out for piping hot food. “Since dine-in is not allowed we are offering good disposable takeaways so that people can enjoy their favourite items siting in their vehicles. Our home delivery was on during the curfew but since Wednesday we have seen a big jump in sales due to takeaway orders for which we have opened our entire menu,” said Srajal Gupta. All the five restaurants of Dastarkhwan are now open. “The Press Club food hub has started drawing people for takeaway, but biggest hurdle is closure time as night curfew starts at 7 pm,” said Arshi Jamal. In the food hub of Old City, Tunday Kawabi, Mubeen’s and Raheem’s are back with what do best — dish out authentic Awadhi cuisine. Abu Baker of Idrees Biryani informed that they too will be in action from Monday as they are waiting for their staff to return. “Our Chowk, Kapoorthala and Aminabad restaurants are providing home delivery and takeaways out of which most of them are of kebab-paratha that people were missing for long time. We are ready to dine-in and as we get orders we will restart it,” said Mohd Usman from Tunday. Saud Ahmed of Raheem’s informed that two of their three restaurants are not operational, and they hope dine-in starts and night curfew and Saturday-Sunday closure is relaxed. “Bahut loss ho chuka hai, hope life becomes normal soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/food-joints-back-in-business-awaiting-dine-in-nod-101623335177929.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||‘Better late than never’: Kejriwal on Centre’s policy to buy vaccines for states||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday appreciated the central government’s policy to buy vaccines for all beneficiary groups for distribution among states from June 21 even as he highlighted the role of the Supreme Court in this regard and expressed concerns over low production of vaccines in the country.“Vaccine shortage is concerning. It is a good thing that the central government has decided to buy vaccines and distribute them among states from June 21. We welcome the decision, even though it was done after the Supreme Court’s intervention and its pressure. Better late than never,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said during his visit to a site of an oxygen storage system in northwest Delhi’s Siraspur.On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Union government will take over the responsibility of procuring vaccines and distributing them to the states. The action comes in the wake of growing demand for vaccines from the states, sharp criticism from the Supreme Court and increasing concerns that supply shortages and the insistence of foreign vaccine makers to deal only with the Union government could derail India’s vaccine drive.The Union government will continue to allow private hospitals to buy up to 25% of the vaccines made in India, although it has capped the service charge they can levy on these at ₹150 a dose.Kejrival, however, asked if there would be enough vaccines in view of the production capacity.“But the biggest question mark looms over where will the government avail vaccines from. Production capacity in the country is still very low. If we have a sufficient number of vaccines, and other states follow Delhi’s model, the whole population can be vaccinated in three months.”Kejriwal cited the city government’s ongoing initiative of engaging 13,000-odd booth level officers in the city and MLAs to visit every household and convince people aged 45 years and above to get vaccinated at the earliest in temporary vaccination sites set up at the polling booths close to their residences.Nearly 15 million of Delhi’s population of 20 million is above the age of 18 and eligible for vaccination. Government records show around 5.79 million people in the city have got at least one dose of the vaccine and 1.34 million have taken both.The city government has been able to increase the number of vaccination centres due to improvement in vaccine supplies. The government’s health bulletin indicated there were 739 centres administering vaccines to the 45+ age group on Thursday, a substantial increase over the 482 centres a day earlier. Similarly, the number of centres offering vaccines to the 18-45 group also went up from 95 on Wednesday to 231 centres on Thursday.Inadequate supplies had earlier forced the government to suspend government-run vaccine centres for the 18-45 group for more than two weeks. The number of sites for the 45+ group reduced to 414 earlier this week.AAP legislator Atishi, while reading out the government’s vaccine bulletin in a video briefing on Thursday, said, “We are shocked that the central government has written to several states, including Delhi, directing them not to disclose vaccine stock numbers. We urge them to invest more on vaccine production and supplies instead of focussing on reducing transparency on stock positions.”Govt to vaccinate delivery agentsDelhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday told the health department to tie up with companies – especially in the retail and food aggregator sectors – to ensure that their delivery agents are vaccinated.In a statement issued by Sisodia’s office, the deputy chief minister instructed the officials concerned to tie up with organisations such as Amazon, Flipkart, Zomato, Swiggy, Dunzo, and others, to ensure vaccination for the delivery persons working for these organisations.“Delhi has received vaccines for the 18-44 years age group and has begun vaccination drives for this segment of the population... We now need to focus on people who have been working as delivery persons. They are at extra risk as their job involves travelling home to home and meeting multiple people throughout the day.

It is false to say that 22 deaths took place because of the mock drill on April 26,” said Dr Rajeev Upadhaya, president, IMA, Agra chapter, who informed that five-member committee of doctors has been asked to investigate the matter.Past president of IMA, Dr Sudhir Dhakre will head the committee of doctors.“There should have been proper enquiry about video going viral and then only appropriate action should have been taken against Dr Arinjay Jain who was being blackmailed in the name of video,” said Dr Dhakre. The allegations about the hospital are related to a video that surfaced on Monday where Shri Paras Hospital owner, Arinjay Jain, is heard saying that he conducted a “mock drill” at 7am on April 26 during an acute oxygen shortage in the city and 22 people were “eliminated” after they “turned blue”.Jain denied the allegations on Tuesday said such an exercise was not done.After the video went viral on social media, a case was registered against Jain at New Agra police station for violating the Epidemic Diseases Act, creating false alarm under the disaster management act and disobeying official orders under the Indian Penal Code. After the Shri Paras Hospital was sealed, 55 patients were shifted to other hospitals. Two committees have been entrusted with separate inquiries.Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party, the Congress and the Shiv Sena have been protesting against the hospital.Shiv Sena activists were beaten up by hospital staff on Tuesday when the matter was exposed.The Shiv Sena activists have lodged case against the hospital staff and are demanded arrest of Dr Arinjay Jain.The Aam Aadmi Party organized a sit in protest at St John’s College crossing on Thursday.“We are demanding that Dr Arinjay Jain be booked for murder of 22 patients, and we would continue holding dharna till our demands are met,” said Kapil Vajpayee from AAP.The Congress Party undertook candle march from Bhagwan Talkies crossing till Shri Paras Hospital seeking arrest of Dr Arinjay Jain, said Amit Singh, secretary for Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee.Despite these protests, Agra Chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) has decided to stand with Dr Arinjay Jain, the owner of Shri Paras Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ima-agra-comes-in-support-of-paras-hospital-101623333437801.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||Pawar dismisses suspicions over stability of MVA government||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Thursday said he has no doubt that the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will complete its five-year term and will perform well in the next elections. He called Shiv Sena a trustworthy party.The comments of Pawar, who was addressing NCP workers on the eve of the party’s 22nd foundation day, came days after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a one-on-one meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi.“There was a lot of speculation soon after the chief minister’s one-on-one meeting with the Prime Minister in Delhi. As I said we have never worked with Shiv Sena in the past, but Maharashtra has been watching the party for the past many years… Shiv Sena is a party that can be trusted even if people are raising doubts following the meeting. I have no doubt that the MVA government will not only complete its tenure of five years but will also perform well in the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections and represent the state and the country,” Pawar said as he made his first appearance at a public function after he was hospitalised in April for gall bladder surgery and treatment for mouth ulcer.Pawar recalled how late Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray once supported Congress and did not contest a single seat in the state assembly elections. “After Morarji Desai led Janata Party came to power at the Centre, Congress was facing defeat in all the states. At that time, only one party came in support and that was Shiv Sena. Balasaheb Thackeray promised not to field a single candidate in the state assembly elections in Maharashtra then and also fulfilled his promise. He did not even care about the impact of his decision on the organisation and kept his word (to Indira Gandhi),” Pawar said.He said the people of Maharashtra accepted the unusual coalition as no one would have thought about NCP joining hands with Shiv Sena. “We did that and fortunately people accepted the alternative. I remember senior journalists... guessing the number of days, the MVA government was going to last since day one, but all this has stopped now,” Pawar said.He added they will have to resolve the issue of quotas for the Maratha community as well as for the Other Backward Class community. Pawar added the NCP will have to ensure the power will be shared with more people to prevent it from getting corrupted. “Power gets corrupted if it is concentrated and thus should be shared with more people. We will have to ensure that Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Other Backward Classes, and all the other communities are getting their share of power.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pawar-dismisses-suspicions-over-stability-of-mva-government-101623332899090.html

We waited for them for the next 2-3 hours, but as no one turned up, we wound up the camp,” said Dr G Shailaja, medical officer of Kolnara community health centre.Health officials were aware of vaccine hesitancy among the 500-odd Kond tribals in the village and organised an awareness drive on Monday. At the meeting attended by local sarpanch, faithhealers and witchdoctors, the tribals expressed their reluctance to get the jab. “They had seen some video which said that whoever who gets the vaccine would die within 2-3 years. We tried hard convincing them that doctors and health workers have also taken the vaccine,” said Shailaja.Also Read | Odisha reports 6,097 new Covid-19 cases; tally climbs to 837,226Aware of vaccine hesitancy, the medical team took 100 doses of Covishield with them on Wednesday. “We discussed the importance of testing and vaccination with the villagers of Mukundpur, Kailashpur and Rekhapadar. We hope they realise the gravity of the situation and get jabbed,” said block programme officer Kalpana Mishra.Health officials have also faced stiff resistance from the villagers over Covid testing. A few days ago, a medical team in Kolnara block was driven away after it arrived for Covid testing in Goudalelibadi vilage. Two persons in the village had earlier tested positive for Covid-19.Rayagada district collector Saroj Mishra said vaccine hesitancy is a matter of worry. “While vaccine hesitancy has come down among Niyamgiri’s Dongaria Kondhs, a particularly vulnerable tribal groups, it is still there among other tribals. Many of the villagers are scared after seeing a fake video that claims people who get jabbed would die within two years,” said Mishra.So far 167,000 doses of vaccine have been administered in the district of which 132,000 were first doses. About 6,000 persons in the age group of 18-45 have also taken the vaccine in the district. The district collector said that at least one third of the total number of Dongaria Kondh tribals have taken the jab since last month.Facebook’s Covid-19 Symptom Survey in India last month showed that India’s vaccine hesitancy rate is around 28.7% with variations across states and Union Territories. To be sure, while overall vaccine supplies may be there at the state level, individual vaccination centres may run out of stock on account of how the states manage their replenishments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tribals-in-odisha-village-flee-to-avoid-covid-vaccine-jab-101623332238400.html

Not only that but she also actively helped people with supplies of medical oxygen, plasma, blood and beds during the peak of Covid-19 in Mumbai.Recognising her role in helping those in dire need, police commissioner Hemant Nagrale facilitated the honour upon her."Last year we were about to celebrate my daughter's birthday when I learnt about Dnyani Vidyalaya in Raigad's Waje taluka. I spoke to the principal and he invited us. The kids mostly come from poor backgrounds. Some of them didn't even have footwear. We used up the money saved for my daughter's birthday and Eid shopping to help them," a national daily recently quoted Rehana as saying.One day when she got a call for help from a police constable who was struggling to get an injection for his mother in 2020, she helped him out by arranging for the crucial medical aid after making a few calls. This, she said, encouraged her to help people in whatever way she could.The social worker had joined the police force as a constable in 2000. In addition to a compassionate asset to the police force, she is also a volleyball player and an athlete. She won silver and gold medals in these sports in 2017, when she represented her force in a competition organised in Sri Lanka, the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/rehana-shaikh-aka-mother-theresa-who-helped-patients-get-beds-o2-felicitated-by-police-101623327460895.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||Provide relief to alleviate financial burden on airports: Operators urge government||The Association of Private Airport Operators (APAO) on Wednesday said that airport operators are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to sustain operations. APAO specified that airports require relief measures not only to ensure sustaining operations but also to save jobs and allow economic recovery of the airport. It also stated that the first two waves have made it difficult for the operators to survive and the third wave will allow continued muted traffic in FY 2022 as well. APAO, which represents airports at Mumbai, upcoming Navi Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Lucknow, Mangaluru, Ahmedabad and Kochi, stated that due to the pandemic, the cash flow situation is ‘precarious’ and that the government needs to provide some relief measures to the airport operators. The onset of the second wave of Covid-19 has further compounded the crisis and according to APAO, domestic passenger traffic has dropped to less than 18-25% of pre-Covid levels.According to APAO, air traffic is barely expected to reach the FY 2021 level in the much predicted third wave, which itself was not adequate for the financial survival of airports.“Airports have to incur fixed costs for maintaining and operating its infrastructure such as runways, taxiways, apron, parking bays, and terminal buildings etc. In airports, of total costs incurred, 80-85% of it is fixed costs. While on one side revenues have dried up, on the other hand, airports have to continue incurring high fixed costs. Airports are the worst affected in the aviation sector,” a statement from APAO read.It also said airports are not generating sufficient cash flow to sustain operations and meet debt obligations. The organisation stated that poor cash flows and consequently downgraded credit ratings have made it impossible for airports to take further financing support from financial institutions. It also stated that airports generate jobs for skilled and unskilled categories in big numbers and help the economy. “With stress on the finances, there is a worry that many of these jobs will be lost. This is the reason, many countries are supporting by giving part wages to these workers, like Germany and France,” APAO said. “Airport revenue generation is directly linked to traffic levels. It is important for the government to understand that along with airlines, airports are also in dire straits. If the situation continues airports will find it difficult to sustain even day to day operations. Job losses would be across all departments of airports. Every lost passenger is a loss not just to airports but to the retailers in airport terminals, the taxis and rideshare drivers etc. and any other airport business that relies on airports and the passengers they serve,” said Satyan Nayar, secretary-general of APAO.As per forecasts by international agencies, the global passenger traffic will not return to pre-Covid-19 levels until 2023-24. “As the cash flow situation is precarious, airports have been requesting the government amidst an extremely challenging environment to provide some relief measures to the airport operators which will directly alleviate the financial burden for airports. Relief measures are required not only to ensure sustaining operations at airports but also needed to save jobs and allow economic recovery of the airport sector,” APAO concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/provide-relief-to-alleviate-financial-burden-on-airports-operators-urge-government-101623329416182.html

10-06-2021||Bangalore||BS Yediyurappa stays chief minister, says BJP’s Arun Singh ahead of Karnataka visit||There is no proposal or even a discussion to change Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Arun Singh said on Thursday. Singh’s statement is seen as a renewed effort to stamp out the swirling rumours about the future of the 78-year-old BJP veteran in Karnataka’s top seat.“(BS) Yediyurappa is the chief minister, is doing good work and will remain the chief minister,” Arun Singh, Rajya Sabha member and national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka said in Delhi on Thursday, describing suggestions that there was talk of changing the chief minister as “imaginary”.He also showered praises on the Yediyurappa government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, something that has been cited by the chief minister’s critics to attack him.Singh, who is expected to travel to Karnataka next week, also delivered a warning to Yediyurappa’s many detractors within the party, declaring that the party was ready to listen to anyone with grievances but could not allow them to criticise the chief minister in public.The senior BJP leader’s support for BS Yediyurappa comes at a time when the BJP is trying to stop his critics within the party from targeting the chief minister. Over the last few days and weeks, several state leaders within the BJP have sought Yediyurappa’s exit over allegations of corruption, mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic and charges that his son, BY Vijayendra, runs a parallel administration under the aegis of his father.Several ministers and legislators have made several trips to Delhi to complain against the chief minister as well as seek his ouster.The statements had added to the challenges of the saffron outfit, whose image was getting dented in the process, prompting the state unit to finally take some action against those speaking out.On Monday, the Karnataka BJP issued gag orders, restricting its ministers, legislators and party workers from speaking out against the chief minister.However, the party is yet to take any action against Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand legislator from Bijapur city, who has repeatedly levelled charges of corruption against Yediyurappa and his family over the last six months.CP Yogeshwar, Karnataka’s minister for tourism, environment and ecology, has also visited Delhi and sought a change in leadership as well as indicating that Yediyurappa’s son was wielding power in the minister’s home district of Ramanagara.The expression of support from the BJP’s state and central leadership comes days after Yediyurappa announced on Sunday that he was ready to step down as chief minister if the high command told him to do so. Yediyurappa’s assertion, which came as a surprise, was interpreted by many to imply that he had reached an agreement with the top brass to continue in power.On Thursday, Arun Singh reiterated the state unit’s order prohibiting state leaders from attacking the chief minister. Singh said no one within the party should speak out against the chief minister and instead, should focus on Covid-19 relief.“I am going to listen and talk to anyone who has grievances,” Singh said, referring to his upcoming visit to Karnataka.“Such statements (attacking Yediyurappa) are given by one or two people. But my opinion is that no one should give such statements in public. If anyone has any such things to say, I am going to hear it. But such public statements should not be given by anyone. Those who have given such statements, I will definitely talk to them asking why they did so,” Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/yediyurappa-stays-chief-minister-says-bjp-s-arun-singh-ahead-of-karnataka-visit-101623328756671.html

Then, further speed up the vaccination according to the guidelines of the central government,” he said.The Covid situation in all 75 districts of the state was under control and the recovery rate had touched 98% now, he said.The positivity rate was a mere 0.3% in the state, and only 642 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours, he said. He also said a total of 1,231 people recovered and were discharged from hospitals in the same period.“Yesterday (Wednesday), no district reported more than 38 fresh Covid cases, which is a good sign towards the falling Covid infection rate. So far, 16.67 lakh people in the state recovered from Covid (since March last year) and currently the state has 12,244 active cases,” he said.The chief minister asked the medical corporation of the state to buy and procure medicines for Covid keeping in mind their quality, packaging, and smooth supply.“Make sure that all medicines are bought at the company rates and the system should be transparent,” he said.Increase capacity of dialysis units in all districts: CMThe chief minister asked officials to increase the capacity of dialysis units in all the districts and make efforts to establish more blood banks.Dialysis is a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluids from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly. It often involves diverting blood to a machine to be cleaned.“Increase the capacity of such dialysis units that are running on PPP (public-private partnership),” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yogi-asks-up-officials-to-administer-over-a-million-covid-vaccine-doses-daily-in-july-101623328155851.html

Raut, who is currently touring north Maharashtra, said this when reporters asked him if the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is planning to project leaders from the state as the face in the Maharashtra elections.“I do not go by the media reports. There is no official statement on this. The BJP owes its success to Narendra Modi for the last seven years and currently he is the top leader of the country and his party,” the parliamentarian said.The Rajya Sabha leader’s statement comes days after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and PM Narendra Modi held a one-on-one meeting for 30 minutes. The meeting between both leaders led to several speculations in political circles but Sena leaders said that Uddhav and PM Modi discussed the issue of nomination of 12 members to the Legislative Council and other political issues.“Yes, we had a separate meeting. We may not be politically together, but that does not mean that we have snapped our relationship. I did not go to meet Nawaz Sharif. There is nothing wrong in meeting Modiji in person,” the chief minister had said.Raut also said that the Prime Minister belongs to the nation and not to any particular party citing that administration may get affected if the Prime Minister gets involved in electoral campaigns.“ The PM should not get involved in election campaigning as it puts pressure on the official machinery,” Raut further added.

Namgia, the last border village, has been declared a containment zone after 36 new cases were detected in a day recently. Also read: Mixed cropping gaining ground in rural ChambaThe annual trade is carried out through the pass from June to November. Traders, mostly from the tribal districts of Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur in the state adjoining China, start registering themselves in May. “So far, there has been no communication from the central government on the trade,” says Jiya Ram Abhilashi, the general manager at the department of industry in Kinnaur. “Normally, after registration for trade, credentials of traders are verified by different agencies,” he said. The traditional trade between India and China has seen many ups and downs. Bilateral trade through Shipki La reopened in 1993 after it was shut due to the Indo-China war in 1962. Shipki La is a mountain pass that connects Kinnaur district to the Tibetan Autonomous Region in China. It’s a border post at 18,599 feet. It is through this pass that the turbulent Sutlej enters India from China-occupied Tibet. Need more facilities to continue trade “Due to the Covid-19 cases, trade is not feasible at present, but if the pandemic subsides in future, we will urge the government to resume the trade. The last two years have been tough,” says Hishey Negi, the president of the Kinnaur-based Indo-China Trade Association. The traders have been seeking more facilities along the border, including a trade centre at Chupan. The government identified land for its construction, but work is yet to start. “The government needs to add more facilities otherwise this trade will die a gradual death. It will not enthuse the younger generation,” says Jiya Lal Negi, a resident of another border village, Chitkul. 29 items imported from China Twenty-nine items are imported from China, including wool, raw silk, yak hair, China clay, borax, butter, common salt, horse, goat, sheep, readymade garments, shoes, quilts, blankets, carpets, and local herbal medicines. Trade suffered a setback when the Indian government banned the import and export of livestock that was a major component of trade in 2012 due to lack of quarantine facility for animals. Livestock comprised a major portion of cross-border trade. Traders imported chigu goats reared for wool and meat in China-controlled Tibet, while Chamurthi horses, known for their sturdiness, were popular among Indian traders.

The panel also met 150 party leaders, including present and ex-state unit presidents, ministers, MPs and other leaders who voiced their suggestions and grievances.The panel also spoke to Amarinder Singh about the Bargari sacrilege case and Kotkapura firing probe which were earlier raised by several party leaders, including Punjab MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu. The former cricketer on June 1 met the Congress panel and accused Amarinder Singh of shielding the Badal family in the sacrilege case, police firing and blamed the chief minister for a botched-up probe in the Kotkapura case.“My stand remains unchanged, I feel that the democratic power of people which goes to the government in the form of taxes should go back to the people.

The bank branch is barely a kilometre from the town and women police stations and quite close to Union minister Nityanand Rai’s residence. This is the 13th such incident in the last 18 months in the state and criminals have looted ₹2.30 crore from different banks, according to an official at the state police headquarters. According to the police, armed robbers walked into the bank at around 10.30am while there were about ten people, including customers, inside. The robbers had covered their faces with masks and wore gloves.Also Read | 31 engg colleges, 38 polytechnic institutes set up in last 15 yrs, says Bihar CMAs per an eyewitness account, a robber brandished a gun, threatening everyone against raising an alarm.

10-06-2021||Delhi||Yuvraj Singh on #Mission1000Beds: It’s our opportunity to come together in this war against Covid||Known to always lend a helping hand to those in need, one couldn’t expect Yuvraj Singh to not step up and do his bit especially during a global crisis. As the country reels under the second wave of Covid-19, Singh’s foundation, YouWeCan, recently launched #Mission1000Beds — a hospital capacity expansion solution to rapidly scale up the Covid-19 critical care facilities across India. In a chat with us, the former Indian cricketer tells us how did this all start, what it is aimed at and how the past year has been for him dealing with the pandemic.It has been a year and a half since the pandemic hit. How have you dealt with all the changes, the new normal?Well, Covid-19 has affected everyone directly or indirectly. Initially, it was a bit challenging, as adapting to anything takes time, but I believe the quicker you adapt the better the process becomes in every sphere of life. In this challenging time, I, along with my team, tried to help as many as we can to mitigate the catastrophic situation through all the possible ways. Last year with our foundation YouWeCan, we mobilised resources towards providing over 1 million hygiene kits to Covid affected states across the country. We also worked closely with the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, UNICEF & WHO on running multiple Covid 19 awareness campaigns throughout the year.Given the uncertainties and anxiety amid such gloomy times, topped with negative news everywhere, what has been your coping mechanism?A solution driven ecosystem has always been my coping mechanism. With the devastation happening around where people are losing their loved ones, I couldn’t think of anything else other than extending my help, resources to the affected families where they can access healthcare infrastructure easily at a time like this. The best way to cope with anything orbits around finding the solution and dealing with it. Did this period give you enough time to look back and reflect and introspect into your life? Any learnings or realisations?Yes, times like this always give either the lessons or reasons to reflect back. Though I always introspect time and again, but times like these make you see things from the lens of gratefulness for the family and friends around you. I believe, staying strong, giving warmth and being kind, the need of the hour for everyone. Your initiative Mission 1000 Beds has gained momentum ever since YWC launched it earlier this month. How did this idea come about? What was the trigger?All of us have lost loved ones and also witnessed countless cases of people struggling for oxygen, ICU beds and other critical care facilities required to combat COVID. I have been deeply impacted by this, too, and felt that we all need to step up to support our healthcare providers and the central as well as state governments who are all working tirelessly. So, we launched #Mission1000Beds — a hospital capacity expansion solution, which will rapidly scale up the Covid-19 critical care facilities across India.The second wave of COVID-19 crisis saw human life suffer than ever before. How is this initiative aimed at ensuring the basics to those battling the virus?With this initiative, we aim to strengthen the capacity of government, Army, autonomous and charitable hospitals by setting up oxygenated beds, ventilators and BiPAP machines, along with other essential medical equipment which is required for critical care of COVID-19 patients. Not only will these enhance the current capacity of the hospitals, but will continue to serve patients for 10 years and beyond. By fulfilling this immediate requirement, we also envision to enhance the healthcare infrastructure in other spheres in near future.This activity has already been initiated in Delhi NCR, Punjab, Haryana, UP, J&K, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Telangana, Karnataka & MP while various other cities in different states are also being looked at. We aim to strengthen the existing capacity of hospitals by 10%-15% so that they can cater to more COVID affected patients and save more lives. These facilities will have the capacity to serve 6000 patients a month. Moreover, post COVID the facility will continue to serve patients requiring critical care. What results have you witnessed so far since the initiative #Mission1000Beds was launched?It’s been a successful initiative, while we had started with a target of 1000 beds, we have already received requests for more than 2000 beds from hospitals across the country and we see this number going up. This is our opportunity to come together in this war against COVID. I urge others to join this initiative too. Our actions today will go a long way in saving countless lives. We are very grateful for all the support we are receiving from family, friends, fellow colleagues, entrepreneurs, organisations, Individuals and many more.Amid this second wave of the pandemic, we’ve seen how social media has come to people’s rescue like never before with everyone stepping up and responding to SOS calls. How are you using social media to make #Mission1000Beds reach more people?Social media has been a great platform to spread the word since most of us are on it and the reach is really high. One of the most effective bridges to connect with people and deliver the message. Social media contributes a major role in extending help especially at a time like this. With multiple platforms today, we have communicated at each social media handle to create awareness as much as we could.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/yuvraj-singh-on-mission1000beds-it-s-our-opportunity-to-come-together-in-this-war-against-covid-101623323115967.html
10-06-2021||Chandigarh||Missing the vaccine bus to catching coronavirus||The day senior citizens became eligible for vaccination, our daughter, who is a doctor, informed us that she had registered us for vaccination. The next morning, I woke up early and got ready but was surprised to find my husband still in bed because usually he is the one who is eager to visit our granddaughters in the city. What perplexed me further was that there were no signs of anything having been plucked from the vegetable garden. Knowing how our granddaughters love sandwiches and burgers stuffed with crunchy greens, Nanu, as they address him, has a small corner reserved to grow lettuce, broccoli, spring onions and cucumbers just for them. No chemical sprays are allowed near this patch. He tends this garden lovingly and packs the veggies for the girls an evening prior to a planned visit. One look at his face and I knew it was time for me to brace against the impending encounter. When you have been in a marriage for half a century, you know that the best way to weather a storm is to lie low and flat on the ground, pretending to be lifeless. This was not the first time that I was standing in His Highness’ court to face the charges. The torrent of words was actually a lament. “How I wish that the children had not inherited your impatience and impulsiveness. What is the hurry to get vaccinated? This disease afflicts those living in crowded cities and not those who live in farmhouses amid green fields brimming with oxygen.” “But our age...” Leaving my sentence dangling in the air, he left the room to call our daughter to inform her that we were not coming. Before her second call came after a week, her father was well prepared with his arsenal. He had myriad references gathered from news channels and social media platforms, whose purpose seemed to be to malign the manufacturer and cite the dangers and lack of efficacy of the vaccine. What exactly transpired between father and daughter is not clear, but I could see him wearing a smug smile which I recognise as a winner’s smile after he razes an opponent to the ground. The third call came two days later, and I overheard my daughter telling Dad that she was coming to pick up her mother to get her vaccinated. He retorted, “So, I’ve not been wrong when I felt that you loved your mother more than me. Anyway, have patience for a few more days as Sputnik V is on its way to India and both of us will take that vaccine together.” Sputnik V has arrived but there has been no call from our daughter. According to the guidelines, Covid patients have to wait for three months after recovery to receive a vaccine. So here we are, monitoring our oxygen saturations and blowing the white, green and yellow balloons provided to us in the Punjab health department’s Covid Fateh Kits after we tested positive for coronavirus. aswantkaur@yahoo.com The writer is a Tarn Taran-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/missing-the-vaccine-bus-to-catching-coronavirus-101623322995963.html
10-06-2021||Other||Taste of life: Eggscellent page turner, from back in the day, has Poona rice cooking||At the National Library in Kolkata, I have a small heap of vintage cookbooks on my desk. Many of them have yellowed pages. Pages so brittle I am afraid to touch them. The books belong to the Raj era and have recipes written by memsahibs, travellers and army officers. One of the books has only a number to identify it with. The original jacket and the first 42 pages of the book are missing. The catalogue says that it was titled “Receipts from our Camp” and was written by one Mrs E in 1902. There is no other information to identify the book and the author with. The missing pages would have contained menus, “Bazaar lists” and “lists of dishes”, as was the tradition those days. I flip through the book. There are recipes for chutneys and jams and curries and “cold meat cookery”. There are soups and salads and entrees. There are recipes for Madras sauce and Bombay sauce. Most of the dishes are European, few Anglo-Indian. The recipes are succinct. The author does not elaborate on certain cooking techniques and ingredients. Perhaps Mrs E did not intend this cookbook for unaccomplished cooks.Where did Mrs E live, I wonder. Deolali? Ambala? Madras? I try looking for hints. Certain ingredients, Bazaar lists often tell the readers about the geography of the recipe. Cookbooks in the Raj era made sure their readers knew when and where to buy the ingredients. But Mrs E does not let me have the pleasure of finding out where she lived and which Camp the recipes came from. The ingredients are all generic. She does not mention which variety of rice to use for cooking a pilaf, where to buy the tamarind she has used in cooking the Madras curry. Perhaps she did write this in the Bazaar lists, but those pages are now missing.On page 86 are recipes for eggs. “Substitutes for meat are specially required at present and none are better than well-prepared eggs. There are at least 150 ways of serving eggs. Every cook has their own ideas of boiling, but an expert recommends a bain-marie or water bath. Thermometer”, the author says, “should be used and the water surrounding the egg must be kept at or near 180 deg Fahrenheit, the time of immersion being ten or twelve minutes.”What does the author mean by “at present”? Was there a war going on? Or, perhaps a famine?“Eggs cooked in this way”, the author declares, “are tender and delicate, even so through-out; no part being hard while another is semi-raw and slimy. An egg immersed in boiling water from two to three and a half minutes is very soft-boiled, three to four minutes soft, five minutes medium, and eight to ten minutes hard. Though professional cooks consider this the best way of doing them the result of cooking the eggs is some times disappointing. The fault is due to the freshness of the egg, of which the white is rather watery in substance.”While reading the introduction of the section, I realise that the font, spacing and writing style has now changed. In fact, the earlier sections of the cookbook did not have any introduction at all. There is an easily noticeable difference between the previous recipes and the recipes which follow page number 86. The pages are thinner too. These are two books bound together.This is intriguing. Why were two different cookbooks bound together? Is this an honest mistake on the part of the library? The sizes of both the books are identical after all. Or, there’s a possibility that these books were owned by somebody else; they bound the remains of two books together and donated them as a single book to the library.I take my query to the librarian and she is intrigued as well. I go back to my desk and to the two–in–one cookbook. There are recipes for Fried eggs with savoury chestnut puree, Eggs a la Santos, Fricassee of eggs with mushrooms, Eggs a la Nesselrode, Eggs with tomatoes and Fried eggs with savoury rice. This last recipe tells me that the author of the second cookbook might have lived in Poona.The author of the second cookbook asks the readers to use “Poona rice” while cooking Fried eggs with savoury rice - Cook 4 oz. of Poona rice in about a pint of rich stock, add enough reduced tomato sauce to colour it, then add two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, and two slices of fried bacon cut into small strips. Season to taste with salt, and reduce a little until sufficiently firm to shape. Melt about an ounce of butter in an omelet pan, and fry in it five or six fresh eggs; trim each neatly, or else stamp out with a plain round pastry cutter. Put the rice in a buttered flat mould, press it in well, and turn out quickly on to a hot dish. Place the fried eggs in the form of a circle on the rice shape, then put a tiny pinch of red or black pepper in the centre of each yolk of egg, and serve hot.Raj cookbooks often use Patna rice or Madras rice (the Seeraga samba variety) to cook several dishes. This mention of Poona rice is very rare. Both Ambemohor and Indrayani are referred to as Poona rice in the Southern and Northern parts of India. Which of these varieties did the author use to cook the dish?Poona rice is mentioned again in the last section of this second book in another recipe named “Savoury rice with vegetables”. This recipe is very close to that of Masalebhat, a popular rice preparation in Maharashtra. The author uses potatoes and cauliflower in the dish along with pepper, cinnamon and cloves. The vegetables, spices and rice are fried in butter.The inclusion of this recipe (and that of Poona rice) means that the author of the second cookbook most probably spent at least some time in Poona. There are no other mentions of geographic locations from India in the book.I have not been able to trace Mrs E or the author of the second cookbook. Perhaps she wrote the second cookbook too, and that’s why the two books ended together. In that case, Mrs E lived in Poona Camp and the recipes from the first cookbook belonged there.These are speculations. Or possibilities. I wish someday I am able to find copies of those books with all the pages intact. That would lead us to Mrs E. And to the author of the second cookbook.Chinmay Damle is a research scientist and food enthusiast. He writes here on Pune’s food culture.

They were arrested on Monday based on the inputs from military intelligence.A police officer said they have seized over 900 subscriber identification module (SIM) cards and a device, which could operate 32 of them at a time, from the two. “They were converting international calls into local calls, bypassing the authorised routers.

10-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers say hike in kharif crops minimum support price is peanuts||Punjab farmers on Thursday said that the Centre’s increase in the minimum support price (MSP) for kharif crops was peanuts at a time when the state’s agricultural sector was faced with an economic crisis.On Wednesday, the cabinet committee on economic affairs announced revised MSPs for summer-sown crops amid the ongoing farmers’ agitation for scrapping the three farm laws and offering a legal backing for MSPs.Also Read: Govt hikes MSP for kharif crops, skews them toward scarce itemsWith an increase of ₹72, the MSP of paddy (common) has been revised from ₹1,868 to ₹1,940, while grade-A paddy will be bought for ₹1,960 as compared to last year’s ₹1,888. Effecting an increase of ₹20, the MSP for maize has been increased from ₹1,850 to ₹1,870. Last year, the MSP for maize was increased by ₹90 and by ₹53 for paddy varieties.This year, the Centre has also mentioned ₹1,239 as cost of paddy production per quintal, while it is ₹1,246 in case of maize production.Formula adopted by Centre faulty: BKU leader BKU general secretary (Dakaunda) Jagmohan Singh said the committee adopts an outdated method to determine the MSP that ignores the formula recommended by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).“The formula adopted by the Centre is faulty as it has failed incorporate cost of labour, increase prices of diesel and rent of agriculture land while announcing fresh MSP,” Singh said.Terming the hike in paddy and maize prices a “mere joke”, he said it will not help farmers as the ground reality is different. “Though the government buys wheat and paddy on MSP, but farmers are getting nearly 50% of the MSP in the case of maize. This year, the maize was sold for ₹900- ₹1,000 per quintal against the MSP of ₹1,850,” he said.Manjit Singh from BKU’s Ugrahan faction said farmers have been asking the Centre to adopt the formula recommended by the National Commission on Farmers chairperson MS Swaminathan.“The production cost is much more than what’s mentioned by the Centre. Instead, the government should have provided an MSP that accounts for the basic cost incurred on production and an additional 50% profit,” he said.Economist calls for scientific approach Lakhwinder Singh Gill, a former professor of economics at Punjabi University, said that the Centre has come up with a meagre increase as the paddy MSP has been hiked by 3.85% but at the same time, the prices for diesel are up by 19% in the recent past.“The Centre has not adopted a scientific approach while proposing the pricing for different crops.The government has not fulfilled its poll promise of offering MSP on the C2 (comprehensive cost) and 50% profit,” he said.The C2 formula of calculating cost of cultivation includes the input cost of capital and the rent on the land to give farmers 50% returns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-farmers-say-hike-in-kharif-crop-msp-is-peanuts-101623316214976.html

These are also the most popular destinations in Bihar among foreign visitors.“But all this has become history now. Since one and a half years, there has been no tourism activity. Though the total lockdown was announced in March 2020, tourism activities started getting hit in December 2019 due to the coronavirus, and by January 2020, foreign tourists started leaving the country. Imagine the life of people who have been totally dependent upon domestic and foreign guests, sales of tour packages and local crafts. There has been no work and no earnings,” Kaulesh Kumar, the ABTO general secretary, said.The association is seeking interest-free long-term loans for tour operators and agencies; tourist transport operators and hotels along with a moratorium of 24 months for existing loan payments.“Hotel business or the entire hospitality sector is the worst affected by corona. Many hotels at the heritage city of Bodh Gaya are on the verge of closure,” Mrityunjay Kumar Rai, general manager of Hotel Anand International in Bodh Gaya and also an ABTO member, said. He said hoteliers are in dire need of a waiver of GST (goods and services tax) and exemption from payment of electricity bills, if they are to see through this crisis.ABTO’s Kaulesh Kumar said most of the hotels were facing a similar situation and the majority of travel agents and operators had shifted to other professions like farming, hawking of vegetables and even manual labour to sustain their families.“We have sent the letter not only to Suresh Prabhu, but a copy has also been sent to Union tourism minister Prahlad Singh Patel to take our requests and requirements to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), ‘’ he said.SK Singh, vice president, Tourism Association of Bihar is backing ABTO’s demand.Drawing attention to the plight of tourism transport operators, Shibani Bhattacharya, head of the ABTO secretariat, says they should be allowed to operate without commercial tourist car road permits for two years. “In fact many have taken property on lease, and as the pandemic and lockdown have stopped earnings, they are unable to pay back the lease money, “she said. She adds that those in the tourism business need financial support for the next two years.State tourism minister Narayan Prasad could not be contacted to comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihars-buddhist-tourism-sector-sends-sos-to-centre-demands-special-package-to-survive-101623316155128.html
10-06-2021||Lucknow||Newlyweds in this UP village have to plant a tree and nurture it as first born||Atul and Sandhya, became the first newlywed couple in Amni Lokipur village in Uttar Pradesh’s Kaushambi district, to plant a sapling with a pledge to nurture it as their first born and in the process set off a unique eco-conservation drive.All 3,700 residents of Amni Lokipur village of Mooratganj development block have resolved that every newly married couple in the village will henceforth enter their house only after planting the sapling of a shade and fruit giving tree, which they will also undertake to protect and nurture till maturity.“Ours is a small village... Over the years, our lush green village with a number of fruit and shade giving trees has lost much of its green cover as the size of farms and houses increased,” former gram pradhan of the village Swatantra Singh said. The ‘Nurture a tree like your first child’ initiative is Singh’s brainchild.Singh said most of the trees planted every year failed to reach maturity in the village owing to lack of proper care, noticing this he ran an information campaign on trees’ role in stabilising the soil and keeping the farmlands fertile. The villagers then jointly came up with the idea for newly-weds to plant and adopt a sapling.“If by any chance the sapling dies, the couple will have to plant a new one and repeat the pledge,” said Lakhan Lal, a marginal farmer and also the new village pradhan.26-years old Atul and 23-years old Sandhya planted the sapling of a Peepal tree on May 30 and said they planned to look after it “as long as we live”.June 16 and 21 will see two more newly-weds repeat the exercise, said Arvind Singh, the secretary of the Amni Lokipur gram panchayat.The village has recently been adopted by the Prayagraj-based Red Eagle Division of the Indian Army that has begun holding medical camps and training educated rural youths to work as nursing assistants in corona times.On June 5, the World Environment Day, the residents of the village along with the army personnel, planted 100 trees in two government-run schools and the teachers pledged to look after them as their kids. They also resolved to involve students in plant conservation.A serving army officer and a village native, Captain Sarvesh Kumar Tripathi said the initiative was more important for the values it would likely inculcate in the young and the kids, who would inherit it in future. “We hope every new beginning in not just Amni Lokipur but also nearby villages is marked by planting a tree,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/newlyweds-in-this-up-village-have-to-plant-a-tree-and-nurture-it-as-first-born-101623314474806.html

Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal said how the central government will supply these vaccins free of cost to all the adults remains a big question.The announcement about free vaccines was made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on Monday. The Union health ministry, which issued guidelines in this regard, said that the allocation of doses to states and union territories (UTs) will be based on their population, burden of the viral disease and progress of their vaccination drive.Also Read| Centre releases revised Covid-19 vaccination drive guidelines“The central government said that after June 21, it will supply vaccines free of cost in the country. The government has done this after the order of the Supreme Court. Better late than never. But even after June 21, where will the vaccines come from is a big question. There is a severe shortage of doses,” Kejriwal said while addressing reporters after he inspected the construction of an oxygen storage tank near Siraspur.The chief minister on May 26 attacked the Centre over its decision to export vaccine doses to other countries rather than inoculating their own citizens. Kejriwal said the impact of the second wave of the pandemic would have been less and so many people would not have succumbed to the viral disease if vaccination was done on time.केंद्र सरकार ने कहा है कि 21 जून के बाद वो पूरे देश में वैक्सीन फ्री सप्लाई करेगी, केंद्र सरकार ने ये सुप्रीम कोर्ट के आदेश के बाद और दबाव में किया है लेकिन देर आए, दुरुस्त आए। लेकिन 21 जून के बाद भी वैक्सीन कहां से आएगी ये बहुत बड़ा सवाल है, वैक्सीन की भारी कमी है: दिल्ली CM pic.twitter.com/6YZ9Z6FLOuDelhi has so far inoculated 5,732,699 beneficiaries against Covid-19 till now.

He said the Delhi government plans to vaccinate all eligible beneficiaries above the age of 45 in the next one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/after-centre-announces-free-covid-vaccines-to-states-kejriwal-asks-a-question-101623312648715.html

10-06-2021||Chandigarh||Mixed cropping gaining ground in rural Chamba||Farmers in rural Chamba district are reaping benefits of the traditional and time-tested mixed cropping method, also called nau-anaj (nine crops). Under this farming system, nine crops are grown in the same field. They are a combination of lentils, cereals, vegetables, legumes and creepers. The maturity time, water and nutrient requirement of the crops is different. This indigenous practice provides natural resistance from crop diseases, infestations and droughts. Also read: Govt hikes MSP for kharif crops, skews them toward scarce itemsChamba project director of the Agriculture Technology Management Agency (ATMA), Dinesh Kumar says, “More than 10,000 farmers have switched to the ecological farming technique under the Prakritik Kheti Khushal Kisan Scheme since 2018. Unlike the mono-cultural system, farmers are going for mixed crops of maize, French beans, wheat, black gram, black lentils, kidney beans, horse gram, cucumber, bottle gourd, brinjal, tomato and cowpea.” 935 hectares under mixed cropping At present, 935 hectares in the district are under mixed cropping. The crops grown by this technique are chemical-free and the soil and groundwater safe. It helps earthworms and other micro-organisms thrive and they play a key role in cycling nutrients. A benefit of mixed cropping is that if any kind of damage is caused to one crop, the co-crop compensates for it as the moisture in the soil remains intact even during the dry season due to the crop cover. Subsidy of ₹25,000 to each farmer To promote natural farming, the management agency is providing a subsidy of ₹25,000 to each farmer who switches over to this technique to buy an indigenous cow. Apart from it, ₹5,000 is being given for the transportation of the cow besides ₹2,000 as market fee. An amount of ₹8,000 is being given for concreting and pitting of cowshed to collect cow urine and ₹2,250 for drums for preparing various inputs and their storage. Besides, ₹10,000 is being given to each family for opening resource stores. “This financial year, ₹1.32 crore is being spent under the scheme in the district,” Kumar says, adding that training camps for farmers are being held besides a food security group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mixed-cropping-gaining-ground-in-rural-chamba-101623308717630.html

I have not taken my jab yet.” Part of a “Roko Toko (stop and remind) Campaign” to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the area, the action has triggered an uproar. Residents say the administration should first ensure proper availability of vaccines before humiliating them in public. “People are not getting vaccinated as there is a limited supply of vaccines in the district. It is wrong to blame the public for that,” said Rudra Pratap Singh, a local resident.To be sure, while overall vaccine supplies may be there at the state level, individual vaccination centres may run out of stock on account of how the states manage their replenishments.Also Read | Bhopal unlocking from today: Markets to open, night curfew to continueNiwari sub-divisional police officer Santosh Patel justified the campaign. “As the unlock process has started so it is our duty to contain the spread of the virus.

Patel said vaccination is the only way to avoid the third wave. “Our motive is not to humiliate people but to (create awareness). ...we (are also) honouring people who are getting vaccinated (by giving them tri-colour badges).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mp-police-put-notices-with-skull-mark-around-necks-of-unvaccinated-people-101623308715132.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||Medical exams begin in Maharashtra amid opposition from students||The second and third year exams for medical, dental and diploma courses for undergraduate students in Maharashtra started nearly six months behind schedule on Thursday, with nearly 40,000 students expected to physically write the exams at designated centres between June 10 and 30.“As if the pandemic was not enough, incessant rains across several districts of Maharashtra, have affected basic travel facilities available to the students. However, our state government is insistent on conducting these exams in the offline mode, putting thousands of lives at risk,” said a student on condition of anonymity.For the past few days, many students have taken to social media sites to share their anger and fear and alleged they were being “forced” to appear for exams in the offline mode despite Maharashtra still registering some of the highest numbers of Covid-19 cases in the country daily.“Students share hostel rooms and bathrooms, which is leading to greater fear of [the infection spreading] among the students. While the examination authorities are insisting on safety protocols at the examination centres, no one is demanding the same at hostels where students are staying and this could lead to chaos,” claimed another student.Usually scheduled in the month of December-January, the second and third year MBBS, BDS, and other para medical and certificate course exams were postponed three times this year due to the rising number of Covid-19 cases recorded across the state. The papers were last postponed from April to June.Last week, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court heard a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by HERD Educational and Medical Research Foundation, a Nagpur-based NGO and a physiotherapy student Nitesh Dhanraj Tantarpale.The plea requested that the court order the state to either conduct examinations online or vaccinate nearly 40,000 undergraduates before holding the exams in the physical mode.Refusing to give interim relief from the upcoming winter session examinations, the court, however, directed the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) to issue an advisory to principals of various medical colleges across the state that it would be desirable that examinees produce a negative RT-PCR report along with the hall ticket when the examinations begin on June 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/medical-exams-begin-in-maharashtra-amid-opposition-from-students-101623307754363.html

This survey will also include children aged 6 years and above.In Varanasi, a total of 16 teams conducting the survey will collect 24 samples each from 31 identified rural and urban pockets, besides, 36 samples each from 18 slums in urban areas. These samples, including the 648 from the slums, will be sent to the microbiology department of the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) in Lucknow to arrive at the percentage of samples showing antibodies against the virus.Blood samples in a sero survey are tested for the presence of IgG (Immunoglobulin G) antibodies that determine a past infection due to the virus. Sero surveys are also important to determine whether the disease has entered the community transmission stage or not.Varanasi district surveillance officer Dr SS Kanaujia said each team engaged in the sero survey comprises a doctor, a lab technician, an Auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) and an Asha worker. They collected 408 out of the total 1392 samples on the first day of the drive.Chief medical officer Dr VB Singh said the health department divided the general population areas into 4 regions on the first day to ensure the samples were uniformly spread. Teams collected 6 samples from each identified region. They included two women and two men (adults) and two boys and girls in the age group of 5 to 17 years. Similarly, samples of 9 residents were taken from slum areas. These included 3 women and 3 men and 3 boys and girls in the age group of 5 to 17 years.The sero survey will give an indication of the spread of the disease within a community, which in turn will establish the level of herd immunity to the disease developed through antibodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid19-sero-survey-in-varanasi-aims-to-test-around-1400-samples-in-3-days-101623305834713.html

10-06-2021||Delhi||DU’s queer collectives come together to celebrate pride month||June is celebrated as pride month worldwide. The theme for 2021 is ‘ The Fight Continues’. “The theme can be interpreted in many ways; it can be fight against Covid, regressive laws against queer people, or fight against queer rights in general too,” says Suyash, president of Hindu College’s Queer Collective(QC), Delhi University.Pride month brings great zest, and is a month long celebration. “But, this year doesn’t feel like a celebration owing to the sad reality of Covid,” Suyash adds. This pride month is to be celebrated virtually, due to Covid-19 pandemic induced restrictions and lockdowns. The QC of Hindu College is coming up with a series of Insta lives touching on various topics, starting this weekend. Bringing on board film makers, who sensitively bring queer representation on screen, like Faraz Arif Ansari, Onir and Sridhar Rangayan, have been invited for talks every following weekend. Lastly, Queeristan: LGBTQ Inclusion in the Indian Workplace’s author Parmesh Shahani, to read a few excerpts from the book, and reflect on his work for queer community.For Faraz Arif Ansari this representation is very important. “As I always say, the more representation, the merrier! I remember when I was growing up; there was no representation, not on television, nor in films. So, starting my journey as a filmmaker, I knew I have to put out good representation for queer identities. It’s all about leaving behind a legacy of love and acceptance,” shares Ansari.With these sessions in place throughout the month, concluding the month will be a virtual pride in collaboration with queer collectives of Miranda House and Gargi College.President of Miranda House’s queer collective, Rio, doesn’t feel great about having pride online. For him, pride is supposed to be inclusive, intersectional and a safe space. “Being online and having a stable internet connection and a safe space in your own house to attend such events is a privilege that not everyone has,” he adds.Miranda house’s QC is also organising a movie screening of a short film called Devi:Godess by Karishma Dube, on June 12.Although, students are excited for a virtual pride too, as they get to showcase their work, interact with like-minded people and just to take a break. However, they miss the pride events that used to happen in the flesh. “A sense of euphoria is missing on the virtual pride. Physical pride celebration brings great energy on the field, creates visibility on a wide spectrum, and generates mobility among students. This can’t be replicated on any medium,” says Shubh Goel, president of SGGSCC’s QC.After the pride month, QC’s across Delhi NCR will also collectively contribute for a newsletter; called Fakhr, to document pride month. Featuring articles, poems, coming out stories and notable achievements of students. The newsletter will come out in the 2nd week of July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dus-queer-collectives-come-together-to-celebrate-pride-month-101623303135081.html

IMD officials, however, said that from Saturday, Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) is expected to received moderate rain, which will bring the temperatures down.On Thursday, the minimum temperature came down to 29°C. On Wednesday, the minimum temperature shot up to 31.4°C, four degrees above normal, and also the highest minimum temperature to be recorded this year.Also Read | Delhiwale: Landmark shop, down shuttersKuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that over the last two days, Delhi’s temperatures have been high because of a layer of dust over the region that trapped heat near the surface. “We received dust carrying winds from Rajasthan and Haryana on Tuesday. This layer of dust did not allow the surface to cool off, resulting in higher temperatures,” Srivastava said.He said that despite high temperatures, Delhi is still experiencing a below normal summer season. IMD forecast said that Delhi will start getting some relief from the heat from June 12. Under the impact of a low-pressure area forming on the north of the Bay of Bengal, the wind direction over Delhi will change to easterly from late Friday night, which will result in light rainfall in parts of Delhi and NCR. From Sunday, the intensity of rainfall will increase and as a result, the temperatures will also fall to below 40°C. “We are expecting moderate rainfall across Delhi and some parts of NCR can also receive heavy showers. From June 12, temperatures will start coming down again,” a senior IMD official confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-weather-another-hot-day-ahead-mercury-to-hover-around-42c-101623299654041.html

10-06-2021||Patna||Days after bodies were found floating in Ganga, Bihar sends samples for Covid-19 testing||Days after bodies were found floating in Ganga, pollution control officials in Bihar have sent samples collected from the river for Covid-19 testing. According to state pollution control board scientist Navin Kumar, the tests are being conducted to check whether the river has been contaminated with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) since there were reports of bodies of Covid-19 victims being dumped in Ganga. This comes after the central government took a strong note of the media reports of dead bodies floating in Ganga and called on the Bihar government to focus on preventing such incidents in the future.Also Read: Bodies of Covid-19 victims among those dumped in Ganga river: Govt"The sampling of Ganga river is a routine thing which we carry out on a regular basis. The pollution board keeps on investigating the quality of water of the Ganga river. But as you know that there were reports of bodies of Covid-19 victims disposed of in the river, so we are conducting tests to check whether the river has been contaminated with coronavirus or not," Kumar told news agency ANI. At least 71 bodies were fished out of the Ganga river in Bihar's Buxar district last month, after a large number of bloated and partially decomposed bodies were found floating in the river, triggering panic among locals and widespread outrage. Images of corpses drifting down a river which many in India consider holy had shocked a nation already reeling under successive waves of the coronavirus disease pandemic.The current investigation of the samples collected from Ganga is being undertaken by the National Mission for Ganga under the Jal Shakti ministry, in collaboration with the Indian Institute for Toxicological Research (IITR), Lucknow, which is a laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), state pollution control board, and the district administration.An expert team collected samples from Ganga on June 1 in Buxar and on June 5 in Patna, Bhojpur and Saran. The samples have been sent to Lucknow for Covid-19 testing, the reports of which are awaited, Kumar added.Taking a strong note of the "undesirable and alarming" media reports, the central government had on May 17 asked Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to prevent the dumping of dead bodies in Ganga and its tributaries. The direction to state governments to ensure safe disposal and dignified cremation of bodies had come straight from the 'Namami Gange' programme under the Union Jal Shakti ministry.The 'Namami Gange' mission aims to minimise pollution and amplify the conservation and rejuvenation of Ganga, the national river. However, with the reports of bodies floating in the river and potential contamination of the water as a result, the National human rights commission (NHRC) had issued notices to the Union Jal Shakti ministry, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar, after receiving complaints about the bodies.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/days-after-bodies-were-found-floating-in-ganga-bihar-sends-samples-for-covid-19-testing-101623294356502.html

This is apart from the ₹4-lakh compensation to kin of those who succumbed to Covid-19.Though the scheme, for widows above 18 years of age and who are not covered by the central scheme, the Indira Gandhi national pension scheme, is not new, the state’s social welfare department has worked overtime to enroll women widowed in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.The department has so far identified 2026 such widows, who lost their husbands and are from below poverty line (BPL) families, while 70% of them have also provided their bank account details for transfer of monthly pension of ₹400.“We will soon start disbursing the amount in their bank accounts so that they start getting their pension from June itself. We have the account numbers of 70% of the applicants, while efforts are on to complete the process for the rest also. Our team is working to enroll every needy person so that they get support,” said director, department of social welfare, Rajkumar.The Lakshmibai pension scheme covers widows below the age of 40 years who are not covered by the Indira Gandhi widow pension scheme of the Central government, which caters to women between 40-59 years from BPL families. The Lakshmibai Pension Yojana in Bihar covers all widows above 18 years of age whose annual family income is below ₹60,000.Patna has the highest number of widows due to Covid-19 at 176, followed by West Champaran (153), Begusarai (110), Muzaffarpur and Rohtas (95 each). The figures are still being compiled.The officer said that the effort was to facilitate the pension payment early in view of hardships faced by families. “In many cases, the officials visited the homes of the affected families to get the documentation process completed and bank accounts opened, if they were not there. The officials also helped families apply in the prescribed format. The department has continued with the process, as the chief minister wants that all needy women must get assistance,” he added.The Bihar government has also announced to provide ₹4 lakh as compensation to family of those who succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. According to a health department bulletin, the Covid-19 death toll has touched 5458 in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-to-start-pensions-for-2026-covid-19-widows-from-june-101623270790535.html

Bhullar and his associate, who had rewards of ₹10 lakh and ₹5 lakh, respectively, on their heads, were living in an apartment in an upscale locality there.A police officer, Kartick Mohan Ghosh, got injured when the fugitives opened fire at the police party. The West Bengal Police was in touch with their counterparts in Punjab after the STF got information about the gangsters from two men who were arrested near Siuri in Birbhum district on Sunday while they were trying to smuggle in a consignment of explosives and 9mm pistols from Bihar. “The Punjab police have confirmed that the deceased are Jaipal and Jaspreet. We were on the lookout for quite some time and were in touch with several agencies, including the Punjab Police. We went to the apartment to arrest them but had to open fire in self defence when they fired on us, injuring an inspector,” Vineet Goyal, additional director general of police, West Bengal STF, said. “We have recovered around ₹7 lakh in cash, five sophisticated pistols, including a Glock, and 89 rounds of ammunition from the apartment,” Goyal said.Jaipal was wanted in several states including Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh in connection with more than 45 cases involving murder, kidnapping, robbery and smuggling. Punjab director general of police Dinkar Gupta said following inputs from the Punjab police, the West Bengal STF swung into action, raided the apartment where the two were hiding and were subsequently killed. He said Punjab Police received a breakthrough with the arrest of one Bharat Kumar of Sahnewal, from near Shambhu Border in Rajpura on Wednesday, who revealed that both Jaipal and Jassi were holed up in a rented apartment in Kolkata. “I am grateful to West Bengal Police, especially the ADGP & STF chief Vineet Goyal, who acted fast on inputs provided by the Punjab Police,” said Gupta. According to the information, Jaipal was absconding since 2014 and during all these years, he had committed many crimes and was wanted in more than 25 cases.

So far, 14 notices have been issued in this regard.Dental surgeons were trained for RT-PCR, AYUSH doctors managed patients in home isolation, and only one intensivist managed the ICUs.In the absence of any public tertiary care hospital, and Chandigarh’s Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) refusing to take patients during the beginning of the pandemic, Panchkula had to make last-minute arrangements. Tie-ups were done with private hospitals, 20-bed ICUs in general hospitals were made functional, and a molecular lab was set up.General hospital alone unable to deal with caseloadPanchkula civil surgeon Dr Jasjit Kaur, who took charge a few weeks ahead of the pandemic, said: “As the general hospital alone was not adequately equipped to deal with tertiary care patients, we had to heavily rely on the private sector.”She said that if there was a public tertiary care institution in the district, they would not have to rope in the private sector for ICU support. “For tertiary care, if not 100%, then about 80% dependency was there on the private hospitals, because the general hospital could take only 18-20 patients in ICUs,” she said.The Panchkula district has only 109 doctors under regular category and hardly 15-20 on outsourcing under the National Health Mission. There are 25 dental surgeons, 103 staff nurses, 13 nursing sisters, 27 lab technicians, and Group D is 253.Dr Kaur said that they need “at least double the number of specialists and triple the number of nurses. There is a great shortage of staff nurses. We would have done much better had we had adequate manpower and infrastructure.”Admitting that the number of staff was “too less”, Dr Kaur said: “I am always told that you (Panchkula) have surplus staff, when compared to other districts of Haryana. We have struggled and only we know how we tried to manage.”Dental surgeons, students trained for testingDr Kaur shared how in the absence of enough manpower, they had to train dental surgeons, dental students, even nurses for RT-PCR and sampling.There was only one intensivist, whereas at least five are needed: “So, we had to train anaesthetists to do this job. Even though we did not have staff nurses trained for ICU, we didn’t have ICU technicians, physicians for ICU.”Dr Kaur said: “We kind of improvised, whatever we could do, but yes, health infrastructure in terms of beds, tertiary care, manpower could not be said to be enough for this pandemic.”She added: “All said and done, private hospitals have done a wonderful job in saving many lives. Let’s not be immediately thankless to them.”Panhckula MLA Gian Chand Gupta said: “In 2015, 25 acre land in MDC-5 was approved for construction of a medical college, but preference changed after the Prime Minister started promoting AYUSH hospitals. We allotted 20-acre space for an AYUSH hospital, and its construction is about to begin.”“For tertiary care services, we are going to have two more big private hospitals. Soon, auction will be held. As far as the medical college is concerned, in the next two years, work will begin, as CM had once mentioned about it,” he added.The virtual foundation stone of the 200-bed mother and child care block at the Sector 6 civil hospital will be laid by the chief minister on June 10 at 11am, and will be showcased from the PWD Rest House, Panchkula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pandemic-exposes-loopholes-in-panchkula-s-public-health-care-system-101623269830412.html
10-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Many bars still closed, but Sukhna Lake, Elante Mall report good response||Even though the Chandigarh administration has allowed bars in the city to reopen with up to 50% seating capacity, many outlets remained closed on Tuesday even as a moderate rush of people was seen at the Sukhna Lake and at the Elante Mall.Chapter head of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) and proprietor of Pyramid at Elante Mall, Sunveer Sondhi, said, “We welcome the orders of the Chandigarh administration, but we didn’t open on Tuesday. Most of the staff had gone back to their native villages, so many places are facing manpower crunch.” He added that they will open within the next few days.President of the Chandigarh Restaurants and Hotels Association and proprietor of Hotel Metro in Sector 43, Arvinder Pal Singh, said, “The staff haven’t been paid for April in many places and with bank instalments and EMIs pending, many places will first see what kind of a response bars receive before recalling their staff back in full strength.”While Social in Sector 7 opened up on Tuesday, director Manish Goel said, “Social had remained open for deliveries due to which we already had some staff at hand, which is why we were able to reopen from Tuesday itself.”Since it was one of the few bars open in the city, Goel reported that many customers had to be turned away due to the 50% occupancy limit enforced by the administration.Residents come for morning walk at SukhnaMany morning walkers were seen on Tuesday morning as the Sukhna Lake opened up for visitors. UT adviser Manoj Parida was also spotted in the morning, walking with a cane and clicking pictures.Many of the old regulars, however, said they will wait a few days before returning back to their schedule. As per Ajay Jagga, who would earlier come for walks everyday: “Just because the government has given us some relaxations doesn’t mean we should abuse them. People should still exercise restraint and avoid going out until its necessary.”Local area councillor Maheshinder Sidhu, who is also a regular here, said, “Morning walkers are well disciplined and the lake should have been opened from 6 to 9 in the morning earlier, too. I will ask that this be done during the Sunday lockdown now.” Officials of the Sukhna Lake police post confirmed that despite patrolling, no challans were issued for not wearing masks or not maintaining social distancing.Elante Mall reports good footfallShopping malls were also allowed to open, and officials at the Elante Mall said that the numbers on Tuesday were encouraging. Salim Roopani, centre director, Elante Mall, said, “We are delighted that the Chandigarh administration granted us permission to reopen. The mall was opened at 10am after sanitisation, and over 90% of the stores were opened which will go to 100% by the weekend. By the evening, over 9,000 people had visited the mall.” Floor Covid wardens were also seen with signages and a police team was present to issue challans to those without masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-many-bars-still-closed-but-sukhna-lake-elante-mall-report-good-response-101623269772019.html

10-06-2021||Chandigarh||Illegal call centre duping US citizens busted in Ambala, 9 held||The Ambala unit of Haryana Police’s special task force (STF) busted an illegal call centre being operated from a marriage palace on Ambala-Kaithal Highway near Ambala city on Wednesday. Kulbhushan, deputy superintendent of police (STF), said that around 125 people were found working at the centre and eight men were arrested from the spot, while another was nabbed from Gurugram in an overnight operation. As many as 200 computers, 10 laptops, ₹2.5 lakh in cash, 11 mobile phones and an internet server were recovered. The accused have been identified as Rahul from Gurugram, Kamal from Panchkula, Chintan and Kunal from Ahmedabad, Sumit Chauhan from Pali, Rajasthan; Lakshmendra alias Lucky from Mumbai, Ayan and Rishi from Navi Mumbai and Ajo from Nagaland’s Dimapur. The raid continued for nearly six hours and the accused failed to produce valid documents pertaining to licence by the telecom department, sources of customers and data etc. “The employees were trained to lure United States customers by impersonating as representatives of Amazon or law enforcement department of federal reserve system, Florida. Their modus operandi was to hack the system of a customer, scare them with fund deduction and use their personal details to defraud them. Using the same scare, they would also provide a scratch card and ask for its number along with card details, to siphon off funds to the tune of $200-1,000 from their accounts,” he added. The DSP added that the call centre was being operated from January and the raid was conducted on the basis of a tip-off. On being asked about the whereabouts of the marriage palace owner, Kulbhushan said, “He had rented them the place based on some agreement. We have summoned him and he will be questioned too.”While the employees were let go after questioning, all the nine accused were sent to three days of remand after being presented before a court, it has been learnt. A case has been registered under Sections 120-B, 384, 419 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code and IT Act. Meanwhile, Haryana director general of police Manoj Yadava congratulated the STF Haryana for busting the large-scale illegal call centre and saving people from getting cheated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/illegal-call-centre-duping-us-citizens-busted-in-ambala-9-held-101623268753387.html

Additional sessions judge Gurvinder Kaur rejected the bail plea of Dalbir of Bibipur village of Jind. The accused, who had been participating in the farmers’ agitation against the three contentious farm laws, was booked under Sections 506 (criminal intimidation), 500 (defamation), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke), 294 (obscene acts or words in public) and 505(1) (intent to incite) of the Indian Penal Code on May 24. He was arrested five days later. Surjewala argued that the farmer had been implicated at the behest of the state government. “The victimisation at the behest of the state government is evidenced from the fact that the applicant-accused has not been supplied a copy of the FIR. Even the FIR was not uploaded,” he said.The former Haryana minister said they will approach the Punjab and Haryana high court to secure Dalbir’s bail. Rejecting the bail, the judge said, “ Keeping in view the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case and without commenting on the merits of case, the applicant-accused does not deserve the concession of bail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/derogatory-remarks-against-cm-khattar-surjewala-appears-in-court-for-jind-farmer-bail-plea-rejected-101623268630205.html

Five of the minors accused of rape are aged between 10 and 12. In their complaint, the 10-year-old girl’s family said the incident took place on May 24 when the victim was playing outside her house. They only realised what had happened after a video of the sexual assault, which was widely circulated, reached them. Rewari DSP (headquarters) Hansraj, said the victim’s family had lodged a complaint on June 8. “The boys took the girl to the government school near her house. They raped her and recorded the incident. They threatened the girl of dire consequences if she told anybody about the assault. After circulating the video, they started blackmailing the victim.” The 18-year-old was presented before a local court in Rewari, which sent him to judicial custody, and the five juveniles were sent to an observation home. Three minors were arrested for filming the incident and will be sent to an observation home on June 10. “The victim and the accused minors will be counselled,” the Rewari DSP said. The accused were booked under Section 376DB (gang rape on woman under 12 years) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act sections of Information Technology (IT) Act and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.A police official, who was part of the team that questioned the accused, said the boys said they had raped the girl after watching a porn video and on the instigation of the 18-year-old man. Haryana state commission for protection of child rights (HSCPCR) chairperson Jyoti Bainda said, “It was a horrific incident. The victim did not confide in her parents until a month and a half after the incident. We will provide a support person to look after the girl. As all the accused were known to the girl, I have sought a status report of her neighbourhood. If needed, we will shift the girl to a children’s home,” she added.Two held for killing boxer for objecting to minor’s molestation Two people were arrested for stabbing boxer, model and actor Kamesh alias Raunak on Tuesday night after he tried to save a girl from molestation.The accused, Rahul and Sunny, have been arrested for molesting the girl and later stabbing Kamesh to death.

10-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Landmark shop, down shutters||An era is ending. It never was a celebrity establishment, but it is tied to our city’s contemporary history. The landmark Ahuja Tailors in Gurugram’s Sadar Bazaar will soon close. “The building owner wants the shops in the premises to be vacated,” says tailor Nathuram Ahuja, whose inheritors chose other professions. “But my silai machine and all the other things that were part of my life for 50 years will come back home.”At 85, the fully vaccinated Mr Ahuja is secluded within his home in Gurugram’s Ram Nagar. While lovingly cared for by his two sons, his routine stayed the same for several decades. Every day he would be in his shop, continuing his relationship with the fabrics, the sewing machine, the inch tape and the scissors.That life was rudely disrupted with the first pandemic-ridden lockdown in March last year. Mr Ahuja hasn’t been to his shop since then. “You survive by accepting the situation,” he notes, pointing out that the pandemic wasn’t the only seismic shift he has experienced. The family lost everything when his father, a village grocer in Dera Ghazi Khan, now part of Pakistan, moved to India following the ‘partition’. Then a 7th standard student, Mr Ahuja couldn’t resume his education. The hardships swallowed his early years, obliging him to struggle through odd jobs. “I would pick up coal dropped by steam engines on rail tracks, and sell them to halwai shops in the bazaar... I would do laavri, in which I would help harvest the crops of landowners in exchange for a sack of the harvest... I would get vegetables from the wholesalers and sell them in a basket on my head.” One job profile is now extinct. “I worked as a punkah-coolie in the courts.” Mr Ahuja is talking of a time when the ceiling fans weren’t ubiquitous, and he would sit outside a courtroom continually operating the long rope of a punkah that worked through a pulley, so that the magistrate within wouldn’t be deprived of the breeze.He eventually learnt tailoring from a cousin in Delhi’s Subzi Mandi, and opened his shop in Gurugram.After a prolonged pause, this man who has lived through so many changes casually observes “so what if my shop is replaced by some other shop... khush raho, mast raho (be happy and carefree).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-landmark-shop-down-shutters-101623268148156.html

This has led to a confusion in the fitness industry.Extending the curfew restrictions in the state till June 15, the press statement issued by the government on June 7 had mentioned that if cases continue to decline, gyms can open after a week with 50% capacity. The gym owners were elated with the announcement, as even the local Congress leaders had assured them that the gyms will be allowed to open from next week. Anticipating reopening, many of them ordered sanitisation of the premises and lubrication of equipment. They even informed their members regarding the same.However, in the final orders regarding the revised guidelines issued by the government on June 8, there was no mention of the reopening of gyms, leaving the owners in a dilemma. Even the subsequent orders issued by deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Sharma regarding the curfew relaxations in the district also didn’t mention anything in this regard.The administrative officials stated that the gyms will remain closed till the time official orders are not issued by the government. Caught unaware, the gym owners stated that the government should issue separate orders for reopening ofgyms from next week as announced earlier or the fitness industry will be forced to raise an agitation.“The sector had heaved a sigh of relief after the government in its press statement mentioned that the gyms can be opened next week if the Covid cases continued to decline. Even Congress leaders had assured us of the same. If the state government fails to issue orders regarding reopening, the gym owners will be forced to move on roads,” Gym Ekta Welfare Association president Monu Sabharwal.“There are over 800 gyms in the city and over 80% of them are being run on rental properties. The owners are struggling to pay fixed charges including power bills, salaries, etc. Many gyms are on the brink of closure,” he added.The gym owners are expecting the government to announce the final date for the reopening of gyms and issue SOPs soon. The owners, who have been staging protests seeking reopening of gyms in the state, stated that they were struggling to make ends meet as the gyms had remained shut for five months last year and for almost two months this year.Punjab Gym Welfare Association president Navneet Singh said, “We have already started preparing for reopening and getting the staff vaccinated. We will take up the matter with the DC as the government had announced that the gyms can open from next week. We expect that SOPs for opening the gyms will be issued by the end of this week.”Meanwhile, DC Sharma said,” The orders issued by the state government are clear and no date has yet been announced for the opening of gyms in the state. The gyms will remain closed until the state government issues orders regarding reopening.”Punjab Youth Development Board chairman Sukhwinder Bindra who had, on Tuesday, assured the gym owners that gyms will be allowed to open from next week, said that the government will be working on the SOPs, following which it might issue separate orders regarding the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lack-of-clarity-around-reopening-leaves-ludhiana-gym-owners-in-the-lurch-101623268211375.html

Sportspersons have been contacting their coaches to know the timings and guidelines they have to follow while visiting the Guru Nanak Stadium and other academies as since February, they have been practising at home due to surge in Covid cases. Players are also enquiring about the hostel facilities as many of them hail from different districts. Coaches said that they have been providing online coaching to the players so that they can continue with their practice at home, but most of them are keen to come to stadiums to join their team members. Gini, an 18-year-old Judoka, who had bagged a gold medal in the National School Games, said, “I am excited to go back to stadium for practice as online classes are not proving very beneficial. In judo, we have to follow techniques, speed and require another person for training. At home, it is difficult to concentrate. I am playing in the 63kg category and have to maintain weight, otherwise I will not be allowed to participate. I gained 5kg than the actual weight required and was not able to maintain the ideal weight.” A native of Faridkot, she said, “I have been playing judo since 2014 and miss other players while practising at home.” Sarajot Singh,18, a hockey player, said, “For the last three months, I have been out of regular practice and miss my fellow team members.

10-06-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana farmers begin paddy transplantation ahead of schedule, notices served||Defying government orders prohibiting transplantation of paddy before June 15, many farmers in northern districts of the state have already started sowing seedlings of the water guzzling crop. Authorities say defaulting farmers are being served notices and fined ₹4,000 per acre. However, no checks were seen on ground level as transplantation is in full swing in the several villages in vegetable growing belts, which include Indri and Gharaunda block of Karnal district, Babain, Ladwa and Shahbad block of Kurukshetra district and Radaur block of Yamunanagar district. Officials in Karnal say notices have been served to around 50 farmers, especially in Darar, Ramba, Kheri Mann Singh, Kharajpur, Nalvi Khurd, Samora, Bazidpur, Nasirpur, and Nalvi Kalan villages, which are also notorious for burning crop residue. In Kurukshetra and Kaithal districts, the agriculture department has issued notices to only two farmers each for violation of the Soil Water Conservation Act, 2009.Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav has said strict action will be taken against defaulting farmers and their crop will be destroyed, but no action has been taken so far.Farmers say they cannot wait till June 15 to transplant the paddy as their nurseries are already ready and last week’s rainfall had helped them start transplantation. “We have to plant early varieties that will be harvested in the first week of September, after which we will be able to grow vegetables and get good prices for them,” said a young farmer from Ramba village of Karnal, who has already transplanted 5 acres of the PUSA 1509 variety. Farmers taking advantage of farm agitation: Officials Officials say, this year, farmers are taking advantage of the ongoing agitation against the contentious agricultural laws and had the backing of farmer unions. With the area under paddy cultivation increasing,the state government is making efforts dwindle down cultivation as it is the primary reason for depletion of the water table. A senior official from the state agriculture department, pleading anonymity, said the incentive scheme for diversification launched last year did not evoke a good response from farmers. Data from the state agriculture department says area under paddy cultivation in the state in 2020 had been 15.27 lakh hectares against 15.59 lakh hectares in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-farmers-begin-paddy-transplantation-ahead-of-schedule-notices-served-101623267910723.html
10-06-2021||Chandigarh||Ahead of Kharge panel report, five more party MPs rally behind Capt||As the three-member panel under leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge on factionalism in the Punjab Congress held a meeting in Delhi to finalise its report, five party MPs met chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday to express their support. The five Lok Sabha MPs, including Capt’s wife Preneet Kaur, Jasbir Singh Gill, Santokh Choudhary, Dr Amar Singh and Mohammad Sadiqe, who called on the chief minister at his residence, discussed with him the strategy for the assembly polls due early next year. They reposed faith in Amarinder’s leadership and ability to successfully lead the party, citing his governance record and administrative as the party’s key strengths. On Monday, three other MPs – Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Manish Tewari and Ravneet Singh Bittu – had met the CM. These meetings, which saw all eight Lok Sabha members of the Congress meet him, are being seen in party circles as a “show of support and accessibility” even as the party high command is trying to find a way to suitably adjust Sidhu without rocking the CM’s boat. The appointment of two deputy chief ministers, including Sidhu and another from the Dalit community, besides rejig of the state unit, is a strong option being considered, a senior party leader familiar with the developments said. However, the biggest challenge for the Congress will be to get both Capt and Sidhu to agree to this. The CM has already on various occasions voiced his opposition to having the Amritsar East MLA back in his team as the deputy chief minister or the state unit chief. On the other hand, Sidhu is now more interested in the state chief’s post, which will allow him a say in ticket distribution for the state polls. “Sidhu is not likely to agree to anything less than the state unit chief’s position. As for the deputy CM’s post, there is hardly any time left for the government,” according to sources close to the former minister. Meanwhile, the Kharge committee, which has been tasked with finding a solution to this squabbling, is learnt to be in touch with the party leadership. “We will have another sitting tomorrow,” committee member and former Delhi Congress president Jai Prakash Agarwal said after the meeting. Kharge also told a news agency that the panel will submit the report within 3-4 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ahead-of-kharge-panel-report-five-more-party-mps-rally-behind-capt-101623267070253.html

Cars, two-wheelers and three-wheelers can be seen squeezed between trucks and tractor trollies bound for the plywood factories across the crossing. Traffic bound for the market and stand-alone shops and eateries along the highway compound irate motorists’ troubles. Kapil, who works at one of the eateries dotting the highway, says, “Traffic snarls are caused when vehicles from three to four queues on the already congested highway. Customers do not find any suitable parking space because of trucks lined up at the sugar mills, which has further dried down sales that are negligible to begin with due to the pandemic. They cannot wait for takeaways in the morning rush.”“While few passenger trains cross the Ambala-Haridwar line, many good trains take the route leading to traffic jams through most of the day,” a railway employee attached with Yamunanagar railway station said.Overbridge closed till June 15Come Thursday, a major railway overbridge connecting Vishkarma Chowk on NH-65 to Kamani Chowk on Workshop Road will remain closed till June 15. Officials said the flyover will remain closed due to construction-related work on a dedicated freight corridor along the rail line.While the traffic police have created diversions to ease vehicles’ movement, the closure is expected to add to the mayhem at the market.Deputy commissioner Girish Arora could not be reached for a comment. However, MLA Ghanshyamdas Arora said another overbridge had been proposed at the site to ease the congestion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/yamunanagar-motorists-despair-over-hour-long-delays-at-railway-crossing-101623266770065.html

Calling upon the NDA government to be sensitive to the anguish of farmers, who were agitating against the three farm laws for more than six months, the SAD chief said: “It is shocking that the NDA government is telling farmers that there is no space for discussion in a democracy.” “The government has done everything within its power to suppress the peaceful and democratic movement and continues to attempt to dislodge farmers from the Singhu and Tikri protest sites,” said Sukhbir, asserting that the farmers want repeal of the three black laws. However, Tomar on Wednesday said the government was ready to resume talks with farmers but asked the unions to point out their objections to the provisions of the three farm laws with sound logic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hold-unconditional-talks-with-farmers-sukhbir-to-tomar-101623266590006.html
10-06-2021||Chandigarh||Barnala farmers show the way, go for direct seeding of paddy||Moving away from the traditional practice, farmers in Barnala district are going for direct seeding of rice (DSR) this khairf season.In the DSR method, seeds are sown in the field rather than by transplanting seedlings from the nursery, thus saving water and labour. Gurpreet Singh, a farmer from Tajoke village in Barnala, has opted for this alternative method on 36 acres of land. Gurpreet owns 30 acres and took another six acres on lease. Earlier, he used to cultivate paddy with traditional methods. “The direct sowing of paddy saves money on labour and water,” he said.Officials said paddy on around 500 acres of land in the village is being sown using the DSR method. Another farmer Buta Singh from the same village has adopted the DSR method on 15 acres of his 26 acres land. Last year, he had used the technique on 10 acres.Barnala chief agriculture officer Charanjit Singh Kainth said that village-level camps and “nukkad” meetings were held to promote DSR technique for paddy sowing. As of now, 19 special camps have been held to promote the technique and the department was conducting special field visits to sensitise farmers.Kainth said 1.13 lakh hectare is under paddy cultivation in the district of which 25,000 to 30,000 acres is expected to be under the DSR, which is 20% more than the last year.He said that around 150 DSR machines were being put to use in the district for direct sowing of paddy. Last year, a subsidy of ₹15 core was given on these machines. This year, farmers have applied online to get the subsidy, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/barnala-farmers-show-the-way-go-for-direct-seeding-of-paddy-101623265990180.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra makes its own draft law to protect farmers||The Maharashtra government has prepared a draft legislation intended to safeguard the interest of farmers concerned over the contentious laws brought in by the Centre and is looking to pass it in the upcoming monsoon session of the state legislature.The state is considering bringing in some vital provisions in the draft law by proposing amendments to the Central acts. Agriculture comes under concurrent list and the states can suggest changes to the Central legislations as per the Constitutional provisions, which, however, has to be approved by the President, it is said.The draft was discussed with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, also former Union agriculture minister, and will now be placed before the cabinet sub-committee headed by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar for approval. It will also be placed before cabinet for final approval before tabling in the state legislature. The ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, a coalition of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, have opposed the provisions of Central government’s farm laws.State revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said they will make it mandatory for traders to take licence if they intend to buy agricultural produce outside Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC). They will also be bringing a system for grievance redressal of farmers in case of disputes. “The laws passed by the central government have flaws which we feel are not in the interest of the farmers. We want certain changes to be made in the legislations which were discussed in today’s meeting with the NCP chief,” Thorat said, after meeting with Pawar at his residence, along with cooperation minister Balasaheb Patil, agriculture minister Dadasaheb Bhuse and minister of state Vishwajeet Kadam on Wednesday afternoon. “For instance, a trader is allowed to buy agricultural produce on the basis of a PAN card, but what will happen in case of cheating. We have considered all these aspects while drafting our law. We will also be inserting a provision mandating licence for traders to ensure accountability,” he added.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act passed by the Centre allows a person to trade without any registration or licence outside APMC market. It is against the existing APMC law of the state that provides a security to farmers that if a buyer didn’t pay remuneration against the produce then it can be recovered from the trader concerned.Similarly, in the ‘Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation’, there is no security provided to the agrarian community, in case of a dispute. They can approach a sub-divisional magistrate, who is already overburdened with work in the existing system and has also no jurisdiction in these matters. “The state in its draft has proposed an alternative mechanism and sought authority to formulate rules for the same,” said a minister, wishing not to be named.Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh governments have passed their own laws against the Central laws. Farmers are concerned the Central laws would deprive them of minimum support price (MSP) and thus are holding protests for over a year.The draft legislation of the state may remain silent on Minimum Support Price (MSP) as consensus over its impact is yet to be made, the minister said. To look into concerns and questions raised by various farmer groups against three farm legislations, the state had last year formed a 10-member cabinet sub-committee. Many political parties and farmers’ organisations in the state have opposed implementation of central laws. It has also asked the officials from various departments to study the laws passed by the Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. “The draft was prepared based on the study report submitted by the officials,” said the cooperation minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-makes-its-own-draft-law-to-protect-farmers-101623265929464.html

He told the party that farmers must be listened to. He did not say that he opposed the BJP or Prime Minister Narendra Modi.” He said the state leaders should have guided the Centre for taking the farmers’ demand seriously. “Had the state BJP leadership been wise and visionary, it would have taken the farmers’ agitation seriously. The state leadership has failed to brief the Centre on farmers’ issues in a right way,” he said. He added: “I have asked the state leadership as well as the central leaders to correct course of action. It constituted a committee led by Surjit Kumar Jyani. However, this committee also praised the government. As a result, the party lost its base in Punjab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-bjp-ex-minister-backs-joshi-on-farmers-issues-101623265870726.html

10-06-2021||Mumbai||Don’t implement Tenancy Act: Sena leaders tell CM Thackeray||Shiv Sena leaders on Wednesday urged chief minister Uddhav Thackeray not to implement the Centre’s Model Tenancy Act in the state. Sena functionaries Anil Desai, Arvind Sawant, Anil Parab, Sunil Prabhu and three others wrote to the CM, saying the rent control is the prerogative of the state government and that the Act passed by the Centre is not beneficial for tenants.The tenancy Act has always been a controversial issue in Mumbai as about 600,000 tenants living in old dilapidated buildings and chawls have been resisting any changes to the existing Rent Control Act. Their contention is any change will result in massive hike in rentals and make their eviction from the premises easier. The state is at liberty to not adopt or partially adopt the Act, which was passed by the Centre last week.The letter signed by party secretary and five vibhag pramukhs (divisional heads) of Mumbai stated there is no need for a new law for Mumbai and that the Bombay Rent Act and Maharashtra Rent Control Act are enough. It also said that the new law does not provide any “protection” to the tenants.According to the Model Tenant Act, after its enactment, all the existing Rent Control Acts will be deemed repealed, in short, if the law is passed, more than 2.5 million people will become homeless, the letter stated.A large chunk of these buildings and chawls that could get affected with the new law are in central and south Mumbai. With the civic election coming up in February 2022, the Shiv Sena has taken a pro-tenant stance. “In Mumbai and other cities in Maharashtra, many houses are vacant and so there is no point in introducing a new rent control law. There is no need for a new fare control law for Mumbai. The Bombay Rent Act and the Maharashtra Rent Control Act are competent and adequate for this. In any law made for tenants, they would be protected because the landlord has unlimited control over his land and is ready to grab the land by expelling the tenant. Therefore, the Rent Act should be a tenant’s charge. In contrast, the Centre’s law is the opposite,” the letter stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/dont-implement-tenancy-act-sena-leaders-tell-cm-101623265809426.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||22 yrs on, NCP all set for challenges||The Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which has been a significant force in Maharashtra politics, except for the five years of the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rule, completes 22 years of its formation on Thursday. Among the many challenges ahead for the party, the most important one is leadership – the party still remains dependent on Pawar’s appeal though there seems to be internal struggle over leadership. While Pawar’s nephew and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar is making it clear that he would prefer to be clear number two in the party, two other power centres are making their presence felt – Pawar’s daughter and MP Supriya Sule as well as party’s state president Jayant Patil. Ajit suffered a setback after he tried to split the party and form a government with the BJP, just when senior Pawar was busy stitching together a three-party alliance with Shiv Sena and Congress after the 2019 Assembly elections. Ajit failed and had to return to the party. However, he managed to get the position of deputy chief minister and is leading the party in the Uddhav Thackeray government. Although there are three other party heavyweights in the government, Jayant Patil, home minister Dilip Walse-Patil and food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal, Ajit is seen as NCP’s undisputed leader in Thackeray’s cabinet. But that is not the case when it comes to taking decisions regarding political issues. Senior Pawar is also making it clear that Sule and Jayant Patil have weightage in party matters, besides the NCP supremo’s close confidant Praful Patel. The rise of Sule is a clear indication that the NCP chief has been grooming his daughter for bigger responsibilities. She is increasingly getting involved in key decisions of the party. She is also accessible to party leaders and workers as the party chief is now unable to meet everybody due to his health condition. “We all used to believe that Ajit dada is the natural heir of Pawar sahib, but now things are changing slowly. Supriya tai is more accessible. She makes a point to meet at least 25 to 100 workers and leaders every day, which gives them a sense of belonging. Not only this, she takes people to the ministers and ensures their problems are resolved. Ajitdada now has limitations in meeting partymen, as he is busy with responsibilities in the government,” said a senior NCP leader, requesting anonymity. Besides Sule, Jayant Patil is even positioning himself as one of the candidates for the chief ministerial position. Many in party think he won’t feel emboldened to make such remarks unless he has the support of senior Pawar. The NCP’s performance in 2019 was noteworthy considering the mass exodus of senior leaders and its struggle to boost morale of the party workers. It lost many of its prominent faces who were also considered as Pawar’s loyalists, apart from eight of its sitting MLAs and a sitting Member of Parliament Udayanraje Bhonsle. But the party managed to get 56 MLAs, 13 more than what it could secure during the Modi wave of 2014. In the 2009 assembly elections, it had won 62 seats. Political analyst Pratap Asbe said the party will have to create ideology-based cadre to prevent a 2019-like situation. “The party cadre will not move if he or she is ideologically committed. This will keep the organisation united and help in moving forward. For this, the leadership is required to hold training and programs of its cadre,” Asbe said. Another political analyst Prakash Bal said the primary challenge of the party is to maintain its regional presence and upcoming local bodies elections would be crucial. “The NCP is a regional party just like the Shiv Sena. In the long term, it has to maintain its regional presence and hence it will be trying to consolidate its position in south and western Maharashtra. Encroaching voters from Konkan and Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) would be a challenge for the party. BMC elections, crucial for all political parties, are due next year, but the NCP’s presence in the city is nowhere to be seen. The party is expected to perform better, especially when it is in the government,” said Bal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/22-yrs-on-ncp-all-set-for-challenges-101623265749401.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||Two cops enjoyed service benefits for 8 years without doing the duty; dismissed||Two police constables have been dismissed from service after departmental enquiries revealed that they were absent absented from duty for eight years, but continued to enjoy the service benefits.The two did not turn up even during departmental enquiry to justify their prolonged absence, following which they were sacked from the police force.Rajeev Jain, deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, has issued orders, dismissing police constables Ramlal Manjule and Samad Shaikh, both of whom were last attached to the Malabar Hill police station, under Rule 3 of Mumbai Police (Punishment and Appeals) Rules, 1956.Manjule was transferred to Malabar Hill police station from Tardeo local arms division in June 2012, but despite being relieved from the previous post, he never reported to the police station. Several reminders and notices were sent to him to join duty at the police station, but in vain, police officials said.Before taking the final decision a show-cause notice was sent to Manjule, but he did not respond to it.Similarly, Shaikh too remained absent for over eight years and did not report on duty at the Malabar Hill police station. When a final show-cause notice was slapped to him in March this year, he responded to the notice and gave explanation for remaining absent. But the reasons furnished by him in his defence were found not satisfactory and hence procedure for his dismissal was initiated, another officer said.Both the policemen continued to avail of various benefits of a government employment all these years, a police source said.The zonal DCP observed that both the police constables have violated the rules under Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1979.“Their irresponsible approach for duty, indiscipline and misconduct makes them liable to face any punishment under Mumbai Police (Punishment and Appeals) Rules, 1956. Hence they have been dismissed from the service recently,” said an officer from Zone 2 police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/two-cops-enjoyed-service-benefits-for-8-years-without-doing-the-duty-dismissed-101623265690489.html
10-06-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers advised to install pheromone traps in cotton fields to check pink bollworm pest||BATHINDAAlarmed over last year’s pink bollworm outbreak in the cotton crop in Bathinda, the Punjab agriculture department has started a state-wide programme asking farmers to use a low-cost pheromone traps in fields to contain infestation of the deadly pest. A pheromone trap uses chemicals secreted by insects to lure pests. One hectare area needs a trap that costs about ₹60-80. The pest attack in Bathinda district’s Jodhpur Romana village in August last year had left the cotton growers and farm experts worried. Cotton is sown over 3.3 lakh hectares in Punjab.Principal entomologist of the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Vijay Kumar said the first case of the pest attack among the cotton growing states in north India was noticed in Haryana’s Jind district in 2017.“Bollgard 2, or BG-2, Monsanto’s second-generation insecticidal technology for cotton, was considered to protect crops against the pink bollworm. It cannot be ruled out that the pest has now grown resistant to the toxins produced by this trait. It is a deadly pest that appears when the cotton plant is in the flowering stage after 65-70 days of sowing,” Kumar said. State agriculture director Sukhdev Singh Sidhu said the department is taking measures to check any incident of pink bollworm infestation. “We have advised farmers to install pheromone trap in fields. A capsule lures male pests in the traps. Regular monitoring indicates pest population in the fields through the trapped pests,” said Sidhu.He said studies from last year’s infestation in Bathinda concluded that pest larvae reached the state with cottonseed consignments from south-west states, including Maharashtra and Karnataka.“Oil mills and cotton ginning units across the state are being asked to follow a protocol to ensure the pest do not entre fields from where it could potentially harm the cotton crop. They have been instructed to sanitise the factories and remove cotton crop residue to contain the situation,” he said.Paramjit Singh, director, PAU regional research station, Bathinda, said it is a challenging task to detect pink bollworm in time and control it through pesticide spraying as it stays inside a cotton boll.“Cotton bolls look normal from outside. But each infected boll has a pink bollworm inside. The worm eats cotton seeds and prevents the development of cotton staple fibre around it well before the boll opens,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-advised-to-install-pheromone-traps-in-cotton-fields-to-check-pink-bollworm-pest-101623265689995.html
10-06-2021||Chandigarh||Centre’s order to cap vaccine price too late, says Balbir Sidhu||Punjab health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Wednesday said that central government’s order of capping of Covid vaccines prices for private hospitals is too late. Reacting to the latest decision of the central government to cap the vaccines prices, Sidhu said this decision was taken at a much later stage when private hospitals had already made huge profits, while the BJP leaders raised the false allegations that Punjab government is making profit by supplying the vaccines to private facilities. The state government is under fire for selling vaccines at a premium to private hospitals. The minister also asked the Centre for administering free vaccines to all. “Keeping in view of administering free vaccine to all, the Centre should abolish 25% quota allocated to private players,” he said. He also urged to the Union government to refund all payments made by state governments for Covid vaccines under new policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centres-order-to-cap-vaccine-price-too-late-says-balbir-sidhu-101623265569904.html

The minister had moved the bail plea in a case booked against him by an actor, who is a Malaysian national, for cheating her on the pretext of marriage.Justice Abdul Qudhose passed the directions after the prosecution submitted that interrogation of the former minister of Information and Technology (2016-2019) is required. Since he had held an important position, there is every possibility of him tampering with the evidence in the case, the prosecution added.Earlier, Justice R Subramanian had ordered the police to not arrest the former minister till June 9. During the hearing on Wednesday, the counsel for the minister, John Sathyan argued that there is no iota of truth in the allegations levelled against the minister and the entire complaint and the accompanying documents are concocted after several attempts for compromise with extortionist demands were not accepted by the minister. The change in government was also noted.The counsel for the minister also added that the offence under section 313 (causing miscarriage without woman’s consent) of the Indian Penal Code made by the actor is done with a malafide intention since she voluntarily caused abortion and there is no material whatsoever to show that it was done on the inducement of the minister. However, the counsel V Raghavachari, appearing for the actor, submitted that the consent given for sex on the promise of marriage by the minister to the actor cannot be considered as consent if the promise is not honoured. In her complaint, the actor had charged that Manikandan had lured her into a relationship for five years on the pretext of marriage but had forced her to abort, and had issued death threats to her. The single-member bench directed both the counsels to file their written submissions on the plea and reserved its orders without extending interim relief to the former minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/madras-hc-refuses-to-extend-stay-on-arrest-of-ex-aiadmk-minister-101623265269370.html

The bench also called for action against negligent officers for not protecting forest land. The case pertains to a plea filed by a petitioner, S Prabakaran against an individual from Chennai for purportedly encroaching on forest land to set up a resort in Naduvattam village of Tamil Nadu’s Nilgiris district. The petitioner informed the court that despite the district forest officer bringing the matter to the notice of the Additional Principal Conservator of Forest, no action has been taken and construction has commenced. The petitioner also said that the respondent has laid pipelines that extract water out of forest land. “If such is the case, the same must be stopped immediately and the negligent or recalcitrant forest officials identified and steps are taken against them for not being able to protect the relevant forest,” the court said. “The District Collector, Nilgiris, and the Chief Forest official exercising jurisdiction over the area should immediately visit the spot and conduct surveys, if necessary, and ensure that the last inch of forest land that might have been encroached upon is returned to its pristine status.” The court has directed the concerned forest official to file a report when the matter appears next in three weeks on June 30. The court asked for the petition to be forwarded to the office of the Advocate-General for the state, R Shunmugasundaram “to treat the matter with the degree of seriousness it deserves.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/madras-hc-orders-probe-into-encroachment-of-forest-land-in-nilgris-101623265209399.html

10-06-2021||Bangalore||K’taka HC allows police to release vehicles seized during curbs||Bengaluru: The Karnataka high court on Wednesday allowed the police department to release over 1.5 lakh vehicles seized for violation of Covid-19 restrictions imposed across the state. The court noted that since a large number of vehicles have been seized, it would be difficult for the police to find adequate space to park these vehicles. As per the data submitted to the HC, 1,37,503 two-wheelers, 7,432 four-wheelers and 7,123 other vehicles have been seized in the state so far. A Division Bench of Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj ordered that such vehicles can be released to their owners after verification of documents along with an undertaking and deposit of fines. The order was passed on an application filed by the state government seeking the release of such vehicles. The government, in its application, had sought authorisation for the jurisdictional police to release the seized vehicles as such a large number of vehicles could not be transported to the jurisdictional courts. In the normal course, the vehicles owners will have to file applications for the release of the vehicles before the jurisdictional magistrate or wait till the case is finally adjudicated. Observing that the jurisdictional magistrates would be overburdened if the owners apply separately for return of vehicles, the bench said: “In the event, the persons claiming to be the owners of the vehicles which have been seized for violation of various orders issued concerning Covid-19 make an application to the jurisdictional Police Officers to grant custody of the seized vehicles, after verification of the ownership of the applicants, it will be open for the jurisdictional Police Officers to give custody of the seized vehicles to the owners by exercising the powers under sub-section (3) of Section 102 of Cr.P.C.” In another order, on Tuesday , the HC has directed the state government to ensure all those domestic workers eligible to receive the ₹2,000 compensation must get the said benefit. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka said: “The applicant’s counsel is prima facie right in submitting that it will be very difficult for domestic workers to get themselves registered on Seva Sindhu portal. In fact, the government order states that the benefit has been extended to workers from other states working in Karnataka,” the bench noted in its order. The bench asked the state how unorganised domestic workers would travel to Seva Sindhu Centres to claim ₹2000 compensation at a time when public transport remains suspended due to Covid-19 lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-hc-allows-police-to-release-vehicles-seized-during-curbs-101623264850928.html
10-06-2021||Chandigarh||How Jaipal Bhullar became Punjab’s most wanted gangster||Failing to make it big in the world of sport, Jaipal Bhullar — one of Punjab’s most wanted drug smuggler and gangster who was killed in an encounter in Kolkata on Wednesday — achieved notoriety in the world of crime.Son of a cop, Bhullar was on the run after gunning down two assistant sub-inspectors of Punjab Police in Ludhiana’s Jagraon town on May 15.Belonging to Ferozepur, Bhullar had a long association with Ludhiana. A national-level hammer thrower, his sporting career had picked up in 2003 when he joined Speed Fund Academy, a government-run training centre in Ludhiana. Also, it was here in July 2004 that he made his first foray into the world of crime by kidnapping a cinema hall owner’s seven-year-old son.With this his sporting career came to an end and his crime graph took a flight, as he came in contact with other gangsters in jail. First such associate was Rajiv Raja who was arrested in 2006 for killing three family members of a jeweller in Ludhiana. Later, out on bail, Bhullar met Shera, with whom he decided to form a gang. In January 2009, both helped Raja flee from police custody at the Barnala bus stand. Later, the gang carried a series of robberies, including at a gun house in Hoshiarpur, followed by more crimes in Mohali and Panchkula. They were also behind several carjackings on the highway.Arrested in Chandigarh, Bhullar came in contact with gangster Rocky of Fazilka and formed a new gang. With witnesses reluctant to speak up, the gangsters were acquitted in July 2010, and soon there was a rift between the duo. Rocky decided to enter politics and allegedly helped cops hunt down a number of gangsters, before he was finally killed by Bhullar at Parwanoo in Himachal Pradesh’s Solan district in 2015.Bhullar had also masterminded the ₹1.33-crore cash van robbery in Banur in 2017 besides executing robbery of 30kg gold at a Ludhiana firm in February 2020.Jaspreet Singh, 29, the other man gunned down by the West Bengal police special task force on Wednesday, was Bhullar’s close aide. A resident of Kharar in Mohali, he was involved in several crimes with the gangster, including kidnapping of a businessman in Zirakpur last year.He was also involved in killing the two ASIs in Jagraon, and was the one who started firing at them after alighting from the driver’s seat of the drug-laden vehicle. According to police, Jaspreet, alias Jassi, was facing over 15 criminal cases and had met Bhullar at Chandigarh Model Jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/how-jaipal-bhullar-became-punjab-s-most-wanted-gangster-101623264850420.html
10-06-2021||Bangalore||Curbs in K’taka to be lifted in 4 to 5 phases: Minister||Bengaluru: Karnataka revenue minister R Ashoka on Wednesday made it clear that there will not be a complete lifting of lockdown post-July 14. He said that the restrictions in the state will be removed in four to five phases. He didn’t mention any timeframe for these phases but said a final decision will be taken in the next couple of days. Talking about the immediate relaxation in norms, he said that the window for purchasing essential services would be extended. Currently, people can shop for essentials between 6 am and 10 pm. “After June 14, the government is mulling of unlocking the state in five phases. In the first phase there is a plan of extending the time of buying essential things from the present 6 am to 10 am to 6 am to 12 noon,” he said. He further added that in the first phase, people will be allowed to visit parks. “Experts are of the opinion that people can be allowed to walk in the park. So, this activity may be allowed in the first phase of unlocking itself. The final decision will be taken by chief minister B S Yediyurappa in the meeting in which the deputy commissioners and district in-charge ministers will take part,” he said. The minister said that several meetings are underway to decide the details of the phase-wise unlock in the state. “Keeping the number of deaths and new cases in mind and aim at bringing down the Covid infections further, lockdown will not be relaxed at one go. Home minister Basavaraj Bommai, health minister K Sudhakar and I have held detailed discussions with the chief minister in this regard,” Ashoka said. The Karnataka government had initially announced 14 day close down from April 27 but subsequently imposed a complete lockdown from May 10 to May 24, as Covid cases continued to spike. Citing that the lockdown was yielding desired results and experts advice, it was further extended till June 7 and then again till June 14. Noting that the number of daily new cases in Bengaluru is still in the 2,000 range, Ashoka, who is also the vice-chairman of Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority said, the numbers have to come down further. “Bengaluru is currently reporting about 2,000 cases. If we want to have a normal life, the caseload must come down to 500 per day. We will also be analysing what will be the positivity rate once unlock process sets in,” he said. We will also have to keep in mind the rise in positive cases as we unlock, he added. Karnataka on Wednesday logged 10,595 new cases and 192 deaths while Bengaluru alone recorded 2,395 cases and 50 deaths. The current positivity rate in the state is 6.68%. The minister clarified that no new industries, other than those that are currently functioning, will be allowed to resume operations for the time being. Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar said that lifting all restrictions at one go may trigger a surge in cases. The restrictions will be eased in a staggered manner and CM will take a final decision on the modalities of unlock, he said. “There is no confusion regarding lifting the restrictions. Other states like Maharashtra, have opened up only after reduction in cases. The advice of expert’s will be conveyed to CM and then he will take a final decision after discussion with senior ministers. As per experts’ opinion, if positivity rate is less than 5% and the cases are less than 5,000 restrictions can be lifted,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/curbs-in-k-taka-to-be-lifted-in-4-to-5-phases-minister-101623264789276.html
10-06-2021||Bangalore||Amid pandemic, K’taka raises power tariff, Oppn slams move||Bengaluru The Karnataka government on Wednesday increased the electricity tariff by 30 paise per unit for the current financial year, resulting in an average increase of 3.84%. The decision has come under sharp criticism from all quarters, questioning the timing of the increase when the Covid-19 pandemic-induced lockdown has affected livelihoods and all businesses alike. “The electricity supply companies (ESCOMs) had sought an average increase of 135 paise per unit accounting for 17.31% increase,” according to a statement by the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) on Wednesday. “The revised retail supply tariff includes the revised transmission tariff to be payable by ESCOMs to KPTCL for Financial Year 2021-22,” the statement added. The revised tariff will come into effect for electricity consumed from the first meter reading date falling on or after April 1, the government added. “ However, to soften the burden of increase in tariff on the consumers, during the prevailing lockdown in the state, the arrears towards revision of tariff for the month of April 2021 and May 2021 is ordered to be recovered during the month of October 2021 and November 2021 respectively, without charging any interest,” the KERC added. Karnataka is among the worst Covid-19 impacted regions in the country. The government said that the order was delayed due to by-elections as well as other polls for city municipal corporations and other urban local bodies earlier this year. The government added that it delayed its order dated April 4, 2020 in view of the adverse financial situation prevailing among all the sectors of economy due to the pandemic. The statement said that an approved discounted rate scheme, wherever there is power surplus, large industries, commercial will be at a discounted rate of ₹6 per unit. “To encourage consumption by lower and middle-class domestic consumers, the first slab of 0-30 units (lifeline consumption) has been increased to 0-50 units,” the government said. “The remaining increase (12.64 paise per unit) is towards overall increase in the operational costs of ESCOMs, which includes the approved revenue deficit as per annual performance review (APR) for FY20 and also the increase in the cost of power purchase due to procurement of energy from new thermal stations and from renewable energy sources to meet the demand,” the government added. It added that input costs towards operations, maintenance and borrowings for capital expenditure were also increasing each year. “Hence, in order to enable the ESCOMs to carry on their business of supplying the electricity, which is the basic need of the society, the increase in the tariff has become inevitable”, the government added . The government said that the total revenue gap assessed for financial year 2022 including the gap for FY 2020, regulatory assets created during the FY20 due to the reasons explained above, is Rs. 1,819.38 crores, which has to be recovered as revenue gap to be filled by tariff revision from 1st April 2021 to 31st March 2022. The fixed charges will also be raised by ₹15, the government added. “If they hike 35 paise, then it will add 9% tax. Already there is no business for two months (this year) and nearly six months were lost last year due to lockdowns. Our overheads will be more, there will be no financial liquidity and no orders. The government has to give discounts. No other state has increased power tariff at this time,” Perikal M Sundar, the president of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI) told Hindustan Times. Most businesses are shut in Karnataka and other parts of the country where similar restrictions have been imposed to contain the pandemic. Sundar said that it was “unfortunate” that the state decided to increase tariffs despite industry bodies like the FKCCI making representations to the government, requesting not to announce any hikes. He said that the industry body strongly objects to the hike and that it will reach out to the chief minister and seek withdrawal of the new changes. Yediyurappa on 2 tranches, had announced ₹1,750 crore financial package to several sections of people hardest hit by the pandemic but barely provided any relief as select individuals who have lost months of livelihood were entitled to a one-time payment of ₹2000- ₹5000, HT reported. As part of the relief, Yediyurappa had announced concessions for MSME industries for paying fixed charges for the month of May/June and for other industries payment will be extended till 30.07.2021. The said relief would cost the state exchequer ₹120 crore, the chief minister said. “The decision of @CMofKarnataka to increase electricity tariff is disastrous for everyone. Common man to industries, all are suffering due to pandemic and the increase will kill everyone,” Siddaramaiah, former chief minister and Congress’ leader of the opposition tweeted. “K’taka has surplus power & yet @BJP4Karnataka continues to purchase power from Central grid, Adani & others at higher cost. Price for which our people have to pay. It’s unfortunate that K’taka CM @BSYBJP cannot keep his head high in front of @narendramodi &Adani,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/amid-pandemic-k-taka-raises-power-tariff-oppn-slams-move-101623264729311.html

While the fact is that in 2002, the number of voters in Jammu was more than Kashmir by 1.41 lakh.”“Similarly, the average population growth of Jammu province, which was 31% between 1971 to 2001, dropped to 21% in 2011, and due to migration within and outside the state on account of Hindu and Sikh genocide in Kashmir, the percentage growth in Kashmir’s population should have been lower but it grew by 26% post 1991,” he said. Sharma emphasised that delimitation at this stage and that too on the basis of an erroneous Census would consolidate subversives, Jihadists, Islamists and further perpetuate J&K as a non-secular, theocratic Muslim domain part from the rest of India.“The only way to take abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A to their logical conclusion is reorganising the state once again by dividing Kashmir into two UTs and granting full statehood to Jammu,” he said.“The fraud of Census 2011 was aimed to destroy Dogra Hindus politically, socially, culturally and economically and create the basic foothold for demographic Jihad in Jammu,” he claimed.Sharma urged the Prime Minister and Home minister to eschew the “sinister idea of conducting delimitation and immediately reorganize JK UT into 2 UTs and one state namely state of Jammu”. Former minister and chairman of Dogra Sadar Sabha Gurchain Singh Charak said, “The Centre bifurcated this vast princely state into two UTs in August 2019. Our forefathers from all religions had toiled hard to make it such a vast state. Subsequently, big parts of it were usurped by China and Pakistan and then the state was bifurcated into two UTs on the grounds of checking terrorism and ending discrimination with Jammu, which had been going on for the past 70 years.”“Despite downgrading the state into two UTs, we welcomed the move, but to our utter dismay, discrimination with Jammu region went up further. Then we asked that secretariats be set up in both the capitals. We also sought that delimitation of assemblies be conducted after Census 2021 because today half of Kashmir is sitting in Jammu. However, if the Centre gives statehood to Jammu, and Kashmir remains a UT under direct control of the Centre to combat terrorism and anti-national elements, then it will be a good step and we would welcome it,” said Charak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chorus-grows-louder-for-statehood-to-jammu-101623264489917.html

10-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s rain woes back on first day of monsoon||Flooded areas, disrupted train services, halted traffic and stranded citizens — nothing went off script in Mumbai’s monsoon story, right from day one, as heavy rain lashed the city and its suburbs on Wednesday, washing away the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) claims of having completed pre-monsoon work. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) declared the arrival of the south-west monsoon in Mumbai, two days prior to the official onset date, as between 8am and 5.30pm, the island city recorded 102mm rain, eastern suburbs received 169mm and western suburbs got 137mm. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal and mayor Kishori Pednekar blamed the excess rain within a short time for the city’s flooding woes. “No one claimed that there will be no waterlogging in Mumbai due to heavy rain, nor can anyone make such a claim. But after waterlogging, if the water does not recede within four hours, we can say that pre-monsoon work has not been done properly,” said Pednekar. Chahal said, “Between 9am and 10am, areas like Sion and Chunabhatti received 55-60 mm rain. Owing to this, rain water flooded railway tracks. Road and railway traffic is affected only at three spots, namely Dahisar subway, Sion and Chunabhatti.” The city’s flooding situation prompted chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to visit BMC’s disaster management control room to take stock of the situation. While the BMC blamed excess rain and high tide for the waterlogging, citizens pointed out the insufficient cleaning by authorities.Activists said rainwater accumulated across several areas in the morning did not drain out even by 4pm, despite the rain receding. According to the BMC, waterlogging was reported at 13 locations, including seven areas in the island city (Hindmata, Sion, Sion bridge, Kalachowkie, Matunga, Dadar TT and BPT Colony). Further, two locations in Kurla and Mankhurd were flooded, along with four spots in the western suburbs — Milan, Malad, Khar and Andheri subways. Rainwater started accumulating in several parts of the city as floodgates were closed in the morning, owing to a high tide of 4.13m around 11.43am, officials said. Post this, several areas like Andheri subway, Milan subway, Sion, Matunga, Dadar TT, Postal Colony in Chembur witnessed waterlogging. In a span of 12 hours, between 5am and 5pm on Wednesday, the city received 137mm of rain, western suburbs got 190mm and eastern suburbs recorded 214mm. Most of this rain was between 9am and 2pm.A BMC official said, “This heavy rain coincided with high tide at 11.45am, because of which many nullahs (stormwater drains) and rivers were not able to empty the water into the sea. In all, we had installed 189 dewatering pumps at 445 locations.”The IMD had on Tuesday issued a yellow warning for the city, but by afternoon it was upgraded to a red alert, warning of very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall. An orange alert has been issued by the IMD till Sunday.Also, on Wednesday, a total of 32 tree-fall incidents were reported in the city and suburbs, followed by six incidents of house and wall collapses, and 14 incidents of short circuits. No injuries were reportedOn the waterlogging situation, Chahal said, “At Andheri subway, the construction of Mogra pumping station is the only solution and in the coming years, problems for Andheri subway will get resolved. Further, at Hindmata and Gandhi Market, our work is going on, and starting next month, we will see a change. But this time, we installed ramps at Hindmata due to which there was no disruption in traffic.”Pednekar said, “On the accumulation of water on railway tracks, we have been continuously coordinating with railway authorities. We are in continuous touch with railway authorities to ensure culverts are cleaned.”Nikhil Desai, a resident of Matunga and a civic activist, said, “The BMC claims there was waterlogging due to high tide, but waterlogging started at 9am. Also, after both high tide and rain stopped, water did not drain out immediately. It was only at 7pm that the water drained out. This has exposed the preparations done by BMC for monsoon.”On the other hand, Gautam Rao, a resident of Santacruz, said, “They spent ₹120 crore to build a pumping station in 2019, but still we see flooding around the Gazdar scheme and now the water accumulates at SV Road and Linking Road. The waterlogging started since 9am after hardly an hour of rainfall. We are witnessing waterlogging every time there is rain. The entire problem starts with the flawed design of the newly built pumping station.”Meanwhile, according to BMC officials, traffic was diverted at 17 locations — near Mankhurd station, Sion road no: 24, Antop Hill, Gandhi Market, Hindmata, Air India colony, National College in Bandra, RCF colony, Andheri Market, Oshiwara, Dahisar check naka, Chunabhatti station, Siddharth Nagar, Goregaon, among other spots. Traffic from the above locations was diverted owing to waterlogging in roads connecting these junctions. Viraj Mamania, a Borivli resident, said, “I travel to Dadar daily for office work, but on Wednesday I could not get out of my house due to waterlogging. We had complained to the BMC, but no one attended to the complaint and it was only by evening, that the water drained out on its own.” Meanwhile, the central and harbour lines of the Central Railway (CR) were suspended for almost the entire day. Meanwhile, corporators across party lines slammed the BMC and the mayor. Ravi Raja, leader of Opposition in the BMC and Congress corporator, said, “The mayor herself has indicated that one cannot stop water logging in the city. So, I feel the administration should come out in the open and say that waterlogging cannot not happen. Like every year, it is clear now that all tall claims made by the BMC get washed off in the first spell of rain.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-rain-woes-back-on-first-day-of-monsoon-101623264431179.html

The decision harmed the interests of people of Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh equally,” he said in a statement issued here.There is no clarity in the latest order issued by the Lt governor of Ladakh whether those applying for jobs will have to submit permanent residence certificates, as was the practice prior to 2019, or domicile certificates. Unlike Ladakh, the recruitment rules framed for J&K last year allowed all domiciles, even those who have been living in J&K for more than seven years or studying in the UT up to Class 12, to apply for jobs.Already a lot of corporate sector companies are working in Ladakh region and limited employment opportunities have been provided to the outsiders through them.“We once again reiterate that if the BJP government wants to correct its wrongs, it should restore the pre-August 2019 position of J&K. Taking half-hearted measures to appease one region or one community won’t work,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/reserving-jobs-for-ladakh-residents-a-half-hearted-effort-says-cpi-m-s-tarigami-101623264370621.html

Nonetheless, silence prevailed within the alliance for the last couple of months.The PAGD had last year held meetings in Jammu, Kashmir, and Kargil and participated in the DDC polls. It won 110 out of the 280 seats. The BJP won 75.J&K was stripped of its semi-autonomous status in August 2019 and split into two union territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stand-firm-on-article-370-j-k-bifurcation-says-gupkar-alliance-101623264313482.html

The matter has also been taken up with the higher authorities, but to no avail,” said Sharma.With mercury touching 44°C in Jammu on Wednesday — season’s highest so far — power supply has worsened across the region.A densely populated locality, Lakshmi Nagar in Sarwal area of the winter capital remained without electricity for over 36 hours after a transformer and transmission lines were damaged due to excessive load.On May 26, Lt governor Manoj Sinha had set an eight-hour deadline to replace damaged transformers in urban areas and 48 hours in rural areas.During the peak of summer, day temperatures soar past 47°C in Jammu.Sharma said, “JPDCL is toiling hard to meet the demand. Out of a requirement of 1530 MW in Jammu region, we are providing 1258 MW power. We are hopeful of meeting the deficit by the end of June.”He, however, urged the people to make judicious use of electricity and refrain from unethical practice of power pilferage.“We are augmenting our capacities, but due to Covid-19 pandemic, the process got a bit delayed. The augmentation projects will be completed by June-end. Our effort is to it improve power scenario across the region, but we also need active support from organisations, political parties and all individuals,” he said.Managing director Gurmeet Singh also appealed to the people to ensure there was no power theft.Urging them to inform JPDCL about power pilferage, he admitted that there may be black sheep within the system. “We need to expose them as well. If you come across such elements, let us know. Strict action will be taken against them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-depts-in-jammu-owe-1-800-crore-to-power-discom-101623264309864.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai got 43.6% of June’s average rain in nine hours||The south-west monsoon announced its arrival in Mumbai on Wednesday, two days prior to the official onset date of June 11, with 220.6mm rain between 8.30am and 5.30pm, according to data from the weather bureau’s Santacruz observatory — representative of the city. The downpour within nine hours has already accounted for 43.6% of the city’s average rainfall for June (505mm).The India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicts that the city may get another 200mm or more of rain between June 11 and June 13, and that heavy rain is likely to persist till at least June 15. The high probability of heavy to very heavy rains prompted the IMD on Wednesday to issue an “extremely severe weather warning” for the entire Konkan coast and some parts of Madhya Maharashtra till June 13. The IMD placed Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts under a red category storm warning on Wednesday (upgraded from the initial yellow category warning issued a day prior), although the intensity of rain significantly reduced after 3pm. From Thursday until Sunday, all seven coastal districts are placed under an orange category warning, indicating that local authorities should “be prepared” for “heavy to very heavy rainfall”.With rainfall accumulated due to pre-monsoon showers between June 1 and June 8, the city has already achieved 84% of June’s monthly average in just nine days. Mumbai has so far recorded 416.2mm of rain this month (until 5.30pm on June 9) against a monthly average of 493.1mm. For comparison, Mumbai received only 344.4 mm of rain in June 2020, its lowest average for the month in five years.There are two significant weather systems driving these torrential showers, including an upper air cyclonic circulation over the Arabian Sea, and a low pressure zone forming over the Bay of Bengal. Experts described these simultaneous circulations as having a “push and pull” effect on the monsoon trough, which has now entered most parts of interior Maharashtra, some parts of south Gujarat, parts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, most parts of central Bay of Bengal, and some more parts of north Bay of Bengal today. “Due to the strengthening of westerly winds along the west coast, along with the these circulations in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, dense moisture laden clouds are kept spinning over Mumbai resulting in heavy to very heavy showers,” said KS Hosalikar, senior scientist with the IMD in Pune. Weather models had not, until Wednesday, predicted the circulation in the north Arabian Sea, leading to heavier than expected rain on the day. Officials were reluctant to comment on the outlook for the season beyond June 15. “It will depend on what weather systems develop and where. For Mumbai, such heavy rain this early in June is certainly an abnormality, but it is likely to be an isolated event due to prevailing weather systems. Once they pass, Mumbai may get a break from high intensity, short bursts of rain. Drawing links with broader climate change conditions is not as easy in this case as it is with cyclones, for example,” said one meteorologist with a government institute in Pune, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-got-43-6-of-june-s-average-rain-in-nine-hours-101623264251016.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 9,000 more Covid deaths added after reconciliation||Since May 1, Maharashtra has added almost 9,000 deaths from Covid-19 under the category of “reconciliation deaths”, which has pushed the total fatality to 100,000 in the state, government data shows. The discrepancy that’s being corrected, though, has simply to do with delayed reporting rather than underreporting or misreporting of deaths. Public health experts say two things can explain this. First, the time-consuming process of fact-based categorisation of deaths as Covid and non-Covid as per rules laid down by the Indian Council of Medical Research. Second, the shortage of manpower and other resources during the more infectious and deadly second wave of the pandemic that led to delays in updating data on the centralised portal. Going by data provided by the state health department, between May 1 and June 7, as many as 22,099 deaths were recorded in the state of which 8,756 were added after reconciliation. Majority of the reconciliations have been from rural parts of the state such as Satara, Sangli, Aurangabad, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Bhandara, and Wardha. Here’s how the numbers add up: On Wednesday, the state recorded 261 Covid deaths, and an additional 400 deaths were reconciled, pushing up the state’s case fatality rate to 1.74%. The reconciled deaths, according to the state public health department’s daily press release, were deaths that occurred even earlier in various districts and corporations. Categorisation takes time Last year, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) issued guidelines based on the parameters provided by World Health Organisation (WHO) to categorise deaths into Covid and non-Covid. The aim was fact-based bifurcation of fatality cases related to Covid-19 infection. Dr Avinash Supe, chairman of the state’s death audit committee said, “Just because a patient has been diagnosed with Covid-19, doesn’t mean the cause of death is the infection. If a patient has severe comorbidities like chronic kidney disease or has recently undergone organ transplantation which has compromised the immunity, we have to check all medical reports of the patient before declaring it a Covid-19 death. We have to categorise such deaths by following the scientific parameters laid down by the ICMR and WHO. This process often takes between six-eight days.” In rural-peripheral parts of Maharashtra, all hospitals have to send updates of Covid-19 patients on the centralised ‘Facility app’ including time of admission, reference to other hospitals and death. Dr Sanjay Salunke, civil surgeon at Sangli, said most hospitals mention Covid-19 as the primary cause of death on the application. But it is officially confirmed only after the auditing team puts a confirmation stamp on it. “All districts have Covid death audit committees that examine health complications or casualties that are part of the deceased patient’s medical reports before confirming the death as Covid or non-Covid. If a deceased patient had too many health complications which the district-level experts fail to categorise, then it is referred to the state audit committee,” he said. Citing an example, Salunke said when a person meets with an accident and comes to the casualty ward, he undergoes RT-PCR test for Covid-19 as per rules. If he is found Covid-19 positive, but dies because of a head trauma, it can’t be categorised as a Covid-19 death. “There are a few parameters that need to be checked like positive RT-PCR report, CT scan findings, inflammatory markers and upper respiratory infections. If the deceased person had severe comorbidities, we also clinically examine them,” said Dr Vishal Rakh, professor, community medicine, BYL Nair hospital. “A death certificate has two sections, underlying and immediate. If a Covid-19 infected patient had upper respiratory syndrome, it is counted under immediate. Other comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes and kidney ailment comes under underlying,” Rakh added. Since last year, public health experts have been regularly updating backlog death data into total fatality, and said similar exercise of death reconciliation is observed across all Indian states. “We aren’t trying to hide any deaths. We are just filtering the deaths as per the category laid down by ICMR and providing fact-based information which is more transparent,” said Dr Suryakant Gitte, civil surgeon, Beed. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, 2,862 deaths in the state have been categorised as non-Covid deaths after reconciliation by the audit committees. Of these, 2,181 are from Mumbai followed by Wardha with 151 non-Covid deaths. Delay in update on centralised portalWith the outbreak of the second wave, in the middle of February, hospitals got overwhelmed with a large inflow of Covid-19 patients. Many with manpower crunch were struggling to attend to patients. As a result, timely upgradation of data on the centralised portal took a backseat. “Each hospital has one-two staff members in the monitoring cell who are responsible for updating the data. But during the peak of the pandemic, all hands were on deck. So, there have been delays in data update,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer.“This also delayed the physical documentation of the deceased patients,” he added. Along with this, many hospitals in rural parts of Sangli, Nanded and Wardha also faced infrastructural issues. “There have been regular issues of load shedding, many centres don’t even have fax machines,” said an officer from Wardha. The state health department have held a series of meetings with the districts to discuss the delay in reporting deaths. “We have decided to form WhatsApp groups so that district-level experts can directly communicate with higher officers if they are confused about categorisation of deaths due to underlying health complications,” said Dr Supe. On Sunday, Maharashtra went past the grim mark of 100,000 Covid-19 fatalities, 15 months after it recorded its first death due to the virus on March 17, 2020. However, the overall mortality rate has gone down compared to last year. This year, the case fatality rate (CFR) is 1.2%, which was 2.3% in 2020. Talking to HT, Dr Supe said, “In 2020, we had 19 lakh cases, now (this year) we have nearly 40 lakh cases. Nearly 50,000 deaths happened in the first year. Among the 40 lakh cases, we had an equal number of deaths. So, it is important to see that even after cases doubled, the fatalities remained the same. However, the deaths this year have come in a shorter time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-9-000-more-covid-deaths-added-after-reconciliation-101623264250504.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||DU collects data on students to lost parents to Covid-19||: Delhi University colleges are collecting data on students who lost their parents to Covid-19, as part of a programme to subsidise their education in the varsity, senior officials said on Wednesday, a plan that was formulated in the wake of a brutal nationwide second wave of infections that claimed over 160,000 lives in April and May alone.While paying tribute to staff and students of the university who died of Covid-19, acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi on Friday said the university will work towards clearing payments due to the deceased employees and to provide “free education to all Delhi University students who lost their parents in this pandemic till they are in the university.”The DU administration on Monday asked colleges to furnish information on the number of students who lost either or both of their parents to the infection. Several principals HT spoke to said compiling the information will take some time due to the ongoing semester exams, the scale of the task, as well as the limited physical interaction with students due to the pandemic, while others noted that several students’ will take time to come to terms with the loss of a loved one.Manoj Sinha, principal of Aryabhatta College and general secretary of the DU Principals’ Association (DUPA), said that since around 2,200 students are enrolled in the college, departments will take time to confirm the numbers.“We have asked our departments and teachers from the mentorship programme to contact the batches of students under them and find out what they need. We have also put a notice up on the college website asking students to step forward and inform us about the death of their parents so that appropriate steps can be taken to help them,” he said.He said the institution will also analyse each case and decide on the best appropriate aid for each student, adding that some students may need non-financial aid as well.“Students from affluent families may not need help paying the fees, but might require a social support system... Even during the pandemic, we reached out to people to arrange for funds for students who were unable to pay their fee due to loss of income [in the family] during the pandemic,” he said.Other institutions such as Hansraj College, Lady Shri Ram College for Women, Indraprastha College for Women, and Ramjas College have sent student mails and asked teachers and departments to work on collecting the information required. Many principals said that some of the students were still hesitant to step forward with the information as they will still processing their grief.“It is not easy for a child to step forward and say they lost their parent to Covid-19. Many of these students have neither connected with the teachers nor come to college due to online classes. We are still compiling the information. So far, around 20 students in our college have lost either of their parents,” said Bijayalaxmi Nanda, principal of Miranda House. “We are also creating mental health support groups for all students especially those who have lost parents or family members. Grief counselling initiatives have also been started.”The university has also started an online and tele-counselling initiative for individuals and families affected by Covid-19 in collaboration with the District Magistrate (Central District) through helpline number 1149127700. The initiative aims to provide counselling advice and emotional support for the rehabilitation of people affected by Covid.DU registrar Vikas Gupta said, “We are currently in the process of taking stock of the situation, collecting the data, and it will be a time consuming process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-collects-data-on-students-to-lost-parents-to-covid19-101623264011208.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||Antilia explosives scare: NIA gets two more months to file charge sheet||The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Wednesday granted the federal agency two more months to file charge sheet against five accused booked in connection with the Antilia explosives scare case and the subsequent murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran. The investigation agency sought 90 days extension for filing charge sheet, over and above 90 days from the date of first remand of the accused, under provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). In the Antilia scare and murder cases, the period of first 90 days will end on June 10. Hence, NIA had last week moved a plea before the special court, seeking extension to complete the probe and file the charge sheet.However, the special court on Wednesday granted NIA extension of 60 days and said, “There are many aspects in which investigation is carried out. Because of the complicity of the matter, it requires more time for thorough investigation. The tentacles of the investigation are deep rooted; hence, it requires more time to search out each and every cause.” NIA, in its application, claimed that the possible involvement of a terrorist organisation, Jaish-ul-Hind, and its alleged demand for money from industrialist Mukesh Ambani need a deeper probe. The plea was opposed by defence advocates Sudeep Pasbola for Sachin Vaze and Vaibhav Baghade for Sunil Mane who claimed the charges of UAPA are not applicable in the case. The defence argued that the prosecution submitted the progress report in the sealed envelope which was not provided to them. The lawyers argued that the accused must know the reason for detention or extension of custody period as part of fundamental rights.NIA had, however, claimed that the report was based on confidential information, and therefore the court refused to share the report with defence lawyers.While objecting to the extension, Pasbola argued that gelatin sticks cannot explode without a detonator and hence there was no actual threat to the society. He added that the accused has always co-operated with the investigating agency and all the articles are already recovered and nothing was left to be investigated. “There was no conspiracy about terror and in absence of the intention, there is no conspiracy or intent to terror,” Pasbola argued.He further submitted that there must be progress in investigation but it has not found any place in the application. Baghade argued that analysis was not an investigation and further contended that the prosecution has not complied with provisions related to UAPA and Criminal Procedure Code while seeking extension to file the charge sheet. Baghade argued that his client, Sunil Mane, had no role in the Antilia case but his role is shown only in the subsequent murder case. In view of this, he argued that UAPA charged were not applicable in his case.On February 25, a Mahindra Scorpio was found abandoned near Antilia, industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence, with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note addressed to the businessman. A case was registered with Gamdevi police station on the same day. Vaze was originally in charge of the investigation but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, the owner of the SUV, who had reported it stolen on February 17. On March 5, Hiran was found dead in a creek near Mumbra. It subsequently emerged that Vaze had borrowed the car from Hiran in November and returned it in early February. NIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and the murder case on March 24.To contain the damage, the Maharashtra government transferred Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh for his alleged management of the case. The police officer subsequently wrote a letter to the chief minister, alleging that the then home minister Anil Deshmukh had instructed Vaze and some other Mumbai Police officers to extort ₹100 crore from bars, restaurants, and hookah parlours, and when no action was forthcoming, approached the courts.The Bombay HC eventually asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the matter, prompting Deshmukh’s resignation. Accordingly, CBI conducted the preliminary inquiry and registered an offence against Deshmukh on April 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-explosives-scare-nia-gets-two-more-months-to-file-charge-sheet-101623264010587.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||Member of Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party arrested in sexual assault case||A member of Shivpal Singh Yadav-led Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia), who was aspiring to contest the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections from the Meerut Cantonment seat on the party’s ticket, was arrested by the Delhi Police in connection with a sexual assault case registered at south Delhi’s New Friends Colony (NFC) police station, officers associated with the probe said on Wednesday.Police said party leader Rohit Pandey, who is also the part owner of a real estate company, was arrested from his house in Meerut’s Ansal Town, following a search conducted by the NFC police team on Monday night. The Meerut police also confirmed Pandey’s arrest from his home, which comes under the territorial jurisdiction of Pallavpuram police station.His two friends have also been arrested in the same case and all three have been sent to judicial custody, the police said.“The Delhi Police team arrested Pandey and informed us that he was wanted in a case registered under Indian Penal Code Section 376D at the NFC police station. They did not inform us before the search; we were telephonically informed about Pandey’s arrest and that they were taking him to Delhi,” said Devesh Kumar Sharma, station officer (SO) of Pallavpuram police station.Deputy commissioner of police (south-east) RP Meena said a woman had filed a complaint at the NFC police station stating that she was sexually assaulted by two persons – Pandey and his friend – in the NFC area and again by three persons – Pandey and his two friends – in Shilma, Himachal Pradesh. Accordingly, a case was registered on June 6 and Pandey and his two friends were arrested on June 7, Meena said.Since the test identification parade (TIP) of Pandey’s two associates is yet to be conducted, the police have withheld their names.Police said the allegations pertain to a crime that took place a “long time ago” -- they did not disclose any dates -- and added that they are “investigating the entire case thoroughly”.Deepak Mishra, chief spokesperson of the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia), said he was aware of the charges under which Pandey was arrested, even as the police have not officially communicated anything about the case or the arrest. He said Pandey was a member of the party but did not hold any post or portfolio.Confirming that Pandey had claimed a candidacy for Meerut Cantonment assembly seat in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Mishra said the party leadership has not yet announced Pandey as the candidate.“We have sought details from the party’s Meerut district unit about Pandey and the crime for which he has been arrested.

We want to create a space for our teachers and their students for sharing, and meaningful dialogue and listening before the resumption of teaching-learning activities,” said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia at the first online workshop with this year’s Inter-Faith 20 (IF20) Education Working Group. IF20 is an international platform for discussions with experts and leaders on various subjects aiming to share recommendations that would help shape the G20 (an international forum for the governments of 19 countries and the European Union) and the global policy agendas.The state government has partnered with the Guerrand-Hermès Foundation for Peace Institute (GHFP) for the IF20 Education Working Group (IF20 Edu WG) initiative on how education can contribute to “healing and well-being.” The education minister said teachers need to be emotionally ready to support their students following a difficult time due to the pandemic. The initiative will help teachers to prepare themselves for the task, he said. Experts associated with GHFP will be conducting a three-day session with mentor teachers in Delhi government schools, who will conduct similar sessions with two teachers at each public school. “These two teachers will then help the fellow teachers in their own schools to initiate dialogue with their students and parents if needed,” the government said.“Pandemic has given us the opportunity to re-imagine schooling and adapt it to the new emerging realities. We need to ask the question that whether we want to start teaching right away or do we want to give the space for the teachers and students to reconnect with each other. For us, school reopening is not just about opening the books; it’s about opening the heart and mind to reconnect with each other,” Sisodia said during the workshop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/workshops-for-govt-teachers-to-facilitate-deep-learning-101623263950502.html
10-06-2021||Other||Terror accused claims he was beaten in Tihar jail, officials reject claim||A plea has been filed in a Delhi court on Wednesday by an alleged ISIS member--arrested for planning suicide attacks and serial blasts across the country--claiming that he was beaten up by other inmates in Tihar jail and forced to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’. Tihar jail officials have denied the allegations. Rashid Zafar was arrested in December 2018 on the allegations of being a member of an ISIS-inspired group, which was planning suicide attacks and serial blasts targeting politicians and government installations in Delhi and other parts of north India. Advocate M S Khan, who represented Zafar’s plea, said his client disclosed the incident to his father telephonically from Tihar Jail.The plea said Zafar was beaten up and forced to chant religious slogans like ‘Jai Shri Ram’ by his inmates. It has sought appropriate directions be passed to the jail superintendent to look into the matter.Tihar jail officers said that the allegations made by the prisoner are false. Sandeep Goel, the prison’s director general, said, “ The prisoner had gone to the jail dispensary duly escorted by the jail guards. While returning he ran towards another ward, where he was not supposed to go. He is a prisoner from a high-security jail. Our jail guards tried to stop him from going to that different ward. During that process, he got violent and inflicted injuries on himself. We got his medical examination done at the prison hospital. The injuries were not of serious nature. He has now come up with these allegations. Prima facie the allegations are false but we are still conducting an inquiry into it.”Zafar was arrested, along with nine others, after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) carried out searches, in coordination with the special cell of Delhi Police and the Anti-Terrorism Squad of Uttar Pradesh Police, at six places in Jafrabad and Seelampur in Delhi, and 11 places in Uttar Pradesh. The searches and the arrests came a month before the Republic Day celebrations on January 26.According to NIA, a locally-made rocket launcher, material for suicide vests and 112 alarm clocks to be used as timers were recovered from the searches.The agency also said it recovered 25kg of explosive material, such as potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate and sulphur.The group had also allegedly purchased remote control cars and wireless doorbells to use circuits in assembling remote-controlled improvised explosive devices. Besides, the NIA also recovered steel containers, electric wires, 91 mobile phones, 134 SIM cards, three laptops, knife, sword and ISIS-related literature during the searches.The probe agency had initially rounded up 16 people of the group ‘Harkat ul Harb e Islam’, which loosely translates into war for the cause of Islam.Of the 16 detained, 10 were later arrested - five from Amroha in UP and five from Seelampur and Jafrabad localities in north-east Delhi, the agency had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/terror-accused-claims-he-was-beaten-in-tihar-jail-officials-reject-claim-101623263949922.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||Pharmacies in Delhi continue to update stock of Covid-19 medicines despite drop in cases||Pharmacies across the city still have to keep updating the stock and prices of eight medicines used for the treatment of Covid-19 on a display board despite there being a significant drop in the number of infections in the Capital. The Retail Distributions and Chemists Association (RDCA)-Delhi has written to the chief minister, health minister, and Lieutenant Governor, asking them to withdraw an order dated May 22 that stipulates the said action but is yet to receive a response. The eight medicines for which the drug stores were asked to display stock position and price includes medicines, such as iveremectin and favipiravir, prescribed to mild Covid-19 patients, and steroids, such as budesonide and dexamethasone, prescribed to moderate and severe patients suffering from the viral infection. “Everyone has to update the stock position every few hours; there isn’t much demand for the medicines now that the Covid-19 cases have gone down. We have written to the authorities asking them to withdraw the order as it is no longer relevant. Some of the medicines have also been removed from the treatment guidelines,” said Sandeep Nangia, president of RDCA. The new guidelines, released by the Union health ministry’s directorate general of health service this week, has dropped all medicines, other than those meant for fever and cold, for mild cases from the treatment. The association wrote to the Delhi government even at the time when the guidelines were released suggesting that the stock position need not be displayed. “We suggested that drug stores should just mention whether medicines are available or not available on the display board. What use is it for a customer to know whether the shop has 500 strips of the medicine or not? All the medicines are under schedule H or H1 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, so the stores have to maintain register of their stock and sale. The drug department can check that to prevent black-marketing although there hasn’t been a single case of a drug store selling medicines more than the MRP,” said Nangia. He added, “An issue that a lot of people faced was that they would say that so many doses of a particular medicine are available but there are several brands manufacturing these medicines. If the doctor prescribes a glaxo (name of the company) drug, we cannot substitute it for a cipla drug, to which many customers protested.” The office of the Delhi’s drug controller could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pharmacies-in-delhi-continue-to-update-stock-of-covid-19-medicines-despite-drop-in-cases-101623263949322.html

All 368 vaccine sites set up by the Delhi government for the 18-45 group last month were suspended for more than two weeks in the light of shortage of both Covishield and Covaxin. For the 45+ group, around 306 centres out of 720 were suspended over the last one week for shortage of Covaxin.Government officials said the stock situation is getting better now. As on Wednesday, the Delhi government had 95 vaccine centres spread across 35 locations for the 18-45 age group and 482 vaccine centres spread across 338 locations for the 45+ group.“The government has also opened on-the-spot registration for all beneficiaries in the state-run centres for the 45+ group and plans to start the same for beneficiaries in the 18-45 group, but for only for those scheduled for the second dose,” said a senior official. This initiative is in line with the directions issued by the central government on Tuesday.“Yesterday (Tuesday) late-evening, Delhi government received 30,000 doses of Covaxin for the 45+ group. Number of vaccine centres is likely to go up from Thursday. Covaxin centres will be open only for people scheduled for the second dose. There is no availability issue with Covishield. We have 27 days’ stock for the 45+ group,” said AAP legislator Atishi while reading out the Delhi government’s health bulletin in a video briefing on Wednesday.She further said, “For the 18-45 group, we have received 125,000 doses of Covishield and 20,000 doses of Covaxin. Centres offering Covaxin are only catering to people scheduled for the second dose. We are happy to announce that vaccination for the 18-45 group in government centres have resumed again. I urge people to book their slots and get vaccinated. We have sufficient stock for eight days and we hope to get more deliveries before the government-run centres run out of stock.” So far, around 4.44 million in Delhi have got one dose and 1.34 million have got both doses, showed government records. The city has a population of around 20 million of which 15 million are eligible for vaccination.Chief minister takes stock of jab booths Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday visited a temporary vaccine site set up by the government under its “Jahan vote, Wahan vaccine” initiative, which is aimed at increasing vaccine coverage among the 45+ population through door-to-door awareness drives and convincing them to take the shots at vaccine sites set up at their nearest polling centres.Under the initiative that has been planned across four weeks, the government shall choose 70 municipal wards in the city every week. All AAP MLAs and leaders are participating in the drive which is primarily being conducted by booth level officers. “We have received an overwhelming response to this campaign of the Delhi government. We have also arranged for e-rickshaws to travel from home to vaccination sites. Just like BLOs give slips door to door before voting, in the same way, they are giving slips of scheduled slots to people for vaccination. Those who do not come to the centre to get the jab even after getting the slot, the BLO will go again to their house and clear doubts,” said Kejriwal.He further said, “Various kinds of rumours are rapidly spreading, thereby increasing vaccine hesitancy. It is the responsibility of all of us to dispel them. Within the next four weeks, the entire population of 45+ will be vaccinated with the first dose all over Delhi. Our electoral structure is competent enough. If we use it all over the country, we can vaccinate everyone in two to three months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jab-centres-in-delhi-reopen-as-vaccine-supply-stabilises-101623263891041.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi-based rapper MC Kode, who went missing on June 2, traced to Jabalpur||A week after Delhi-based amateur rapper, MC Kode, went missing after allegedly posting a suicide note on Instragram, police have traced him to Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday.His mother had filed the missing person complaint last Thursday, police said. Based on her compliant, a kidnapping case was registered and multiple teams were searching for the rapper, whose given name is Aditya Tiwari. Police said he had recently faced flak on social media for a 2016 video in which he allegedly made derogatory comments about a religion and the Indian army.Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur said on June 4, Aditya’s mother Deepa Tiwari filed the missing person report in which she said Aditya was missing since June 2. She also told the police that her son had allegedly uploaded a suicide note on his Instagram account and later, his mobile phone was found to be switched off.“We registered a case and made efforts through the human intelligence network and technical surveillance to find Aditya. Through a source, we learnt that Aditya may be living with his friend in Jabalpur. A team was sent there and he was found at the house of his friend, who had studied with him in college,” said Thakur.The team members have left Jabalpur with Aditya and are likely to reach Delhi by Thursday. Aditya told the police that he left Delhi for Madhya Pradesh on June 2 itself. After reaching Jabalpur, he stayed at different places before moving to his friend’s home. “We will ask him the reason for his recent actions once he reaches Delhi,” added the DCP.Deepa Tiwari said she will now file a complaint over the “mental harassment, threat and trolling” that her son had to face on social media, which she claimed made him take the steps that he did.“I had last seen Aditya on May 26. The video surfaced around May 20 and till June 1, he was with friends. It was only on June 2 that I came across his suicide post and tried contacting him. However, his phone was switched off. I panicked and approached the police,” she said.“The person who dug up my son’s five to six years old video and began harassing him has disappeared from social media. We will file a complaint and seek police help to go after the people who put my son under extreme mental stress,” Deepa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhibased-rapper-who-went-missing-on-june-2-traced-to-jabalpur-101623263890407.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||Dust carrying winds push AQI to very poor, minimum temp highest this year||High-velocity winds, carrying dust from the deserts of Rajasthan, continued to blow over Delhi on Wednesday, pushing the air quality in the national capital into the “very poor” category for the first time since this February. The layer of dust over Delhi-NCR also kept the night temperature from falling, with the result that Wednesday recorded a minimum temperature of 31.4 degrees Celsius, the highest so far this year, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings show that on Wednesday, the overall air quality index (AQI) in Delhi was 305, categorised as ”very poor” on the AQI scale. On Tuesday, the average AQI was 205, in the “poor” category. On the AQI scale of 0 to 500, a reading between 200-300 is rated as “poor”, while that between 300-400 is classified as “very poor”.IMD scientists said dusty south-westerly winds have been blowing through the national capital since Tuesday, spiking pollution levels. Pollution recordings confirmed that PM10 (coarse particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 micrometres) was the primary pollutant in Wednesday’s foul air.At 5pm Wednesday, the PM10 level peaked at 384ug/m3, over three times higher than the acceptable standard of 100ug/m3 in India.Experts said now that Delhi is on its way to unlocking the economy, focus should be on managing pollution sources to prevent such spikes.Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) said, “Cities across the country need to tackle dispersed sources of pollution such as open burning of waste, dust from construction sites and unpaved roads. Pollution control boards and urban local bodies should have dedicated field inspection teams to identify such sources and ensure that they are addressed. Secondly, we need robust citizen grievance redressal mechanisms. The Green Delhi app is a great move but citizens should be encouraged to use it more actively.”Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said, “Post-noon on Wednesday, the dust film over Delhi cleared up a bit, but since pollution observatories take a 24-hour average of pollutants, an improvement will be visible on the charts only on Thursday.”Srivastava also pointed out that this layer of dust as well as clouds were keeping the minimum temperature higher than normal.The Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the entire city, recorded a minimum temperature of 31.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, which was four degrees above what is considered normal for this time of the year. The maximum temperature was 42.2 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal.“The layer of dust and the clouds trapped the heat from the surface and did not allow the ground to cool off. This kept the minimum temperature high. Wednesday’s is the highest minimum temperature that Delhi has recorded this year,” Srivastava said.The IMD forecast, however, said that Delhi will get rain from June 12, bringing some relief from the simmering heat. Under the impact of a low-pressure system, which is forming north of the Bay of Bengal, the wind direction over Delhi will change to easterly from late Friday night, which will result in light rainfall in parts of Delhi and NCR.From Sunday, the intensity of rainfall will increase and, as a result, the temperature will also fall to below 40 degrees Celsius.“We are expecting moderate rainfall across Delhi while parts of NCR may receive heavy showers. From June 12, the temperature will start decreasing again,” a senior IMD official confirmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dust-carrying-winds-push-air-quality-to-very-poor-minimum-temp-highest-this-year-101623263889189.html

Deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said the police control room received a call at 4.30pm alerting them about a building collapse. A police team reached there and learnt that the digging work at an under-construction building had caused a portion of the adjacent house to collapse and that one person was trapped under the debris. The police team along with the rescue teams from the fire department removed the debris and found the man who was injured and unconscious. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead. Police later identified him as Ishan Sethi, from Mussoorie in Uttarakhand. DCP Thakur said a case was registered and the building contractors, Vikas Bhayana and Rahul Bhayana, were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-student-dies-as-portion-of-building-collapses-in-panchsheel-park-101623263832742.html
10-06-2021||Other||Draft Master Plan recommends annual ‘Renewable Energy Plan’ in Delhi||Delhi on Wednesday recorded this year’s highest peak power demand so far at 6,185 MW, and 80% of the supply continued to come from polluting coal-fired thermal power plants. In this context, the Master Plan of Delhi (MPD) 2041 proposes to mandate that Delhi have an annual “Renewable Energy Plan” that identifies potential energy generation areas within the city along with strategies and projects to meet the targets outlined by the Union ministry of new and renewable energy. To ensure a digitally enabled and connected city, it also suggests total fibre-optic coverage to enable 5G in the future.Real-time data from the State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC) showed that the peak power demand of Delhi was 6,185 MW at 2.45pm on Wednesday. It was 5,808 MW on Tuesday and 5,559 MW on Monday. Delhi’s peak power demand recorded last year was 6,314 MW on June 29. It was lower than the all-time high peak power demand of 7,409 MW on July 2 the previous year because of the lockdown.The MPD also mandates all agencies to adopt strategies to manage peak load demand. “Promote mixed use, permit select commercial/recreational spaces to function for 24 hours and promote night economy. Set up large public screenings of sporting and other events etc. Examine feasibility of shared heating and cooling systems. Use vacant office buildings/ schools etc., for night parking and EV (electric vehicle) charging. Promote EV battery swapping during peak hours and permit EV charging only during non-peak hours,” it states.To increase Delhi’s share in green or renewable energy, the draft MPD has emphasised on solar power generation. To be sure, the city administration in 2016 rolled out a Delhi Solar Policy to achieve this. The MPD has asked the government to expedite its agriculture-cum-solar farm scheme by incentivising landowners to set up solar farms on their agricultural lands.“Delhi has a number of canals that can be utilised for harnessing solar energy as per feasibility. The canal owning agencies may leverage this potential for the generation of solar energy. Government buildings and institutional campuses with a rooftop area above 500 sq.m to install solar PVs (photovoltaics) as per Delhi Solar Policy 2016 and Net Metering Regulations, 2014. Large-scale public facilities such as airports, Metro stations, railway stations, interstate and city-level bus stations/depots, stadiums etc., may progressively meet the majority of their power requirements through solar and other renewable energy,” the document said.It also calls for setting up data centres to meet the need for data storage and server management, and for unified command and control centres to be set up by the local bodies as drivers for effective urban management, especially traffic, safety, and disaster response, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/draft-master-plan-recommends-annual-renewable-energy-plan-in-delhi-101623263831330.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||Origin of ransomware attack on MIDC server traced to Bulgaria||Mumbai cyber police, which is investigating the ransomware attack on Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) servers in March this year, has traced the origin of the attack to Bulgaria and approached the east European country for obtaining details of the suspects involved in the attack.Initially, cyber police suspected involvement of cyber criminals from Russia-Kazakhstan region, but the probe has indicated involvement of cyber criminals from Bulgaria. Following this, official channels have been activated to seek help from concerned foreign authorities to nab the culprits, confirmed a senior IPS officer from Mumbai Police.Cyber expert Prashant Mali said, “East European countries like Bulgaria and Romania have many hacker gangs and there are several layers of members from different countries who feed on ransom money earned by targeting sleepy organisations with less or bad cyber security controls. They majorly deal in Bitcoins for ransom.”On March 21 at 2.30am, a ransomware, SYNack, attacked the MIDC system. The attack was on the local server system to take unauthorised access of the computer system of MIDC and encrypted data. Because of this, MIDC personnel could not use the system data for over a week. This also damaged computers at the corporation’s 16 regional offices. The email sent by the attackers explained the kind of attack and their demand for ransom, the police said. Ten days later, MIDC filed an official complaint with the cyber police on April 1. It is being alleged that the hackers had demanded ₹500 crore ransom, however, neither the police nor MIDC officials confirmed the amount. “The first information report (FIR) too did not mention the ₹500-crore ransom amount,” a senior police officer said. After the attack, all computers were disconnected from the server. The corporation also asked all its departments to shut the system and not to switch on computers until issues were resolved completely. This had caused disruption of services across the state. Earlier, MIDC claimed that all their systems were hosted on ESDS (cloud service provider) and local server of the corporation and for security and maintenance purpose, the corporation was using a well-known anti-virus. It claimed that as backup files of its website, single-window clearance system, building plan approval management system (BPAMS), ERP (enterprise resource planning), computerised land distribution system, water bills, etc. are stored on different networks, they are all safe. Later, the services were restored. A team of cyber police officers had visited the MIDC office, made enquiries with technical staff there to understand the nature of attack.MIDC CEO P Anbalagan said, “Our system is well on track with no loss of data. We are going to build further security features.”Earlier, an attempted cyber sabotage allegedly by a Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat group had caused massive power outage in Mumbai last October. Then home minister Anil Deshmukh had said that the Maharashtra cyber police had found evidence which suggested that the grid failure in Mumbai on October 12 last year, which resulted in the city plunging into darkness, disrupting train services and shutting down the stock market, was likely a cyber sabotage. The New York Times, citing a report by a US-based cyber security firm, had claimed the Chinese-state sponsored groups had targeted power sector in India with malware. This came months after the clash between troops of the two nations in Galwan valley in June 2020. BOXIn 2013, two Bulgarian nationals — Tsenev Yulian Georgiev and Ivanov Kalin Ivanoy — allegedly fitted ATM machines with skimming devices at an Axis bank ATM kiosk outside DGP’s office in Colaba to steal data of debit cards. The duo had cloned ATM cards using the stolen data and later withdrew the money in Greece from bank accounts of 79 citizens of Mumbai to the tune of ₹22,88,229. Police probe revealed that the two were part of a huge international fraud syndicate as the withdrawal of money using the cloned cards were done after more than a month’s time, leaving no time for investigators to get on the trail of the accused. Of the 79 victims in the Colaba case, 15 were the policemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/origin-of-ransomware-attack-on-midc-server-traced-to-bulgaria-101623263830475.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||List steps to address jab booking problems faced by Mumbaiites: HC to state||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked the state government and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as to why the authorities were unable to provide vaccination booking options for more than a day to city residents, while other districts, including Kolhapur, Hingoli, and Nashik, were offering week or month-long vaccination slots. The HC query was prompted after the petitioner apprised the bench that due to the one-day booking option, which was getting filled up within minutes of being made available on the booking portal, city residents were unable to ascertain when they would be getting the jab. The court also asked the authorities to consider and respond to the six suggestions submitted by the petitioner to streamline the vaccination process. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Yogeeta Vanzara through advocate Jamsheed Master was informed that vaccination booking portal CoWIN was giving slots only for a day, and as there was no fixed time for booking, citizens were facing problems in getting an appointment. In light of this problem, the petition sought a separate portal for booking slots in government and civic-run hospital for Mumbai. Master informed the bench that as per its directions on June 2, the petitioner had prepared a list of suggestions for the Centre and state government which included making available a weekly plan for vaccination, opening of booking slots at fixed time, monitoring of vaccination centres by city task force or ward health officers and walk-in facility for economically backward persons or those without smart phones. It is also suggested that technical experts and system specialists from IIT-Bombay be roped in to ensure vaccination facilities are being offered to marginalised and underprivileged communities and walk-in facility for persons between the age of 18 to 44 years having comorbidities was conducted smoothly. Master submitted that in parts of the state, vaccination slots were made available well in advance, at times a week or month prior, and urged that the same be done in Mumbai as well. Senior Counsel Anil Sakhare for BMC submitted that the vaccination quota is allocated by the state government and the civic authority can arrange a weekly programme only if it receives weekly quota in advance.However, additional government pleader Geeta Shastri for the state informed the bench that allocating weekly quota was subject to availability of stocks of jabs.After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that administrative decisions should be left to the local authorities and the state should look into the suggestions. “If the state feels that some of the suggestions are workable, it does not need to wait for court orders to implement them,” said the bench. Seeking an affidavit in reply to the suggestions made by petitioner from the state, HC posted further hearing to June 17. The bench also asked authorities to address issues raised in other PILs including lack of awareness and access to vaccination in rural areas, steps for vaccinating mentally ill persons, sex workers and transgender persons and those not having requisite documents like identity cards for getting jabs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/list-steps-to-address-jab-booking-problems-faced-by-mumbaiites-hc-to-state-101623263829896.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Covid-19 positivity rate below 1% for 10th day in a row||For the 10th consecutive day on Wednesday, the Covid-19 positivity rate -- proportion of samples that return positive of the total tested – was under 1% in Delhi, even as the national capital reported 337 new cases of Covid-19, the government’s daily health bulletin said.Wednesday’s positivity rate was 0.46% after testing 73,241 samples. The infection has so far affected over 1.43 million people in the city, according to the data. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Covid-19 spread in an area is considered to be under control if the test positivity rate remains below 5% for at least 14 consecutive days.On Wednesday, Delhi also added 36 deaths due to the viral infection, taking the total toll to 24,704 since the first death was recorded on March 13 last year.With the declining number of cases, the seven day rolling average case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – has shot up to 12.4% on Wednesday.The cumulative CFR – based on the total number of cases and deaths -- stands at 1.73% so far, as compared to the national average of 1.22%.With the second wave of infections in Delhi subsiding, the government is busy preparing for a third wave. It has started the unlock process, in which markets were allowed to open from Monday on an odd-even basis, along with malls. Delhi Metro also started operations with 50% capacity.The April-May surge in cases was the worst Delhi has seen with over 28,000 cases and 277 deaths being reported on April 20, rising to 306 fatalities on April 22. On May 3, the city registered a record 448 deaths and 18,043 cases, according to the state health bulletin.The city also faced an acute shortage of oxygen by April-end as hospitals saw a large number of critical Covid-19 patients.Experts warned that while preparing for a possible third wave, it was important to keep an eye out for new variants. “Before planning for a third wave, we need to see why such a devastating second wave had happened. It happened because a new and more infectious Delta variant of the virus was circulating since December which was given an opportunity to spread. We missed the new variant. Now, we need to ensure that we do enough genomic sequencing so that we do not miss any new variants,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-positivity-rate-below-1-for-10th-day-in-a-row-101623263829294.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||Emphasis on promotion of rental housing, no more mixed land use streets||The draft Master Plan of Delhi-2041 focuses on promoting rental housing and development of small format housing in the Capital, advocating a paradigm shift in DDA’s role from developer to facilitator in the housing sector with the private sector taking the lead in implementation of policies such as land pooling.The draft plan also proposes major changes in the development control norms to preserve the residential character of localities and prevent rampant commercialisation while allowing mixed-use development.The plan was placed in the public domain on Wednesday to invite objections and suggestions from the citizens. Once approved and notified by the Centre, the master plan will provide a policy framework for the development of the Capital. It has been prepared by DDA.Emphasis on rental housing“There is a need to address the housing needs of students, single working men and women, migrants, etc. through affordable housing, rental housing, hostels, studio apartments, serviced apartments, dormitories, etc,” the draft read. It also said the large unsold housing stock may also be brought back into circulation through the rental option.Rental and affordable housing should be promoted within the city, particularly in areas closer to transit. “Given the high cost of land in developed parts of the city this also ensures availability of housing for a variety of income groups closer to their workplaces, thereby minimising travel trip distances,” the draft reads.The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and other concerned public agencies may take up dedicated affordable public rental housing projects close to activity centres (industrial areas, educational hubs, etc.). To manage rental assets, public agencies will be allowed to rope in Rental Management Agencies and housing aggregators. An online portal will be developed giving information regarding availability, location, rentals, a DDA official said .AK Jain, former planning commissioner with the DDA, said, “It is a good move to provide for rental housing. A large section of the population can’t afford to buy houses, but need affordable space to stay. There has been a decline in rental housing and this policy will arrest the problem. But we need a strong grievance redressal body.”As per the draft plan, “A paradigm shift is envisaged in the supply scenario, with the private sector leading the development/redevelopment of housing over the plan period. Public agencies shall play the role of a ‘facilitator’ and ensure ease of doing business, through appropriate regulatory environments.”As per the draft plan, the land pooling policy under which 17-20 lakh dwelling units are to be constructed on the outskirts of the city and Transit-Oriented Development in which residential projects will be planned near transit hubs, will see major participation from private developers.No more mixed land use streetsThe draft MPD-2041 has proposed some changes in the development control norms to address the issue of rampant commercialisation in residential areas, planned development in greenbelt areas and providing space for more commercial development.As per the new provisions, which will come into effect once the plan is notified, no new street, specially in residential areas, will be notified as mixed-use or commercial streets. DDA officials said that while mixed land use development for vertical development of the city is being promoted for planned development, streets will not be declared commercial as adequate provisions have been made to address the need of commercial spaces in the capital.In the aftermath of large-scale sealing and demolition of commercial establishments operating from residential areas in 2006, mixed land use was allowed by the Centre and regulations were introduced in the MPD-2021 that was notified on February 7, 2007. Since 2007, over 3,000 streets, mostly in residential areas, have been declared as mixed land use, commercial or pedestrian streets due to commercial activity on them.Resident welfare associations (RWAs) in the city say that the mixed land use provisions have “ruined the residential character” of the neighbourhoods.A senior DDA official said, “The new plan has provision for mixed land use development on plots which are located on 24-metre wide right of way. The current provision is for 18-metre right of way. This will help in checking rampant commercialisation to a large extent.”But residents say that the draft plan is silent on how the problems being faced by people who live in such areas will be addressed. Rajiv Kakria, convenor of Save our City campaign and a resident of Greater Kailash-I, said, “But what about the problem which are already there.. The plan is silent on it. Mixed land use provisions have messed up the residential character of the city. Those who have prepared the plan are not aware of the ground situation.”DDA officials said that the plan is an application for future developments only.No local area plansLocal area plans (LAPs), which were a significant feature of the MPD-2021, have been done away with in the current draft.Urban planner Shamsher Singh, former chief town planner with erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Delhi, said it is not a good move. “LAPs are needed to give an idea about utilities and infrastructure that is needed at a municipal ward level. It is prepared with the active participation of residents. This is the most basic level of plan or rather it makes the implementation of the MPD easier.”But DDA officials said that LAPs were never prepared and notified. “We now plan to do more detailed layout plans,” they said.Industrial and greenbelt areasThe plan proposes that plots in industrial area can be used for commercial, group housing, developing co-working spaces, etc, providing new spaces for commercial development.The plan also envisages a green development area policy to allow commercial and institutional establishments in greenbelt villages.Currently, no new construction, either residential or commercial, is allowed in the 47 villages located on the city’s periphery. Some of them are Dhansa, Mitraon, Tikri Kalan, Kapashera, parts of Rajokri, Ghumanhera, Bamnoli and Bijwasan.The new policy, a senior DDA official said, will allow planned development in these villages and make way for institutions, hospitals and big parks. The policy will also be applicable to 23 villages that are currently covered under the Low-Density Residential Area (LDRA) policy that was notified in 2013.Environmentalist Diwan Singh cautioned that the policy will result in rampant commercial activities in greenbelt villages. “These are the green buffers of the city. What will be left, if development is allowed in these villages?,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/master-plan-2041-emphasis-on-promotion-of-rental-housing-no-more-mixed-land-use-streets-101623263771033.html

Forms will also be accepted with a late fee of ₹500 between July 8 and 15. “MH-CET entrance exams for admission to professional courses including engineering/technology, pharmacy and agricultural education for the 2021-22 academic year will be held across various centres in Mumbai and across Maharashtra,” states the circular signed by CET cell commissioner CD Joshi. It further states that the online registration schedule and information brochure for the exam has been made available on the official website, https://mhtcet2021.mahacet.org. “Payment for the exams will only be accepted in the online mode,” the circular said.Earlier this month, both the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council of Indian Secondary Certificate Examinations (CISCE) announced their decision to scrap their respective Class 12 exams keeping the ongoing pandemic in mind. In the same week, Maharashtra government announced the decision to cancel Class 12 exams on similar grounds. Each education board is charting formula/criteria to derive Class 12 marks in order for students to apply for undergraduate admissions. “We are yet to finalise dates for the various exams. For the time being, registrations have commenced to give ample time to applicants to complete the first step of the admissions process,” said an official from state CET cell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/registrations-for-mh-cet-begin-even-as-state-yet-to-finalise-criterion-for-class-12-marks-101623263769820.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||Draft Master Plan 2041: Focus on density, public spaces in wake of Covid-19||In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the draft Master Plan of Delhi (MPD) 2041 makes provisions for medical emergencies, with a specific focus on physical distancing, decentralising workspaces, and limiting population density, apart from other post-Covid practices.The draft plan, which was made public for comments on Wednesday, pushes for mixed-use development, creating large public spaces, reducing built densities through planned regeneration to allow distancing during pandemics, as part of its plans to develop “pandemic-resilient” infrastructure.The coronavirus disease pandemic has, for over a year now, forced authorities to issue lockdowns, curb movement and travel, and recommend work-from-home where possible, in a bid to ensure distancing in public places, apart from bringing to light the limitations in the city’s public health infrastructure.Officials of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) said the problem of population density needs to be addressed using planning provisions.“Decentralised workspaces will be promoted in the form of co-working spaces, shared workspaces within slum rehabilitation projects, support for home-based work, and more. Further, common community spaces must be set up, so that they can be utilised as refuge spots, common kitchens or quarantine spaces as required,” said an official of the land-owning agency.Last year, DDA asked the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), which has drafted the MPD-2041 with the development agency, to incorporate provisions for pandemic resilient infrastructure in Delhi.Hitesh Vaidya, director of NIUA, said, “This pandemic has shown that it cannot be business as usual anymore. Health services need to be integrated with the rest of the city’s infrastructure. There is also a need to plan neighbourhoods in detail.”During the pandemic, several school buildings, vacant housing complexes and stadiums were used to set up temporary Covid care centres. To this effect, DDA officials said the master plan must provide for multi-facility plots (particularly in dense, unplanned areas) that can be temporarily repurposed, if needed, during a disaster.In the past two decades, Delhi has witnessed outbreaks and epidemics of diseases like dengue, H1N1 and now Covid-19.MPD-2041 also stresses the need for better designed buildings in order to reduce the dependence on mechanical ventilation systems, which pose a threat during airborne epidemics, such as the coronavirus.Apart from pandemic resilience, the master plan also has provisions to reduce seismic vulnerability and the chances of floods in urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/draft-master-plan-2041-focus-on-density-public-spaces-in-wake-of-covid19-101623263769224.html
10-06-2021||Other||Master Plan-2041: Reuse and conserve crucial to meeting Delhi’s water needs||New Delhi: Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) Master Plan 2041 draft policy stressed ways to plug water wastage in the city by reusing and conserving water. “Delhi is a water-scarce city and pressure on available water resources has increased manifold due to population growth wasteful consumption and systemic loss of water. There are visible accounts of decline in groundwater levels, heavy pollution in Yamuna River and frequent waterlogging instances across Delhi,” the draft policy read. In the document, the DDA stressed that an integrated urban water management (IUWM) approach be adopted for Delhi where water supply, wastewater management and stormwater drainage can be interconnected for having water-linked infrastructures in an urban water cycle. “Surface water, rainwater, wastewater and groundwater are considered here as four access points of water that have to be managed together. The focus is on reducing reliance on surface water and groundwater and realising the potential of the non-traditional sources of water for the future water needs of Delhi. The IUWM approach maximizes efficient water use,” it read. Quoting the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) data, DDA said that in 2020 Delhi’s total demand was 1140 million gallons per day (MGD), as against the supply of 935MGD. This demand is expected to increase to 1746 MGD by 2031, before it goes down again in 2041 to 1455 MGD. “Due to the limited availability of raw water to Delhi, DJB targets of demand of potable water for domestic use need to be rationalized and progressively reduced to 50 GPCD (gallons per capita per day) and supplemented by using non-potable recycled water of desired quality standard for non-potable purposes,” the DDA document highlighted. The Master Plan 2041 draft highlighted the management of wastewater. “To alleviate the flooding conditions in various parts of the city, stormwater drainage infrastructure needs to be made efficient. So, it is pertinent to apply corrective spatial strategies to address the deficient drainage infrastructure and introduce low-cost flood- prevention measures such as water body rejuvenation, using parks for rainwater harvesting etc. Further, solid waste and sewage need to be managed so that flow of stormwater is not hindered,” the document suggested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/master-plan-2041-reuse-and-conserve-crucial-to-meeting-delhi-s-water-needs-101623263710596.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||Doctors remove Covid patient’s cardiac tumour in Mira Road||A team of doctors of a Mira Road hospital removed a 50-gram rare cardiac tumour which had grown in the heart of a 28-year-old Covid-positive woman from Kolhapur.Dr Upendra Bhalerao, surgeon, Wockhardt Hospital, Mira Road, said the patient had complained of breathlessness, swelling over legs and was on high oxygen support. Echocardiography revealed a 7cm x 6.5cm x 5cm massive tumour in the right-side upper chamber (atrium) of her heart which was blocking the blood flow to lungs. “It is a cardiac tumour called myxoma and not treating her at the right time may have led to death,” said Dr Bhalerao.“We first treated her with steroids and Remdesivir for Covid-19, After 10 days, she underwent a high-risk surgery to remove the cardiac tumour,” he said. The tumour was completely removed from the atrial septum after a six-hour surgery. He added that the patient was moved to the ward after four days in the intensive care unit (ICU), and then discharged home in a week after the surgery. The doctor said the patient’s heart is in stable condition with normal blood oxygen saturation. He added that as symptoms of several heart and lung conditions overlap with those of Covid-19, all patients should be thoroughly evaluated based on all symptoms to uncover underlying diseases, if any.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/doctors-remove-covid-patient-s-cardiac-tumour-in-mira-road-101623263709852.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||Draft Master Plan lists measures to save ‘green and blue’ assets||The draft Master Plan of Delhi-2041 envisages building a sustainable infrastructure that will help the national capital curb local sources of pollution such as dust from construction sites and vehicular emissions, as well as redeveloping the city’s ‘green and blue’ assets, referring to the city’s forest and green cover and its water bodies.The draft of the plan document, prepared by the Delhi Development Authority, was put in the public domain on Wednesday for suggestions. Once approved, the plan will provide policy framework for the development of the city till 2041.This time, environmental degradation and mitigating strategies have been put in focus since Delhi has to face alarming levels of air pollution specially in winters each year because of a combination of local, external and weather factors.Besides redevelopment and protection of both forest and green cover as well as the Yamuna and other water bodies, the draft plan envisages building infrastructure in a way that connects people with their natural heritage.“The aim is to provide a comprehensive framework to treat green and blue assets (natural and planned) as green-blue infrastructure to facilitate better continuum and strategies for tackling pollution, for protection and enhancement of natural assets with a public interface, to build new city-level assets such as greenways along natural drains, repurposing underutilised sites and wastelands as green-blue assets, and greening of plots and buildings and introduction to green-blue Factor (GBF) for plan approval,” the draft read.The green-blue plan suggests that to protect the depleting number of trees in Delhi, a tree directory will be prepared by all agencies concerned in their respective areas. The agencies will be tasked with identifying unique tree corridors or precincts, heritage trees, precincts with high carbon storage and sequestration rates, etc. Such trees or tree clusters shall be protected and controlled in terms of planting of indigenous trees and integrated with cultural trails or nature trails.Considering that Delhi is yet to have a tree census, such an initiative is likely to help agencies keep an exact count of the number, location, type and age of the trees in their jurisdiction. This will also help authorities keep track of instances of illegal tree felling.To preserve and improve the conditions of water bodies and their floodplains, the draft plan proposes natural resources to be marked as ‘areas under environmental protection’. These areas will be marked by delineated boundaries and a separate database will be created to monitor their protection and maintenance. Also, it was proposed to restrict development near and on such sites.Saying “Delhi’s history and cultural ethos is closely linked with the Yamuna”, the draft plan lists special initiatives for the rejuvenation of the river and its floodplains. These measures include 300-metre green buffer along the entire edge of the river, developing cycling and walking trails along the embankments, restricting all permanent construction on the floodplain and identifying specific spots for cultural and agricultural activities.Emphasising that curbing air and water pollution in the city will require efforts by several states, the draft plan says that all member NCR states and respective pollution control boards need to follow the regulations and standards laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).In order to control dust, which is the main contributor of particulate matter pollutants in the city’s air, the draft plan proposes that all development projects must follow dust mitigation measures in handling construction material and construction and demolition waste. “A dust management plan will be submitted as per CPCB or any other guidelines. Construction sites shall be monitored regularly by the local bodies to ascertain the implementation,” the draft plan read.Government data quoted in by the DDA stated that local PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) pollution is 26% during summers and 36% during winter.It also underlined the importance of checking pollution of surface water bodies and ground water to be addressed on priority. The draft plan calls for comprehensive strategies for preserving and enhancing streams, drains, lakes and wetlands, ponds and baolis.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said the DDA has ensured that there is a multi-sectoral understanding of the environmental crisis that Delhi is facing. However, she said, the master plan could be pushed further by setting tighter deadlines for managing polluting sectors to ensure early and efficient results.“What needs to be appreciated is that environment is not seen as a stand-alone category, each segment of the document, such as transport, industries, water management, links to the overall environmental issue. Finally, we are also recognising separately the various factors that contribute to pollution, and this will help us tackle this problem better,” Roychowdhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/draft-master-plan-lists-measures-to-save-green-and-blue-assets-combat-pollution-101623263709223.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||Drop in private vehicle use, better last-mile transit in vision document||Agencies in the national capital will have to ensure a 1% drop in private vehicular trips every year and increase the use of public and shared transport by the same quantum each year, said the draft Master Plan of Delhi (MPD) 2041, which was made public for comments on Wednesday.The draft, which will serve as a vision document for the city’s development over the next 20 years, aims to improve the city’s mobility network by making public transport available to residents within walking distance, building strategic road links to decongest the city, disincentivising travel in private vehicles through congestion pricing and dynamic parking charges, and reimagining the Ring Rail.Experts who reviewed the draft MPD 2041 said the document correctly addresses the city’s changing transport requirements, even as it leaves some of the basics intact. For instance, shared mobility in the form of app-based taxi and the concept of carpooling have been included in the city planning document for the first time. At the same time, the document also reiterates a long-standing demand for a Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMPTA).The document also requires that agencies draft a Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) to integrate all levels and modes of urban transport and move towards low-carbon transit systems.The Delhi Economic Survey (2019-20) said though the annual growth rate of vehicle sales almost halved to 4.4% for the 2019-20 fiscal,the number of vehicles in the city has more than doubled to 643 per thousand people, from 317 in 2005-06. This increase has also consequently led to a surge in parking demand.Delhi has more than 10 million registered vehicles, of which 7.3 million are two-wheelers, shows state government data.State transport minister Kailash Gahlot said MPD 2041 calls for greater coordination and cooperation of all agencies in the city, including the Delhi government, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the Delhi Police and the civic bodies.“It is good to see that the MPD 2041 mentions Delhi’s parking policy, which is one-of-its kind in India, at length and has reiterated that the municipal corporations must expedite formulating their respective area parking management plans. The draft MPD is mostly a wrap of the Delhi government’s flagship transport projects, including the electric vehicle policy, premium bus scheme, real-time public information system for buses and the plan to convert bus depots into multi-level facilities to increase parking space,” he said.Gahlot added Delhi has more than 6,700 state-run buses, which will increase to around 11,000 buses in the coming years.“We are also redeveloping all bus terminals, setting up new ones and making transit-oriented development (TOD) nodes at Kashmere Gate, Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan. The RRTS [Regional Rapid Transit System] and the expansion of the Delhi Metro are going to help create some of the biggest multi-modal transport hubs of the country in Delhi,” he said.The document also recommends corridors that will act as “road links”, or extensions of existing or proposed arterial corridors to improve inter-city connectivity, including the Urban Extension Road 2.The document notes that buses are the preferred and most accessible public transport system.“A detailed analysis of Public Transport Accessibility Levels (PTAL) shall be adopted for the city. This shall be operationalised through an expert agency to be updated and notified from time to time. PTAL mapping will help evaluate the public transport outreach and spatially distinguish high-accessibility areas from low. The analysis shall include all shared modes with fixed routes and fixed fares, including contract IPT modes such as Gramin Seva, autorickshaws, maxi cabs, RTVs, etc., apart from buses, metro rail and their feeder services. Based on such an analysis, the entire city can be divided into different grades,” it stated.The MPD also said the emergence of shared mobility options, complemented by the expansion of the metro network, is gradually changing mobility choices made by commuters from private ownership to shared or public transport-oriented options. It also suggests running special Metro and bus services at night, apart from operating express transport routes.“Ring Rail, a part of Delhi’s legacy infrastructure, is being used for transporting freight and is presently running at only 50% of its potential passenger ridership. While the Ring Rail plays a significant role in freight transport and keeps almost 20,000 trucks off Delhi’s roads, its role in transporting people needs to be re-imagined,” the document said.To promote the use of cleaner transport systems, the MPD mandates all new fuel stations to have space for charging infrastructure. “Fuel stations, Metro station parking, railway parking areas, authorised on-street parking or other government-owned parking shall be retrofitted with EV [electric vehicle] charging infrastructure,” it said.To address the marginal rise in cycling use and make the city more pedestrian-friendly, the document proposes that ‘active travel areas’ be identified around high activity hubs and that “walk plans” be prepared for these areas to improve pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, including cycling highways.The vision document also lays out a hierarchy of roads to be followed in the city. These include national highways (60-90 metres wide), arterial roads (30-60m), collector roads (12-30m) and local streets (less than 12m). Of the four categories, only local streets have been prescribed to have slow moving traffic (through traffic calming measures), along with pedestrian lanes.Madhav Pai, executive director of the WRI India Ross Center, said the draft MPD 2041 is contradictory in some aspects.“The ambition to improve walking and cycling is great, but this vision is against the fast roads proposed in the draft MPD. Fast roads (wider than 45 metres) should be designed for speeds less than 60kmph and for roads narrower than 30m. The design speed should be less than 30kmph,” he said.Pai hoped that UMTA, a demand that has not implemented in two decades, will be constituted now.“The MPD sets out a good vision for transport. Implementation will require strong co-ordination, negotiation between the central, state and local governments. So, operationalising the UMTA as early as possible will be important,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-draft-master-plan-2041-drop-in-pvt-vehicle-use-better-last-mile-transit-in-vision-document-101623263649793.html

With roads dug up across the city, people are facing a severe inconvenience.Cleaning of nullahs has also not been completed, activists allege. Pre-monsoon work starts in April and is completed by the end of May. This year, tenders were floated late and it delayed the pre-monsoon work, despite the streets being empty of traffic because of the lockdown. As per report submitted by various departments, PMC officials claim that 90 per cent of the pre-monsoon works have been completed. The on-ground situation contradicts this claim. Data shared by the PMC’s sewage, maintenance and repair departments states that of the 526km of nullahs in the city, PMC has cleaned 500 km. Of the 338 culverts, 310 have been cleaned. There are 105 critical nullah spots in the city. Of that, PMC has been able to clean 90 so far. Road restoration work is also still not complete. VG Kulkarni, chief superintendent engineer of the road department, said, “We have stopped all major road work. Laying of roads will take at least two more days to complete. Bajirao road has major development work pending.” Shivraj Sanas, a resident of Mandai, said, “We cannot walk. There is a traffic jam in the peth areas due to incomplete road work. Roads become slippery and we cannot drive our vehicles. Monsoons have started and I don’t know when it will be completed.”“I don’t know why the PMC fails to complete pre-monsoon work before the monsoon starts,” said Suni Bhavsar, a resident of Narayan peth. Areas that normally witness water logging include Kothrud, Yerawada, J M road, Sahakarnagar, the peth areas, Anandnagar, Vitthalwadi, Sun City road and Pulachiwadi.Work pendingTotal length of storm drainage lines - 145,200 metresStill to be cleaned – 54,076m Total number of storm water chambers - 23,980 Still to be cleaned – 6,089 Total number of critical nullah spots - 105 Still to be cleaned – 15 Total number of culverts - 338 Still to be cleaned - 30||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-fails-to-meet-deadline-on-pre-monsoon-works-101623263649236.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||QS Ranking: IIT-Bombay still top Indian institute, global rank 177||The Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) continued to be the top ranking Indian university in the QS World Ranking 2022 released Wednesday, even as the institute dropped five places in its overall ranking.With an overall score of 46.4, IIT-B secured a world ranking of 177, down from last year’s 172. The institute was eight places above its sister campus in Delhi, which scored 45.9, and nine places above the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, which scored 45.7. These are the only three Indian institutes to make it to the top 200 universities in the list released by global ranking agency Quacquarelli Symonds, London, the United Kingdom.Apart from IIT-B, 21 other Indian universities, including IIT-Madras, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Guwahati, and Roorkee found a place in the top 1,000 universities of the world, ranked by QS.Every year, QS ranks universities around the world based on its evaluation metrics, each carrying different weightage. This year 1,300 universities were evaluated for six metrics: academic reputation (40% weightage), employer reputation (10%), faculty-student ratio (20%), citations per faculty (20%), international faculty ratio (5%) and international student ratio (5%).IIT-B, which was the 37th best university in Asia last year, dropped one place this year. Subhasis Chaudhari, director of IIT-B, said, “In the faculty-to-student ratio section, we lost out some marks as our number of students have increased at a much higher proportion. In all other verticals, we have earned more points. We need to hire more faculty members, but we need to have better infrastructure to absorb them. Infrastructure upgradation, however, is a slow process.”Among state universities, Savitribai Phule Pune University improved its ranking this year by moving up to 591-600 group from 651-700 last year. University of Mumbai (MU) maintained its rank in the range of 1,001 to 1,200. Of the 35 Indian universities that made it to the list, MU ranked third last in terms of its score.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/qs-ranking-iit-bombay-still-top-indian-institute-global-rank-177-101623263591042.html
10-06-2021||Pune||Pune witnesses first monsoon rainfall of this season||PUNE The Southwest Monsoon has further advanced in parts of Maharashtra, including Mumbai. On Wednesday, Pune witnessed its first monsoon rainfall of this season. Shivajinagar reported 3 millimetre (mm) and Lohegaon reported 2 mm of rain.The sky was cloudy on Wednesday followed by a light drizzle at various places across the city.Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting department, said on Wednesday that the monsoon has covered as much as 80 per cent of the state.“For the last two days, there was no advancement of the southwest monsoon. However, on Wednesday it covered 80 per cent of Maharashtra. As a result we have declared the onset of monsoon over Mumbai as well. The northern limit of the monsoon passes through Valsad, Malegaon and Nagpur,” said Kashyapi.He further added that ghat areas around Pune may receive isolated heavy rainfall from June 11 to June 15.“There are chances of light to moderate rainfall in Pune city as well till June 15. The maximum temperature will be around 27 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature will be around 22 degrees Celsius,” said Kashyapi.Pune, Satara, Mahabaleshwar and many cities in Konkan and Goa also received rainfall on Wednesday. In Marathwada, no rainfall was reported. However, Vidarbha Akola, Nagpur and Amravati reported rainfall.IMD officials noted that parts of Maharashtra may receive heavy rainfall in the next few days.“Due to the strengthening of westerly winds along the west coast in association with the low pressure area, widespread rainfall activity with heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely to continue over coastal districts of Maharashtra till June 15,” said IMD officials.Kashyapi added that along with Konkan and Goa, other subdivisions will also receive good rainfall in the next few days.“Isolated parts of Madhya Maharashtra, Vidarbha and Marathwada may receive isolated heavy rainfall till June 13. In Vidarbha, chances of gusty winds, thunderstorms and lightning are also very likely,” said Kashyapi. Kashyapi added that the monsoon in 2021 is likely to cover the entire state of Maharashtra three days prior to the normal onset date of June 15.On Wednesday, the highest maximum temperature was 37 degrees Celsius at Washim in Maharashtra, and the lowest minimum temperature was 16.7 degrees Celsius in Mahabaleshwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-witnesses-first-monsoon-rainfall-of-this-season-101623263589237.html

The state added 661 deaths, including 400 reconciled, pushing toll to 101,833. Mumbai, meanwhile, continued to record less than 1,000 cases for the ninth consecutive day with 785 new cases and 27 fatalities.Even as Maharashtra is witnessing a downward curve for the past few weeks, districts in Konkan and western Maharashtra still report a chunk of daily cases. Six districts — Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Pune — contribute over 50% of state’s daily cases. Experts and health department officials said the viral activity works in a differential manner and the areas showing higher number of cases will eventually come down.According to the data, rural and urban areas from the six districts contributed over 50% of the state’s total cases. Since June 6, these six districts added 23,138 cases, which was 51.81% of the state’s total cases during this period. On Wednesday, Ratnagiri (536), Sindhudurg (540), Pune (1,368), Satara (845), Kolhapur (1,467) and Sangli (984) districts added 5,740 of the 10,989 new cases, which is 52.23%.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, former director-general of health services (Maharashtra) and advisor to the state government on Covid-19, said the pandemic does not behave in the same manner across geography. “Maharashtra is as big as any European country, so we expect the districts will show a differential and it is being demonstrated. In western Maharashtra, particularly Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, and Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg in the Konkan region, are not showing a distinct decline that we are seeing in other parts of the state. Such things occur wherever there is a delay in introduction of virus. When Mumbai and Pune were on the peak, these districts were at a better stage, comparatively. The urban areas are recovering faster than the rural areas as the infection gets introduced a bit later, therefore more cases are seen from rural areas,” he said.He added that when there was hectic viral activity in Amravati, Akola and Nagpur in February-end to March, Pune, Mumbai and other parts did not have many cases at that time. “Now those [Vidarbha] districts are on a downward trend. But Pune district is still high,” Dr Salunkhe added.Salunkhe added that the overall downward trend should not make the administration and the state government lax. He added that the state still needs to move “cautiously” in opening up activities. The state has fixed parameters including positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds to allow the level of unlocking in districts and municipal areas. A review will be taken on Thursday for districts that could see unlocking or imposition of restrictions for the next week.“I am not happy with the things happening in Maharashtra. Let us not be fooled by the declining curve. Pandemic are well known to fool the people through downward curve. It does not guarantee that it won’t turn upward. I am regularly warning the government about it… I am worried about the unlocking. I have spoken to the health minister; I will speak to the chief minister (CM) and deputy CM on Friday,” Salunkhe said.A senior health department official said the state has not allowed blanket lifting of restrictions. “One cannot shut all activities permanently. As the viral activity is fluid, the state has adopted a dynamic way to allow or disallow activities in a district or city area. If a particular district or city shows higher positivity rate or increase in oxygen bed occupancy, the restrictions will be made tighter,” the official said requesting anonymity. CM Uddhav Thackeray and his cabinet colleagues will be given a presentation on the weekly Covid situation in the state in the cabinet meeting scheduled to be held on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-covid-growth-still-high-in-6-districts-101623263529254.html
10-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra administers 25 million doses; over 5 million citizens got both shots||Maharashtra on Wednesday achieved a milestone by surpassing the 25-million mark for vaccine doses administered so far. The state has fully vaccinated over 5 million beneficiaries in the state, since the drive began on January 16.The state, according to data on the CoWIN portal, has administered 25,038,076 doses till 9pm on Wednesday, of which 20,029,244 are first doses and 5,008,832 are second doses. Nearly five months into the vaccination programme, around 22% of the 91,435,000 eligible citizens across the state have received the first dose, while 5.47% got both doses. State immunisation officer DN Patil said the pace of vaccination has been consistent for the past few days as the state has been inoculating around 250,000-275,000 beneficiaries daily. “The pace is good and our efforts are to get around 30-35% of the population covered with at least one dose, at the earliest,” said Patil.On Wednesday, Maharashtra administered 295,674 vaccine doses till 9pm, according to CoWIN portal. Of the doses administered, 224,735 were first doses while 70,939 beneficiaries took their second shot. Due to heavy rainfall, Mumbai’s daily vaccination figures saw a drastic decline. From over 96,000 doses administered on Tuesday, city registered only 50,807 inoculations on Wednesday. One vaccination centre in Madanpura was shut in south Mumbai owing to water logging in its premises. Meanwhile, on Thursday vaccination for all age groups will be conducted via appointment basis only.Other districts that showed high turnout for inoculation are Pune (43,349), and Thane (21,860) districts, followed by Nashik (15,516), Ahmednagar (14,151) and Jalgaon (12,884), as per the portal’s data.(Inputs from Mehul R Thakkar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-administers-25-million-doses-over-5-million-citizens-got-both-shots-101623263470374.html
10-06-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Physically challenged travel miles to reach special vaccination camp||Ghaziabad: Sixty-year-old Bhagwat Swaroop, a resident of Loni who is physically challenged, was one of the 100 beneficiaries who toiled hard to reach the district headquarters in Ghaziabad on Wednesday to get a Covid-19 vaccine shot at the special camp organised for such people. He said that despite his condition, he reached the vaccination site for which he had to travel about 22km. The camp was organised at Vikas Bhawan by the district administration. The officials said that by the end of the day, with the help of some NGOs, they achieved 100% coverage and administered the vaccine to 100 beneficiaries who were in age groups 18-45 and above 45 years. “Last week I got a call from Vikas Bhawan to attend the camp. I started around 8.30am and returned home by 2pm. I had to change three autos to reach the site. It was a tough task to go so far. It would have been better if the camp was organised in Loni. I also took my son-in-law along to help me out,” Swaroop said. “When I reached the camp, I waited till 11.30 as the vaccine had not arrived. We were told that the camp will start at 10am,” he added. Like Swaroop, many others reached the camp from far off places despite their physical condition, while some were brought in by NGOs through their transport.Monu Kumar, another physically challenged man, also reached the camp from Jalalabad village in Muradnagar which is about 18km away from the district headquarters. “I took a local transport to the main bus stand and then took a bus to reach the camp site. After waiting for 40-45 minutes, I got my first dose. It was a long journey for me considering my physical condition. A vaccination camp in Muradnagar would have been a better option for people like us,” he said. Social activists said that the administration should avoid holding such camps at central locations. “Instead, there should have been camps near to the residences of such people either at block level or at local body level. The administration should, in fact, reach out to such persons rather than calling them to their doorsteps. Travelling to and from the site would have been very painful for such beneficiaries amid high temperature. So, such camps should be completely avoided,” said Rajeev Sharma, a city-based human rights’ activist. When approached about the issue, district’s chief development officer Asmita Lal said that the beneficiaries were willing to take up vaccination and arrived to attend the camp. “We roped in NGOs which arranged buses to ferry many beneficiaries and also made proper arrangement at the camp. The camp also helped such persons in getting registrations, and henceforth they will get vaccinated in their respective areas at block level or their nearest community health centre. Our aim was to encourage vaccination among people of such groups as many were hesitant to come forward for vaccination,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-physically-challenged-travel-miles-to-reach-special-vaccination-camp-101623263469760.html

When they reached the spot, however, the four victims had been rushed to the Yashoda Hospital, Kaushambi.“We did not receive any information from the service centre and came to know through other sources. The lift was ferrying a car from the third floor to the ground floor with four persons, including one in the car. Then it reached the ground floor and later came crashing to the basement area,” said Ran Singh, station house officer of the Link Road police station. “It probably took place due to some technical snag. Four persons, including three staff members and a customer, suffered injuries and are under treatment. We have not received any complaint so far into the incident,” he added. The police identified the four as Gaurav Kumar, 26, Mohammad Naved, 28, Brij Bhushan, 37 and Sunil Kumar, 28. “Three of them are in the ICU. They suffered fractures, cuts, abrasions and other injuries. Their condition is, however, stable,” said a spokesperson from the Yashoda Hospital, Kaushambi. The officials of the service centre meanwhile claimed that everything was “normal”. “The things are normal,” said Ish Kumar, general manager of the service centre said, without choosing to elaborate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/four-injured-after-a-lift-fall-at-service-centre-in-sahibabad-101623263469209.html
10-06-2021||Noida||Covid vaccination: GB Nagar covers 45% of eligible population||NOIDA: With 7,78,823 doses of Covid-19 vaccine administered till Tuesday, Gautam Budh Nagar has recorded the highest vaccine coverage among the six districts in the Meerut division. The district administration officials said that by the end of July, every eligible person in the district will get at least one dose of the vaccine.The officials said that GB Nagar has so far covered nearly 45% of those eligible to take the shot. Nearly 1.4 million people in the district are eligible to take the Covid-19 vaccine, they said. According to the Co-WIN data, while neighbouring Ghaziabad district stands second (in Meerut division) on the list with 6,86,814 doses, Meerut district is on the third position with 6,78,555 shots. The data also shows that GB Nagar stands on second position in terms of total doses administered so far across 75 districts in Uttar Pradesh, after Lucknow – the state’s capital – where 10,75,902 vaccine doses have been administered till Tuesday. The GB Nagar district magistrate, Suhas LY, said that the enthusiasm shown by the people taking the jabs – especially from the age group of 18 to 45 years – is commendable. “GB Nagar is always exposed to Delhi, where the infection rate was always high, more than other districts of western UP. That’s why, since the first phase, we have always set a high target for vaccination and never failed to achieve it. We have so far covered over 45% of the population, which is eligible for vaccination right now. If the ratio of vaccination with population is taken, GB Nagar will stand much ahead among all the districts in the state,” he said. The DM also said that to ensure maximum number of people get vaccinated, the district administration is going to start a vaccination drive in urban slums from Thursday. “To ensure a smooth operation of this drive, some NGOs have expressed their eagerness in taking part in it. Very soon, we’ll launch similar drives for the rickshaw, auto and cab drivers, besides the delivery boys of different companies,” he said. Echoing similar views, district chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that vaccination is important to prevent the probable third wave. “Our officials have made necessary arrangements for providing required vaccine stock so that more and more people are immunised. People are showing a great response to vaccination as it helps prevent hospitalisation in majority of the cases,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid-vaccination-gb-nagar-covers-45-of-eligible-population-101623263409926.html
10-06-2021||Noida||Private hospitals in Noida stare at loss as vaccine prices capped||The Centre’s move to cap prices of administering vaccine has come as a blow to private hospitals in Gautam Budh Nagar that would have to incur a heavy loss. Despite this, many said they would continue with the vaccination drive.On Tuesday, the Centre said it would procure 75% of the vaccine manufacturer’s stock and distribute it free to all states from June 21. Private hospitals, meanwhile, could access only the remaining stock from the manufactures, and had to cap the price of Covishield at ₹780, Covaxin at ₹1,410 and Sputnik V at ₹1,145 per dose immediately. Private hospitals in Gautam Budh Nagar, which have been conducting vaccinations on their premises and even off-site, say that the landing cost of the vaccine (from procurement from vaccine makers to vaccination) was around ₹750-800 for Covishield and around ₹1,450 for Covaxin, while Sputnik V is yet to be deployed in the city. Felix Hospital in Sector 137 had been administering Covishield for ₹900. It has also been holding a 24/7 vaccination drive. Dr DK Gupta, chairman and managing director of Felix Hospital in Sector 137, said, “There are miscellaneous charges attached to the cost of the vaccine, including transportation, cold chain storage, deploying staff, ensuring disposables like gloves, syringes, and emergency care equipment that has to be kept on standby in case of adverse effects.(The new rate will mean) we will have to incur 10% loss.” “From June 21, we will have to apply on a central government portal that will be regulated by the state government. We will apply for vaccines as per our earlier plans but not sure how much we will be able to get from the manufacturers, as per the new policy,” said Dr Gupta. According to the central government order, the portal will help smaller and remoter private hospitals to obtain timely supply of vaccines.Two big private hospitals of the district, Max and Fortis, refused to comment on the issue.Sharda Hospital has been conducting 24/7 vaccination camps too and charged ₹850 for a dose of Covishield. At off-site vaccination sites, the charges were the same. Dr Ajeet Kumar, public relations officer from Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida, said, Private hospitals have also tied up with corporate offices and residential societies in the city. In such camps, we send our staff and equipment, and all that will cost more.” On whether the hospital will break their tie-ups with residential societies, he said, “We will continue to honour our commitments.” Dr Sunil Balyan, chief medical superintendent at Bisrakh’s Yatharth Hospital, said they will update their prices. The hospital was administering Covaxin for ₹1,460 earlier. “The hospital was procuring Covaxin from manufacturer at ₹1260. Including logistic and human resource cost, each dose had cost us ₹1,450. So, we were already working on a ‘no-profit-no loss’ model. Now we will have to incur a ₹50 loss. We have tie-ups with some residential societies in the area and we will update the cost of vaccination as per government guidelines.” Dr NK Sharma, president of the Indian Medical Association (Noida) said, “We need to think of the larger good. Capping price is in favour of those who were unable to access to free government vaccination centres.” GB Nagar Chief Medical Officer Dr Deepak Ohri said, “The district health department will monitor the prices charged by private hospitals as per guidelines from the government.” Going forward, Sharda Hospital, Felix Hospital and Yatharth Hospital said that they will continue to procure vaccines as per their earlier plan. “However, starting June 21, we will have to apply on a government portal that will aggregate demand of vaccines from all private hospitals and specify quota for each one keeping in mind equitable distribution. We will apply for vaccines as per our earlier plans but not sure how much we will be able to get from the manufacturers, as per the new policy,” said Dr Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/private-hospitals-in-noida-stare-at-loss-as-vaccine-prices-capped-101623263409208.html
10-06-2021||Other||Centre’s revised guidelines likely to boost Covid-19 vaccination drive in Uttar Pradesh||The central government’s revised guidelines for implementation of the national Covid vaccination programme are likely to give a thrust to the vaccination drive in Uttar Pradesh. The new guidelines will be effective from June 21.Health and family welfare minister Jai Pratap Singh said the central government had announced that vaccine doses would be allocated to states on criteria such as population, disease burden and progress of vaccination.“The central government has also stated that wastage of vaccine will affect the allocation of the doses negatively,” he said.“Uttar Pradesh has already cut the vaccine wastage from 20% to 2%. We are working to bring the wastage down to zero. Some districts are already reporting zero wastage of Covid vaccines. The health department is giving regular training to vaccinators to check wastage,” he said.“Uttar Pradesh with a population of over 24 crore has already given 2.07 crore doses, the highest in the country. The state government is working to increase the daily administration of doses,” Singh said.The central government will provide information about the doses to be supplied to Uttar Pradesh by June 21.The Uttar Pradesh government had floated a global tender on May 5 to procure 40 million doses of Covid vaccines from national and international vaccine manufacturers. The state government had extended the last date for the submission of the bids, first to May 31 and then to June 10.Now with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement that the central government will supply the required vaccine doses to the states, the state government need not procure the vaccines from private companies.“I hope no company will submit the bid in view of PM’s announcement on Monday,” Singh said.Uttar Pradesh has already procured 10 lakh doses of Covid vaccines for beneficiaries in the 18-45 age group from the Hyderabad-based Bharat- Biotech and the Pune-based Serum Institute of India.The state government has made advance payment to both the companies to ramp up its vaccine stock.“Once both the companies complete the supply of the doses, we will get the remaining stock from the central government,” he said.Under the revised guidelines, the central government has made it clear that all the citizens, irrespective of their income status, are entitled to free vaccination. Those who have the ability to pay are encouraged to use vaccination centres at private hospitals.The central government has also told the state government that CoWIN portal provides every citizen the facility of convenient and safe pre-booking of appointment for vaccination.“All government and private vaccination centres will also provide onsite registration facility, available both for individuals as well as group of individuals. The state government will finalise the procedure soon. The state government has already provided the booking facility at common service centres,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/centres-revised-guidelines-likely-to-boost-vaccination-in-up-101623263169187.html
10-06-2021||Other||Net-based video surveillance systems at rly stations soon||Soon a network of high-tech internet-based video surveillance system would be in place at railway stations across the country to ensure better security of train passengers, especially women.As part of a pan-India exercise, these internet-based video surveillance systems (VSS) have been installed at 269 railway stations across the country, including 16 railway stations of North Central Railways (NCR). Besides the central control monitoring rooms too have been activated in 10 railway zones of the country, including NCR, said railway officials. The project includes integration of existing standalone CCTV network of the railways into the VSS system for centralised monitoring, they added.This is part of the major initiative of the Railway Board wherein 6,049 railway stations of the country are being equipped with this state -of-the-art surveillance system.The work has been assigned to RailTel and the system is being installed from the funds allocated under the Nirbhaya Fund of the central government. CMD of RailTel Puneet Chawla said “We will be completing the work at 756 stations by March next year. We are installing four types of IP cameras to ensure maximum coverage inside the Railway premises. This will give an extra edge to the RPF officials to improve security.”Senior manager of RailTel, Sucharita Pradhan said, “The feed from the network of cameras being installed under this system will be centrally monitored and the footage would be stored for 30 days. To enhance security at railway stations, the CCTV cameras-based systems are being put in place to cover main entrance/exits, platforms, foot over bridges, waiting halls, parking areas etc based on site and security requirements and threat perceptions.”These CCTVs would remain attached to the network with the help of optical fibre cables (OFC) and the video feed of the CCTV cameras will not just be displayed at local RPF outposts but also at a centralised CCTV control room being set up at divisional and zonal levels, she explained. Pradhan said that of the 269 stations, where the system has already been installed, 16 each are from NCR and North Eastern Railways (NER), 47 from Northern Railways (NR) among others. In the days to come the system would work on the basis of video analytics and facial recognition which means that while monitoring the feed, if any suspicious looking person is picked up, the facial recognition system would identify the same on the basis of the existing database of the system, said officials. For the purpose, high-tech cameras are being installed which include bullet, fixed-dome, Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ) and 4K ultra high-definition cameras.“Network Management System (NMS) is also being provided for monitoring the footage of the cameras which are stored in a server and backed by UPS. The feed could be viewed using web browser and a range of Net-enabled devices including laptop, mobile phone etc, by authorised personnel,” said Pradhan.The official shared that work at 31 more stations was in progress at the moment and would be completed soon. RailTel has also floated tenders for this work at 456 additional stations of the country. “In terms of NCR, the control room has been recently activated at the zonal headquarters at Subedarganj wherein live feed is being watched on two 55-inch display screens,” said CPRO, NCR, Shivam Sharma. Of the 16 stations of NCR, the system has already been installed at Babina (20 cameras), Datia (21 cameras), Aligarh (40 cameras), Gwalior (15 cameras), Mahoba (27 cameras), Phaphund (27 cameras), Tundla (40 cameras), Orai (38 cameras), Etawah (40 cameras), Raja ki Mandi (38 cameras), Agra Fort (40 cameras), Lalitpur (40 cameras), Sikohabad (40 cameras), Firozabad (15), Banda (40 cameras) and Murena (40 cameras).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/netbased-video-surveillance-systems-at-rly-stations-soon-101623255489358.html
10-06-2021||Patna||BJP trying to destabilise Bihar govt, says HAM(S)||Barely six months after the formation of the NDA government in Bihar, the internal strife in the ruling alliance is getting more pronounced.On Wednesday, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) or the HAM(S), headed by former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, alleged that some BJP leaders were trying to destabilize the government and demanded the formation of a coordination committee of the alliance partners to sort out the things before it is too late.“Some leaders of the BJP are trying to destabilize the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government in the state. They are issuing statements against the government and thereby giving an opportunity to the opposition to attack the government. It is high time that a coordination committee of NDA constituents is formed before it is too late,” said HAM-S spokesperson Danish Rizwan.The statement drew a prompt response from the BJP.“The NDA in Bihar is working on a common agenda of sustainable development free of crime and corruption. Nitish Kumar as a CM is excellently leading the state, coordinating well with all the alliance partners. NDA is rock solid and unaffected by Individual statements,” said Nikhil Anand, Bihar BJP’s spokesperson.Another party spokesperson and former MLA Prem Ranjan Patel reminded HAM-S that despite BJP being the largest party, it offered chief ministership of the state to the second largest party. “We made chief minister of JD (U). The NDA government is working in perfect co-ordination. Some people are creating confusion and controversy for petty gains. They will be exposed,” he said.JD (U) leaders refused to join the issue.The latest round of confrontation started on Tuesday when Manjhi tweeted that nobody could break Muslim-Dalit unity, referring to an incident in Purnia last month when a former village head, a Dalit, was killed in an attack by a mob, which also torched about a dozen houses.BJP minister Janak Ram had alleged forced conversion of Dalits. BJP’s state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, in a Facebook post, had criticised the government over attacks on Dalits.Earlier, Manjhi had questioned the use Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Covid vaccination certificates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-trying-to-destabilise-bihar-govt-says-hams-101623254709588.html
10-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police bust nationwide fraud syndicate operated by Chinese nationals||More than half a million Indians have been cheated of over ₹150 crore in two months by a nationwide fraud syndicate operated by Chinese nationals in connivance with Indian fraudsters, who were offering lucrative returns on an online multi-level marketing (MLM) campaign through their two “malicious mobile applications” Power Bank and EZPlan , the Delhi Police said on Wednesday.Eleven people, including a Tibetan woman and two chartered accountants (CAs) based in Delhi and Gurugram, were arrested following multiple raids in Delhi-NCR and West Bengal since June 2. The footprints of the syndicate were confirmed in West Bengal, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, Odisha, Assam, and Surat, the police said.Nearly ₹11 crore of cheated money was blocked in various bank accounts and online payment gateways that were being operated by the members of the syndicate based in India as well as China. Around ₹97 lakh was recovered from one of the arrested CAs, Avik Kedia, who formed over 110 “shell companies” for Chinese fraudsters to route the money through multiple bank accounts, deputy commissioner of police (cyber crime cell, CyPAD) Anyesh Roy said.Also Read | Delhi Police trains youngsters to bolster healthcare servicesDCP Roy said CyPAD officials recently came across several social media posts made by people across the country regarding two mobile apps – “Power Bank and ExPlan” – that offered to double the invested amount in 24-35 days. The apps also offered returns on an hourly and daily basis and had investment options starting from ₹300 to several lakhs.The Power Bank app was available on Google Play Store and trending at No 4. The EZPlan app was available on the website www.ezplan.in. DCP Roy said that since the messages were inducing the recipient to download an app through a short (encrypted) URL, the activity was identified as suspicious and the malware forensic lab of CyPAD-NCFL was asked to examine both the apps.“When analysed, CyPAD officials found that to deceive people, the Power Bank app projected itself as a product of a Bengaluru-based technology start-up. However, the server on which the app was hosted was found to be based in China. The app is associated with several dangerous permissions such as access to camera, read and write to external storage and to read contact details of the cellphone,” said DCP Roy.Investigators analysed the modus operandi of the two apps and found that to entice investors, initially the fraudsters gave a small payout amounting to 5-10% of the invested money. People, believing the scheme to be genuine, started investing more money as well as circulating and sharing the apps with their friends and relatives. Once someone had invested a large amount, their account was blocked by the app, thus causing severe financial loss, said the police.To identify and nab the people behind the scam, a CyPAd officer became a decoy customer, invested a token amount using the app and followed the money trail. The linked payment gateways, UPI IDs, transaction IDs, bank accounts that were used for routing the money were identified and analysed. A web of nearly 25 shell companies for routing the fraud money was traced across the country and it pointed to the involvement of professional accountants. Several mobile phone numbers connected with the bank accounts and involved in the scam were found to have Chinese origins, said DCP Roy.“Further analysis of mobile numbers active in India led to the arrest of Sheikh Robin in West Bengal’s Uluberia on June 2. The same day, nine other suspects were arrested, while a Tibetan woman, Pema Wangmo, was arrested later from Delhi’s IGI Airport, following inputs from the Bengaluru Police that is also probing a similar cheating module. She was acting on behest of the Chinese and creating shell companies with Indian directors,” added Roy.The other arrested persons were identified as Avik Kedia and Ronak Bansal, both CAs, Umakant Akash Joys, Ved Chandra, Hari Om, Abhishek Mansaramani, Arvind , Shashi Bansal and Mithlesh Sharma. At the time of his arrest, Robin had 29 bank accounts and 30 active cellphones. His disclosure revealed a startlingly well-planned conspiracy of cheating and fraud being organized by Chinese nationals through a labyrinth of shell companies, bank accounts, and dummy mobile numbers, the DCP said.“The Chinese fraudsters contacted Robin and others through encrypted mobile apps such as Telegram, Dingtalk and WeChat. The Chinese fraudsters and their local operatives also used sophisticated software and financial tools for automated fund transfer to manage the enormous scale of the fraud. Names of several Chinese nationals have been revealed so far. Investigation in respect of their whereabouts, specific roles and their large fraud network is underway,” added DCP Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-bust-nationwide-fraud-syndicate-operated-by-chinese-nationals-101623237188774.html

10-06-2021||World||G7 leaders to call for new probe into origins of Coronavirus: Draft communique||Leaders at the G7 Summit in UK will call for a new transparent investigation by the World Health Organization (WHO) into the origins of the Coronavirus while pledging one billion doses of vaccines for countries around the world, according to a leaked draft communiqué for the meeting. The leaders of the G7 states – Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US – will gather in the British seaside resort of Cornwall during June 11-13 for the summit. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was invited by the UK as a special guest but dropped plans to travel to Cornwall because of the pandemic, will virtually join G7 outreach sessions during June 12-13. A draft communiqué accessed by Bloomberg News said the G7 leaders will call for a “fresh, transparent, WHO-convened study” into the origins of the Coronavirus. This follows calls by several countries, including India and the US, for further studies to determine how Covid-19 spread last year. “I think we have been very clear that we support the need for a follow-up to the WHO report on the origin of Covid-19 and for further studies and we have called for understanding and cooperation of all in this regard,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday, without directly naming China. India first backed the call for further investigations on May 28, days after US President Joe Biden asked intelligence agencies to redouble their efforts to gather information to facilitate a definitive conclusion on the origin of the Coronavirus and to submit a fresh report on the issue within 90 days. Biden’s action angered China, which has said the US is playing politics. Within the US intelligence set-up, at least one agency is leaning towards the theory that the virus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan. Most scientific experts believe the virus jumped to humans from an animal host in a natural event, and the WHO’s probe earlier this year concluded it was “extremely unlikely” the pandemic began in a laboratory. The draft communiqué also contains a pledge by G7 leaders to deliver at least one billion extra doses of vaccines through dose-sharing and financing over the next year to help cover 80% of the world’s adult population. G7 officials are putting together the communiqué which outlines a plan to end the pandemic by December 2022. The document will form the basis of “final-stage talks” at the summit and will be released on Sunday. The figure of one billion additional vaccines doses will include 500 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine that the US will buy for distribution to some 100 countries. The White House said on Thursday the Biden administration had reached an agreement with Pfizer and a formal announcement would be made by the president in remarks before the G7 Summit. The US will donate 200 million doses in 2021 and 300 million doses in the first half of 2022, and the vaccines will begin shipping in August, the White House said. The Biden administration earlier said it will donate 80 million doses of vaccines – 20 million of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson jabs and 60 million doses of AstraZeneca shots – from surplus stocks to countries around the world. Three-fourths of these doses will be distributed through the WHO-backed COVAX facility. Prime Minister Modi will join the outreach sessions of the G7 Summit at the invitation of his UK counterpart Boris Johnson. The UK, which holds the G7 presidency, has invited India, Australia, South Korea and South Africa, as guest countries for the summit. The summit’s theme is “Build Back Better” and the UK has outlined four priority areas – leading the global recovery from Covid-19 while strengthening resilience against future pandemics, promoting prosperity by championing free and fair trade, tackling climate change, and championing shared values and open societies. This is the second time Modi will participate in a G7 meeting. India was invited by the G7 French presidency in 2019 to the Biarritz Summit as a goodwill partner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-leaders-to-call-for-new-probe-into-origins-of-coronavirus-draft-communique-101623338358449.html

The team will meet with Bukele Thursday.El Salvador’s congress approved a law this week requiring businesses to accept Bitcoin in exchange for goods and services. President Nayib Bukele said the digital currency will help counter El Salvador’s low banking penetration and cut the cost of sending remittances.The nation’s bonds dropped, sending the yield on its bonds coming due in 2025 up 71 basis points to 7.8% at 10:40 a.m. in New York. El Salvador’s bonds are the worst performers in emerging markets this week, according to a Bloomberg Barclays index.“The plans for Bitcoin under an increasingly autocratic regime will likely only compound concerns about corruption, money laundering and the independence of regulatory agencies,” Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America Fixed Income Strategy at Amherst Pierpont, wrote in a note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-sees-risks-after-el-salvador-makes-bitcoin-legal-tender-101623337622774.html

10-06-2021||World||Ex-president Karzai to lead Afghan team to Pakistan to push peace process||Former Afghan president Hamid Karzai is expected to lead a high-level delegation, including High Council for National Reconciliation chief Abdullah Abdullah, to Pakistan to give a push to efforts to forge a political settlement in Afghanistan amid the fast-paced drawdown of US forces. Karzai’s visit is being seen as complementary to US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad’s efforts to nudge the Afghan government and the Taliban towards a political settlement. Khalilzad began a visit on June 4 that has taken him to Afghanistan and Qatar, where he met the Taliban negotiating team. The team to be led by Karzai to Pakistan will represent the Grand Council that was convened recently by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to fashion a strategy for further talks with the Taliban, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. The inclusion of Abdullah in the team is an effort to project a united front, they said. Also Read | Talking to the TalibanThe team is expected to travel to Islamabad by June 20 and its members will engage with Pakistan’s political and military leadership to underline the importance of taking forward talks with the Taliban on finding a political settlement, the people said. “The team will convey the will of the Afghan people to the Pakistani leadership and discuss ways to bring the Taliban to the negotiating table,” one of the people cited above said. The Afghan side is expecting the Pakistani side to lend a helping hand, even though there is a heated dialogue in Kabul on the way forward with Islamabad, especially because of the lack of trust and suspicions about the Pakistani military’s close ties with elements within the Afghan Taliban, the people said. Referring to the Pakistani military’s relationship with the Haqqani Network, which has been blamed for a string of attacks in Afghanistan, a second person said: “It is better to convince the master so that they can convince the foot soldiers. The patron has been behaving badly for too long.” The Taliban have refused to open a dialogue with Ghani’s government and are holding separate talks with Khalilzad. It is believed UK Chief of Defence Staff Gen Nick Carter has been spearheading British efforts to push the Pakistani side to play a positive role in helping with the Afghan peace process. Key Western powers have pointed out to Pakistan that a positive role in the Afghan peace process would also be helpful at a time when Islamabad is dealing with various vulnerabilities and challenges, such as a worsening economy and pressure on the counter-terrorism front from bodies such as the Financial Action Task Force FATF). The people said there was a growing realisation in India, Afghanistan and key Western powers that the Taliban will have a part in the next government formed in Kabul and, therefore, the current efforts should ensure that the group did not emerge as the dominant power in such a dispensation. “Even Pakistan realises that a government in which the Taliban have free rein is not in its interests,” the first person cited above said. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said: “Everyone expects the Taliban to be part of the next Afghan government in some manner. This would indicate that efforts to contain the Taliban by all the players, except for Pakistan, haven’t yielded results, but it is also true that efforts to prop up other political elements have not been successful.” He added, “The only option now is to create an amalgamation of elements from both sides that will work for some sort of political stability in Afghanistan. Within this, the aim will be to ensure the Taliban doesn’t have the upper hand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expresident-karzai-to-lead-afghan-team-to-pakistan-to-push-peace-process-101623329659106.html
10-06-2021||World||China warns Japan after its PM refers to Taiwan as a ‘country’||China on Thursday said it has lodged stern protests and warned Japan after its Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga made a rare reference to Taiwan as a country during a parliamentary meeting a day before.China accused Japan of severely breaching its pledge not to refer to self-ruled Taiwan as a country, which Beijing sees as a breakaway region to be reunited, if required, by force.Suga had referred to Taiwan as a country during a meeting of National Diet, the country’s bicameral legislature on Wednesday.In his first one-on-one parliamentary debate with opposition leaders on Wednesday, Suga, naming Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan, said “such three countries have been imposing strong restrictions on privacy rights” to curb the novel coronavirus outbreak, Kyodo news agency said in its report from Tokyo.The reference evoked strong response from Beijing, which is against foreign countries having diplomatic ties with Taiwan or even referring to the island as a country.“Japanese leaders flagrantly refer to Taiwan as a ‘country’ on multiple occasions, severely violating principles set out in the four political documents including the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and its solemn and repeated commitment of not seeing Taiwan as a country,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Thursday.“China is strongly dissatisfied with Japan’s wrong remarks and has lodged solemn representation to the Japanese side,” Wang said, adding: “We ask Japan to make prompt clarification, remove the severe damage and ensure that such things won’t happen again.”Urging the Japanese side to “earnestly honour its commitment”, Wang said Tokyo should avoid undermining China’s sovereignty in any form and refrain from sending any wrong signal to the “Taiwan independence” forces.Wang emphasised that there is only “one China” in the world and “Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory”.Since Japan broke off diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1972, successive Japanese governments have usually called Taiwan a region, in accordance with its “one-China” policy.Japan-Taiwan ties recently, however, have shown signs of warming especially after Tokyo last week donated 1.24 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to help tackle the rising number of cases on the island.Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen thanked Japan for supplying “timely assistance”, calling Tokyo “a partner insisting on the same values of freedom and democracy”.In April, a joint statement after a summit between US President Joe Biden and Suga referred to the “importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait”.“The meeting was Biden’s first in-person meeting with a foreign head of state since taking office and was in line with the US administration’s efforts to rally its partners in the Indo-Pacific to counter China’s growing influence in the region. Notably, the statement was the first issued by leaders of the two countries to mention Taiwan since 1969,” Taiwan News reported. Ties between China and Japan are themselves fraught with the history of colonialism and maritime disputes with differences flaring frequently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-japan-after-its-pm-refers-to-taiwan-as-a-country-101623324556275.html
10-06-2021||World||Israel-Palestine conflict: A bit of Mahmoud Darwish, Edward Said in all those affected||The burning conflict between Israel and Palestine, which dates back decades, was all over the news in May. On social media too, along with snippets of air strikes between Hamas and Israel, there were polarised opinions on whether the Palestinian families should be evicted and their homes in Sheikh Jarrah, a neighbourhood near Damascus Gate, be given to Israeli settlers.What gave rise to the latest clashes?The conflict that has its roots in the early 19th century was stirred once again after a skirmish broke out between the Palestinian worshipers and Israeli police at Al Aqsa Mosque on the last Friday of Ramadan. The Temple Mount is considered the holiest place in Judaism and is the place to which Jews turn during prayer. It is also a site of the third-holiest shrine in Islam, the Al-Aqsa Mosque.The site is one of the most sensitive in the Middle East conflict and a tussle there sparked off the Israel-Hamas conflict which culminated in air strikes from Hamas in Gaza in response to the clash and counter-air strikes from Israel.Who was Mahmoud Darwish?Social media was flooded with images, poems and videos of Mahmoud Darwish and Edward Said around the time of the clashes. Mahmoud Darwish, a Palestinian poet and author who was also regarded as his country's national poet, remains relevant even today as his works speak for the many internally displaced people who fled or were expelled from their homes in Mandatory Palestine during the 1947-1949 Palestine war but remained within the area that became the state of Israel.Mahmoud Darwish was legally classified as ‘present-absent-alien’ after he was forced to first leave his homeland for Lebanon in 1948, when the village of al-Birwah in the district of Galilee was demolished along with 416 other Palestinian villages, then returned to Palestine ‘illegally’ a year later. Now an ‘internal refugee’, he settled in the nearby village of Dayr-al-Asad upon his return.Edward SaidEdward Said was a Palestinian American academic who was born in Jerusalem in 1935. He was also a political activist and a literary critic whose major works were in the field of, but not limited to, postcolonial studies — an academic field he was also a founder of.Like Darwish, Said was a Palestinian exile who claimed that his work was aimed at easing tensions between Palestinians and Israelis. When a photo of him throwing stones at a fence was published in 2002, he rubbished reports that said it was a "violent" gesture on his part and reiterated his claim. “One stone tossed into an empty place scarcely warrants a second thought,” he said in an official statement issued two days after the incident.When asked why he did it, Said said, "If my child asks me one day 'Dad what did you do in the war?', I will say that I threw a stone to vile and injustice."The image of him throwing the stone angered many Israelis but Said justified it as ‘a symbolic gesture of joy’. Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after 18 years of occupation in May 2000, it became a custom for Arab tourists to throw stones over the wire fence. The fence was erected at the border after the Israeli withdrawal.Sense of identityFor Said, whose family was a Protestant Christian and Palestinian, he was a "minority inside a minority". Said was a citizen of the United States as his father was a war veteran in the US army. In an interview with novelist Salman Rushdie in 1986, which was published in the New Left Review, Said talked about the Palestinian identity and consciousness in general and his alienation in New York."In Edward’s view, the broken or discontinuous nature of Palestinian experience entails that classic rules about form or structure cannot be true to that experience; rather, it is necessary to work through a kind of chaos or unstable form that will accurately express its essential instability. Edward then proceeds to introduce the theme…that the history of Palestine has turned the insider (the Palestinian Arab) into the outsider," Rushdie wrote after the interview.The last line of Said's memoir 'Out of Place' reads, “With so many dissonances in my life I have learned actually to prefer being not quite right and out of place.”Darwish's sense of identity was also complex. Following the loss of his homeland at an early age (he was 6 when he was first forced to flee from his country), he went on to find solace and purpose in creating an identity through his poetry, and lyrical prose. His works aim to answer one question -- 'Who am I?' -- and are a site of resistance.For him, “the personal and the public are always in an uneasy relationship” Said wrote in his essay 'On Mahmoud Darwish'.The Rita-element in Mahmoud DarwishReports suggest that Darwish was in love with a woman whom he called 'Rita' in his works. 'Rita' is the pen name for the Jewish-Israeli Tamar Ben-Ami, with whom Darwish met in Haifa and fell in love when he was 22.This transgressive love, which was out of place when it came to the poet's politics, was commemorated through his poems like 'Rita and the Rifle', 'Rita’s Winter' and 'The Sleeping Garden'. The complexity of Arab-Jewish relationships is explored in his work and we see an attempt to humanise the enemy.Darwish seems to be an advocate of dialogue with Israelis. He embraced the Israeli component in his Palestinian identity and did not condemn the former for being the 'other'.His poem 'Rita and the Rifle' is one such example in which he acknowledges the two lovers' differences and yet reminisces their time together and expresses his love for 'Rita'."Between Rita and my eyes is a gunand whoever knows Rita kneelsand praysto some divinity in those hazel eyes...""And I kissed Ritawhen she was youngand I remember how she clung to meand how my arm was covered by the loveliest of braidsand I remember Ritaas a sparrow remembers its stream...""Once upon a time …O silence of the eveningmy moon migrated far in the morningin the hazel eyesand the cityswept away all the singers and Rita.Between Rita and my eyes is a gun."Said's way forwardIn Said's view, the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) gave Palestine very little control and a limited territory. The Palestinian Authority was given self-governance of parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip after the accord.Separate Palestinian and Jewish states would be unrealisable, Said argued and while he recognised that both Palestinian and Jewish sides were against forming a single binational state, he claimed it to be the most suitable solution.“I see no other way than to begin now to speak about sharing the land that has thrust us together, and sharing it in a truly democratic way, with equal rights for each citizen,” he wrote in a 1999 essay in The New York Times.Darwish and Said, in their own capacities, remain relevant to the conflict of the Arab world till date. While the works of the former help explain the lack of coherence when it comes to identities of those affected by the conflict, the latter, among other things, addresses the problematic takeover of the East by the West which was guided by a sense of the white man's burden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israelpalestine-conflict-a-bit-of-mahmoud-darwish-edward-said-in-all-those-affected-101623318933943.html

A "ring of fire" will be visible around the Moon from several regions across the world, a celestial phenomenon whereby the Sun's halo is partially blocked by the lunar body. Although the annular solar eclipse will most prominently be visible in the northern hemisphere -- in parts of northeast Canada, Greenland, and Siberia -- Indians will be able to watch the annular solar eclipse 2021 online with the help of live stream options provided by Nasa and the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada Sudbury Centre.Solar eclipse: What is a "ring of fire"?NASA describes solar eclipse as an astronomical phenomenon that occurs when the Moon moves between the Sun and Earth, casting a shadow on the latter, fully or partially blocking the Sun's light in some areas.Also Read: Solar eclipse of June 10, 2021: These states will witness partial eclipse. Check timings, live stream optionsA total solar eclipse, as in when the Moon completely obscures the Sun, occurs because the Moon is about 400 times smaller than the Sun, but also 400 times closer, giving both the celestial bodies the same apparent size in the sky.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's orbit is not completely aligned with that of the Sun, thereby leaving a sliver of the solar halo.Because the Moon’s orbit is not perfectly circular, it can sometimes appear slightly smaller than the Sun. When this happens, we witness an annular solar eclipse, where a "ring of fire" appears around the Moon due to the remnant halo of the Sun.Solar eclipse of June 10, 2021The annular solar eclipse of June 10, 2021, where a "ring of fire" appears around the Moon due to the remnant halo of the Sun, will mostly be visible in the northern hemisphere. In the UK and Ireland, people will witness a partial solar eclipse while most of India, barring a few cities, will be missing out on the celestial phenomenon.Also Read: First solar eclipse of 2021 today, nearly all of India to miss outThe solar eclipse on Thursday is expected to begin here shortly after noon, at 1:42pm. The peak time will come around 4:16pm, when both the Sun and the Moon will conjunct exactly at 25 degrees in the Taurus sign. After that, the phenomenon will begin to recede and the solar eclipse will finally end at 6:41pm.About 35% of the Sun will be blocked out by the moon as viewed from Northern Ireland and Scotland, decreasing to about 20% in southeast England, according to Ryan Milligan, lecturer in astrophysics at Queen's University Belfast and an avid solar eclipse chaser. "Most people will be oblivious to what’s going on above their heads, even with clear skies," he said, adding that people need specially-approved solar eclipse glasses that reduce sunlight to safe levels to look directly at the Sun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/solar-eclipse-today-ring-of-fire-around-the-moon-during-annular-solar-eclipse-explained-101623310947529.html

From June 21, dining-in at restaurants can resume, as well as live performances, in-person tuition and gym classes. For companies however, work-from-home remains the default arrangement, according to the statement.“Further relaxations such as for group and event sizes, capacity limits, distancing requirements, mask-wearing and travel will be introduced when a sufficient proportion of the population has been fully vaccinated, especially for those who are vaccinated,” it said in the statement.The country’s daily virus count has dropped to the single-digit range since lockdown-like restrictions such as smaller group sizes and the ban on dining-in were imposed in mid-May, after an outbreak from Changi Airport resulted in the country’s largest active cluster. Singapore’s hard-won success in bringing the latest outbreak under control comes as the city-state ramps up vaccination.As of June 9, about 44% of the population have received their first dose, and about a third have been fully vaccinated, according to the statement. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last month pledged to reopen the economy as testing and inoculation become widespread, signalling a shift away from the strict containment approach that could be detrimental to the trade-reliant country.Vaccination, testingOfficials at a briefing on Thursday said they expect half of Singapore’s population to be fully vaccinated in August. Citizens aged 12 to 39 years old will be invited to register for vaccination from June 11, with this extended to the rest of the population over the coming months.As more activities resume, the government will also require all staff who work at settings with unmasked clients to be regularly tested, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated. These include staff of dine-in food outlets and fitness studios.Authorities have also granted interim approval for self-test kits, that produce results in less than 20 minutes, to be sold at retail pharmacies from June 16 onwards. Sales will be initially limited to 10 kits per person.“This wave of infection is not like a big forest fire where the entire thing is burning. We see spots of fire,” health minister Ong Ye Kung said at the briefing. “We didn’t resort to flying overhead and dropping big water bombs, but the trucks went in with our water tanks and hose, and we managed to put it out.”As Singapore looks to once again restart activities, Lee is set to meet his Australian counterpart, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, today. Morrison will be the first foreign leader to make an official visit to the city-state since Covid-19 broke out, and this takes place against a backdrop of interest within both countries to establish air travel bubbles with each another.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-relax-covid-rules-in-stages-as-infections-fall-101623313066375.html
10-06-2021||World||Three in four employees in India seek remote work options: Microsoft survey||Nearly three-fourths or 74% of Indian employees say they want more flexible remote work options while at the same time 73% of them are also craving more in-person time with their teams, according to findings of Microsoft's first annual work trend index released on Thursday. To prepare, 73% of business decision-makers are considering redesigning physical spaces to better accommodate hybrid work environments. The data is clear: extreme flexibility and hybrid work will define the post-pandemic workplace.Microsoft said last year's move to remote work boosted feelings of inclusion for workers because everyone was in the same virtual room. But the move to a hybrid work environment will need to ensure employees are given the flexibility to work when and where they want, as well as the tools they need to equally contribute from wherever they happen to be.The 2021 work trend index outlines findings from a study of more than 30,000 people in 31 countries and analyses trillions of aggregate productivity and labour signals across Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn. It also includes perspectives from experts who have studied collaboration, social capital, and space design at work for decades."If we have learned one thing in the last year, it is that we are no longer bound to traditional notions of space and time when it comes to how, when, and where we work," said Rajiv Sodhi, chief operating officer at Microsoft India.The findings attest that remote work has created new opportunities but there are challenges ahead as well."We believe hybrid work is the future and a successful hybrid strategy will require extreme flexibility. As every organisation fundamentally reimagines itself for the hybrid work era, we are collectively learning and innovating on how we will shape the future of work in India. It is time to embrace work as a frame of mind, not a place you go."Creating a hybrid work plan for any organisation requires a flexible operating model spanning people, places, and processes, show index findings.To help people thrive, organisations need to rethink the entire employee experience -- from creating a culture to attracting and retaining talent and building privacy-backed listening systems.The findings say work has become more human and authentic. Co-workers leaned on each other in new ways to get through the last year.One among four (24%) Indian employees has cried with a colleague and 35% of people are less likely to feel embarrassed now when their home lives show up at work. As living rooms made way for work meetings, 37% of people got to meet their co-workers' families.The genuine interactions with coworkers are helping to foster a workplace where 63% of Indian workers said they are more likely to be their full, authentic selves at work.At the same time, digital overload is real and rising. Self-assessed productivity has remained the same or higher for many employees over the past year, but at a human cost.About 62% of the Indian workforce says their companies are asking too much of them at a time like this and 13% say their employer does not care about their work-life balance.More than half -- 57% to be exact -- of Indian employees feel overworked and 32% feel exhausted.The findings say India's first generation of digital natives (Gen Z) appears to be suffering and need to be re-energised. Nearly 71% of this generation -- those between the ages of 18 and 25 years -- say they are merely surviving or flat-out struggling.Very significantly, a vast talent marketplace is one of the brightest outcomes from shift to remote work. Remote job postings on LinkedIn increased more than five times in the last year, and people are taking notice.This fundamental shift expands economic opportunity for individuals and enables organisations to build high-performing, diverse teams from a near-limitless talent pool.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-in-four-employees-in-india-seek-remote-work-options-microsoft-survey-101623307415007.html

Military help is also not likely at government enclaves across the country, the newspaper reported.Additional airstrikes would require Biden's approval, the Times noted.The National Security Council declined to comment to the Times on the options being discussed.The Hill has reached out to the White House and the Pentagon for comment. The report comes as the US military reaches the halfway point of withdrawing forces.Biden said in April that all US troops would be withdrawn from Afghanistan by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks that sparked the conflict.Meanwhile, President Biden said at the time that the US would continue to provide humanitarian assistance and support peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.Still, questions remained about how the US would handle threats from the region. Concerns over a rise in violence have grown amid clashes between the Afghan military and the Taliban since Biden announced the withdrawal, reported The Hill.Biden is also under pressure to evacuate Afghans who helped US forces during the conflict and are at risk of being hunted by the Taliban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-mulls-authorising-airstrikes-in-afghanistan-if-country-falls-into-crisis-report-101623306724766.html

The man was discovered Tuesday by a deputy responding to a call about a suspicious vehicle parked near the winery in Santa Rosa, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. The deputy saw a hat on a piece of farming equipment and then found the man stuck inside the shaft of a vineyard fan. Firefighters rescued him.“The man indicated he liked to take pictures of the engines of old farm equipment,” the statement said. “After a thorough investigation, which revealed the farm equipment wasn’t antique and the man had far more methamphetamine than camera equipment, the motivation to climb into the fan shaft remains a total mystery.”The 38-year-old man required medical treatment but is expected to make a full recovery, the office said.The man will be charged with trespassing and drug possession, as well as violations of a probation case, the statement said.Vineyard fans are used to circulate air across vines to keep grapes from freezing during colder months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-rescued-after-being-trapped-for-2-days-in-giant-fan-at-santa-rosa-vineyard-101623305333893.html

Beginning on June 15, Facebook will let any employee whose job can be done remotely ask to work that way permanently, the internet giant told news agency AFP."We believe how we work is more important than where we work," Facebook said while sharing an update to its remote work policy."We want to be the place where people can do the best work of their careers while ensuring a consistent experience for employees no matter where they're located."Facebook and other Silicon Valley firms shifted to remote work early in the pandemic, relying on the internet tools they create to get jobs done.Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has said he expects the shift to remote work to be a lasting one at the leading social network, which plans to look for employees able to do their jobs from wherever they happen to live.Facebook recently began reopening its offices after a yearlong pandemic shutdown, but without perks such as free food and commuter shuttles.The rollout of vaccines and improving health conditions were cited as reasons for gradually welcoming employees back to abandoned campuses.Facebook said work schedules for those returning to offices will be flexible, but its guidance is for people to be on-site at least half the time.The leading social network said it is on track to have most of its US campuses at 50 percent capacity by early September.Some Facebook offices in Europe and Asia are open, according to the California-based firm.Safety protocols in place include wearing face masks and keeping one's distance at work, along with routine Covid-19 testing, according to Facebook.As of June 15, Facebook will also expand remote work across international borders, supporting moves from the United States to Canada as well as shifts to Britain from other parts of Europe, the company said.Google and Microsoft have unveiled similar hybrid schemes for workers, while some firms such as Twitter have told employees they can work remotely indefinitely.Apple is reportedly facing employee resistance to its plan to bring employees back to the office.The iPhone maker has called for employees to return three days a week starting in September, according to the tech news site The Verge.But some Apple workers have signed a letter calling for more flexibility for employees who have been doing their jobs remotely for more than a year.The Apple letter said the remote system works well and gives employees better work-life balance while accommodating those with special needs and reducing the risk of contagion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-offers-permanent-work-from-home-for-employees-even-as-offices-reopen-101623303929754.html

'The 2021 Atlantic Charter is designed to echo those values and cover new partnerships, including a new Travel Taskforce for renewed US-UK exchanges.“While Churchill and Roosevelt faced the question of how to help the world recover following a devastating war, today we have to reckon with a very different but no less intimidating challenge - how to build back better from the coronavirus pandemic,” said Johnson.“And as we do so, cooperation between the UK and US, the closest of partners and the greatest of allies, will be crucial for the future of the world’s stability and prosperity. The agreements President Biden and I will make today [Thursday], rooted as they are in our shared values and outlook, will form the foundation of a sustainable global recovery," he said."Eighty years ago the US President and British Prime Minister stood together promising a better future. Today we do the same,” he added.The new Atlantic Charter will outline eight areas to work together, around values of defending democracy, reaffirming the importance of collective security, and building a fair and sustainable global trading system, Downing Street said.The principled commitments made in the new Atlantic Charter will be underpinned by a series of new policy priorities expected to be agreed by the two leaders ahead of the formal G7 deliberations.These include working to open up travel between the UK and US as soon as possible."Many people in the UK and US have been prevented from seeing family and friends for over 400 days as a result of coronavirus travel restrictions. Before the outbreak of coronavirus more than 5 million Brits visited the US and over 4.5 million Americans visited the UK every year - more than any other country," Downing Street said.Biden and Johnson expected to agree to work to relaunch UK-US travel as soon as possible through a new Travel Taskforce, which will make recommendations on safely reopening international travel.The taskforce will work to explore options and to ensure that the UK and US closely share thinking and expertise on international travel policy going forward.It’s also expected that the leaders will agree to pursue a landmark bilateral technology agreement, to be signed next year."The agreement will start a new era of strategic cooperation by reducing the barriers British tech firms face when trying to work with their US counterparts. By combining our shared expertise in areas like AI and quantum technology, the UK and US have the potential to transform the way we live," Downing Street said.It added that the two leaders will agree to work together to harness their power to address modern challenges like climate change, fighting cancer and antimicrobial resistance, as well as strengthening our strategic advantage on the international stage as like-minded democracies.To strengthen UK and US efforts to beat the coronavirus pandemic and prevent any future outbreaks, the two leaders are expected to agree to "scale up" joint work on genomic sequencing and variant assessments.This includes the UK Health Security Agency’s new Centre for Pandemic Preparedness linking up with its US counterpart, the proposed National Center for Epidemic Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, as part of an integrated global surveillance system.Discussions between the Prime Minister and President Biden are also expected to cover other areas of bilateral cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-biden-to-hold-first-in-person-meeting-ahead-of-g7-leaders-summit-101623302525983.html

Sri Lanka is currently using China's Sinopharm and Rusian Sputnik V vaccines.Sri Lanka has witnessed an increase of positive cases and deaths since April, partly caused by celebrations and shopping during last month's traditional new year festival.

The UNODC partially attributed the rise in supply to the ease in obtaining precursors to manufacture meth and other drugs. The supply of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy, cannabinoids, and ketamine has also expanded across the region, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/illegal-drug-trade-booming-amid-covid-19-pandemic-asia-sees-record-rise-in-crystal-meth-use-101623300447660.html
10-06-2021||World||Canada: Researchers claim to have developed treatment for blood clot from AZ jab||Researchers in Canada have claimed to have demonstrated an effective treatment for a rare blood clot caused by the Covid-19 vaccine made by AstraZeneca, which is also manufactured under the brand name Covishield by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII).Scientists at the McMaster Platelet Immunology Laboratory (MPIL), which is part of the faculty of health sciences at McMaster University in Hamilton in the province of Ontario, recommended “two treatments, a combination of anti-clotting drugs with high doses of intravenous immunoglobulin” to combat the adverse side-effect - vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).“The use of high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) plus anticoagulation is recommended for the treatment of VITT, a rare side-effect of adenoviral vector vaccines against Covid-19,” they said in a study published in New England Journal of Medicine.The university described it as a “new lifesaving treatment”. MPIL’s scientific director and associate professor of medicine Ishac Nazy said, “If you were a patient with VITT, I’d be telling you, we know of a treatment approach. We can diagnose it accurately with our tests, treat it, and we know exactly how the treatment works.”MPIL is the only laboratory accredited by Canadian health authorities to test treatments for this rare condition. There have been 28 such cases officially reported in Canada so far, including five fatalities.MPIL researchers devised an “effective VITT test and treatment by building on their previous investigations of heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT),” the release said. Scientists modified their HIT test to “detect VITT-specific antibodies that are found, albeit rarely, in patients who had a Covid-19 vaccine”.Following that, tests on blood samples taken from three Canadian patients who were suffering from the side-effect “showed how high doses of immunoglobulin coupled with blood-thinner medications shut down platelet activation and stopped clot formation”.Nazy said, “We now understand the mechanism that leads to platelet activation and clotting.”Around 2.8 million doses of the AZ vaccine have been administered to Canadians, including 500,000 doses of Covishield. While the number recorded as having suffered from adverse reactions was minuscule, health authorities like those in Ontario had paused use of the vaccine in mid-May. The vaccination drive has now resumed for second doses, though the National Advisory Committee on Immunisation updated its recommendation earlier this month to say that the first dose of the AZ vaccine can be followed by a second jab of a Pfizer or Moderna shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-researchers-claim-to-have-developed-treatment-for-blood-clot-from-az-jab-101623300433634.html

One included a pretty woman holding up a sign that read, "Do you want to live at the library with me, from morning till night?" and the other said, "Do you want me to become part of your youth?"The other photos, especially when men held up the signs, did not feature the seemingly suggestive text.For example, one man was pictured holding a sign that said, "Do you want to become an honest, diligent and ambitious NJU student?"The ads became controversial online almost immediately."The problem with this photo is that it treats women as if they should be someone's belonging. These women made it to NJU, but now they are 'part of someone else's youth'? That is ridiculous," one comment said on Weibo.Another wrote: "As a top university, you should recruit based on your resources and quality of your academics, instead of using hot guys and pretty women to lure people."NJU deleted the ads after they receiving the criticism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-top-university-faces-criticism-for-using-women-to-lure-applicants-101623299456269.html

They will be instrumental in delivering my vision for the #PresidencyOfHope,” Shahid tweeted.Hussain is Maldives’ permanent representative to the UN and doubles up as ambassador to the US and Canada.Naidu is India’s deputy permanent representative to the UN, and he will be on loan from the Indian government to the United Nations for a position that is comparable to the Indian prime minister’s principal secretary, who oversees the cabinet bureaucracy; also something like the chief of staff to the US president.Naidu will probably be the first Indian diplomat to be named to this position, and as such, his appointment bears testimony to India’s growing influence in the world body. India started a two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in January - it’s eighth so far - with an unstated goal of, among other things, to buttress its claim to a permanent membership of the most exclusive club of nations in the world.Naidu’s stewardship of the UN general assembly bureaucracy will be critical at a time when the world body is trying to get back on its feet with Covid-19 being steadily brought under control.

In what comes as their first such call since the start of the Biden-Harris administration, the ministers “agreed to promote the healthy development of pragmatic cooperation in trade and investment” and “exchanged views frankly and pragmatically on relevant issues and mutual concerns,” according to a statement by the Xi Jinping-led Chinese government.US-China relations have remained strained for years owing to pinched economic ties, hegemonic rivalry in the Pacific, mutual suspicion over each other's political intentions, and global influence. The phone call today between the commerce ministers of two countries is part of an attempt to bridge these fraught ties under the Biden administration — and is the third such call this week, after Chinese vice-premier Liu He spoke with US trade representative Katherine Tai and treasury secretary Janet Yellen earlier.China appears optimistic regarding the latest attempts in normalising economic and political ties between the two countries. According to Gao Feng, the spokesperson for China's commerce ministry, the country has started "normal communications" with the US. The two sides have agreed to pragmatically solve some issues for producers and consumers, and promote healthy, stable economic and trade ties, he said.US statements, on the other hand, do not look that positive. While the Biden administration is committed to leveling the "significantly imbalanced" trade ties with China, there are parts of the US-China relationship “that are unhealthy and have over time been damaging in some very important ways to the US economy,” said US trade representative Katherine Tai said on the weekend before a meeting of Asia-Pacific trade ministers.Investors and market analysts are keeping a close watch on the developments in the international sphere, according to the news agency, without getting overly excited about the normalisation attempts just yet. While it is true that both countries stepping up economic and trade cooperation is a positive step worth highlighting, it is also true that any notable "game-changing decision" or announcement is yet to be made.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-china-trade-officials-hold-first-phone-call-agree-to-promote-healthy-ties-101623290490594.html

"We were told that a peaceful protest is being organised and the demonstrators were instructed against violence, road blockades and hate speech," he said.The protest in Bahria Town Karachi (BTK) against land grabbing turned violent as fast food franchises, several vehicles, a showroom and two offices of estate agents were set ablaze and police resorted to teargas shelling and firing rubber bullets.An anti-terrorism court in Karachi has handed over 120 people to the police for two-day physical remand, reported The Frontier Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/like-conversing-with-deaf-sindh-cm-lashes-out-at-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-101623287942543.html

But it may be the North Korean leader’s Swiss timepiece that provides the clearest evidence he’s been watching his weight.Also Read: North Korea’s Kim Jong Un appears in public for the first time in monthKim’s ever-present IWC Schaffhausen Portofino appeared to have been fastened tighter around his wrist in the latest photos released by state media, according to an analysis published Tuesday by NK News. The Seoul-based news site compared close-ups of the $12,000 watch from past months to support observations that Kim, 37, had slimmed down.The North Korean leader’s weight has long been tracked by spy agencies for clues about about the stability of his autocratic and secretive regime, especially since his family has a history of heart disease. South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers in November that Kim weighed an estimated 140 kilograms (309 pounds) and had gained some 50 kilograms since coming to power in 2011.“Foreign intelligence agencies want to know is Kim Jong Un healthy enough to remain the leader for a long amount of time,” said Colin Zwirko, a senior analytic correspondent for NK News. “What’s going on behind the scenes, if he’s unhealthy? And how does that affect security in the region given North Korea has nuclear weapons.”Kim’s health became the subject of global intrigue during a 20-day absence last year in which he missed birthday celebrations for his late grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung. The Seoul-based news site Daily NK reported that Kim had undergone a “cardiovascular surgical procedure,” and, when he finally emerged, NK News cited a mark on his wrist as possible evidence to support that theory.Kim hadn’t been featured in North Korean state media for about a month before reports Saturday that he had attended a ruling party meeting on economic issues. The country’s economy has shown little sign of growth this year after its worst contraction in decades as it continues to struggle with the pandemic, U.S. sanctions and a lack of trade with China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-swiss-watch-clearest-evidence-of-weight-loss-101623287376413.html
10-06-2021||World||Drug kingpin El Chapo's wife expected to plead guilty to US charges||The wife of Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is expected to plead guilty to federal criminal charges after she had been charged in the US with helping her husband run his multibillion-dollar criminal empire.Emma Coronel Aispuro is due in court Thursday in Washington for a plea agreement hearing, according to court records. She had previously pleaded not guilty after being charged in a single-count criminal complaint with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana in the US.She was arrested in February at Dulles International Airport in Virginia.Prosecutors have alleged Coronel “worked closely with the command-and-control structure” of the Sinaloa cartel and conspired to distribute large quantities of drugs, knowing they would be smuggled into the US.Her arrest was a surprise in part because authorities made no move to arrest her over the past two years, even after she was implicated in her husband’s crimes. During Guzman’s trial in 2019, prosecutors said she helped orchestrate Guzman’s two prison breaks in Mexico.As Mexico’s most powerful drug lord, Guzman ran a cartel responsible for smuggling cocaine and other drugs into the United States during his 25-year reign, prosecutors say. They also said his “army of sicarios,” or “hit men,” was under orders to kidnap, torture and kill anyone who got in his way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drug-kingpin-el-chapo-s-wife-expected-to-plead-guilty-to-us-charges-101623283460291.html
10-06-2021||World||Setbacks for SII leave world short of Covid-19 shots||round the world, from Bangladesh to Nepal to Rwanda, vulnerable hotspots have been grappling with stalled Covid-19 vaccination programmes as they run out of doses. Many of those shortages can be traced back to a single company: The Serum Institute of India.The world’s largest vaccine maker, Serum was last year named a top supplier of coronavirus shots to Covax, the World Health Organization-backed initiative aimed at securing an equitable global rollout. But the company has been dogged by setbacks, from a ban on exports to a factory fire, which have hampered its ability to fill orders.Covax has pledged to send shots to some 92 countries, but has so far received only 30 million of the minimum 200 million doses it ordered from Serum. Serum’s travails have now become a cautionary tale for becoming over-reliant on one manufacturer.Other manufacturers have also had trouble meeting targets, yet Serum’s shortfalls are particularly consequential because Covax and emerging countries were counting on it so heavily.The company has been unable to send any shots overseas since April, when the India banned vaccine exports amid the country’s devastating second wave. But some of Serum’s problems began long before.Last year, Serum’s chief executive officer, Adar Poonawalla, pledged that his vaccine producing colossus would churn out 400 million doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s coronavirus shot for low and middle-income countries by the end of 2020. A month into 2021, he said it had manufactured only 70 million shots because the company had been uncertain about when it would receive a license from India and didn’t have enough warehouse space.A string of nations had also entered into direct contracts with Serum and are now racing to find new suppliers. In Nepal, the government says it has received only half of the 2 million shots it ordered directly from Serum. The rest were supposed to arrive by March.“We are struggling with the shortage of vaccines,” said Tara Nath Pokhrel, the director of the family welfare division at Nepal’s health ministry.The decision to choose Serum as a major Covax supplier “was based, largely, on the company’s massive production capacity, ability to deliver at low cost and the fact that its vaccine was one of the earliest to gain WHO emergency use listing,” said Seth Berkley, chief executive officer at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which has been facilitating Covax.Berkley says Serum’s manufacturing capacity is now expanding. Still, Covax and many developing countries are scrambling to find new sources after Serum said that exports are unlikely to resume until the end of 2021 given the needs of India. Bangladesh too briefly stopped giving out first vaccination doses after Serum’s supply shortages.The situation Serum now finds itself in a turnaround. In November, Poonawalla said Serum was aiming to have 100 million doses ready in reserve by the end of December, just a quarter of the amount promised. In January, he lowered that to 70 million.Poonawalla said in January that the shortfalls were due to a lack of warehouse space after slower than anticipated regulatory approvals in India. The company filed their application for an emergency license in early December. Over recent months Poonawalla has also cited US policies for some of his company’s problems, spearheading complaints against a de-facto American export ban on some vaccine raw materials.Meanwhile, in January, a fire broke out at one of Serum’s plants. The manufacturer at first downplayed its impact, but it led to losses of equipment and delays in putting on additional manufacturing lines, according to a person familiar with the matter.“Right now I think they are really, really stuck -- that’s a major blow to Covax,” said Cleo Kontoravdi, a member of Imperial College London’s Future Vaccine Manufacturing Research Hub and Vaccine Research Network.Serum didn’t respond to a list of questions.There have been shortages in India as well. India’s initial order sheet in January was parsimonious -- just 11 million shots at first. But as the second wave swept across the demand shot up, and supplies dwindled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/setbacks-for-sii-leave-world-short-of-covid-19-shots-101623269299473.html

This means for every 10 people who get the strain, another 15 or 16 people will contract it.The modelling came as the UK recorded another 7,540 coronavirus cases in the latest 24-hour period on Wednesday, the highest since the end of February."Basically [the modelling] is saying there is a risk of a substantial third wave, (but) we cannot be definitive about the scale of that – it could be substantially lower than the second wave or it could be of the same order of magnitude,” professor Ferguson told reporters.“That, critically, depends on how effective the vaccines still are protecting people against hospitalisation and death against the Delta variant, as well as a few other unknowns. The key issue is how long will it keep on doubling, because we are starting at a very low level and we have a lot of immunity in the population from vaccination and from people being infected in the past," he said.The scientist also said that delaying the June 21 complete unlocking would allow for "more people to get second doses" of vaccines, as the modelling suggests benefits to "getting more vaccines into more arms as it reduces the scale of any third wave".It comes as the government continues to weigh up the data in order to make an announcement on the next stage in the lockdown roadmap by Monday.Meanwhile, the National Health Service (NHS) declared another milestone in its vaccination programme with more than 1 million bookings for a Covid-19 vaccine through the NHS website on Tuesday. It marks a record high figure and the first time daily appointments booked through the national booking service have topped the million mark.As eligibility extended to people aged 25 to 29 on Tuesday morning, a total of 1,082,596 first and second dose slots were snapped up across the day online and by phone, around 45,000 an hour on average and more than 750 every minute, over the full 24 hours.“The Covid-19 vaccine is still the best protection against coronavirus and as further supplies become available to us week by week it’s great that we’ve seen 25 to 29 year olds sending bookings to blockbuster levels, following hard on the heels of the millions of others,” said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS chief executive.“Hitting 1 million bookings in a day sends a fantastic signal that getting the Covid-19 vaccine is something that all of us – no matter our age – can value and be excited by and most importantly should get, when our opportunity comes,” said Dr Emily Lawson, lead for the NHS Covid Vaccination Programme.Meanwhile, coronavirus vaccines and tests are being stepped up in hotspot areas of north-west England to try to deal with the rise in cases of the Delta variant – the highly transmissible VOC first detected in India. Local leaders have asked for extra vaccine doses to vaccinate everyone even faster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-uk-epidemiologist-warns-of-substantial-third-wave-of-covid-19-backed-by-new-data-modelling-101623270207658.html

It was one of hundreds of rollbacks of environmental and public health regulations under former President Donald Trump, who said the rules imposed unnecessary burdens on business.The Trump-era rule, finalized last year, was long sought by builders, oil and gas developers, farmers and others who complained about federal overreach that they said stretched into gullies, creeks and ravines on farmland and other private property.Environmental groups and public-health advocates said the rollback approved under Trump would allow businesses to dump pollutants into unprotected waterways and fill in some wetlands, threatening public water supplies downstream and harming wildlife and habitat.The water rule has been a point of contention for decades. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Michael Regan has pledged to issue a new rule that protects water quality while not overly burdening small farmers.President Joe Biden ordered a review of the Trump-era rule as part of a broader executive action on climate change during his first week in office. Wednesday's legal filing by the Justice Department begins that process, as the Biden administration formally requests repeal of the Trump-era rule.“Today's action reflects the agencies' intent to initiate a new rulemaking process that restores the protections in place prior to the 2015 WOTUS implementation, and anticipates developing a new rule'' that defines what waters are considered to be under federal jurisdiction, the EPA said in a statement Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-to-repeal-trump-era-rule-that-ended-federal-protection-for-waterways-101623268274707.html

If they arrive by air, they also must stay in a designated hotel until they receive a negative Covid-19 test."The first step ... is to allow fully vaccinated individuals currently permitted to enter Canada to do so without the requirement to stay in government-authorized accommodation," Health Minister Patty Hajdu told reporters on Wednesday.The easing of restrictions will hinge on Covid-19 case numbers and vaccinations, she said.Canadian businesses, especially airlines and those that depend on tourism, have been lobbying for Ottawa to relax restrictions as more and more people are vaccinated. But Hajdu made clear that Ottawa would act slowly.Asked about calls from businesses to lift restrictions starting on June 22, Hajdu said: "We do want to be cautious and careful on these next steps to be sure that we are not putting that recovery in jeopardy."The Canadian Chamber of Commerce welcomed the announcement but said much work still remained."As other countries move ahead with their reopening plans, it is critical for Canada to catch up by providing a national reopening strategy, including a plan for border measures," it said in a statement.By June 21, Canada is due to decide whether to extend land border restrictions with the United States. The measures do not affect trade.Hajdu said Canada would take a "phased approach towards adjusting current border measures."It is still unclear when the border rules might change for foreign travelers.There will be as many as seven phases, with borders not fully open until some 75% of Canadians are fully vaccinated, a source familiar with the matter said.Canada is working on developing a vaccine certificate that can be presented at the border as proof of vaccination, Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc told reporters.Even if fully vaccinated, Canadians will be required to take a Covid-19 test before departure and upon arrival, and then quarantine until they receive a negative result, Hajdu saidSome 70% of eligible Canadians have received a first shot, Procurement Minister Anita Anand said on Wednesday, while about 10% are fully vaccinated.Canada is due to receive millions of doses of both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in June. Canada will receive 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, with some coming for the first time from the United States, Anand said.On Tuesday, the Biden administration said it was forming expert working groups with Canada, Mexico, the European Union and the United Kingdom to determine how best to safely restart travel after 15 months of pandemic restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-to-relax-quarantine-protocols-for-fully-vaccinated-citizens-returning-home-starting-early-july-101623266116186.html

Biden, who is due to arrive in Britain on Wednesday at the start of his first trip abroad as president, has said he would press Putin to respect human rights.Putin said last Friday he expected the talks to be held in a positive atmosphere, though he anticipated no breakthrough.He said allegations that Russian hackers were behind a cyber attack that disrupted meat production in North America and Australia were an attempt to provoke a political row ahead of the summit, Interfax news agency reported.Despite "destructive noise" by both sides, a mutual objective has emerged to put their relationship "on a more predictable and stable basis", said Robert Legvold, professor emeritus at Colombia University and a Russia expert."Over time Geneva summits have been critical to the relationship," he told reporters in the Swiss city on Wednesday."And when it comes to actually working out important areas of cooperation, strategic nuclear arms control, the majority of those talks have been in Geneva too."Diplomatic sources expect confirmation of the venue later on Wednesday or Thursday. The Swiss police and army have closed the two parks surrounding the Villa La Grange and installed barricades and barbed wire.Neutral Switzerland, which did not join Western sanctions against Russia for its 2014 annexation of the Crimea region from Ukraine, lobbied hard to land the first big power summit in the Alpine country in decades."RESET"In the Cold War era, US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev held their first summit in Geneva in Nov. 1985 and agreed to pursue cuts in their nuclear arsenals.In Geneva in 2009, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov a yellow box bearing a red "reset" button to symbolise improved ties under President Barack Obama. But the word "reset" was mistranslated into the Russian word for "overcharge", creating an awkward moment.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Lavrov will accompany Biden and Putin.The classic villa is located in a park along the left bank. Dotted with redwood trees, rose bushes and ancient fountains, the park offers a stunning view of Lake Geneva and sailboats.Biden is also scheduled to hold talks with Swiss President Guy Parmelin.Switzerland has represented US interests in Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution, often facilitating the transfer of prisoners between the two foes. Tax issues are likely to be raised after Biden referred to Switzerland as a "fiscal paradise" in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-meet-russia-s-vladimir-putin-in-18th-century-swiss-villa-for-june-16-summit-101623265038896.html

The duo also denied knowing any Barbara Jarabica, a female friend of Choksi who he alleged was also behind his abduction. Choksi, in his complaint filed before the Antiguan Royal Police force on June 3, has named one Gurmit Singh as one of his kidnappers. Bhandal and Gurmit Singh have also been named by Michael Polak, a lawyer assisting the Choksi family in the UK, in a complaint filed at British Police’s War Crimes Unit. Barbara Jarabica and another UK resident Gurdip Bath are also said to have been named in the lawyer’s complaint. Bhandal told Writeups24 that he is of Indian origin and resides in Midlands, United Kingdom and doesn’t even remember when he last visited India while referring to his association with India or any Indian authority.He added that he will cooperate with investigators in Antigua if contacted but they were yet to approach him. Asked about their whereabouts on the day Mehul Choksi went missing, Bhandal told the website they were on English Harbour (Antigua) but left late morning for Dominica after clearing immigration. Bhandal further said their plan was to go to St Lucia from Dominica but he got seasick and they had to take a charter to Barbados directly. They denied knowing about Mehul Choksi and anything about allegations levelled by him. Asked why Choksi and his lawyers have specifically taken their name, the duo told Writeups24 -- “On Monday morning when I was not feeling well, so I told them I would like to get out of the boat. Most of the customs and coast guards took our picture and came and started inspecting the boat asking questions. Maybe someone had shared out information with them since our boat was there.”They added they are friends and often sail together in the Mediterranean but this time they decided to go to Caribbean. Bhandal said he works in property purchasing while Gurmit Singh is retired. Barbara Jarabica, in interviews with Indian TV channels, has also denied any role in abduction of Choksi. Choksi has alleged that he was abducted by 8-10 people from Barbara’s house in Antigua on May 23 around 5:15 pm and brought to Dominica in a boat. Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne has said they are conducting an investigation into the allegations of abduction. Choksi is currently being treated in Dominica but is facing illegal entry charges in the country while the Indian government is pushing for his deportation directly to India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-uk-nationals-say-they-have-no-role-in-mehul-choksi-s-abduction-101623265210643.html

Two hundred million doses — enough to fully protect 100 million people — would be shared this year, with the balance to be donated in the first half of 2022, the person said.National security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Wednesday that Biden was committed to sharing vaccines because it was in the public health and strategic interests of the US As Biden embarks on his first foreign trip, he is aiming to show “that democracies are the countries that can best deliver solutions for people everywhere," Sullivan said.“As he said in his joint session (address), we were the ‘arsenal of democracy’ in World War II," Sullivan said. "We're going to be the ‘arsenal of vaccines’ over this next period to help end the pandemic.”The news of the Pfizer sharing plan was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the president's formal announcement. The news was first reported by the Washington Post.The US has faced mounting pressure to outline its global vaccine sharing plan. Inequities in supply around the world have become more pronounced, and the demand for shots in the US — where nearly 64% of adults have received at least one dose — has dropped precipitously.The announcement comes a week after the White House unveiled its plans to donate an initial allotment of 25 million doses of surplus vaccine overseas, mostly through the United Nations-backed COVAX program, promising infusions for South and Central America, Asia, Africa and others at a time of glaring shortages abroad.Overall, the White House has announced plans to share 80 million doses globally by the end of June, most through COVAX. Officials say a quarter of the nation’s excess will be kept in reserve for emergencies and for the US to share directly with allies and partners.The White House has also directed doses to allies including South Korea, Taiwan and Ukraine.Global public health groups had been aiming to use the upcoming G-7 meetings in Cornwall, England, to press the nation's wealthiest democracies to do more to share vaccines with the world, and Biden's plans drew immediate praise toward that end.“The Biden administration’s decision to purchase and donate additional Covid-19 vaccine doses is the kind of bold leadership that is needed to end this global pandemic," said Tom Hart, acting CEO at The ONE Campaign, a nonprofit that seeks to end poverty. “This action sends an incredibly powerful message about America’s commitment to helping the world fight this pandemic and the immense power of US global leadership.”Sullivan told reporters Wednesday that he does not expect the US push to waive the patents on vaccines to cause tension with European counterparts.“We’re all converging around the idea that we need to boost vaccine supply in a number of ways, sharing more of our own doses,” Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One. “We’ll have more to say on that, helping get more manufacturing capacity around the world.”Globally, there have been more than 3.7 million confirmed deaths from Covid-19, and more than 174 million people have been confirmed infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-buy-500-million-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-share-globally-via-covax-reports-101623264117007.html

If you’re young and haven’t gotten your shot yet, it really is time. It’s the best way to protect yourself and those you love," Biden tweeted on Tuesday.Dr Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said the Delta variant accounts for more than 6 per cent of the cases being sequenced in the US. The actual number is likely higher, as the US is running the genetic sequence on a fraction of cases.The variant has become the dominant strain in the UK, accounting for an estimated 60 per cent of new cases. It’s now more prevalent than the Alpha strain, formerly called the B.1.1.7 strain, which was first identified in the UK, and transmission is peaking in people between the ages of 12 and 20, Dr. Fauci said at a press briefing on Tuesday."In the UK, the Delta variant is rapidly emerging as the dominant variant ... It is replacing the B.1.1.7," Fauci said. "We cannot let that happen in the United States," he told CNBC. President Biden has set a goal of administering at least one vaccine shot to 70 per cent of Americans by July 4. Last week, health officials in Britain warned that the Delta variant of Covid-19, has now become the dominant variant of concern in the UK and may also come with an increased risk of hospitalisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-urges-young-people-to-take-covid-19-shots-citing-rapid-spread-of-delta-variant-in-uk-101623262971981.html

10-06-2021||World||1 in 2 Indians faced bias in Trump’s final year: US study||One in two Indian Americans experienced some form of discrimination in the United States over the course of a 12-month period, says a new survey-based study. And it’s mostly over the colour of their skin, followed by gender, religion, country of origin and caste, in that order.The Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS), done jointly by Johns Hopkins University, University of Pennsylvania and Carnegie, with polling group YouGov, also found that US-born Indian Americans are more likely to complain of discrimination than those born outside, mostly in India.The study is based on a poll of 1,200 Indian Americans — including citizens, Green Card holders and Non-Resident Indians — in September of 2020, in the run up to the November election. Respondents were asked, among a wide range of questions, if they had felt discrimination against in the past 12 months, roughly the last year of President Donald Trump’s term.Trump’s four years were marked by a significant spike in hate crimes and discriminatory behaviour in the US, including the mainstreaming of white supremacists. The worst of it was against Asian Americans, over the Covid-19 outbreak, which Trump and his supporters had taken to calling the “China Virus”, “Wuhan Virus” or “Kung Flu”.But there is no data to show if Indian American felt the same level of discrimination or less pre-Trump. The report said, according to their data, “one in two Indian Americans reports being subject to some form of discrimination in the past year”. It added that the data suggested that “discrimination based on skin colour is the most common form of bias: 30% of respondents report feeling discriminated against due to the colour of their skin”. The findings showed that 18% were discriminated against due to their gender or religion and 16% for their country of origin. About 5% were discriminated over caste, which, the authors of the report said, based on the responses, was perpetrated by both Indian Americans and non-Indians, such as South Asians who are familiar with caste and related issues. The state of California sued Cisco Systems, a San Jose-based IT giant in July 2020 for alleged caste-based discrimination at workplace on a complaint from an employee who was described as “Dalit”. The lawsuit cited a 2018 survey that found that 67% of Dalit employees reported being treated unfairly at American workplaces.Indian Americans were also hit by a wave of hate crimes and ethnic slurs in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 -- a Sikh man in Arizona was the first person killed in the backlash. A white supremacist gunned down six people at a Wisconsin gurdwara in 2012; and Srinivas Kuchibhotla, an IT engineer from Hyderabad, was killed in Kansas by a man who yelled at him and a friend to “get out of my country” in 2017.“The incident of my friend’s daughter who was born in America being told by another person who was standing in line at a coffee shop to ‘go home’ still stands out for me,” said MR Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, an advocacy group for the Indian American community. The study, he added, “is a clarion call for the Indian diaspora to build institutions that can stand up for the community and work aggressively on these issues”.A significantly larger number of foreign-born Indian Americans , 59% , did not feel they had been discriminated against in the past one year, compared to 36% of their US-born counterparts, the survey showed. “Differences in social norms, greater awareness of discriminatory practices, or less fear of retaliation”, were some of the factors cited by the study for the higher reporting of discrimination by US-born Indian Americans. In other findings, Indian Americans — both born in the US and outside — tend to marry within the community, with US-born Indian Americans marrying non-Indians at a significantly higher number than foreign-born Indian Americans. They tend to hang out with other Indian Americans as their “social network [is] populated with relatively more people of Indian origin. And only 43% believe the phrase “Indian American” describes them adequately. About 30% preferred to be called “Indian” and 6% don’t like the “hyphenated American” part like Bobby Jindal, the Republican who briefly ran for the White House in 2016, and wanted to be called “American”.The survey makes a broader point that the Indian American community has come of age and as it has come to be portrayed “as a poster child” of America opening up to immigrants, it has also faced greater scrutiny. “This paper argues that while there is much that binds the community, there are also nascent signs that these common bonds are being tested as religious cleavages, generational divides, and political polarisation invite fragmentation,” the study said in conclusion. “In that sense, the currents coursing their way through the Indian diaspora are perhaps reflective not only of broader developments in American society but also—and perhaps even to a greater extent—the turbulence afflicting India.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamericans-regularly-encounter-discrimination-survey-101623214070757.html

Prima facie, these reports appear to be fake,” the government said in a release.Dr RS Sharma who heads the CoWIN portal and is also the chairman of the empowered group on vaccine administration also clarified that the reports of hacking of the CoWIN portal are false. “Our attention has been drawn towards the news circulating on social media about the alleged hacking of the CoWIN system. In this connection we wish to state that CoWIN stores all the vaccination data in a safe and secure digital environment,” Sharma said.“No CoWIN data is shared with any entity outside the CoWIN environment. The data being claimed as having been leaked, such as geo-location of beneficiaries, is not even collected at CoWIN,” he further added.Reports of CoWIN being hacked surfaced after a website called Data Leak Market said it was selling a database for Covid-19 vaccination in India. The website also said that the data of 150 million people also included their name, Aadhaar number, and location. They also clarified that they did not originally leak the data and were merely reselling the data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/data-of-millions-on-cowin-portal-safe-assures-govt-denies-reports-of-hacking-101623346611022.html
10-06-2021||India||India in touch with ‘various stakeholders’ in Afghanistan: MEA||India on Thursday said it is in touch with “various stakeholders” in Afghanistan in order to work for the long-term goal of development and reconstruction of the war-torn country. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi was responding to questions at a weekly news briefing on Hindustan Times’ report on India opening channels of communication with Taliban factions and leaders for the first time, and whether there had been a shift in India’s policy on Afghanistan. Bagchi declined to comment on the HT report but said: “We are in touch with various stakeholders...in pursuance of our long-term commitment towards development and reconstruction of Afghanistan.” Describing India’s relations with Afghanistan as historical and multifaceted, he added: “We have been engaging with Afghans across ethnicities. As a friendly neighbour, we are concerned about peace and security in Afghanistan and the region. We support all peace initiatives and have been engaged with several stakeholders, including regional countries.” Bagchi noted that external affairs minister S Jaishankar had virtually participated in the inaugural ceremony for the intra-Afghan talks in Doha last September, while a senior official delegation had attended the same talks. The intra-Afghan talks marked the first time that Indian officials were present in the same venue as a Taliban delegation. Bagchi further said there were “visits by multiple Afghan leaders to India” in the recent past, and the Indian side had made official visits to Kabul. HT reported on Tuesday that India had for the first time opened channels of communication with Afghan Taliban factions and leaders, including Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, against the backdrop of the rapid drawdown of US forces from Afghanistan. The move marks a significant shift from India’s long-standing position of not engaging with the Afghan Taliban and comes at a time when key world powers are veering round to the position that the Taliban will play some part in any future dispensation in Kabul. The external affairs pointperson for Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, joint secretary JP Singh, visited Kabul last month for meetings with the Afghan leadership. National Security Adviser Ajit Doval made a two-day visit to Kabul in January, becoming the first senior Indian official to travel to Afghanistan since the peace process began last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-in-touch-with-various-stakeholders-in-afghanistan-mea-101623346519766.html

We strongly welcome the government's announcement on that point,” spokesperson Rice said.The IMF welcomes the Indian government’s announcement to facilitate access to vaccinations and to provide additional support to minimize the social cost of the pandemic. #India pic.twitter.com/yG4nZr5EnTRice was answering questions regarding the participation of Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF and various other topics, when he made the comments regarding the Indian government’s latest announcement. He also said that the second wave of Covid-19 and the lockdown measures induced by it suggested a fall in India’s economic activity.Confirming that the IMF would revise India’s growth forecast in its next update to the World Economic Outlook, expected next month, Rice said “More to come next month when we will be publishing updated forecasts for India in the context of the World Economic Outlook.”Also read | IMF, World Bank ask G7 to release surplus Covid-19 vaccines“India, of course, is an economy that's important to the global economy, due to its large share in global and regional GDP. And therefore, India's growth and economic outlook has broader implications with spill overs working primarily through trade, linkages and global supply chains which are particularly strong, of course, with South Asia and that region,” he further addedEarlier on Monday (June 7), Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Union government is taking over the vaccination process from the states. Modi also said that all beneficiaries above 18 years of age would be immunised free of cost beginning June 21.According to his announcement, the central government would now procure 75% of all vaccines being made and distribute it to the states for free of cost. Meanwhile, private hospitals in the country would continue to procure the remaining 25% of the stock. The government has capped the price of each vaccine dose being used in the country and also the service charge by the private hospitals. Modi also said that the production of essential medicines to fight the pandemic will also be ramped up.Daily new cases in India have remained below the 100,000-mark for the third consecutive day on Thursday as 94.052 people were tested positive for the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imf-welcomes-india-s-efforts-in-making-covid-19-vaccinations-accessible-says-country-s-growth-forecast-to-be-revised-101623345361149.html

It also said that vaccinating the young population, given the current scenario, will not be cost-effective. The experts also recommended that local level sero-surveys in real time at the end of the second wave should be conducted repeatedly to map the vulnerability at the district level.The Indian Public Health Association (IPHA), Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine (IAPSM) and Indian Association of Epidemiologists (IAE) also submitted the findings to Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighting the need of vaccinating the people who are vulnerable.India has administered 240 million Covid vaccine doses till now“Mass, indiscriminate, and incomplete vaccination can also trigger emergence of mutant strains. Given the rapid transmission of infection in various parts of the country, it is unlikely that mass vaccination of all adults will catch up with the pace of natural infection among our young population,” the study said.Committed to prevent misuse of data regarding Covid-19 vaccines, says Centre“The present situation of the pandemic in the country demands that we should be guided by the logistics and epidemiological data to prioritise vaccination rather than opening vaccination for all age groups at this stage,” the study further added.Allow walk-in Covid jabs, online registration not enough: Rahul Gandhi to Centre“Vaccine is a strong and powerful weapon against the novel coronavirus. And like all strong weapons it should neither be withheld nor used indiscriminately; but should be employed strategically to derive maximum benefit in a cost-effective way,” the report further added.The recommendation also include addition of 17 more laboratories to the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) and achieving the target of genomic sequencing of at 3% of the positive samples.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiscriminate-vaccination-can-lead-to-rise-of-mutant-strains-experts-tell-pm-101623344820669.html

Dr Basanta Kumar Goswami, who is posted at the Majuligarh tea estate in Biswanath district, was allegedly manhandled by a few young men on Wednesday evening while he was returning from his walk. “The workers in the tea estate were upset with the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions that resulted in closure of shops at 12 pm. Some of them went and had a meeting with the management of the estate on Wednesday over this,” said Biswanath superintendent of police Ripul Das. “On the way back from the meeting some young men saw the doctor and thinking that he might have had a role in the early closure of the shops and other restrictions allegedly pushed him to the ground. We have conducted a medical examination and he is stable. A case has been registered and we will take action,” he added. According to the doctor, the tea estate administration had enforced Covid-19 restrictions in the area strictly as 31 positive cases had been detected there. In Assam, all shops and business establishments have to close down at 12 pm daily and there is curfew between 1 pm and 5 am. “I was taking my evening walk near my residence after my duty at the hospital when three youths came towards me and started pushing and jostling me accusing me of closing shops. In the rush, I fell on the ground and hurt the wrist of my right hand and my back,” Dr Goswami told journalists on Thursday. On June 1, several people had brutally assaulted a doctor posted at a Covid Care Centre in Hojai district after a patient had died during treatment. Police had arrested 26 people in connection with the case. Earlier this week, another doctor was beaten up by a patient’s son in Darrang district allegedly due to delay in attending the patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-assam-81-year-old-tea-garden-doctor-allegedly-manhandled-police-lodge-fir-101623345019404.html
10-06-2021||India||India tells China to issue visas to nationals who meet travel requirements||India called on China on Thursday to issue visas to Indian nationals who meet all requirements laid down by Beijing for travel, including getting vaccinated with Chinese-made jabs, so that they could return to their studies or jobs. The government is also taking steps to protect the interests of Indian nationals who work or study abroad but have been stuck in the country because of Covid-19-related travel restrictions, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a weekly news briefing. The problems faced by these nationals are being taken up with the concerned governments, he said. In the case of China, Bagchi pointed out that Indian nationals have been unable to travel back to resume their work or studies since November last year, even though Chinese citizens are able to travel to India despite the absence of direct connectivity. “However, for Indian nationals, travel to China has not been possible since last November as the Chinese side had suspended existing visas. In March this year, the Chinese embassy issued a notification about facilitating visas for those taking Chinese-made vaccines,” Bagchi said. “It is understood that several Indian nationals have applied for Chinese visas after getting vaccinated in that manner but are yet to be issued visas. Since these Indian nationals have apparently met the requirements laid down by the Chinese side, we hope the Chinese embassy would be able to issue them visas soon,” he said. Indian authorities have been in touch with Chinese counterparts to seek “early resumption of travel” by Indian citizens to China, especially for those who work or study there, he added. “While we recognise the need to ensure safety and strictly follow Covid-related protocols, essential two-way travel should be facilitated, especially keeping in view the fact that Chinese nationals are able to travel to India,” Bagchi said. According to official data, China is home to more than 55,000 Indian nationals, including more than 20,000 students. Many students and professionals returned to India following the Covid-19 outbreak and have been unable to go back to China. In the case of other countries too, the government is aware of challenges faced by Indian students who are unable to return to pursue their studies. The external affairs ministry, in line with the government’s priorities, has been “working actively to protect the interests of Indians residing abroad, be it for education, employment or other reasons”, he added. “We have been taking this issue up with the concerned governments on priority. We have also requested students facing difficulties to contact the external affairs ministry,” he said, referring to a recent initiative launched to gather details of such students from across the country. Responding to a separate question about problems faced by Indians studying or working abroad who have been vaccinated with the Covaxin jab that is yet to be approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), Bagchi said: “We are aware that Bharat Biotech has sought WHO emergency use listing for Covaxin. We hope this process of getting this approval is completed at an early date.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tells-china-to-issue-visas-to-nationals-who-meet-travel-requirements-101623344059118.html

He also highlighted that the Centre never denied further discussions regarding the three contentious laws with the protesting farmer groups and unions.“[Narendra Singh] Tomar Ji has clearly said the doors for talks are open. The government never closed its doors. There have already been 11-12 rounds of talks earlier,” news agency PTI quoted Anil Vij as saying on Thursday. “But farmers' union leaders have not even once been able to point out what their objections to the farm laws are,” he further said, while speaking to reporters."They have not been able to point out the objections. From this, it appears that their agenda is not (repeal of) farm laws, but (they have) some secret agenda," Vij said.Also read | Maharashtra makes its own draft law to protect farmersAnil Vij’s comments came a day after Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that the Union government is ready to resume talks with the protesting unions and hear their objections. “Whenever farmers want discussions, the government of India will be ready for discussion. But we have repeatedly asked them to tell the objections in the provisions with logic. We will listen and find a solution,” PTI quoted Tomar as saying at a cabinet briefing.However, farmer leaders have maintained their stance regarding the issue and have categorically said that they are ready for further talks only if the government yields to their demands. “Our stand remains the same. Repeal the three laws, give us a written guarantee on MSP, if the government is ready to talk on this, then we are ready. Now, it is up to the government to decide about the meeting,” PTI quoted farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka as saying.“While the prime minister superciliously says that the government is just one call away, the real anti-farmer attitude of the government is very apparent. Protesting farmers repeat and reiterate that the government's attitude is unjustifiable and unreasonable, and is resting on ego and optics' games. Farmers demand a full repeal of the three central laws and a new legislation to guarantee MSP for all farmers,” the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, another protesting farmer body, said regarding the meetings.Many farmers have been protesting against the government’s three new farm laws for over six months at Delhi’s borders. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court of India has set up a committee to find solutions regarding the issue and has also put a hold on the implementation of the laws until further orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-home-minister-anil-vij-claims-secret-agenda-behind-farmers-protest-amid-tussle-over-further-talks-101623342334106.html

10-06-2021||India||Jailed activists Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal work to help prison community||To mark one year of incarceration of jailed student activists Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, who are charged with conspiring to orchestrate the 2020 Delhi riots, students’ collective Pinjra Tod on Wednesday released a pamphlet detailing the activities undertaken by the duo in Tihar jail, that include running a computer centre, legal aid centre, and engaging with the women and children in prison. Both Kalita and Narwal are a part of the women’s collective Pinjra Tod since its inception in 2015. “As Natasha and Devangana complete a year in prison, we share with you all a booklet with some of their artwork, excerpts from their prison letters written to us and some of the work they have done within the prison,” the collective said in a statement on Wednesday. The two women are not the only prisoners working behind bars. Convicted prisoners are allotted work within the jail complex -- in places such as jail factory, kitchen and gardens. Under trial prisoners are given a choice if they wish to work and help the prison department in running the complex. They are also paid daily wages. For example --- former Congress leader Sushil Sharma, convicted for his wife, Naina Sahni’s murder, helped prisoners at the legal aid centre. Former Delhi police inspector Anil Kumar convicted in the Connaught Place fake encounter case, worked in the offices within the jail complex and was part of preparing reform activities for prisoners. Almost all prisoners, barring a few, choose to work as it helps them pass their time behind bars and also use their skills in helping the prison department. In the pamphlet released by the collective, both Narwal and Kalita – in separate letters – speak about their experiences in the jail and their work with the prison community involving working at a legal aid centre, computer centre, library, running yoga sessions before the pandemic hit, and working with the children in the prison. Children below 6 years are allowed to stay with their mothers inside the prison. Until last month, there were around 25 children along with their mothers inside the prison. The children and their mothers were released last week to ensure that they did not catch the Covid-19 infection. The two women had also been holding reading sessions of feminist novels before the pandemic and making artwork around it that was shared by the group on Wednesday. Sandeep Goel, Director General Prisons, said, “If the conduct of the inmates is disciplined, we do involve them in several activities as per their area of knowledge. While all activities are suspended now due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some prisoners have been involved in the legal aid cell assisting visiting lawyers or helping with the crèche facilities or even training people to use computer facilities at our computer centre. Inmates are also involved in different cultural activities including Women’s Day.” While the lawyers of the two women have accused Delhi police of arresting them on false charges because they were prominent members of the protests against the Citizenship Law, police have maintained that the two women were active members in the conspiracy to start the riots in parts of northeast Delhi last year. At least 53 people died and 607 were injured when clashes broke out between Hindus and Muslims in February last year. Last month, Narwal’s father passed away after contracting Covid-19 following which the PhD student was given a three-week interim bail. She returned to prison on May 30. The booklet was released a day after Pinjra Tod held a virtual event inviting friends, family, and activists to speak and mark one year of their incarceration. Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh said, “We may come from different organisations, but we have seen all these JNU students around, growing up with us and amidst us. Today, they are behind bars and they are organising activities inside prison, helping people.” Prison expert, Sunil Gupta, who was a law officer in Tihar for over three decades, said that except dangerous prisoners, most inmates are involved in various activities inside jails. “Whosoever wants to work with the children of incarcerated women are allowed to do so irrespective of the offence they are facing. Several vocational skills or recreational activities involving music and sports are also held so that prisoners don’t have any negative thoughts and are kept engaged,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jailed-activists-devangana-kalita-natasha-narwal-work-to-help-prison-community-101623333857639.html

People who are committed to party ideology should be given responsibilities,” Moily was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Both Moily and Sibal highlighted that every political party needs to be receptive towards feedback. “I am sure the leadership knows about the problems and I hope they listen because listening is needed for survival. No corporate structure can survive without listening and so is with politics. If you don't listen, you will fall into bad times,” Sibal said.Moily said that the party needs to undergo ‘major surgery’. “Congress needs to undergo major surgery. People with competence should be given charge of various states,” Moily further added. Moily, Sibal and Jitin Prasada were among the 23 leaders who also batted for an overhaul of the way Congress was being run as a party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-he-get-prasada-always-a-suspect-prasada-gets-flak-after-joining-bjp-101623332859271.html
10-06-2021||India||Kashmir village learnt its lesson in 2020, emerges unscathed in Covid 2nd wave||Hirpora village in south Kashmir’s Shopian district, which was a Covid-19 hotspot when the first wave of coronavirus infections struck Jammu and Kashmir, has emerged unscathed in the second and more devastating wave of the pandemic, a health official said on Thursday.“Last year it was a hotspot but this year, we only had a few occasional cases as people took precautions and followed all the SOPs (standard operating procedures) to prevent Covid-19 from the very beginning. They wore masks, maintained social distance and used good hand hygiene,” said chief medical officer, Shopian, Dr Arshid Hussain Tak.On its part, the administration also carried out intensive vaccination campaigns for the 45+ age group in the hilly village on the Mughal Road that connects Poonch and Rajouri districts of Jammu division with Shopian in south Kashmir.Hirpora village, some 65-odd km from summer capital Srinagar, is home to about 3,000 people, most of them fruit farmers and small-time shopkeepers.Tak said the 600 people above the age of 45 got their first vaccine dose within two weeks of the start of vaccination in April, we inoculated all the 600 people above 45 years of age in the village,” he said.As compared to the 110 positive cases reported from the village last year when it was classified as a Red Zone, Tak said this year, the village had reported only 12 cases. Most of the people who tested positive this year were travellers who were tested by the authorities as part of what it describes as its aggressive testing campaign.“Currently we have no positive cases in the village despite our aggressive testing campaign. It is on Mughal Road and all the passengers passing through the area into Kashmir are tested. Passengers may test positive but not the villagers,” he said.“We are the first in the union territory to have 100 percent completion of vaccination of people above the 45 years age group. Our positivity rate in the second wave is now less than 3% while mortality rate is 0.1 percent,” he said.Shopian was the first Kashmir district to vaccinate 100 percent of its population who are 45 years and above with the first dose. It is the least affected district out of the 10 districts of Kashmir valley in terms of Covid-19 cases and fatalities.Overall, the district has recorded 5,466 coronavirus cases and 57 deaths till June 09. It has the second lowest active cases of 569 after Bandipora district.Kashmir has reported 1,87,000 cases and 2,118 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-village-learnt-its-lesson-in-first-wave-emerges-unscathed-in-covid-2nd-wave-101623332897415.html
10-06-2021||India||Consistent HC pressure led to correction of Covid death figures in Bihar||The Bihar government on Wednesday corrected the figures of fatalities due to Covid-19 and put the toll at 9,375 from the first and second waves after verification. The toll was just 5,424 a day earlier.The revision came after repeated reminders from the Patna high court which pulled up the state government over its failure in properly maintaining the record of deaths.Advocate General Lalit Kishore said he would present the details of the updated toll before the court when the case related to Covid management will be taken up for hearing this week. The court is looking at issues such as death registration as well as preparedness for a possible third wave.Dr Sunil Kumar, Indian Medical Association state secretary, said that the actual figure could go further up as the state was still considering only the positive reports of the rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests as the yardstick. He added there were many who just did not go for any tests and were in home isolation or others who tested negative in rapid and RT-PCR tests but were positive as per chest scan.“The data collected in the rural areas is also very weak and so is the level of awareness. We apprehend that the death figures could go higher... A large number of people remained in home isolation and those deaths are not reported in the absence of test reports.”Also Read | Child labour rises 1st time in 20 years, Nobel laureate demands actionA high court bench of chief justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar on May 18 pointed out the inconsistency in figures of deaths in Buxar, where 81 corpses were found floating in the Ganga and sought details of both Covid and non-Covid deaths in the state.“We are aghast at the manner in which the affidavits are being filed. We notice that the official website maintained... for recording the births and the deaths has not yet been updated. We see no reason as to why the deaths, whatever be the number and wherever they may have taken place, would not have been updated on the official website. Deaths may have also taken place in home isolation, at care centres, private hospitals, etc. Equally, this would apply to all the districts of Bihar,” the bench said.On May 21, the bench was told how delays in the issuance of death registration certificates were causing problems to the kin of victims in availing insurance claims and other compensation.The court said that Buxar was a test case. “If officials of the panchayati raj institutions and others do not comply with the court’s order within a week and fail to update death registration, we will stop their salary and even seize their powers.”On May 25, the bench reiterated it was important that every death was recorded and documented from every village, block, district or town. It added it could go a long way in helping the state prepare for the third wave with an overall view of the ground situation.This prompted the state government to order district magistrates to comply with the orders within 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consistent-hc-pressure-led-to-correction-of-covid-death-figures-in-bihar-101623330556666.html

10-06-2021||India||Uttarakhand defies SC order on road through tiger corridor, contempt plea filed||A contempt petition has been filed in the Supreme Court against the Uttarakhand government for resuming construction of a road project in Rajaji National Park that was stalled by the top court in 2019 for want of statutory forest and wildlife clearances.As the 11.5 kilometre-road cuts through an ecologically sensitive wildlife corridor serving as a crucial link for tigers and elephants to cross between Rajaji National Park and Corbett National Park, the Supreme Court had on July 29, 2019 held, “No road activity shall be undertaking without obtaining statutory approvals under Section 38 of the Wildlife Protection Act.” Section 38 requires approval of NBWL for any project undertaken in a wildlife sanctuary or national park. An expert committee assisting the Supreme Court had opined that the project lacks clearance under the Forest Conservation Act as well.Also Read | Assam gets 2 new national parks; total goes up to sevenThe contempt petition filed by Supreme Court lawyer Gaurav Kumar Bansal stated that the order passed in July 2019 is still relevant as the state is yet to obtain forest clearance. Even the Standing Committee of the National Board of Wildlife (NBWL) has laid down certain Mitigation Measures to which the State Forest Department is not agreeable.The petition said, “Construction of the Laldhang Chillarkhal road by state of Uttarakhand, in absence of the decision by Standing Committee of the NBWL is not only illegal but also amounts to Contempt of order dated July 29, 2019 issued by this Court…Hence the present contempt petition.”Bansal referred to certain news reports to show how the state has resumed work on the road project by giving orders under the Uttarakhand Disaster Management Act. In March 2019 the state government began construction on this stretch to provide a shorter route connecting Haridwar with Kotdwar.The road cuts through the buffer zone of Rajaji National Park, home to tigers, elephants, cheetahs and bears. The petition annexed recent photographs to show tiger pug marks and elephant tracks on the stretch where construction is going on.As per a joint inspection report of the site in question by the Wildlife Institute of India and National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) , the project cuts through “crucial tiger movement corridor” between Rajaji and Corbett, and the best mitigation measure proposed is avoidance of the project, followed by the next best method to elevate the entire stretch of road alignment.According to the two expert bodies, “Mortality of wild animals would certainly increase in the area once the road is black topped as it would allow larger number of vehicles to ply over with higher speed thereby creating a barrier to animal movement.” Once the road is ready, traffic of Kumaon area and other cities in central eastern and eastern parts of the state would be diverted to this road due to shorter distance and to avoid taxes levied in Uttar Pradesh, the report stated.Both the NTCA and NBWL have conveyed to the state forest department that forest clearance for the project is inevitable.They have also proposed keeping the underpass at an 8 metre height to allow smooth passage for elephants in the central road stretch of 4.7 kilometres between Chamaria and Siggadi Sot. Additional proposed mitigation measures include speed breakers at regular intervals of 250 to 300 metres in the forested stretches of the road and no traffic movement between sunset and sunrise. The petition stated that Uttarakhand’s chief wildlife warden is not agreeable to the mitigation measures and seeks exemption from forest clearances, he has also suggested that the underpass be made with of 5 metres instead of the proposed 8 metres.On May 28, 2021, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change wrote to the Uttarakhand government asking the state forest department to obtain forest clearance for the road project. Even NTCA wrote to the government on May 31 seeking a factual report on the road project. The NBWL is set to meet on June 11 to decide on the mitigation measures to be complied by Uttarakhand Forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-defies-sc-order-on-road-through-tiger-corridor-contempt-plea-filed-101623329657970.html

The announcement came two days after the state’s education minister Ranoj Pegu said that the board exams for both classes were likely to be held in the first half of August by following Covid-19 safety measures. “Most parents and student organizations in Assam are of the opinion that the board exams should be held. The education department will try and hold the exams in mid-July,” Sarma said in Guwahati. “The questions papers are likely to be multiple-choice ones, allowing students to score good marks. The exams will be held following Covid-19 protocol provided the positivity rate drops below 2%. If it is above that, we will ask schools to evaluate the students,” he added. Sarma said that the exams are likely to be conducted between July 15 and July 20 with boys and girls appearing on different dates in order to ensure social distancing at exam centres. “We can’t put the lives of students at risk. The exact dates of the exam will be announced in the next few days, but it will come with a rider on the positivity rate. We will make an assessment on July 1, if the positivity rate doesn’t drop below 2%, we won’t put lives of students at risk and cancel the exams,” he said.

He has sought a report before June 22 while questioning whether authorities followed procedures in the case as per the Act.The commission issued the notice before reports of the marriage. The revenue division officer has been asked to find out if she requires protection and legal, medical and psychiatric help.Also Read | Tamil Nadu reverses 100% occupancy order in movie theatres after Centre’s noticeTamil Nadu Association for Rights of All Types of Differently Abled and Caregivers (TARATDAC) general secretary S Namburajan said village heads arranged the woman’s marriage with the alleged 35-year-old rapist on June 6. “That is when I alerted the authorities in Chennai,” said Namburajan. “They are protecting the criminal... This will only lead to an increase in such crimes.”Namburajan said they helped the woman’s family file a police complaint on June 3 and claimed no case was registered until June 5. He added locals informed him the woman was married off on Wednesday. R Mahizhnan, the district differently abled welfare officer, led a preliminary inquiry last Friday. “We instructed them several times not to speak for a marriage,” he said. “We gave them our contacts and asked them to come to us for any help and service, but we hear they got her married Wednesday morning,” he said.Police said that they have registered a First Information Report under Indian Penal Code Sections including 417 (cheating), 503 (1) (criminal intimidation), 493 (deceiving a woman to cohabit), 506 (1) (criminal intimidation), and 312 (miscarriage).Sai Charan Tejaswi, the superintendent of police, said if the activists have concerns of omission, they are ready to take action as per complaints. “It is a recent case.

10-06-2021||India||Highway heists, bribe allegations, leadership battles: BJP’s Kerala challenges||Since its rout in the recently held assembly poll, in which the party lost its lone sitting legislative seat, the Kerala unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is mired in a series of controversies.Upset with the developments, the party central leadership has summoned state chief K Surendran to Delhi. Coming right after the Kerala Police registered a case against him on Monday for allegedly bribing an independent candidate to withdraw his papers after the intervention of a court in north Kerala, the call from Delhi has triggered speculation about what lies ahead for the party in the state.The defeat and its aftermath Following the poll debacle, in which the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) lost around three per cent of vote share compared to its 2016 performance, the central leadership sought a report from three important leaders — former state police chief Jacob Thomas, Metro Man E Sreedharan (both were party candidates) and former bureaucrat C V Ananda Bose — about the state of affairs in the party. They reportedly recommended sweeping changes in the light of poor performance, factional feuds and subsequent controversies in the state unit.Also Read | Kannur strongman K Sudhakaran is new Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee chiefThough the state unit has started a process of damage control, political observers suggest that there remain mounting differences within the party.State leaders have underplayed Surendran’s Delhi visit but speculation is rife here about an overhaul. “It was not summoning, but a planned visit. Besides our political opponents, a section of media is also baying for the party blood,” said party leader M T Ramesh, rejecting the speculation about a change in state party leadership. A party team has also called on Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Wednesday, alleging a ploy to defame the party.The party is in the midst of three raging controversies — a reported highway heist and hawala transactions, alleged pay off to an independent candidate, and a financial transaction with tribal leader C K Janu, a candidate in Wayanad, to remain with the NDA bloc.Highway heist A highway robbery took place on April 3, three days before the state went to the polls. It unfolded after a man named S Shamseer, who was transporting cash, was waylaid by a group of people on Kodakara on Thrisur-Ernakulam highway and looted his vehicle after assaulting him.Four days later (April 7), Shamseer filed a police complaint in which he said ₹25 lakh was stolen from his car, and claimed the money was meant for some property transactions. The police filed a case on April 7 following his compliant.When the police inquired why he delayed filing complaint, his statements were inconsistent and after further interrogation he took the name of one A K Dharmarajan, a local Rashtriya Swaymsevak Sangh leader.Dharmarajan said the money was meant for election activities and he collected it from many persons. But the police subsequently found that ₹3.5 crore was missing, and arrested 20 persons, all history-sheeters, allegedly involved in the heist.The alleged BJP link came to light when police started investigation into the source of money. Dharmarajan reportedly told the police that the money was meant to be handed over to BJP Alapuzha treasurer, K G Kartha, and party state organising secretary, M Ganeshan, was aware of the transportation. Both leaders were questioned by the police.The special investigation team (SIT) probing the case now suspects that the money came from Karnataka through hawala channels and it was allegedly meant for distribution in elections. After money was lost, both (Shamseer and Dharmarajan) made several calls to state unit chief Surendran and his son, call records of both showed. The Enforcement Directorate has sought details of the case from the SIT. Both the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Congress have alleged the ED was going slow since the BJP was involved.Meanwhile, a local court in Thrissur on Wednesday dismissed a plea of Dharmarajan seeking the possession of seized money. Police have so far seized ₹1.75 crore and gold from the accused. While dismissing his plea, the court said the investigation in the case was on and it sought more details from the SIT.Pay-off to independent candidate Even as the party was struggling with highway heist, the alleged pay off to an independent candidate surfaced.Independent candidate K Sundara, who had contested against K Surendran in Mancheswaram (north Kerala), alleged last week that he was under pressure to withdraw his candidature in favour of the BJP leader. He said though he demanded ₹15 lakh, he was paid ₹2.5 lakh and received a smart phone. He also said he was offered a wine parlour and a house in Karnataka once Surendran emerged victorious. After Surendran’s defeat, party leaders were not willing to meet promises made to him, he alleged.After the news surfaced, the CPI(M) candidate V V Ramesan moved the Kasaragod magistrate court, which directed the police to register a case against Surendran. He was later booked under Section 17I (B )of the Indian Penal Code and other sections. But the party said it will challenge the decision in a higher court.“Both the ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress have joined hands to discredit the BJP. Some of the recent allegations are part of this campaign,” said party leader A N Radhakrishnan. Sundara, who now claimed he is associated with the Bahujan Samaj Party, said he was ready to depose against the BJP leader.Interestingly, in the 2016 assembly elections too, Sundara had contested but he got 467 votes while Surendran lost the seat by a slender margin of 89 votes. Sundara said this time the BJP was more alert and many leaders from Karnataka pressurised him to withdraw from the election. After withdrawing his nomination, he campaigned for Surendran, but did not join the party.But the state president lost the April poll by a bigger margin of 745 votes to Muslim League’s AKM Ashraf. “It is only tip of the iceberg. The ongoing investigation will give a clear picture later. The party spent crores of rupees in recent elections,” said CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan.The Congress has sought a court-monitored probe into highway heist and hawala transactions. “Only a court-monitored probe will unravel truth otherwise the state government will weaken in the case in lieu of some of the cases being probed by central agencies,” said party leader K Muraleedharan.Largesse to tribal leader In the middle of these two controversies, another issue surfaced last week after the leader of Janatipathya Rashtriya Party (JRP), an ally of the BJP, alleged that Surendran had given ₹10 lakh to JRP president C K Janu to returning to the NDA fold before the polls. Earlier Janu, a tribal leader from Wayanad, had severed her links with the BJP and NDA but later she became a candidate in Wayanad.JRP leader Praseetha Azeekode said though Janu sought a bigger amount, Surendran gave her only ₹10 lakh. After her disclosure, an audio tape also surfaced in which Surendran was purportedly heard talking to Janu. (HT could not verify authenticity of the tape). But Janu later denied this and said it was part of the electioneering expenses and no payment was involved in her return.“The recent allegations have invited more ignominy to the party than the poll defeat. Infighting in the party played a key role in fuelling troubles,” said political observer A Jayashankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highway-heists-bribe-allegations-leadership-battles-bjp-s-kerala-challenges-101623326116374.html
10-06-2021||India||Monsoon covers nearly half the country in a week, six days ahead of schedule||Monsoon has advanced into parts of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and remaining areas of Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh six days ahead of schedule, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday. Monsoon is expected to reach Delhi earlier than expected, IMD added.“In the next 48 hours, monsoon will reach parts of east Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In the subsequent two days, the monsoon may cover west Uttar Pradesh and parts of Uttarakhand also. So, the expectation is that it will reach Delhi earlier than expected,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, who heads the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre.Monsoon normally arrives in Delhi by June-end.Srivastava said certain conditions will have to be met before they declare the onset of monsoon in Delhi. “It should have rained in a large area for a couple of days, the easterly wind pattern should be established, and it should have covered Bihar, parts of Uttar Pradesh, etc,” he said.Also Read | Monsoon likely to cover all of east, large parts of central India in 2-3 daysRK Jenamani, senior scientist, National Weather Forecasting Centre, echoed Srivastava and said that before the early arrival of the monsoon in northwest India, there will be widespread and heavy rains in east and central India. “There is a warning of lightning for central India, Bihar, Odisha, etc. People should be careful.”The arrival of monsoon, which is crucial to the country’s farm-dependent economy, is announced based on factors such as wind speed, consistency of rainfall, intensity, and cloud cover. The monsoon arrived in Kerala on June 3 two days behind schedule. It arrives there first before covering the rest of India by July.The early expected arrival of the monsoon in northwest India including Delhi is expected to bring relief from the muggy weather.IMD said the country has recorded 21% excess rainfall between June 1 and 9. Out of 36 subdivisions, 11 have recorded large excess rains (60% above normal), seven excess (20 to 59%), 10 normal (-19 to 19%).In its second long-range forecast, IMD said monsoon rainfall was likely to be normal at 101% of the long-period average (LPA) after two years of above-average rainfall. LPA is the average rainfall (88cm) recorded in India every year between June and September from 1961 to 2010.Good rainfall has been a prime reason for the farm sector’s resilience for two years, and its ability last year to buck the Covid-19 pandemic.In 2020 and 2019, the monsoon was above normal at 110% and 109% of LPA. In 1996, 1997, and 1998, the monsoon was normal at 103.4%, 102.2%, and 104%, according to IMD. India recorded 18% excess rain during the pre-monsoon period from March 1 to May 31.IMD said the monsoon also advanced to the remaining parts of the Central Bay of Bengal and most parts of the North Bay of Bengal on Thursday. The northern limit of the monsoon passes through Surat, Nandurbar, Betul, Mandla, Bilaspur, Bolangir, Puri, and Bagdogra.IMD said conditions were favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon into more parts of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, remaining parts Chhattisgarh and Odisha, entire West Bengal and Jharkhand, and parts of Bihar and east Uttar Pradesh and remaining parts of north Bay of Bengal during the next 48 hours.Ministry of earth sciences secretary M Rajeevan said the monsoon is very active now and their models indicate that it will be active for another week. “Some of our models are indicating a slight weakening of the monsoon towards the end of the month. Monsoon is normally active during onset, plus a low-pressure area developing over the Bay of Bengal is also helping it progress.”IMD said a cyclonic circulation was lying over the northwest Bay of Bengal. Under its influence, a low-pressure area is likely to form over the northwest Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood during the next 24 hours. It is likely to become more marked during subsequent 24 hours and move west-north-westwards across Odisha. Under its influence, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall activity with isolated to scattered heavy to very heavy rainfall was very likely in most parts of east India and adjoining central India from Thursday.Extremely heavy rain (≥ 20 cm) was also likely in Odisha on June 11 and 12, Chhattisgarh during June 11 and 13, east Madhya Pradesh on June 13, Vidarbha on June 12 and 13.Due to the strengthening of westerly winds along the west coast in association with the low-pressure area, widespread rainfall activity with heavy to very heavy rain was likely to continue in coastal districts of Maharashtra from June 10 to 11 and in coastal Karnataka from June 12 to 15. Extremely heavy rain is also likely in the Konkan region.Due to the west-north-westwards movement of the low-pressure area, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall activity is likely in northwest India from June 12 to 14.Ahead of monsoon onset, fairly widespread thunderstorm activity accompanied by frequent cloud to ground lightning was likely in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Bengal, Jharkhand, and Bihar during the next two days, IMD has warned. Deaths due to lightning are reported in the monsoon season particularly in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.“In monsoon season hydrometeoric (water or ice particles) concentration is more so there is more charge build-up. If it is a very high cloud, then charge neutralisation happens within the cloud also called intra-cloud lightning. If cloud height is high but not extremely high, there is more charge separation and cloud to ground lightning. Cloud life during monsoon is longer and it moves slowly so there are a number of flashes in a small region. Kharif crops are planted in this season. Paddy field acts as an ionic fluid and many farmers get electrocuted at once,” Soma Sen Roy, a member of the ministry of earth sciences’ thunderstorm working group, said last year.India receives about 70% of its annual rain during the four-month monsoon that is crucial for rice, soybean, and cotton cultivation. As much as 60% of the sown area does not have access to irrigation in India, where over 150 million farmers and nearly half of the population are dependent on a farm-based income. The monsoon also replenishes 89 nationally important reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-covers-nearly-half-the-country-in-a-week-six-days-ahead-of-schedule-101623325876281.html

But the scheme went wrong as now PM Gaston Browne's "lies" are being exposed, Priti Choksi said. "This Bogey of going to Cuba from the Commonwealth of Dominica is nothing but the result of a botched up google search, where people have confused the Commonwealth of Dominica with the Dominican Republic as Cuba is in the direction of the Dominican Republic and both of them i.e the Commonwealth of Dominica and the Dominican Republic are in opposite directions," Priti said referring Barbara's claim that she never went to Dominica. Antigua PM had earlier claimed that Mehul Choksi might have gone to Dominica with his girlfriend.As contradictory accounts of what happened to Mehul Choksi and how he landed at Dominica are emerging, Dominica has declared him a prohibited immigrant.What Priti Choksi saysPreeti Choksi has trashed Barbara Jabarica's claims that Mehul befriended her with a false name. In this age of technology, anyone's identity can be confirmed on social media, the wife said. She also asked why the CCTV footage of the abduction from Jolly Harbour are not there. Had he been going to Dominica, why would he leave his passport, car keys behind, Priti asked.What Barbara Jabarica saysBarbara Jabarica has said she knew Mehul Choksi by the name of Raj since August. The businessman, wanted in India in a multi-crore scam, wanted her to join the diamond business. Barbara has also said that she was not his girlfriend. Barbara also said that once Mehul Choksi spoke to her about Cuba but it was not like an escape plan.What Mehul Choksi saysMehul Choksi said he was abducted on May 23 evening and named a few persons including Barbara, Gurjit Bhandal and Narendar Singh. Choksi said he was taken on a yacht on May 23 evening. On May 24, he was handed over to the Coast Guard of Dominica on a boat around 10 am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehul-choksi-s-disappearance-from-antigua-sponsored-by-state-alleges-wife-priti-choksi-101623325318247.html

Addressing an event to mark the release of a postage stamp on the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries, Shringla described Germany as one of India’s “most important friends in the European Union”. “Last year, Germany became the second European country to issue guidelines for the Indo-Pacific, which we welcome. We look forward to working with Germany on our convergent vision of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region,” he said. Also Read | US eases travel warning for Japan ahead of Olympics, France, Germany, othersThe post-pandemic global order will require concerted efforts by like-minded countries to ensure that multilateralism and a rules-based international order are respected by all, he said. “India and Germany must therefore continue to enhance the level and quality of their strategic engagement. We both have unique strengths that we can synergise to be a force for good in the world,” he added. Shringla also said the recommencement of negotiations on an India-EU trade and investment agreement augurs well for the future of economic ties with Germany. Regular institutional engagements at higher political levels have lent momentum to India-Germany ties, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chancellor Angela Merkel have met 12 times in the past seven years, Shringla noted. The two countries also consult closely at multilateral and international organisations, and engage on issues such as counter-terrorism, cyber-security and climate change, he said. The virtual event was also joined by German ambassador Walter Lindner and Vineet Pandey, secretary in the department of posts. India established diplomatic ties with the then Federal Republic of Germany on March 7, 1951, becoming one of the first countries to do so. In recent times, the two sides have extensively cooperated in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic in scientific research and supply of health-related products and equipment. In the early days of the pandemic, India supplied hydroxychoroquine and other pharmaceutical products to Germany. Amid the second wave of the pandemic in India, Germany extended much needed support by supplying oxygen-related equipment, essential drugs and raw materials. Shringla thanked the government and people of Germany for this “timely and helpful gesture”. Both India’s department of posts, and Germany’s postage stamp division issued commemorative stamps. The Indian stamp was designed by Gulistan and the German stamp by Matthias Wittig.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-work-with-germany-on-convergent-vision-for-indo-pacific-foreign-secy-101623324616119.html

10-06-2021||India||Adopt ‘decent family planning policy’: Assam CM to minority community||Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday urged the minority Muslim community in the state to adopt a “decent family planning” policy to bring down poverty and control social problems. “We want to work with the minority Muslim community to control population. The root cause of issues such as poverty, land encroachment etc., lies in uncontrolled population growth. I think we can put an end to a lot of social problems in Assam if the Muslim community adopts decent family planning norms,” the CM said in Guwahati. Addressing a press conference to mark completion of first month of his government at the state administrative staff college, Sarma appealed to organisations such as All Assam Minority Students Union (AAMSU) and Opposition party All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) to focus on population control initiatives in the Muslim community. “Assam government is going to take a few more steps which should encourage population control. I want to work with AAMSU and AIUDF on this,” he said “We want community support to spread education among Muslim women. You cannot reduce poverty unless you control your population. I hope the community will respect the government’s stand on this and work towards this,” he added. In 2017, the Assam assembly had passed a population and women empowerment policy which prevented people with more than two children from securing government jobs. It also prevented them from contesting panchayat and municipal elections. However, that policy is yet to be implemented. Since coming to power, the state government has started a campaign to remove encroachments from government land and also from religious sites. Anti-encroachment drives in different places have uprooted thousands of settlers from Sipajhar, Sootea, Hojai and Karimganj. “All this encroachment is happening due to an increase in population. If that trend continues, it will lead to paucity of living space and will result on conflict. Some are saying that such eviction drives shouldn’t happen. But we can’t allow people to illegally settle on forest land or land belonging to temples,” said Sarma. Terming Illegal smuggling of cattle as a big problem, the CM said a new law would be passed in the next assembly session on it. He pointed out that since the existing laws in the state don’t consider transit of cattle as illegal and cattle from other states are transported through Assam and smuggled to Bangladesh through the Indo-Bangla border in Meghalaya, the new legislation was needed. “In July, in the next assembly session, we will pass a law making transit of cattle through the state as illegal. With this new legislation, Assam will have to power to fight this menace. In the interim, we have stopped transit of cattle through an executive order. Since coming to power, we have been able to almost end this illegal trade,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adopt-decent-family-planning-policy-assam-cm-to-minority-community-101623322575798.html

Never thought I could meet my family again,” emotional Becks told the media. He was sentenced to death (execution by a firing squad) by UAE’s Supreme Court in 2013 after he rammed his car into a group of children in Abu Dhabi in September 2012, killing a six-year old Sudanese boy. He was charged with dangerous driving and murder after examining CCTV visuals and testimonies of witnesses.Krishnan, who used to work as a driver for a private company, pleaded that he dozed off on the wheels due to overwork, however, it was rejected and he was sentenced to death by the apex court in Abu Dhabi.His family approached UAE-based Indian businessman and philanthropist Yusuffali, who negotiated with the family of the victim for nearly six years, convincing them to pardon Krishnan. Finally in January 2021, the victim’s family, which had moved to Sudan by then, agreed to pardon Krishnan.After winning family’s pardon for Krishnan, Ali deposited 500,000 Dirhams (approximately Rs1 crore) in the court as ‘blood money’-- Blood Money or Diyah under Islamic law is a type of monetary compensation paid by an individual who kills someoneKrishnan was freed from Al Wathba jail in Abu Dhabi following the conclusion of the settlement.

Michael Polak, part of the legal team representing Choksi and an expert in providing legal assistance to foreign nationals around the world, told a virtual news conference that the team has also filed a complaint with the War Crimes Unit of UK’s Metropolitan Police on the ground that Choksi was tortured. Dominica dropped the London-based Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as the country’s final court of appeal in 2015. However, citizens of Antigua and Barbuda voted in a constitutional referendum in 2018 to retain the body as their final court of appeal. Also Read | Dominica declared Mehul Choksi prohibited immigrant, show documentsChoksi’s lawyers contend he continues to be an Antiguan citizen and can appeal against any move to strip him of his citizenship or to extradite him to India in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Polak said Choksi wouldn’t have access to this legal protection in Dominica. Polak described Choksi’s case as one of “egregious breach of the rule of law and fundamental fairness”. He said, “What has happened to Mehul Choksi has been terrible. He was lured into a property, kidnapped, a bag placed over his head, beaten, forced on to a boat and unlawfully renditioned into another country.” “In Antigua, he has the right to appeal to the Privy Council in London to determine whether the government is acting properly...against him. In Dominica, he does not have such protection. The motive behind the kidnapping could not be clearer,” he added. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Polak’s comments.Choksi went missing from Antigua while going for an evening walk on May 23. While the Antiguan premier has repeatedly said Choksi fled to Dominica with his girlfriend, the businessman’s wife Priti Choksi and his lawyers – Wayne Marsh and Vijay Aggarwal – have alleged he was abducted by Antiguan and Indian officials, tortured and taken to Dominica in a boat. He has been charged for illegal entry in Dominica and is being treated at a hospital there after a court adjourned his case till June 14. An official complaint filed by Choksi with police in Antigua stated that after he reached Dominica, he was told by his abductors that he was brought there to meet an “Indian politician”. Choksi has named Barbara Jarabica, Narender Singh, Gurmit Singh and “unknown persons” as his abductors. A complaint filed by Polak with the UK Metropolitan Police contends that Choksi’s case should be investigated by the War Crimes Unit as it involves torture. Polak said that under Section 134 of the UK Criminal Justice Act, English courts have jurisdiction over such matters wherever in the world they take place. “The War Crimes Unit of the Metropolitan Police investigates war crimes, torture and genocide wherever it takes place,” he said, adding the Metropolitan Police and Crown Prosecution Service will have the final say in an investigation. According to Polak’s complaint filed with the Metropolitan Police on June 7, Choksi was allegedly lured by Barbara Jarabica and then attacked and taken by force by several men to Dominica in a boat. The complaint has also pointed out that Jarabica and three men allegedly involved in the incident – St Kitts and Nevis national Gurdip Bath, Gurmit Singh and Gurjit Singh Bhandal – are all residents of the UK. Polak told the news conference that Choksi’s case goes beyond the “appalling treatment” meted out to him and represents a “fundamental test for the legal systems of Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica and a political test for Caricom and the Commonwealth on respect for rule of law and individual rights”. He contended there was sufficient proof that Jarabica and the other men involved in the incident had carried out a “reconnaissance or a failed attempt to kidnap” Choksi in April, and said that Choksi should be returned to Antigua. Choksi is an accused in a multi-crore scam in India, having allegedly siphoned off nearly ₹7,080 crore in the ₹13,578-crore Punjab National Bank fraud before fleeing to Antigua in January 2018. He then acquired Antiguan citizenship under the controversial Citizenship by Investment Programme. Asked about Choksi’s alleged role in the scam, Polak replied, “The current case is not about the scams, it’s about due process. We don’t act by kidnapping people, that’s not how things are done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksi-unlawfully-renditioned-to-dominica-so-he-couldn-t-appeal-to-uk-lawyer-101623322455805.html

"After consultation with stakeholders, the state government instructed the district administration to identify institutional deaths due to Covid," the health minister told news agency ANI. The intent of the exercise is to reach out to the family members of the deceased, the health minister said.The revision exercise has resulted in a 72.8 per cent increase in the state's Covid-19 toll. The fatalities have been attributed to private hospitals and homes.The health minister said the report was prepared in the last 15-20 days and was released on Tuesday. The government, however, has not given any time frame when these fatalities might have occurred."These deaths occurred 15 days ago and were only uploaded now in the government portal. Action will be taken against some of the private hospitals," an official said to news agency Reuters.Following the revision, Bihar's Covid-19 death toll almost doubled from 5,458 to 9,429.About 38 districts showed a change in the death toll after revision. Kaimur, Saharsa, Begusarai, East Champaran reported over a 200 per cent rise in the toll. While Munger was the only district with no increase, no district reported any decrease in the toll after the revision.The Patna high court has recently flagged incinsistenct in the death figures reported in Buxar.

Himanta was addressing a gathering to mark 30 days of his government in the state.“The government is the guardian of all poor people but the government also requires the support of the government in reducing poverty and tackling the issue of population growth, which is the primary cause of poverty, illiteracy and leads to lack of proper family planning,” Sarma was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. He also urged community leaders to introspect and asked them to encourage people to focus on population control.Sarma also said that the government will aim to educate women of the community to effectively tackle the issue.Sarma also highlighted that the government is against encroachment of temple lands, Satra and forest lands. He said that community members have assured the government that they do not want encroachment of these lands.The chief minister on Monday visited the Darrang district to survey the riverine areas that were encroached by illegal settlers. “A total 120 bigha land out of Shiva Mandir's 180 bigha area were encroached by illegal occupants and these lands have been freed by police and district administration,” Sarma said.Sarma said that the government is committed to ensure that lands of Satras and temples are not encroached and will take every step to ensure to protect Assam's land, identity, culture, language and heritage from illegal migrants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/population-control-needed-for-reducing-poverty-himanta-to-minority-community-101623320112173.html

With her clarification came a veiled attack on BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, where corpses were found floating in the river and some were washed up on the river bank. "We don't have rivers to dump the bodies," the mayor said.The clarification comes on a day India's Covid-19 tally shot up because Bihar revised its Covid-19 fatalities. The revision accounted for around 4,000 additional deaths which were added to the total toll on Thursday. After the revision, the total number of Covid-19 deaths in the state was 9,429 till Tuesday. Before the revision, the number was 5,458. It is not known when did these deaths took place.Maharashtra, the worst-affected state by the pandemic, is witnessing a steady improvement in the Covid-19 situation with daily cases and daily tolls nosediving. Mumbai's toll has dropped below 30 in the past few days. BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis earlier accused the civic body and the Maharashtra government of fudging mortality data.In May, reports of bodies floating in the Ganga in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar surfaced. It was suspected that they died of Covid and their bodies were dumped in the river. On May 17, the Centre asked Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to prevent the dumping of bodies in the Ganga and any other river and called media reports"undesirable and alarming".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-has-no-river-to-dump-covid-bodies-mayor-kishori-pednekar-s-jibe-at-up-bihar-101623317411651.html
10-06-2021||India||UK, Indian scientists jointly develop low-cost sensor to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater||Scientists in the United Kingdom (UK) and India have now come together to jointly develop a low-cost sensor to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, that causes the infectious coronavirus disease (Covid-19), within the wastewater. This is expected to help several middle-to-low-income countries that are struggling to control the prevalence of Covid-19 in a larger area where it is often spread through wastewater.The sensor was tested with wastewater collected from a sewage treatment plant in Mumbai spiked with SARS-Cov-2 Ribonucleic Acid (RNA). The researchers found that the sensor was able to detect the genetic material at concentrations as low as 10 picograms per microlitre.The low-cost sensor to detect Covid-19 was developed by researchers from the University of Strathclyde in the UK and those from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay in India. “Many low- to middle-income countries face a challenge in tracking Covid-19 in people because of limited access to the necessary facilities for mass testing," said Dr. Andy Ward, chancellor’s fellow in the department of civil and environmental engineering. "Looking for traces of the virus within wastewater would enable public health officials to get a better understanding of how prevalent the disease is in a larger area," he added.How does the Covid-19 sensor work to detect SARS-Cov-2 within wastewater?The sensor developed jointly by UK and Indian scientists can be used with portable equipment that uses the standard Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This eliminates the need for the expensive chemicals and lab infrastructure needed for real-time quantitative PCR tests, according to the research published recently in the journal, Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical.Explaining the importance of the technique, Dr. Ward said, "the current gold-standard method of real-time PCR testing (qPCR) requires expensive laboratory equipment and skilled scientists to complete. Furthermore, if resources are limited, testing of human samples would most likely take precedence over wastewater epidemiology surveillance. Therefore, lower cost, alternative approaches are required in order to support wastewater surveillance,” he said.The importance of testing wastewater for the presence of SARS-CoV-2According to Dr. Ward, the testing of wastewater for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is already widely recognized as a tool to identify areas where the case numbers are likely to be increasing and therefore allow more targeted action to be taken to limit the viral spread in specific regions.Adding to his inputs, Dr. Siddharth Tallur, associate professor in the department of electrical engineering at IIT Bombay, said, “The method we have developed is not just applicable to SARS-CoV-2, it could be applied to any other virus so it’s very versatile." He added that in the future, the focus will be on optimizing the assay further to increase accuracy and integrate it with a portable platform to handle "both PCR reaction and electrochemical measurement".(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-indian-scientists-jointly-develop-low-cost-sensor-to-detect-sars-cov-2-in-wastewater-101623316228382.html

Officials said they have now started preparations for a possible third wave even as though they are still uncertain whether and when it would hit.An official said they are expecting the numbers to touch the baseline level by June-end or early July and that they do not know when exactly the third wave would come. “But going by the experiences of countries like the UK and Canada, we expect that it may hit sometime around October or November and have hence started our preparations accordingly. We want to utilise the gap we get between the two waves,” said the official, requesting anonymity.Also Read | Bihar’s Buddhist tourism sector sends SOS to Centre, seeks financial bailoutA second official said children accounted for around three per cent of the people infected during the second wave. “...on any given day, there were not more than 200 children in hospitals in the state. But going by the experience of other countries, where the third wave has hit, we apprehend children could get more affected if the third wave hits.”Officials said the number of beds at Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU), Sick Neonatal Care Units (SNCU) and Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) are being increased. “While 250-300 PICU beds would be kept aside for Covid-19 patients, which may be increased up to 500, around 500 HDU units would be kept for them which may be increased up to 1,000. ...we would keep aside around 800 beds initially, which may be increased up to 1,500 according to need,” said a third official.In the 69 state-run SNCUs for infants less than a month old, there are around 2,583 beds. These would also be increased.“The main objective is to set up at least one paediatric unit in each district. An HDU would be also located in nearby locations which would have facilities like BiPAP and high flow oxygen. At some, 2 to 3 beds in normal CCUs could be upgraded by keeping paediatric gadgets to treat children above five,” said the second official.The health department is also in the process of purchasing paediatric pulse oximeters so that they could be distributed uniformly across health centres in advance. Officials said general duty medical officers may also be trained to handle paediatric cases.To be sure, the country’s top experts have said there is no evidence that the third wave will hit children harder. “If we look at the data, and compare both the Covid-19 waves, children are usually protected as the numbers are fewer. Even if they get infection, the disease is usually mild...there is no indication that in the third Covid-19 wave, children will be more impacted,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (New Delhi).“There could also be another theory that says since kids aren’t exposed much yet, in the next wave there’s a possibility that proportionally they may get more affected by virtue of greater exposure.”The Centre has also issued comprehensive guidelines for management of Covid-19 in children, including treatment of mucormycosis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-cases-drop-bengal-gears-up-for-possible-third-wave-101623316635301.html

10-06-2021||India||Odisha to move virtual teaching to YouTube from June 21 for school students||With little possibility of schools reopening from the current academic session, the Odisha government plans to live stream virtual teaching sessions for all classes on YouTube from June 21. Offline classes have been suspended since March 2020 due to the Covid pandemic outbreak.State project director of Odisha School Education Programme Authority (OSEPA) Bhupendra Singh Poonia has asked 13 of the 30 district education officers to arrange two classrooms, preferably in centre of excellence schools/ transformation high schools or in schools located near the district headquarter towns, for YouTube live streaming of virtual classes. The trial run has to be over by June 17, Poonia has ordered.The districts where virtual classes will be held for live streaming are Khordha, Balangir, Cuttack, Kendrapara, Ganjam, Koraput Puri, Dhenkanal, Sundargarh, Nayagarh, Bhadrak, Balasore and Sambalpur.Poonia said students will be able to put up questions for subject teachers during the live sessions and those will be addressed immediately after the session is over, in a time slot allotted for an interactive question-answer session.Specifying the minimum requirements for holding such classes, Poonia said, “There should be sufficient light in the room with special lights or halogen for video recording. Rooms should have AC 9 (air conditioner) or at least ceiling fans. A white board (preferably of size 5×4 ft) with marker pens and a stand for the whiteboard and a flex banner of 6×4 ft size with uniform print matter are needed.”The other requirements include a modern desktop/laptop, two cameras, recording cards, wireless lapel microphone and a camera stand or tripod.The decision to try the YouTube live streaming option comes a year after a combination of WhatsApp, Google Meet, Zoom and Skype were used for online learning. Study materials, contents of different subjects as well as written notes were shared on WhatsApp for students of Class II to X. The Odisha School Education Programme Authority also telecast video lessons for Class X on DD Odia TV channel.However, experts question if the initiative will reach hundreds of thousands of students without access to the internet, laptops or smartphones. As per government statistics, of the 67,128 government elementary schools in the state, only 27.68% have initiated online education so far.“More than 80% students in the state-run schools cannot afford smartphones and computers. How would the YouTube live streaming reach them is a big question. This disparity and inequality in imparting online classes may have long-term implications,” said Ruchi Kashyap, executive trustee at Atmashakti Trust, an NGO that conducted a State-wide study among students last year and found the number of children who attend online classes through a smartphone was 31.95%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-move-virtual-teaching-to-youtube-from-june-21-for-school-students-101623310934597.html

10-06-2021||India||Did Nusrat Jahan lie in Parliament, asks BJP after Trinamool MP says marriage with Nikhil Jain invalid||A day after Trinamool MP Nusrat Jahan issued a statement clarifying her marital status and the reason behind it, BJP's Amit Malviya on Thursday asked whether she lied to Parliament when she took the oath as Nusrat Jahan Ruhi Jain. Sharing the clip of Nusrat Jahan taking the oath, Malviya added a disclaimer and said Nusrat Jahan's personal life should not be anyone's concern. But he is raising the question as Nusrat Jahan is an elected representative and is married to Nikhil Jain, going by the record of Parliament.Nusrat Jahan on Wednesday said her marriage to Nikhil Jain was never legal, valid and tenable in India as the ceremony, which took place in Turkey in 2019, was done as per Turkish Marriage Regulation. Since it was an interfaith marriage, it requires validation under the Special Marriage Act in India, which never happened, the Trinamool MP said, explaining why she does not require a divorce from Nikhil Jain. It was a relationship or a live-in relationship and Nusrat and Nikhil have been separated long ago, the actor-turned-MP said in her statement.TMC MP Nusrat Jahan Ruhi Jain’s personal life, who she is married to or who she is living in with, should not be anyone’s concern. But she is an elected representative and is on record in the Parliament that she is married to Nikhil Jain. Did she lie on the floor of the House? pic.twitter.com/RtJc6250rpWhile her statement came amid speculations of her dating Yash Dasgupta, an actor who joined the BJP ahead of the West Bengal assembly election, it has kicked up a new row regarding official records of Nusrat Jahan."TMC MP Nusrat Jahan Ruhi Jain’s personal life, who she is married to or who she is living in with, should not be anyone’s concern. But she is an elected representative and is on record in the Parliament that she is married to Nikhil Jain. Did she lie on the floor of the House?" Malviya tweeted.While Nusrat has not said anything about the official records of her marital status, Nikhil on Wednesday claimed he has already moved the court for the annulment of the marriage.In her statement, Nusrat brought some serious allegations against Nikhil and his family members. She said even after their separation, Nikhil was withdrawing money from her bank accounts by illegal means. Her jewellery and other belongings have also been "forcefully" held back by Nikhil and his family, Nusrat claimed. Nikhil has not commented on these allegations and said the matter is now subjudice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-nusrat-jahan-lie-in-parliament-asks-bjp-after-trinamool-mp-says-marriage-with-nikhil-jain-invalid-101623310009890.html

10-06-2021||India||In first month, Himanta Biswa Sarma govt focuses on Covid, war on drugs||Tackling the Covid-19 situation in the state and a relentless campaign against illegal drugs have been the two key areas of focus for the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led coalition government in Assam, which completes its first month in office on Thursday.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition, which includes Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and United Peoples’ Party Liberal (UPPL) took charge at a time when the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak.After deliberations by the BJP high command in Delhi, the issue of leadership was resolved — with Sarma attaining his ambition of becoming chief minister (CM), and outgoing CM Sonowal being assured he would be accommodated by the party or government in another capacity, perhaps in Delhi.The Covid challenge On May 10, the day the new Cabinet took oath, the state recorded 5,803 positive cases. Within the next 10 days, the figure kept increasing, going up to 6,573 cases on May 20 — the highest-ever daily cases for the state. Nearly 80-90 deaths from the disease were taking place and hospitals were filled to the brim with patients.Contrary to expectations, Sarma, who handled the health ministry in the previous Sarbananda Sonowal government, gave the charge of the ministry to Keshab Mahanta, working president of AGP, instead of handling the responsibility himself.Also Read | Assam opens 300-bed Covid hospital in stadium; built in 20 days by DRDOInitiatives such as a strict curfew, extending to as long as 17 hours daily, without going in for a complete lockdown; the setting up of new Covid care centres; improvement in oxygen supply; a ban on inter-district movement; and increasing the number of Covid tests as well as speeding up vaccination has helped bring down the figures in the past two weeks.Daily numbers have now come down to around 3,800 cases and nearly 40 deaths. The positivity rate, which hovered around 8% a month ago, has now decreased to nearly 3%. The state, however, still has 49,000 active Covid-19 cases at present.The war on drugs While the health department is handling the pandemic situation, the state’s police is busy busting drug cartels, arresting traffickers and recovering contraband and cash since the new government took office.Though the drive against drugs has been part of the routine police operations, the campaign picked momentum last month after the new government under Sarma, who also holds the home portfolio, took charge.Between May 10 and June 7, the police across Assam has registered 401 cases and arrested 701 persons in connection with illegal drugs. Over 8.5 kgs of heroin, 2 kgs of brown sugar, nearly 6,000 kgs of marijuana, over 270,000 illegal tablets and around ₹26 lakh in cash have been recovered in this period.Also Read | Assam state board class 12 exams to be held in July-AugAs per police records, there has been a big jump in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act cases in past 10 years in the state. From 180 cases in 2010, the police registered 1,023 cases last year.“We will continue our operations against drugs continuously. Many families have been destroyed because of it, so we are taking this action as our responsibility. I am of the firm belief if our police acts actively, Assam would be able to get rid of this menace,” Sarma said in Delhi last week.The militant challengeThe release of Ritul Saikia, a junior engineer assistant of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), kidnapped by the banned United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I), within two weeks of the new government taking charge, has been another highlight of the past month.“The CM took personal interest in the matter and visited the affected family. His appeal to ULFA-I commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah elicited quick and positive response and led to Saikia’s release on the Indo-Myanmar border,” said information minister Pijush Hazarika.Saikia was abducted along with two other colleagues from a work over rig site of ONGC in Sivasagar district of Assam on April 21. While his colleagues were rescued three days later by security forces from Nagaland, close to the Indo-Myanmar border, in a joint operation, Saikia’s whereabouts were not known.Also Read | Assam to raise 10 commando battalions on lines of NSG to fight crime, border issuesIn the past month, the government also increased its stake in Numaligarh Refinery Limited (NRL) from 12.35% to 26% with an investment of ₹2,187 cr, marking the biggest-ever investment by the state.On the administrative front, the government created the role of “guardian ministers”, giving responsibility of two to three districts to each Cabinet minister for development projects and welfare schemes in those districts.The critique But the Opposition isn’t impressed. “Assam is one of the worst performing states in Niti Ayog’s Sustainable Development Goals Index. And despite assurances by the new CM, crime against women continues unabated in the state,” said Bobbeeta Sharma, media in-charge of Opposition Congress state unit.“The BJP had always committed to revive the two closed paper mills of Assam, but recently we have seen how they are all out to auction them without consideration of the interest of the people of Assam,” she added.Experts believe that while it is too early to judge the Sarma government, especially given that its hands were full tackling the pandemic in the first month, there are clear challenges.“The government was formed during a crisis and hence it has been mainly preoccupied in dealing with Covid-19,” said Kaustubh Deka, professor of political science in Dibrugarh University. He however highlighted the delay and cancellation of board exams, and the closure of two paper mills that the BJP had promised to revive as weaknesses in the first month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-in-1st-month-himanta-biswa-sarma-govt-focuses-on-covid-war-on-drugs-101623309854641.html

10-06-2021||India||Delta Covid-19 variant can infect vaccinated people, claims AIIMS study||Vaccination is not a guarantee against the Covid-19 infection and it will only ensure that the infection does not become severe, experts have reiterated this, but now a preliminary study conducted by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi has claimed the same after conducting a small study on 63 people. Out of these 63 people. 35 received both the dose of vaccines and 27 received only one dose. All of them got breakthrough infections (infections after vaccination) and among the samples which were genome sequenced, the Delta variant — the variant first reported in India — is predominant.Here is all you need to know about this study:1. Out of 63 samples, 36 were sequenced. 19 among them completed one dose and 17 got both doses.2. Out of the 36 samples, the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was found in 23 samples.3. Among 63 participants, 1en patients received Covishield while 53 received Covaxin.4. The patients had a mean age of 37 (21-92), of which 41 were males and 22 were females, AIIMS said.5. It may be noted that AIIMS earlier said that there was no death among this group, which points to the premise that vaccination reduces mortality."Reinfections and vaccine breakthrough infections are rare occurrences and genomic sequencing of vaccine breakthrough infections can provide useful insights. In the present group of vaccine breakthrough infections investigated using genome sequencing, closely overlapping and mirroring the Covid-19 cases in the state of Delhi, the variants of concern B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.7 comprised the majority, but the proportions were not significantly different in comparison with the population prevalence of the variants during this period with high community transmission," the study said.Several studies are going on to understand the variants of the Covid-19 better. A recent study by Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, and Banaras Hindu University has revealed that the Dela variant was the reason for the rise in the Covid-19 infections in Varanasi. India's SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia has also confirmed that the Delta variant was the factor behind the second wave and it is more infectious than the variant first found in the UK.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-covid-19-variant-can-infect-vaccinated-people-claims-aiims-study-101623307391151.html

Tikait has been leading the protests by farmers near the Delhi border seeking withdrawal of three farm laws passed by Parliament in September, 2020.“We said the opposition in the country is weak. We are sitting on the streets now. Had the opposition been strong, we need not have done that. Opposition should be strong, we told her (Mamata Banerjee),” Tikait was quoted as saying by news agency ANI on Thursday.Also Read| Need union of states to take on Centre: MamataThe Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader said that he met Banerjee as a chief minister and not as a party chief.“Did I meet the Afghanistan President, for which I had to take Govt of India’s permission?

One of the most vocal critics of the laws in the opposition, Banerjee hit out at the Centre on Wednesday by asking why it was so difficult to speak to the farmers. She also said the farmers’ movement is not just limited to the north Indian states of Punjab, Haryana or Uttar Pradesh and it is for the whole of India.“The BJP rule has been disastrous for all sectors from healthcare to farmers to industry. India is suffering...we are facing both natural and political disasters,” the Bengal CM added.Also Watch| Mamata Banerjee meets Rakesh Tikait: West Bengal CM’s promises & proposals﻿﻿Eleven rounds of talks have so far been held between the farmers’ unions and the Centre in a bid to end the deadlock over the farm laws, which were passed in September 2020 by Parliament.

The farmers are adamant on their demands for a complete revocation of the farm laws along with the assurance of a legal guarantee on Minimum Support Price (MSP).Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar once again urged the unions to resume talks over the laws and list their objections in the provisions with logic. “We will listen and find a solution,” Tomar said during a cabinet briefing on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-would-ve-not-sat-on-streets-if-tikait-after-meeting-with-bengal-cm-101623305924164.html

The southwest monsoon is likely to advance into the entire state during the next 2-3 days.Heavy to very heavy rainfall is very likely to occur at a few places over the districts of Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack, Dhenkanal, Angul and Sambalpur on June 10 and 11, the IMD forecast said.Jena has asked the district collectors to keep all cyclone and flood shelters ready to house people evacuated from kutcha houses/hut and low-lying areas. “The engineers in charge may keep a close watch over the embankments, especially weak/vulnerable points in rivers/ canals. Flood fighting materials may be kept ready at strategic places and immediate action may be taken to prevent any breach or to close the breach, damage of roads,” the special relief commissioner (SRC) said.The latest flood warning comes at a time when people in the coastal districts of Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara and Mayurbhanj are still battling the aftermath of cyclone Yaas that hit the coast between Balasore and Bhadrak districts on May 26 noon with a sustained wind speed of 130–140 kmph, with gusts reaching 155 kmph.

On the brighter side, the positivity rate has declined to 3.72% from 4.41%, according to the state health department.625 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in the past 24 hours including 183 from West district, the largest district in the state. Khowai (94), Unakoti (88), South district (70), North district (55), Sepahijala (52), Gomati (48) and Dhalai district (48) accounted for the rest.Over 150 Covid-19 patients have died and more than 20,000 cases were recorded in the state this year, said a senior doctor. An audit report recently released by the health department said that more than 100 patients died at Covid care centres while some were in home isolation.A health department expert said people’s reluctance to undergo Covid-19 test, getting vaccinated and regularly checking oxygen levels has been the main reason behind the deaths.“If the patients come to the hospital with below 60% oxygen level, it is almost impossible to help them despite the presence of well-equipped infrastructure”, said Dr Tapan Majumder, head of the microbiology department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-records-highest-single-day-14-covid-19-deaths-during-the-2nd-wave-101623303073990.html
10-06-2021||India||Ramdev now says he will take Covid-19 vaccine; 'good doctors are God's messengers'||Yoga guru Ramdev has said he will take the vaccine against Covid-19 soon in what comes as his attempt to bury the hatchet with the Indian Medical Association. The yoga guru, who has been at odds with the doctors' body, also advocated for vaccines and said everyone should get vaccinated, apart from practising yoga and Ayurveda. Ramdev also praised PM Modi's announcement of a free, centralised Covid-19 vaccination drive which will begin on June 21, which is also the International Yoga Day.This marks a complete shift from his earlier statement on vaccines where he questioned the efficacy of these vaccines in protecting one from Covid-19 infections as thousands of doctors, he said, contracted the infection after being vaccinated and died. On the contrary, he has the dual cover of yoga and Ayurveda and has not yet taken the jibe, he had said earlier.So is the fight between Ramdev and the Indian Medical Association a thing of the past now? The yoga guru has recently said his fight is not against ant doctor as they are a "gift to the planet". His fight is against the drug mafia, which he clarified again on social media as he posted a document comparing the price of generic medicines and the branded medicines and said, "Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadh stores had to be opened because drug mafias have opened fancy shops where they are selling unnecessary medicines at very high prices instead of basic and necessary ones"."We cannot be at enmity with any organisation. And all the good doctors are all messengers sent by God on this earth. They are a gift to this planet. But if a person being a doctor does anything wrong then that is the fault of that individual," Ramdev said, as quoted by news agency ANIThe Indian Medical Association on Wednesday approached the Indian Council of Medical Research against Ramdev's "unprovoked, demeaning and prejudicing utterances against modern medicine". In its complaint, the association termed Ramdev as a quack. The association already wrote to health minister Harsh Vardhan, PM Modi against his statements. The Delhi high court has also heard the case filed by the Delhi Medical Association against Ramdev and observed that he is entitled to his opinion.Ramdev versus Indian Medical AssociationA viral video of Ramdev on social media where he is seen trashing allopathy is where the conflict started. The IMA wrote to the health minister following which the video was withdrawn. But the controversy was far from over as Ramdev raised 25 questions over the efficacy of modern medicine and said the vaccine has no use against Covid as "thousand of doctors died even after getting inoculated". The IMA objected to the statement and said as Ramdev has many followers, he should not promote vaccine hesitancy.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramdev-now-says-he-will-take-covid-19-vaccine-good-doctors-are-god-s-messengers-101623300964876.html

The plea also contended that any film depicting Rajput’s personal life will influence the witnesses in probe related to his death, as well as change public perception towards the late actor.Krishna Kishore Singh sought a ban on films “Nyay: The Justice,” “Suicide or Murder: A Star Was Lost” and "Shashank." He also sought an injunction against any other film, publication, caricature etc based on his son’s life. Singh also said that many people took Rajput’s death as an "opportunity to get fame by developing different theories/stories", at the cost of his and his family’s reputation.”Speaking on the development, advocate AP Singh, representing directors and producers against Rajput’s father, said, “It’s a matter of great happiness for us. We have won today. This victory belongs not just to us, but also to all directors, producers who made these films to give the right direction to society.”34-year-old Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead in his home in Mumbai on June 15 last year. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is conducting a probe into his death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-ban-on-proposed-films-on-late-actor-sushant-singh-rajput-s-life-delhi-hc-101623302308351.html
10-06-2021||India||SC gives bail to man to take care of 3-yr-old daughter||The Supreme Court has granted interim six-week bail to a man accused of dowry demands and causing his wife’s death to allow him to take care of his three-year-old sick daughter. The court noted the man’s father-in-law also wanted the accused out for the sake of the child.“Considering the fact that the three-year-old daughter of the petitioner is suffering from Acute Bacillary Dysentery–C, anaemia and she needs optimum care and supervision, we deem it fit at this stage to release the petitioner on ...interim bail for a period of six weeks,” said a bench of justices Indira Banerjee and MR Shah on Tuesday.The man’s wife was in August last year found hanging in their house in Agra. Her family claimed she was murdered for dowry. The man’s family maintained the woman died by suicide after two miscarriages. The couple had adopted the girl.The father-in-law filed a dowry death and harassment case against the man. The Agra police concluded the woman died by suicide after being allegedly tortured for dowry.The husband was arrested on August 7 last year while the Allahabad high court granted anticipatory bail to his parents, sister, and brother. His father-in-law challenged the bail in the Supreme Court.In December last year, the Supreme Court said the suicide note of the woman was leaked to the media within two days of her death and that it compromised with the fairness of the investigation. It cancelled the pre-arrest bail given to her in-laws and handed over the probe to the Central Bureau of Investigation. “...the conduct of the investigation thus far diminishes this Court’s faith in directing a further investigation by the same authorities (Agra police),” it said.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for the accused, asked for an interim bail to ensure the well-being of his daughter. Rohatgi said the man was in jail since August and this incarceration has taken a toll on his daughter.The bench asked why he should be let out when the grandparents could take care of the child. Rohatgi responded that he has checked with Sanjay Kharde, the lawyer for the child’s grandfather, and that the latter supported the plea for bail for the sake of the child.Kharde echoed Rohatgi. “She has always stayed with her father and mother after her adoption. She does not eat properly, nor does she sleep well. The child has a depressive state of mind. She keeps asking about her father and mother. We are supporting this plea only in the interest of the child,” said Kharde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-gives-bail-to-man-to-take-care-of-3-yr-old-daughter-101623298574102.html

The state added 661 deaths, including 400 after reconciling of records, pushing the toll to 101,833. Mumbai continued to record less than 1,000 cases for the ninth consecutive day with 785 new cases and 27 fatalities.Even as Maharashtra is witnessing a downward curve for the past few weeks, districts in Konkan and western Maharashtra still report a chunk of daily cases. Six districts — Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Pune — contribute over 50% of state’s daily cases. Experts and health department officials said the viral activity works in a differential manner and the high numbers in certain areas will eventually come down.Also Read | Setbacks for SII leave world short of Covid-19 shotsAccording to the data, rural and urban areas from the six districts contributed over 50% of the state’s total cases.

Western Maharashtra, particularly Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli, and Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg in the Konkan region, are not showing a distinct decline that we are seeing in other parts of the state. Such things occur wherever there is a delay in introduction of virus. When Mumbai and Pune were on the peak, these districts were at a better stage, comparatively. Also, the urban areas are recovering faster than the rural areas as the infection gets introduced a bit later, therefore, more cases are seen from rural areas,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-witnesses-downward-curve-records-10-989-fresh-covid-cases-101623295153642.html

The total length of Biju Expressway (Ghatipada-Sinapali) in Nuapada district will be 104.65 kms including 6 minor bridges and 6 major bridges. A 69.85 km long stretch of Biju Expressway (Sinapali-Dharmagarh-Ampani) will pass through Kalahandi district including construction of 11 minor bridges and two major bridges.“This will not only provide enhanced connectivity in Western Odisha, but also provide impetus to industrial growth and overall economic development in the region,” said Mohapatra.The Aspirational District programme of the Narendra Modi government aimed at transforming 115 backward districts in 28 states through convergence of Central and state schemes. Apart from Kalahandi and Nuapada, Odisha’s other 8 aspirational districts are Sundargarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, Bargarh, Nuapada, Kalahandi, Nabarangpur & Koraput.Districts like Kalahandi and Nuapada, despite having rich natural resources, are yet to see desired economic development due to poor infrastructure, poor connectivity and very poor exposure to the rest of the world, experts say.The Cabinet also decided to restructure the cadre of Odisha Administrative Service, the premier state civil service by increasing the cadre strength from 1903 to 2123. As officers of this cadre contribute mostly to revenue administration, law & order, rural & urban development, land acquisition, rehabilitation & resettlement, education & health and most importantly disaster management, the government felt the need for enhancement of posts in mid and senior levels through restructuring of the cadre, officials said.“Government schemes and welfare activities have grown manifold over the years and this has necessitated the posting of officers in different levels, in addition to the existing scale,” said an official of the general administration department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-widen-expressway-in-2-of-its-poorest-districts-for-economic-development-101623294733094.html

10-06-2021||India||Former TMC leader left India before CBI filed smuggling case, Abhishek Manu Singhvi tells HC||Representing former Trinamool Congress (TMC) youth wing general secretary Vinay Mishra, who is facing an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in cattle and coal smuggling cases, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi on Wednesday raised objection to the agency’s action during a Calcutta High Court hearing. Singhvi told the court during a virtual hearing that Mishra left India before the probe against him started and when he left the country he had no knowledge about the case. The case was heard by Justice Tirthankar Ghosh. The CBI has issued a red corner notice for Mishra. On Monday, during a hearing, Mishra’s lawyers filed an affidavit stating he renounced his citizenship on December 19 last year by filing an application at the Indian Consulate in Dubai. The application was accepted on December 22, the affidavit said. Though Mishra’s lawyers have not made any statement on his current location, CBI officials suspect that he is living in Vanuatu, a small island in Polynesia. Singhvi, on Wednesday, also told the court that the CBI initiated the case against Mishra without taking any sanction from the state government. In 2018, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal withdrew the general consent accorded to the CBI to conduct investigations and raids in these states. Singhvi sought quashing of the case saying a case against Mishra was lodged at the Asansol court in Bengal’s West Burdwan district. He argued that the CBI has no document against Mishra to show his involvement in cattle and coal smuggling except handwritten entries in a diary in which the name of the accused is mentioned. A handwritten diary has no legal value, Singhvi said. The case will be heard again on Thursday. The high court on Monday directed that it would hear on merit an application by Mishra for modification of the court’s earlier order asking him to appear before the CBI. Justice Ghosh on Monday directed that Mishra’s application for protection from arrest and appearance before the CBI through video conferencing would be taken up for hearing on Wednesday. Singhvi argued on Monday that Mishra’s name did not figure in the first information report (FIR) or the initial charge sheet. His name was registered in 2020 although the alleged crime took place between 2015 and 2017. Mishra prayed for modification of an order the high court passed on April 22, asking him to appear before the CBI in person on May 3. He prayed for permission to join the investigation through video conferencing in view of the pandemic. Mishra prayed for protection from arrest till disposal of his petition before the high court and cancellation of the application for red corner notice with the Interpol. Additional Solicitor General YJ Dastoor, who appeared for the CBI, opposed the prayer on Monday, saying the petitioner suppressed facts when the initial application was moved before the high court. In the modified application, Mishra claimed that he left India on September 16, 2020, much before the registration of the case on September 21, 2020 and another FIR on November 27. He claimed that he did not receive any notice or summons from the CBI before leaving the country. He claimed that one of the main reasons for which he had to leave India was life threats from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) members. He did not name anyone. Mishra alleged that he is being targeted by central agencies as he is an ex-general secretary of the TMC youth wing. The Enforcement Directorate arrested his brother Vikas in March and also attached his property. During the recent assembly polls, the BJP alleged that chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and then youth TMC president Abhishek Banerjee was involved in the coal smuggling case. It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth hundreds of crores of rupees, have been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs mines. The CBI questioned Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Banerjee and her sister Maneka Gambhir. The latter’s husband, Ankush Arora, and his father Pawan Arora were also interrogated. TMC leaders alleged that BJP is using the agency to keep the chief minister under pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-tmc-leader-left-india-before-cbi-filed-smuggling-case-abhishek-manu-singhvi-tells-hc-101623266890229.html

10-06-2021||India||After CJI Ramana’s intervention, Telangana HC to get 18 more judges||New Delhi: An intervention from Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana has cleared the decks for increasing the number of judges in the Telangana high court by around 75% of its sanctioned strength. The high court is set to have 42 judges after an increase of 18 judges from the total sanctioned strength of 24, according to people familiar with the development.The proposal to increase the strength was pending since February 2019 when the chief justice of the Telangana high court had written to the Union minister of law and justice. The recommendation was also endorsed by the governor and chief minister of the state.However, in November 2019, the ministry wrote back to the high court chief justice, stating that preference should be given to filling-up the existing vacancies.The issue remained hanging fire until justice Ramana took the helm in the last week of April this year and took stock of all pending issues pertaining to pendency in the judiciary.Last month, justice Ramana also took up with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the minister of law and justice host of issues concerning judiciary that included the request of the Telangana high court, according to people cited above.On May 27, the CJI expedited the matter by writing to Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, highlighting that the proposal for hike in sanctioned bench strength from 24 to 42 has been pending since February 2019.The letter pointed out that the pendency in the high court has gone up to 237,000 cases, requiring immediate attention.As per the people mentioned above, the CJI opined that the current strength, even after all the vacancies are filled, was highly inadequate to address the pendency.Quoting from earlier communications, the CJI affirmed that the necessary infrastructure was in place to accommodate 42 judges in the Telangana high court.Justice Ramana asked the Union government to accede to the request made by the high court in the interest of administration of justice.The ministry swung into action after the CJI’s letter and conveyed to justice Ramana the government’s acceptance to the proposal on June 7.The CJI, those in the know of development said, gave his final approval to the proposed hike on Tuesday, paving the way for issuance of a notification in this regard by the law ministry. The notification is likely to be issued soon.As on June 1, Telangana high court had a vacancy of 10 judges out of 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-cji-ramana-s-intervention-telangana-hc-to-get-18-more-judges-101623265150013.html
10-06-2021||India||Black money row to poll show: Kerala BJP finds itself in a dock||Thiruvananthapuram: Pressure mounts on Kerala Bharatiya Janata Party as state chief K Surendran is set to meet party’s top leaders in New Delhi to discuss issues like the black money row, performance at the assembly elections and alleged bribery case, and try to come up with strategies for the state unit along with the way ahead.After a humiliating defeat in the April 6 assembly election where the BJP lost its lone seat in the southern state, the central leadership had sought a report from three important leaders — former DGP Jacob Thomas, Metro Man E Sreedharan (both were candidates) and former bureaucrat C V Andan Bose — on the state of affairs in the party. The central leadership reportedly recommended sweeping changes in the light of poor performance, faction feud and subsequent controversies associated with the state unit. Amid the rising infighting, political observers believe that mounting differences among party leaders had resulted in the poll debacle. While state leaders have underplayed Surendran’s Delhi visit, speculation is rife about an overhaul. “It was not a summon but a planned visit. Besides, our political opponents and a section of media are also baying for the party blood,” BJP leader M T Ramesh said while denying speculations of change in state party leadership. A BJP team also called on Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Wednesday, alleging a ploy to defame the party. Besides the internal feud, the party is also under a cloud of purported highway heist and hawala transactions, alleged pay off to an independent candidate and transaction of money to tribal leader C K Janu, a candidate in Wayanad, to remain in the NDA. A look at the controversies: Highway heist The alleged highway robbery took place on April 3, three days before the state went to the polls. A man named S Shamseer told police that he was transporting some cash when he was allegedly waylaid by a group of people in Kodakara on Thrissur-Ernakulam highway who looted his vehicle after assaulting him. Shamseer, however, filed a police complaint four days later (April 7) and alleged that ₹25 lakh, which was meant for some property transactions, was stolen from his vehicle. Police found several inconsistencies in Shamseer’s statements when he was asked why he took four days to register the complaint. Shamseer later named one A K Dharmarajan, a local leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). During the probe, Dharmarajan told police that the money was meant for election activities and was collected from several people. After arresting 20 people, all history-sheeters allegedly involved in the heist, police found that the recoveries ran into several crores ( ₹3.50 crore). Police have so far seized ₹1.75 crore and gold from all the accused. During the probe, Dharmajan reportedly told police that the money was meant to be handed over to BJP Alappuzha treasurer K G Kartha and that party state organising secretary M Ganeshan was aware of the transportation.However, the case took a turn when one of the main accused P Deepak was found at the BJP district office in Thrissur after the incident, police said. BJP leaders, however, claimed that Deepak visited the office as part of an internal probe being carried out by the party. A special investigation team (SIT) formed by the state police to probe the case now suspect the money came from Karnataka through hawala channels and was allegedly meant for distribution during the elections. Call records showed that after the money was recovered by the police, both Shamseer and Dharmarajan made several calls to Surendran and his son K Harikrishnan. On Monday, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the SIT had handed over the details of the case to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) after the central agency sought the same. Meanwhile, a local court in Thrissur on Wednesday dismissed a plea by Dharmarajan seeking possession of the seized money. The court said an investigation into the case was underway and sought more details from the SIT in this regard. The Congress has sought a court-monitored probe into the highway heist and hawala transactions. “Only a court-monitored probe will unravel the truth, otherwise the state government will weaken the case in lieu of some of the cases being probed by central agencies,” party MP K Muraleedharan said.Pay-off to independent candidate Just when the party was struggling to come clear in the alleged highway heist case, a case of bribery against Surendran surfaced. Independent candidate K Sundara, who had contested against the state BJP chief from Mancheswaram (north Kerala) seat, alleged last week that he was under pressure to withdraw his candidature. He said that while he had demanded ₹15 lakh, he was paid only ₹2.5 lakh and handed over a smartphone. Besides these, Sundara alleged that he was offered a wine parlour and a house in Karnataka once Surendran emerged victorious. However, after Surendran’s loss to Muslim League’s AKM Ashraf, party leaders refused to meet the promises made to him, he said. Sundara did later withdraw his nomination and campaigned for Surendran but did not join the party. Following the allegations, CPI(M) candidate V V Ramesan moved Kasaragod magistrate court which directed Kerala Police to register a case against the BJP leader. Surendran was booked under section 17I (B) of Indian Penal Code among other charges. The party said it will challenge the move in a higher court. “Both the ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress have joined hands to discredit the BJP. Some of the recent allegations are part of this campaign,” party leader A N Radhakrishnan said. Sundara, who now claims to be associated with the Bahujan Samaj Party, said he is ready to depose against the BJP leader. Interestingly in the 2016 assembly elections, Sundara had secured 467 votes while Surendran lost the seat by a slender margin of 89 votes. The independent candidate said that this time, the BJP was more alert and several leaders from Karnataka had pressurised him to withdraw his candidature from the election. Surendran lost the April polls by a bigger margin of 745 votes to Ashraf. “It is only the tip of the iceberg. The ongoing investigation will give a clear picture later. The party spent crores of rupees in the recent elections,” CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan said. Largesse to tribal leader A fresh controversy surfaced last week after a leader belonging to Janadhipathya Rashtriya Party (JRP), an ally of the BJP, alleged that Surendran had given ₹10 lakh to their party chief C K Janu for returning to the NDA fold before the polls. Janu, a tribal leader from Wayanad, had earlier severed links with the BJP and NDA but later contested for them from Sulthan Bathery in Wayanad district. JRP leader Praseetha Azeekode said though Janu had sought a bigger amount, Surendran gave her only ₹10 lakh. After her disclosure, an audio tape surfaced in which Surendran was purportedly heard talking to Janu, promising her ₹10 lakh. HT could not verify the authenticity of the tape. However, Janu claimed that the money was part of the poll campaign expenses and no payment was involved for return. “The allegations have invited more ignominy to the party than recent poll defeat,” political observer A Jayashankar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/black-money-row-to-poll-show-kerala-bjp-finds-itself-in-a-dock-101623265149309.html
10-06-2021||India||K’taka govt defends anti-cattle slaughter Act in HC||Bengaluru: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa-led government on Wednesday defended the contentious anti-cattle slaughter Act, which has been challenged through multiple petitions, in the Karnataka high court. The Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Act, 2020, came into effect in February this year after the bill regarding the legislation was passed in the legislative council. Highlighting the government’s stance on the Act in the high court, the chief minister’s office (CMO) in a statement on Wednesday said, “Bulls and bullocks are useful not only for dairy farming but also for draught agricultural purposes and breeding. In addition to these activities, working bullocks are indispensable as they supply an impressive amount of power in comparison to any other animal.” There are at least nine petitions pending before courts challenging the Act, according to one person aware of the developments. The new legislation expands the scope of an existing law to protect cattle from slaughter and is part of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s larger “plans to introduce laws in line with its core-ideology”, a BJP legislator said on the condition of anonymity. When the Bill was presented in the state legislature, the Congress had protested it and even torn its copies. The Yediyurappa government had earlier promulgated the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Ordinance, which widened the existing provisions for punishment on killing of cattle. The Act also has a provision to safeguard those “acting in good faith”, which activists fear would give rise to vigilantism. The new law penalises those slaughtering cattle below 13 years of age with a jail term of three to five years and/or fines ranging from ₹50,000 to ₹10 lakh, or both. The CMO said that even the cattle that are too old to work help in production of manure and biogas and so they cannot be called “economically unproductive”. “Considering their immense contribution, it was felt necessary to preserve and protect cow progeny, including bulls and bullocks,” it added. The state government also argued that the cattle population has dropped drastically in the last eight years. According to the 19th livestock census in 2012, there were 9,516,484 cattle in the state, which came down to 8,469,004 in 2019 (20th livestock census). “The population of indigenous cattle is 1,254,206 (Hallikar and Amritmahal) and both male and female are used for drought purposes. The state government has submitted that these are few of the reasons for which the enactment in question was passed,” the CMO said in its statement. A division bench of Karnataka high court, headed by its chief justice, is expected to give a date on Monday for the final hearing in the case, according to a person aware of the developments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-govt-defends-anti-cattle-slaughter-act-in-hc-101623264849279.html

Appreciate his insights on developments in the region and beyond. Thanked him for the support and solidarity in India’s fight against Covid.”Jaishankar embarked on a three-day visit to Kuwait on Wednesday, carrying a message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah on ways to boost bilateral ties. He is scheduled to travel from Kuwait to Kenya.Hours after Jaishankar’s stopover in Doha, senior Qatari officials held separate meetings with Khalilzad, the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, and a team of Taliban negotiators.Mutlaq bin Majed Al Qahtani, the Qatari foreign minister’s special envoy for counter-terrorism and mediation in conflict resolution, met Khalilzad and his delegation and discussed the “peace process in Afghanistan and ongoing talks in Doha between the Afghan parties”, Qatar News Agency (QNA) reported.Qahtani held a separate meeting with Sheikh Abdul Hakim, who was last year appointed the Taliban chief negotiator by the group’s chief Hibatullah Akhunzada last year. This meeting too reviewed the peace process in Afghanistan, QNA reported.Khalilzad and an US inter-agency delegation, including the National Security Council, department of defense and USAID, began a visit to Afghanistan, Qatar and the region on June 4 to give a boost to the stalled Afghan peace process amid the rapid drawdown of American forces in Afghanistan.The delegation will “underscore enduring US support for Afghanistan’s development and a political settlement that will end the war”, the state department said in a statement ahead of the visit. In Qatar, Khalilzad will “continue to encourage both sides to make tangible progress towards a political settlement that protects the gains of the last two decades”, the statement added.While in Kuwait, Jaishankar will thank the country’s leadership for supporting India’s response to a second wave of Coronavirus infections by supplying a large quantity of medical oxygen. This is his first visit to Kuwait as foreign minister and follows a trip to India by his Kuwaiti counterpart Ahmed Nasser Al-Mohammad Al-Sabah in March.Under an air and sea bridge arrangement, Indian Navy ships have transported 425 tonnes of liquid oxygen from Kuwaiti ports to India. Kuwait has supplied more than 5,000 oxygen cylinders, 66 oxygen concentrators, 11 ventilators and other materials such as medicines, oximeters, masks and gloves to India.Kuwait is among the largest suppliers of oil for India and also home to nearly 900,000 Indian expatriates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-meets-qatari-nsa-on-way-to-kuwait-101623264549306.html
10-06-2021||India||Centre, states pitch in to dispel vaccine hesitancy in rural areas||“If you get vaccine, we will meet again. If you don’t, we will meet at Narmada ghat,” cautions a colourful banner on an auto rickshaw in Bhopal, referring to a cremation ground in the central Indian city.Almost 1500km away, in Ganderbal, a little north of Srinagar, religious leaders are using loudspeakers at mosques to urge people to go and get vaccinated.These are some of the efforts on in rural India as various administrations, central, state and local, work towards encouraging people in smaller cities, towns or villages to take Covid-19 vaccines. While the overwhelming issue right now, even in rural India, is supplies, there is also hesitancy caused by fear of vaccines, or prompted by misapprehensions regarding them.To date, India has fully vaccinated 47,224,623 people and partially vaccinated 148,029,921, according to the HT dashboard. The current population eligible for vaccination is 940 million (those over the age of 18 years). Assuming that even 60% of this is rural (Census 2011 put the proportion at 68.9%), this works out to 564 million people in rural India who need to be vaccinated.Based on data from health ministry’s Co-WIN dashboard analysed by HT, 13.4% of all adults living in India’s rural districts have received at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine till June 7, while this proportion was 24% in urban and 18% in semi-urban districts.According to a HT analysis on May 8, around the peak of the second wave, rural and semi-rural India was contributing almost 58% of new Covid-19 cases.The Union ministry of minority affairs has begun a pan-Indian campaign to tackle concerns and myths about the inoculation drive that have resulted in vaccine hesitancy among minority communities. According to an official aware of the matter, a national-level awareness campaign has been organised, especially in areas that have a high percentage of minorities and where people have shown reluctance to take vaccines.“In some areas the ministry is relying on women’s self-help groups to drive away the misconceptions about the vaccines. The ministry has also reached out to religious and social organisations to help remove doubts and fears about the vaccines,” said the official quoted above.Citing examples of areas with vaccine hesitancy, the official said administrations in several districts of Uttar Pradesh such as Sultanpur, Amethi, Aligarh and Moradabad, and in Haryana’s Mewat have reported reluctance towards vaccines based on dogmas, religious reasons and rumours.Even as the government works on increasing vaccine supplies, it faces the task of addressing the issue of hesitancy.Recently, a video showing an old woman in a village in Uttar Pradesh, hiding behind a drum fearing vaccination went viral, underlining how many in the rural belts are wary of taking vaccines. HT reported on May 20 how the fight against Covid-19 in rural Bihar is being hampered by the lack of health are infrastructure and vaccine hesitancy.A report put out by the union panchayati raj ministry shows truck drivers, panchayats or even toll plazas have painted slogans such as “buri nazar wale tera munh kala, achha hoga vaccine lagwane wala” (wicked people be damned, good things will happen to those who got vaccinated). And women volunteers are conducting door to door surveys and even small rallies in villages to encourage people to take vaccines.The ministry report highlighted that “in Gujarat, some panchayats even offered 50% concession in panchayat taxes to promote vaccination” while some others formed “Gram yoddha samiti” comprisingpanchayat leaders, ASHA workers and local police to counsel villagers.A senior ministry official, who didn’t wish to be named, said, “It’s a tough job. But these Covid influencers are better placed as they belong to the local community.”And in Odisha, where “there have been some vaccine hesitancy seen in certain tribal communities, the state government, according to the ministry, has provided ₹10,000 to each village welfare committees to undertake activities such as “poster campaigns, leaflet distribution, wall paintings and beating of drums.”In faraway villages of Nagaland, women’s self-help groups “continue to install bamboo pole hand wash stations in public places in the village. During the first wave, 2316 hand wash facilityies has been installed across 1158 villages and this continues to be a practice in the second wave as well,” read the report shared by the ministry.With inputs by Smriti Kak Ramachandran||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-states-pitch-in-to-dispel-vaccine-hesitancy-in-rural-areas-101623264491159.html
10-06-2021||India||‘I wasn’t being able to fulfil the aspirations of people’: Jitin Prasada||Jitin Prasada, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday, spoke to HT about the timing of his move, why he chose the BJP, and while refusing to blame individuals in the Congress, talked about the general disconnect between the party and the people in his home state of Uttar Pradesh. Edited excerpts:The move doesn’t come as that much of a surprise. You almost joined the BJP in 2019 and then held back-- what changed since then?It’s not about surprises, but in the last two years, I have been travelling across the country and in my interactions with people, I began to realise that I’m not being able to fulfil the expectations of the very people I promised to work for. And when you see a dilution in that, you start feeling that the organisation that you belong to is not being able to fulfil the expectations of the people, especially in the state that I come from.How long have you been feeling like this?It’s not about a particular time, it’s about a series of election defeats, the interactions with people, their suggestions and their talk; they reach out to you to for help and work but you are not able to fulfil it. That’s when you have to take a decision.Did the BJP approach you or did you approach them?It’s not about who approached whom. I’m not going to tell you other than it’s a decision that I’m very happy to have taken. I’m happy to be part of a party that’s the only national party that exists in India. It functions on an institutional basis rather than on whims and fancies that revolve around a particular person.Are you referring to the whims and fancies of the people in charge now -- SoniaGandhi, or Rahul Gandhi?I am talking about the parties in general, not about a particular party.But the party that you are quitting is the Congress?Today, is my first day in the BJP, and today isn’t the day of why I left a particular party.One of the first people who reached out on Twitter was Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma who also like you quit the Congress. Did you seek his advice before leaving?No, I didn’t have any interaction with him, but I hope to meet him very soon and congratulate him on his victory in AssamYou talked about successive defeats...Defeats and wins are part of politics. I am talking about the distancing at large from the people of a political party, especially in my state. The disconnect has led to serious defeats and it isn’t being course corrected.When you talk about disconnect, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is the state in-charge and she has been trying since 2019 to revive the Congress. Is this an indictment of her?I am not talking about just the last two years. I’m talking of what’s happened over the years. You know the results of what’s happened.If we talk about BJP, you are joining at a difficult time since in your state, their leaders have criticised their handling of Covid.They have voiced their concerns, but as far as I’m concerned, I am going to work for the party and we are going to see elections in Uttar Pradesh soon. Apart from that, I am looking at doing whatever they decide to put me to work. I feel that my energy will be utilised and that will make me successful.Do you bring the Brahmin vote to the table for BJP?I belong to that community and have been taking up their cause on a non-political platform. Hopefully, I’ll be able to help them much more now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-wan-t-being-able-to-fulfil-the-aspirations-of-people-101623264490588.html
10-06-2021||India||Entry of old Cong loyalist good optics for BJP in run up to UP polls||Former Union minister Jitin Prasada’s induction into the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday came in the backdrop of caste realignments in Uttar Pradesh, which goes to the polls early next year and where Brahmins form an influential vote bloc.Though Prasada’s influence within the community may be limited, his entry gives an opportunity to the BJP to showcase a Brahmin face in a state where reports of dissidence within the party have surfaced in recent weeks amid allegations that the administration was biased towards Thakurs.The party, which is hoping to return to power in India’s most-populous state, also gets a chance to underline that loyalists of the Congress party’s first family --- Prasada was considered close to former party president Rahul Gandhi -- were abandoning the party.“They say Modi ji is intolerant. Then why so many senior Congress leaders are abandoning the “tolerant” Gandhi family and wanting to work with Modiji? People prefer to work in a democratic culture rather than work for a delusional dictator disconnected from the masses,” tweeted Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who left Congress to join BJP in 2015.But the Congress insisted that losing Prasada was a minor loss because the 47-year-old had no electoral heft and had ceased to be a mass leader. The Congress pointed out that Prasada lost from his home seat of Dhaurara in the last two Lok Sabha elections. “Make no mistake. He is no Jyotiraditya Scindia or Himanta Biswa Sarma who have mass support and had followers in the organisation,” said a senior Congress strategist requesting anonymity. Scindia and his followers quit the Congress in 2020, causing the party’s government in Madhya Pradesh to fall.Prasada’s entry into the BJP comes months before crucial elections in Uttar Pradesh, which BJP won in a landslide in 2017 by forming a rainbow coalition of upper castes, non-Yadav Other Backward Classes and non-Jatav Scheduled Caste communities. Before that election too, BJP had inducted key Brahmin leaders -- Brajesh Pathak from Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Rita Bahuguna Joshi from Congress -- into the party.A senior BJP leader who did not wish to be quoted said it was the bulk of the Brahmin vote that helped BJP secure massive wins in the last two national elections and also get a huge mandate in the 2017 UP assembly elections.The ruling dispensation is also counting on Prasada to counter the perception that Brahmins, who form roughly 13% the state’s population but have wider social influence, moved away from BJP after chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who is from the Thakur community, was made chief minister in 2017.In a tweet, Adityanath welcomed Prasada. “His entry will definitely strengthen the party in UP,” the CM said.Over the past year, Prasada tried to consolidate his position among Brahmins by holding a Brahmin Chetna Samvaad. He claimed his community was facing persecution and being ignored by the Yogi Adityanath-led government.But his efforts were somewhat overshadowed by the Samajwadi Party (SP) and BSP after the regional outfits promised to build statues of Parashuram to attract Brahmin support.“The impact of statements by Prasada, [BSP chief] Mayawati and SP insinuating that there is a Thakur vs Brahmin sentiment in the state, which has been lent support by the CM’s preference, cannot be denied. Various Brahmin social groups have over time conveyed their concerns to the party leadership,” said a second senior BJP leader.In the 2007 elections, BSP won a simple majority by crafting a coalition of extremes between Dalits and Brahmins. To woo the upper caste community, Mayawati even changed her party’s slogan from Tilak, Tarazu aur Talwar, Inko Maaro Joote Chaar’ to ‘Haathi Nahi, Ganesh Hai; Brahama, Vishnu, Mahesh Hai’“The Brahmin vote has always played a decisive role in the past. The dip in the popularity of the Congress, which at one time had popular and tall Brahmin leaders in the state as CMs, was exacerbated when the community shifted their loyalty to the BJP after the Ramjanmabhoomi movement. In between there were times when the community even supported the BSP,” a third senior BJP leader said, requesting anonymity.Two of Prasada’s aides claimed he was increasingly getting marginalised in the Congress organisation, and had even told them how in his home turf of Shahjahanpur, SP turncoats were getting more importance than his loyalists. Once an integral part of ‘Team Rahul’, he was among the so-called G23 leaders who demanded sweeping changes in the party organisation last year.They also claimed that despite being named poll incharge for West Bengal earlier this year, Prasada had little say in strategy, alliance and communication plan.“I knew him as a good person. He was a prominent Brahmin face for our party. He must have joined the BJP for greener pastures,” said leader of Congress in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who worked with Prasada closely during the West Bengal polls.“The BJP does not believe in caste politics. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we believe in sabka saath sabka vikas. The coming of Congress leaders such as Rita Bahuguna Joshi and now Prasada is also a seal of approval on the administration of Modi-Yogi double-engine government,” said Chandramohan, a BJP spokesperson in UP.Asked if Prasada’s inability to win the previous two Lok Sabha elections is a cause for concern, Chandramohan said the Prasada family has a certain heft in the state’s politics. “Both the party and he will benefit from coming together,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/entry-of-old-cong-loyalist-brahmin-face-good-optics-for-bjp-in-run-up-to-up-polls-101623264310964.html
10-06-2021||India||Covaxin phase 3 trial results to be out in July: Bharat Biotech||Hyderabad-based vaccine maker Bharat Biotech said on Wednesday it will release the results of phase 3 clinical trials of its coronavirus shot only in July, a month later than the previously announced timeline of June.The Bharat Biotech shot, Covaxin, is one of the three vaccines currently approved in India for emergency use owing to the pandemic. It was given a go-ahead in January without having carried out phase 3 trials at the time. The company released interim data in April that showed the vaccine was very effective.The firm told news agency ANI on Wednesday it will release its data to the public in July, submit it to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) for a full license application, and give the results for a peer-review.The interim analysis of the trials has shown an efficacy of 78% against symptomatic disease, and 100% protection from serious illness, according to the company.“It is critical to understand, and further emphasise the phase-3 data will first be submitted to Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), followed by peer-reviewed journals, with a timeline of 3 months for publication, and as communicated earlier, COVAXIN phase 3 results full trial data will be made public during July. Once data from the final analysis of phase III studies are available, Bharat Biotech will apply for full licensure for COVAXIN,” Bharat Biotech told ANI on Wednesday. At the time of releasing the interim data, the company said the data was likely to be released in June.The company’s project head for Covaxin, Raches Ella, made a similar statement on Twitter.But usually, companies do publish data much before they apply for full licensure. Moderna, for instance, whose vaccine was approved in the US under the same emergency use authorisation, published its peer-reviewed preliminary results 12 days later in late December. AstraZeneca/Oxford published peer-reviewed efficacy results earlier in December, ahead of its approval in the UK.People aware of the matter also said Bharat Biotech will further collate real-world data from people who are being administered the shot in the country.Experts say the data should be put in public domain for independent analysis. “Trial data should ideally be published in peer-reviewed top medical journal so that those people who are not a part of the clinical trial can study it, question it and cross-check the legitimacy of the trial,” said CM Gulhati, editor, Monthly Index of Medical Specialities (MIMS), pharmaceutical reference guide.The phase 3 study held this year enrolled 25,800 participants between 18-98 years of age, with analysis conducted 14 days post second dose. Covaxin was developed with seed strains received from the National Institute of Virology under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-phase-3-trial-results-to-be-out-in-july-bharat-biotech-101623264190659.html
10-06-2021||India||Cabinet clears hike in kharif crop MSPs||The Union Cabinet has raised minimum support prices (MSPs) of summer-sown crops, increasing them by 1.8% and 6.7%, in keeping with a policy to offer farmers at least 50% returns over the cost of cultivation, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Wednesday.The new rates come amid ongoing protests by farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, who want the government to scrap three agricultural laws passed in September 2020 and offer a legal backing for MSPs.The MSPs announced on Wednesday are geared toward nudging farmers to shift away from plentiful cereals, by setting higher prices for oilseeds and pulses, whose output and supply are relatively scarce. For instance, India imports up to two-thirds of its vegetable oil to meet domestic demand.“We have been saying all along that there should be no doubt over MSP. The MSP system has been there and will be there,” Tomar said. The new rates will offer returns of between 50% and 62% over cost of cultivation, he said.MSPs are federally fixed floor prices for crops for government purchases aimed at avoiding distress sale by farmers and signalling a benchmark rate for private traders.The agriculture minister said the government has not closed the doors on negotiations with protesting farm unions. “We are willing to talk and are committed to farmers’ welfare. We had 11 rounds of talks. We have appealed to the farmers to point out specific objections in the legislation. Neither any opposition leader in the House (Parliament) nor the protesting farmers have come up with any specific objection,” Tomar said.The government buys large quantities of cereals from farmers at MSP rates and distributes them to beneficiaries through the public distribution system at subsidised rates. This is primarily how farmers benefit from the MSP system. However, sales to other buyers can be at prices that are either above or below MSPs.Farm economist KS Mani, a former faculty with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, said he broadly agreed with the pricing differential between produce that are abundant and those in short supply. “The underlying aim is crop diversification. This will work if the government also buys oilseeds and pulses in sufficient quantities.”Among key crops, MSP for paddy has been raised from ₹1,868 to ₹1,940 a quintal, a hike of 3%. The rates for coarse cereals jowar and bajra were hiked by ₹118 to stand at ₹2,738 and ₹2,250, which translates to a raise of 21% and 5%, respectively. The prices of urad, a lentil, has been increased sharply by ₹300 to stand at ₹6,300 a quintal.The highest increase over the previous year was for sesamum, an oilseed, whose MSP was raised by ₹452 a quintal, to stand at ₹7,307 a quintal, up from ₹6,855.The next largest increase were for two lentils, tur (pigeon pea) and urad (black gram) , whose MSPs were increased by ₹300 a quintal each. Prices of groundnut and nigerseed have been increased by ₹275 per quintal and ₹235 a quintal, respectively. In all, prices were raised by up to 62%.To fix MSP, the government uses a measure of cost, called A2 + FL, which refers to the cost of cultivation plus the value of family labour.Farmers have been demanding a legal guarantee for MSP that is calculated using a broader and more comprehensive measure of costs called C2, which includes the assumed cost of capital invested, including machinery, and rent on land.“Across crops, the increase in absolute numbers doesn’t even match the inflation rate,” said Kavitha Kuruganti, a farm activist. “The government is doing its usual trickery on farmers. First, they did not use the C2 cost concept and used A2+FL. In maize, the increase is as low as ₹20 per quintal, compared to last year. MSPs are meaningless if the government cannot ensure that all farmers get at least this price. That is where the demand for a legal guarantee comes in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-clears-hike-in-kharif-crop-msps-101623264191249.html
10-06-2021||India||Blow to Congress as Jitin Prasada joins BJP||Former Union minister and Congress leader Jitin Prasada on Wednesday made the switch to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and said that the ruling dispensation was “truly a national party” while other outfits remained about personalities or were confined to particular regions.Joining the BJP in New Delhi in the presence of Union minister Piyush Goyal, Prasada said that “if there was any political party in the country today that worked in an institutional way... then it was the Bharatiya Janata Party”.“Our family has been associated with the Congress for three generations, but during the last 8-10 years, I felt that if there is any national party, it is the BJP,” he added.Prasada, who earlier met Union home minister Amit Shah, said other parties have been reduced to individuals or regional entities. The 47-year-old son of former Congress leader Jitendra Prasada called his move a new chapter in his political life and a well-thought-out decision.He was part of a group of 23 leaders who wrote to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi last year, seeking organisational overhaul and elections at all levels, triggering a tussle within the party. On Wednesday, Prasada refrained from attacking the Congress leadership directly but said he realised that it was no longer possible for him to serve people and protect their interests while remaining in his former party. He said the decision was not about which party he was quitting but which he was joining. The development marks another high-profile exit from the Congress of a leader who later joined the BJP. Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia joined the BJP last year, resulting in the fall of the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh. Once considered close to Rahul Gandhi, a host of young Congress leaders, including Sachin Pilot and Milind Deora, have spoken out about the state of affairs in their party. Getting Prasada, a member of the Brahmin community, which forms about 13% of Uttar Pradesh’s population, is good optics for the BJP ahead of assembly elections in the state next year, experts said. Goyal praised Prasada for continuing to help the people of his constituency despite no longer being their representative in Parliament. Prasada, a two-time Congress MP, lost the 2014 elections to BJP’s Rekha Verma.Lauding him as a “rooted leader” and politician of stature, Goyal said his joining the BJP will boost the party and also provide him an opportunity to serve people. There was speculation about the possibility of Prasada joining the BJP ahead of the 2019 elections but he had then dismissed it saying he would not address “hypothetical questions”.Prasada has said in recent years that his community was facing persecution and being largely ignored by the Yogi Adityanath-led government in Uttar Pradesh. He also started a Brahma Chetna Samvaad to reach out to the community and offer a platform to give a voice to the community’s aspirations.In a tweet on Wednesday, Adityanath said: “ We welcome Jitin Prasad, who has left Congress to join the BJP. His inclusion in the party will definitely strengthen BJP in Uttar Pradesh.” Last year, Congress leader Kapil Sibal, who was among the signatories to a letter to party chief Sonia Gandhi seeking organisational changes, alleged Prasada was being targeted by partymen in Uttar Pradesh and called it unfortunate. Prasada did not find a place in the Congress’s committees formed for the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. A two-term Lok Sabha MP, he lost elections in 2014 and 2019, and was the Congress leader in charge of West Bengal before joining the BJP.“Jitin Prasad Ji, do you feel comfortable standing with those people who have suppressed every democratic institution in the last 7 years?” Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blow-to-congress-as-jitin-prasada-joins-bjp-101623264129836.html
10-06-2021||India||“Bio E vaccine works against variants, ready with tweaks if needed': Maria Elena Bottazzi||Biological E’s vaccine candidate works well to control Sars-Cov-2 variants of concerns, and work has already begun to make alterations in case more resistant mutations occur, according to one of the leading scientists who is part of the development team. In an interview with HT, Maria Elena Bottazzi, the associate dean of Baylor College of Medicine’s National School of Tropical Medicine, said Biological E’s recombinant protein vaccine could address a large gap in global supplies in general, and help inoculate children in particular, and spoke of the need to ensure second doses are given on time to reduce the risk of mutations. The Baylor College of Medicine has partnered with Biological E for the vaccine. Edited excerpts: Tell us a little bit about the progress of the Biological E vaccine.In 2020, we transferred to Biological E the seed stock to produce this recombinant protein Covid-19 vaccine candidate. Biological E have been doing a number of things since: they are advancing the manufacturing, and are also maturing the process and scaling it up. They are testing the manufacturing stock, and at the same time, have engaged in a clinical development plan. The company has got the approval to initiate a large Phase 2/3 trials in India, while in parallel, it’s also working with global agencies, including CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations) to launch a global clinical trial.When can we expect to see the results from the Phase 1/2 trial?I think they’re (Biological E researchers) finishing up compiling all the data from the Phase 1/2 stages and the company will probably provide more information soon. They have already received the approval for Phase 3 trials so you will probably see that they’re going to be launching that in the next week.Have you been able to test how the vaccine works with the variants of concern we have at the moment?Yes, in our laboratories, working in partnership with Biological E, we have evaluated the performance of the vaccine using our pseudovirus technique, and clearly, the vaccine induces cross neutralising antibodies against the different variants, including B.1.617 (Delta) variant. We are also re-engineering the vaccine candidate and have already transitioned to Biological E additional constructs for them to evaluate – to see if we will in the future need boosters or a second-generation dose against the different variants. But the vaccine that they are currently advancing is quite cross-protective and performs well against variants of concern. At the same time, we’re looking for alternatives in case in the future, we need to redesign the vaccine. So, it is a two-pronged approach.We have constructs for Sars, and for Mers, and now we have a toolbox of different constructs against Covid-19, so we’re looking at ways to develop second and then third-generation vaccine candidates.You mentioned in the past that this vaccine could show particular promise for use among children. Can you tell us a little more about that?The yeast expression technology (the platform used) is the mainstay for a lot of vaccines -- it’s the same process used for the Hepatitis B vaccine, which is widely used in the paediatric population. There is a lot of experience in quality production, and regulators are quite abreast of the safety. And because it’s a system used for other licensed vaccines, it’s also reassuring. After authorisation (for adults), Biological E will start looking at evaluation in paediatric populations.There is a debate over whether second doses of the vaccine should be delayed, as has been done by India, particularly in light of the reduced efficacy with the Delta variant. What is your opinion on it?That is a hard choice because we know that you really require the two-dose scheme to ensure you maximise the immune response, but at the same time, you don’t have enough vaccines to cover as many people as possible. I appreciate the stress of wanting to make sure a lot of people start getting vaccinated, but if you start vaccinating people that are not fully protected, that may also open the window for this virus to continue mutating and enabling it to escape immunity. Scientifically, we favour that individuals stay within the schedule of that vaccine.From what we have seen of the Sars-Cov-2’s evolution till now, how do you see the pandemic evolving and how does it pose a challenge to the vaccination programme?If we continue to have this very patchy world, where there are areas where you’re doing a really good job in access and distribution of vaccines but in other areas you don’t, I think there’s going to be more of this emergence of variants of concern. It is most likely going to require all of us get a booster shot sometime late this year or early next year. And this is, again, another reason why we now first need to ensure we have enough vaccines to catch up areas where there is still a lag in coverage. At the same time, we will also need to have availability to fill gaps for other ages, including the paediatric population. So, as you can see, that’s the real urgency of continuing to ramp up production, ensuring there’s enough supply of all the reagents you need, and to have a very good ecosystem in the health system for distributed storage.

10-06-2021||India||Wide variation in coverage across states marks India’s vaccine drive||India’s vaccination drive has been open to adults across age groups for 40 days and several variations in coverage are clear across the country’s states, data analysed by HT shows. While Himachal Pradesh is the clear leader in terms of administering doses to the largest proportion of its adults (38%), states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Tamil Nadu have not managed give a single shot to even 15% of those eligible for vaccines.Delhi leads in administering doses to those in the 18-45 years age group with 17.3% of residents in the category having received a shot, while Chhattisgarh brings up the bottom of the list with only 3.7% those between 18 and 45 receiving jabs.Tamil Nadu is not only among states that has covered less than 15% of its eligible population, its coverage of the 45+ years age group (20.4%) is the worst among all 23 regions for which population projections are available for 2021 from the National Commission on Population. Given the high social development indicators and the relatively good public health infrastructure in the state, the numbers may point to significant vaccine hesitancy.Till 5pm on Wednesday, India administered 191.9 million first doses of Covid-19 vaccines across different age groups, according to data uploaded on the Co-WIN dashboard. Of these, 50.5 million doses went to people in the 18-45 age group, 79.2 million to those in the 45-60 age group, and 62.2 million to those above 60.Yet, because 63% of all adults in India are in the 18-45 age group, only 8.5% of this category has been covered, whereas 38.2% of the 45-60 group (they form 22% of the eligible population) and 45.1% of the 60 and above age group (14.7% of the eligible population) has been given at least one dose.So, how are states faring in vaccinating the old and the young?The states that have vaccinated a low share of their eligible population are unsurprisingly behind in vaccinating both the old and the young. These are Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Punjab. These six states have given first doses to less than 20% of adults, with 27%-36% coverage in the 45 and above age group and 5.1%-7.6% coverage in the 18-45 age group.Though Tamil Nadu is also among states that has covered less than 20% of adults, it has managed to a vaccinate a higher share (9.1%) of the 18-45 age group than these six states.The vaccination of the 45+ age group appears to be a good barometer for overall coverage as it has a direct correlation with the share of overall eligible population given the first dose. The top 11 of the 23 regions for which population projections are available are also the top 11 regions in coverage of the 45+ age group, although their precise ranks may vary slightly. Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, for instance, are 7th and 10th in covering their overall eligible population, but 3rd and 4th in covering their 45+ group.However, there is poor correlation between the coverage of the overall population and the 18-45 group. For instance, Chhattisgarh, which is 10th in overall coverage, has vaccinated the least share of its 18-45 age group among all the 23 regions.This anomaly in vaccinating the 18-45 age group is evident in the wide variation in the share of doses given to the 18-45 population with respect to the share of the age group in the eligible population. MP, for instance, has given 39% of its doses to this younger age group, which has a share of 65% in the eligible population. In other words, it has given 0.59 times doses to the 18-45 age group relative to its share in population. This relative share is 0.14 for Chhattisgarh. The highest relative share of vaccinating the 18-45 age group (0.65 in Tamil Nadu) is 4.7 times than the lowest (0.14 in Chhattisgarh). The difference between regions in the relative share of vaccinating the 45+ age group is much less; the highest (2.6 in Chhattisgarh) is only 1.8 times the lowest (1.5 in Tamil Nadu). To be sure, this relative share is bound to be higher for the older age group in all states simply because this is the segment that became eligible for vaccination on March 1 (60+) , and then, subsequently, on April 1 (45+). The 18-45 segment became eligible for vaccines only on May 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wide-variation-in-coverage-across-states-marks-india-s-vaccine-drive-101623264009894.html
10-06-2021||India||Two notorious gangsters from Punjab gunned down by Bengal STF near Kolkata||Two notorious gangsters from Punjab, who were wanted for multiple crimes, were killed in an encounter with the Special Task Force (STF) of the West Bengal Police in the eastern outskirts of Kolkata around 3.40 pm on Wednesday, police said. One of the criminals was suspected to be Jaipal Singh Bhullar who was involved in the murder of police personnel in Ludhiana on May 15. The second gangster was reportedly identified as Jaspreet Jassi. They were allegedly involved in smuggling of firearms and explosives. The Bengal Police did not make any official statement till 5.15 pm The criminals were hiding in a rented apartment at a posh multi-storeyed residential complex in New Town area. A police officer was injured when the criminals opened fire. A huge police contingent was deployed in and around the complex since it was suspected that the slain gangsters could have had associates who might have slipped out during the encounter. All roads were sealed. The West Bengal Police was in touch with their counterparts in Punjab. Police officials said the STF got information about the Punjab gangsters from two men who were arrested near Siuri in Birbhum district on Sunday while they were trying to smuggle in a consignment of explosives and 9 mm pistols from Bihar. STF personnel are examining footage captured by security cameras installed inside the complex to find more details about the movements of the slain duo. The injured STF officer, Kartick Mohan Ghosh, was shot in the shoulder. He was rushed to AMRI Hospital in Salt Lake. He lost a lot of blood, said an officer. Jaipal Singh Bhullar, alias Manjit Singh, was the son of a retired assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of Punjab police. He was wanted in several states including Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh in connection with more than 45 cases involving murder, kidnapping, robbery and smuggling. He was earlier a sportsman. Bhullar, who carried a price on his head, was known for indiscriminate use of firearms. He and three others were involved in the killings of two Punjab police ASIs at New Grain Market in Jagraon, Ludhiana on May 15. Bhullar and his associates were living in a second floor apartment at Sukhobristi, a complex built by the Shapoorji Pallonji Group. After the encounter, residents told the media that although this was the first shootout inside the complex, in the past the state and Kolkata police had arrested some criminals. “Many apartment owners do not even live in Kolkata. They rent out properties without checking the background of the tenants. The issue has been raised by the residents’ society several times,” said a resident who did not want to be identified. Tapas Chatterjee, the local Trinamool Congress legislator, visited the spot and assured the residents that their safety would be ensured by the administration. “I will not make any statement on the shootout. It is a police matter,” he said. “The Punjab police have confirmed that the deceased are Jaipal and Jaspreet who had rewards of ₹10 and 5 lakhs respectively on their heads. We were on the lookout for quite some time and were in touch with several agencies, including the Punjab Police. The two were being hunted for the killings of two policemen on May 15. We went to the apartment to arrest them but had to open fire in self defence when they fired at us, injuring an inspector,” Vineet Goyal, additional director general of police, West Bengal STF, said at 7.30 pm. “We have recovered around ₹7 lakh in cash, five sophisticated pistols, including Glocks, and 89 rounds of unfired ammunition from the apartment,” Goyal said. “We cannot say right now how many shots were fired during the shootout,” he added. “The two criminals were wanted in connection with numerous crimes committed since 2016. They killed a politician as well. A Punjab Police team has arrived in the state just now. The West Bengal CID and bomb disposal squad have been deployed. The apartment is being searched as the criminals could have hidden explosives there,” Goyal said. “Since the shootout took place in Bengal, a case will be registered here. The operation was carried out entirely by the state STF,” he added. The bodies were removed from the apartment around 7.45 pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-notorious-gangsters-from-punjab-gunned-down-by-bengal-stf-near-kolkata-101623245288080.html

10-06-2021||India||Let’s cooperate, not confront each other, says Chinese envoy||India and China should cooperate, not confront each other, and resolve differences over the border dispute through consultation and dialogue, the Chinese ambassador to New Delhi Sun Weidong has said. Sun called the dispute a legacy of history and added the boundary question should be kept in the “right place” in the bilateral ties between the two countries.“It is normal for countries to have differences. Border disputes are a legacy of history and should be placed in the right place in bilateral relations,” Sun said. He added that Beijing believes in resolving border disputes through dialogue and consultation.“At the same time, our determination to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests is unwavering. China and India should respect each other, treat each other equally, engage in dialogue and consultation, and properly resolve their differences to find a solution acceptable to both sides,” Sun said during an online interaction with Indian youth leaders on Tuesday.Sun added that China and India should concentrate on dealing with the pandemic and reviving the economy.His comments came in the backdrop of the ongoing border friction along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.India has said in recent months that complete disengagement at all friction points on the LAC and peace and tranquillity in the border areas alone can lead to normalisation of ties in other spheres such as trade and investment.Speaking to external affairs minister S Jaishankar in late February, Chinese state councillor and foreign minister, Wang Yi, similarly said the border dispute between India and China is a reality, should be taken seriously but should also be placed at an appropriate position in bilateral ties.New Delhi has told Beijing that it cannot be business as usual, and the border dispute cannot be swept under the carpet until full disengagement is completed at friction points.During his interaction, Sun responded to a question on the inability of thousands of stranded Indian students to return to China because of the pandemic. Sun gave no assurance about their return to China, indicating they have to continue online studies in the foreseeable future. He said relevant universities are expected to maintain close contact with overseas students, make arrangements for online teaching, and properly handle their legitimate concerns and demands.A majority of the 23,000 Indian students studying in China have been unable to return because the Chinese government has not yet allowed foreign students to resume physical classes.Sun indicated that China is unlikely to normalise international travel with India anytime soon. He added international travel increases the risk of Covid-19 infection spreading to the countries of destination.He gave the example of the recent spike in Covid-19 cases in the southern trade hub of Guangzhou.Like other countries around the world, China is also formulating its own pandemic prevention measures, he said, adding that both Chinese and foreigners are expected to comply with those rules.Sun spoke about China’s offer to help India fight the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. He added China “did not stand idly by” in assisting its neighbour.China was one of the first countries to offer support and assistance to India and one of the first to act, he said.India has not accepted direct aid from Beijing but has not restricted private companies and traders from sourcing medical equipment and material from Chinese companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lets-cooperate-not-confront-each-other-china-to-india-101623211970843.html

10-06-2021||Today's||At G7, an agenda for the future||Nothing could provide more compelling or tragic proof of the necessity of global cooperation than the pandemic which has swept the world and claimed over 3.7 million lives.For the first time since the onset of this catastrophe, leaders of the G7 will meet in person on June 11 for a summit that I will chair in Cornwall in the United Kingdom (UK). I have also invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the leaders of Australia, South Korea and South Africa, allowing a broader gathering of fellow democracies and free societies.Our shared task is to overcome the pandemic, minimise the risk of any recurrence and build back better after this tragedy.Around the table in Cornwall, in-person and virtually, will be the world’s biggest and most advanced economies, ready to deploy our capabilities and expertise against a common enemy.Also Read | Johnson, Biden to hold first in-person meeting ahead of G7 Leaders’ SummitThe genius and perseverance of our scientists have given us safe and effective vaccines against Covid-19. Now our most pressing task is to use them to protect humanity as swiftly as possible.The UK helped to establish Covax, the global alliance that has so far supplied 80 million doses to developing countries. Almost all have been the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, developed with British government support — using expertise from every part of the UK — precisely so that it would be cheap to administer and easy to store, capable of protecting the maximum number of people worldwide.Britain has contributed £548 million to Covax and we will also donate the vast majority of any surplus doses from our domestic vaccination programme.But in the heat of emergency, we must all strive even harder. So I want the G7 to adopt an exacting yet profoundly necessary target— to provide one billion doses to developing countries in order to vaccinate everyone in the world by the end of next year.Nothing like this has ever been tried before and if you doubt whether it can be done, I would urge you to take heart from the unprecedented feats already achieved in the adversity of this pandemic. Our scientists devised vaccines against Covid-19 faster than any disease had ever been overcome before. Britain and many other countries are inoculating their populations more swiftly than anyone thought possible.Now we must bring the same spirit of urgency and ingenuity to a global endeavour to protect humanity everywhere. It can be done, it must be done — and this G7 summit should resolve that it will be done.But the reality is that even if we succeed, our efforts would count for little if another lethal virus were to emerge and inflict disaster all over again.So we need to strengthen our collective ability to prevent another pandemic and provide early warning of future threats, including by creating a network of surveillance centres — a Global Pandemic Radar.Our scientists took just 300 days to crack Covid and produce the vaccines, many manufactured in India, but we need to be able to respond even more rapidly. This G7 summit will begin a new effort to accelerate the development of vaccines, treatments and tests for any new virus from 300 to 100 days.Even as we minimise the risk of another catastrophe, we have an obligation to ensure that something good might come from today’s ordeal. We must build back better with a global economic recovery based on greener and fairer foundations.It remains a moral outrage — and a grave impediment to economic growth — that millions of girls around the world are denied an education, holding back the development of entire societies. Our shared goal must be to get another 40 million girls into school by 2025. I will ask the G7 and our guests to contribute more towards the Global Partnership for Education’s target of raising $5 billion for schools in the developing world.As more children enter classrooms, we must create jobs to match their talent and safeguard the environment they will inherit. The G7 can take forward both aims by supporting a green industrial revolution and promising to halve our carbon emissions by 2030, in order to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees.We will bring the world together to strive towards this essential goal when the UK hosts the COP26 conference in Glasgow in November. In the meantime, I want the G7 to safeguard biodiversity for future generations by pledging to protect at least 30% of our land and oceans by 2030. We’re already partnering closely with India on this crucial issue.And we should offer developing countries the high quality and transparent investment they need to build clean and green national infrastructure, turbocharging their economies.This is a compelling agenda for global recovery, ambitious yet achievable, provided we summon the will and the ingenuity. Britain is privileged to chair the G7 and to play our part, alongside our kindred democracies, in setting this immense effort in train. The scale of the challenge demands no less.Boris Johnson is Prime Minister of the United KingdomThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/at-g7-an-agenda-for-the-future-101623331157147.html
10-06-2021||Today's||Is the global pharma industry unhappy with India’s policies?||The Drugs Controller General of India, on January 3, granted restricted emergency use authorisation (EUA) for two Covid-19 vaccines — Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Serum Institute of India’s Covishield. Covaxin, developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology in collaboration with Bharat Biotech, is India’s first indigenous vaccine against Covid-19. Covaxin has now received EUA from a range of countries and is in the process of obtaining it in 60 other countries. This is an important step by the scientific community to fulfill our dream of Atmanirbhar Bharat .But the real battle on vaccines had begun earlier, when the original proposal submitted by India and South Africa to the TRIPS Council on October 2 emphasised the need for World Trade Organization (WTO) members to work together to ensure that intellectual property rights (IPR) “such as patents, industrial designs, copyright and protection of undisclosed information” do not create barriers to timely access to affordable medical products. A patent waiver would allow any company with the required capacity to start manufacturing the shot, even without an agreement with the original developer. However, international developers of Covid-19 vaccines such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson opposed any waiver for their doses, claiming they were capable of producing adequate jabs to meet global demand. Pharmaceutical companies have reported sharp profit gains during the crisis. The industry’s biggest lobby group warned that this unprecedented step would undermine the response of companies and compromise safety. India then revised its proposal, to state that patent protections for vaccines be waived for a limited timeframe to address the concerns of the United States, European Union and others that opposed the original proposal. The Narendra Modi government made this proposal even before India had developed its indigenous vaccine, which it could manufacture and supply globally at a low cost. With India developing its indigenous vaccine, having the largest vaccine manufacturing capacity in the world, along with its stated intention to waive IPR, the threat to the global pharma industry, particularly to the limited number of companies with vaccine patents, became real. This was aggravated with India’s Vaccine Maitri initiative.India has been one of the pioneers for supply of cheap life-saving drugs under the compulsory licensing (CL) and process patent regime. Under CL, for the purpose of combating a health emergency, a WTO member is allowed to override a patent and “license” a domestic manufacturer to produce a global vaccine. But many experts pointed out that since Covid-19 is a global pandemic, the Indian government may not want to exercise its power under Section 92 and 100 of the Patent Act for manufacturing through CL.The government, in its affidavit to the Supreme Court, said, “It is earnestly urged that any discussion or a mention of exercise of statutory powers either for essential drugs or vaccines having patent issues would have serious, and unintended adverse consequences in the countries efforts on global platform.” Currently, the Centre is involved in finding a diplomatic solution, but it had not ruled out invoking the law at a future date.The best option is domestic manufacturing using an open licensing policy. The government has given permission to several domestic vaccine manufacturers to manufacture Covaxin. With an indigenously researched and produced vaccine catering to domestic and global demand, our pharma industry will come of age. This will also end the pharma industry’s dependence on manufacture and export of generic medicines alone.The world-class Indian vaccine, with several vaccine manufacturers and an open licence, is attractive for several countries, particularly in the developing world. Indian pharma industry will gain immensely and our country will stand out as a nation helping at the time of need. But dominant global pharma companies stand to lose billions of dollars in profits due to the policies followed and stand taken by the Modi government and this is a strong enough reason for them to be unhappy.Gopal Krishna Agarwal is national spokesperson of the BJPThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/is-the-global-pharma-industry-unhappy-with-india-s-policies-101623330498111.html
10-06-2021||Today's||The Taste with Vir Sanghvi: The Politician as Careerist||Can you think of a time when Indian politics has been more polarised than it is today? I certainly can’t. Yes, there have been times when political parties have vigorously opposed each other but it has mostly been in the spirit of domestic competition.But today, the battle is more fundamental. The problem with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress tells us, is that it is opposed to the very idea of India. According to it, to allow the BJP to continue in power would be to give up on the idea of a diverse, pluralistic nation committed to liberal values.For its part, the BJP is as extreme in its characterisation of its political opponent. The Congress is no longer a political party, it says. It is a family business run by a greedy and corrupt dynasty that has robbed India through the ages while consistently betraying our national interest. The only way for India to become a great nation, the BJP tells us, is to work towards a Congress-mukt Bharat.You would think that with this level of hostility and such a clear divide between the two sides, members of either party would stay far away from each other, that the differences would be sharp and all-pervasive.You would be wrong.In reality, there has never been a time when there is so much mobility between parties. The Congressmen who accuse the BJP of destroying the secular fabric of the nation are quietly negotiating to join the very same BJP. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders who abandoned their party before the Bengal election, heeding Amit Shah’s call that Mamata Banerjee was destroying the state are now negotiating the terms of their exits from the BJP and their re-admittance into the TMC. And even as the BJP condemns opposition politicians as being part of the dynastic Lutyens’ cabal that destroyed India, it is simultaneously offering them plum posts if they are willing to change sides.It has now got to the stage where it is regarded as vital for all political parties to squirrel away their legislators to expensive resort hotels to ensure that they cannot negotiate defections to other parties. Nobody regards this as odd. In fact, it is now perfectly normal.An ordinary voter may well wonder: What in God’s name is going on? I have often asked myself the same question. This week, when Jitin Prasada, who I know and like, crossed over to join the BJP, a party that he (and his family) had opposed for years on familiar grounds (communalist, deceitful), I began to look for answers again.The most reasoned and convincing explanation I found was in an article by Shashi Tharoor. The Congress leader made a basic point that we often lose sight of. Yes, politics can become a career. But it is fundamentally different from becoming, say, a banker or a salesman because you don’t choose your party as you would choose your employer.If you are a banker, you might start out at say, the State Bank of India (SBI) and then, if you feel your prospects are better at HDFC, you might abandon the SBI and join HDFC. That’s fine. It is how career professionals are expected to behave. (The idea is Shashi’s but the examples are my own).When you enter politics, however, you join a political party based not on your career prospects but on your values and beliefs. If you agree with Karl Marx, you join the Communists. If you believe in Hindutva, then the BJP is the party for you. If you are committed to a liberal, secular idea of India, you join the Congress. And so on.If, after that, your career stalls or your party falters, then you try and change things from within. If that is not possible, you can sit out the bad period or you can perhaps join a breakaway faction of your party.That is how it has been in Indian politics for decades. If you don’t like the BJP’s current leadership, you don’t suddenly turn your back on Hindutva and decide that your prospects are better in say, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or the Congress. You stick by your core beliefs, no matter how badly your career is going.Indian politics is full of examples where a disgruntled faction within a party has broken away. The CPM emerged out of the CPI. The Trinamool Congress is a breakaway faction of the Congress. The Janata Dal has splintered into many parties.In none of these cases did any of the breakaway factions consider merging with an ideological enemy. The CPM did not approach the Congress. When Sharad Pawar, P Sangma and other Congressmen had problems with Sonia Gandhi, they formed the Nationalist Congress Party. They did not go and join the Shiv Sena.This is not a peculiarly Indian way of doing things. This is how the democratic system works the world over. People do sometimes change parties but it is rare and usually provokes great consternation. Hardly ever does a senior politician jump from one party to its ideological opposite.In India, there are occasions when differences between the ideologies of parties are minor and the parties are defined by their leaders. In such cases, you can perhaps understand how a politician can change parties. But that is certainly not true of major parties today. As we have seen, never before has the gulf been so wide.So why do people switch sides so easily? How do they so quickly abandon the beliefs they have sworn by for decades?The only answer possible is the one that Tharoor suggests. Things have reached such a pass in India that even among our brightest politicians, politics is no longer about values or beliefs. It is now no more than a career. Like the chap who is not getting very far at SBI and decides to join HDFC, our politicians treat personal advancement as the ultimate goal. Ideology is only for sloganeering and rhetoric – which they can promptly disown later.You don’t have to be a genius to see that a country whose political system is staffed by people who regard their own career prospects as more important than values or any beliefs is in a bad way.Yes, there will be fewer defections from cadre-based parties like the BJP and the CPM. But how ideologically solid can the cadre of any party be if it is repeatedly infiltrated by newcomers who don’t care about ideology and are only focused on their own advancement?I don’t expect India’s politicians to worry too much about what their desire for career advancement is doing to the country. But what about the rest of us? What about the media in particular?We have effortlessly sunk to a level where even the media regards defections as no more than a game. Each change of party is reported with the breathless excitement normally reserved for an IPL match. Nobody even talks about the betrayal of values, of ideology that each defection represents. At a time when Indian politics is most polarised, we treat it as entirely normal that people should be able to walk across to the other side only because they are getting a better deal.They say that a country gets the politicians it deserves. That’s too harsh. But yes, when we expect no ideological integrity from our politicians and accept that their only purpose in life is to get the best deal for themselves, then our country is in very deep trouble indeed.For more stories by Vir Sanghvi read here||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-taste-with-vir-sanghvi-the-politician-as-careerist-101623320614002.html
10-06-2021||Today's||India’s PACK challenge requires a political response||Call it PACK — a strategic spread of interlinked geographies, comprising Pakistan, Afghanistan, China and Kashmir. With territorial disputes, political instability, religious radicalism, popular aspirations and great power dynamics as key issues, PACK is forcing a long game on India. Playing it well requires both resources as well as a concerted political approach at the top level. The latter is key. How is New Delhi faring?Pakistan is speaking a new language of geoeconomics and a trade-fronted regional policy. This merits cautious interest from New Delhi, indications of which are evident. The aggressive rhetoric that preceded and followed the August 5, 2019, decisions died down as the ceasefire announcement neared. Oddly, the military-logistical joint statement, released on February 25, also referred to the two director general of military operations (DGMOs) agreeing to “address each other’s core issues and concerns which have propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence”. This was a political element, and it is not clear why it was inserted there.Also Read | US mulls authorising airstrikes in Afghanistan if country falls into crisisNevertheless, optics and remarks suggest something is in the works. On his visit to the United States (US) last month, external affairs minister (EAM) S Jaishankar mentioned the “bigger issues” with Pakistan that need addressing, noting that “everybody hopes for the best”.So is a fresh Pakistan policy in the offing? With stray unofficial remarks and no political statement, we know very little while the Indo-Pak bazaar of speculation flourishes. Compare this with Pakistan, where Prime Minister (PM) Imran Khan has clearly laid out the conditions for engagement with India. Why the opacity at the top level in New Delhi? Is there a concern about a backlash from domestic actors? Or is it because there is no desire to risk the embarrassment that followed the Lahore touchdown of December 2015?In Afghanistan, the Taliban consider themselves victorious. The graph of their recent gains suggests that they will likely shape the nature of the Kabul regime within the coming year. To India, Afghanistan is a stellar example of its commitment to political and societal modernisation of a country carried out with voluntary participation of its citizens. Given this, India’s stake in the nature of the coming Afghan regime is robustly legitimate. New Delhi has fittingly spelt out its preference — a constitutional and democratic regime that protects the rights of women and minorities. Jaishankar has articulated this position, saying that the gains of two decades must not be lost to political expediency.The position is politically bold and desirable. And to say that it befitted a stronger articulation or reiteration from the PM in no way minimises the status and standing of EAM. But the informed Indian citizen must wonder why it hasn’t been coming. Is it because this endorsement of a liberal democracy abroad — with an unequivocal commitment to minority rights — sits oddly with the project at home? Isn’t it more urgent given reports that India has begun engaging with the Taliban? New Delhi may also want to consider that its stated concern for the rights of South Asian minorities — a central tenet of liberalism — when contrasted with what is widely perceived to be the a systematic marginalisation of its own minorities, erodes its standing.On Kashmir, the decisions of August 2019 were about securing an ideological goal. Their impact on the security of national interest will become clear in the coming years, even as Kashmir moves from lockdown to lockdown. Generic terms such as development, peace and integration with the rest of the country are understandable, but it is not clear what New Delhi considers a new and sustainable Kashmiri equilibrium, one where all Kashmiris feel included, within the larger PACK matrix.However, it is on China that the trajectory of the political approach and leadership has been most telling. Assurance has been given that no territory would be lost on the government’s watch. Bravery of soldiers has been rightly praised in addresses to citizens. Regime partisans speak of India having stared China down. All this against the backdrop of the fact that we don’t even have a complete official account of what has transpired on the ground.On the China policy, the core problem remains unaddressed — the collapse of bilateral political understanding forged at the highest level in Ahmedabad, Wuhan and Mamallapuram. Instead, we have seen a tactical approach focused on the eastern Ladakh situation articulated and/or executed by the national security, military, and diplomatic establishments. In the seeming absence of a political approach and leadership, bilateral relations drift while new facts advantageous to the Chinese are reportedly getting entrenched on the ground.Aversion to political risk and hedging in the face of flux are common to leaderships. But the opportunities and challenges presented by PACK demand a concerted approach and visible leadership at the top political level. With over a year gone, it is time for PM Narendra Modi to set out his government’s efforts at securing India’s national interest vis-à-vis China. The Afghan position, if articulated by him, would relieve many at home and abroad. Risks with Pakistan won’t be new, but they shouldn’t cost him much given the popular support. And everyone needs an inclusive and representative Kashmir vision.Atul Mishra teaches international relations at Shiv Nadar University.

10-06-2021||Today's||Decoding the BJP’s meltdown in Bengal and the way forward||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is going through a meltdown in West Bengal. This unravelling is as baffling as was its relatively poor showing in the polls. On the latter, one may argue that the party was a victim of its own hype. Otherwise, increasing its tally from three to 77 sears was impressive by any standard. But subsequent events have exposed the hollow foundations on which the party had built its castle of sand.Neither BJP supporters nor political commentators had anticipated such a debacle. The high-voltage campaign, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, had swept everyone off their feet. But even fewer people had expected the collapse of the BJP West Bengal state unit post the elections. Nor could they imagine the reverse exodus to Trinamool Congress that followed.The leadership vacuumToday, the BJP is almost faceless in Bengal. Paratroopers who came from the BJP headquarters in Delhi took the first flight out. BJP’s state president, Dilip Ghosh, who was sulking even before the elections, has gone out of sight. Other stalwarts such as Mukul Roy are maintaining an enigmatic silence. Rajib Banerjee, another big-ticket acquisition, is raising eyebrows with cryptic social media posts. Swapan Dasgupta, seen as a probable chief ministerial candidate, was quick to reclaim his seat in the Rajya Sabha.Also Read | Adhikari meets Shah, Nadda over Bengal violence; TMC turncoats trouble state BJPPost-poll revenge violence has sent old BJP-Sangh ground workers and grassroots leaders underground. Sidelined before the elections, they are now feeling orphaned.And so the only leader who is displaying some energy is Suvendu Adhikari, who earned his spurs as the “Giant killer of Nandigram” and has been anointed as leader of opposition.In such a scenario, cynics quip, the governor is now the most visible face of the Opposition in the state. The descent of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) has raised questions. Reopening old cases against Trinamool Congress leaders smack of proxy action by the Centre.Be that as it may, the void in BJP’s state leadership is obvious to all. BJP’s reaction in West Bengal is comparable to that of Congress after its rout in 2014 and 2019.Explaining the BJP’s drift and responseBut remember, West Bengal is not the only loss BJP has suffered under the leadership of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. Delhi in 2015 and 2020, Bihar in 2015 and Rajasthan 2018 are cases in point. So, why is it that BJP is finding it so hard to digest the Bengal verdict? A few theories are doing the rounds in political circles. But none of the arguments are compelling.One view is that, in her third term, Mamata Banerjee may become the pivot of opposition unity. That would make her a credible challenger to Narendra Modi in 2024.The second explanation is that the debacle has upset Modi-Shah’s calculations for 2024. They were counting on improving upon the 2019 tally of Lok Sabha seats from Bengal. That would have helped them to offset possible losses in other states. Now, it looks like a tall task.The third explanation is that the timing of the Bengal setback could not have been worse for Narendra Modi. It coincided with the surge of the Covid-19 second wave and the devastating oxygen crisis. The economy, which was on a slow recovery path, suffered a fresh jolt. The farmer agitation is still simmering. All this, one reckoned, put Modi-Shah on the defensive within the BJP-RSS ecosystem. Some are quick to read manifestations of it in the reported rumbles in Uttar Pradesh.The fourth conjecture is about Mamata Banerjee’s constant confrontation with the Centre. Emboldened by the massive victory, she would only step-up the ante. Her frequent fulminations, bordering on intransigence, are bound to bother the PM and settle established federal equations.But none of these arguments can explain the existential crisis BJP is facing in West Bengal nor its subsequent actions. The party’s current course of action will neither weaken Banerjee nor equip the BJP to get battle ready for 2024. The state leadership is missing in action. The central leadership appears to be taking a hands-off approach. Most worrying is the lack of a discernible way forward strategy. This has left the old BJP cadres in the dark to fend for themselves.For the BJP, a choiceThe party is at crossroads. To salvage lost ground it has two options. First, go back to the drawing board and rebuild the organisation from scratch, the RSS way. The second, give Suvendu Adhikari a free-reign and support him for a quick ramp-up.The BJP of yore would have opted for the former option (a return to the roots), even if it is a slow and long haul. But the current leadership does not have either the patience or luxury of time. Taking the second approach (backing Adhikari fully) would have a high risk quotient — of alienating older cadres and making the party seem Trinamool’s B team.So, it is Hobson’s choice. But the BJP is not a party to sit idle. Victory or defeat, its wheels never stop. But it needs to settle the leadership equations in the state, evolve a calibrated but robust strategy to take on the state government, and make some hard choices, soon.Sandip Ghose is a political observer and commentator on current affairsThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/decoding-the-bjp-s-meltdown-in-bengal-and-the-way-forward-101623319455296.html
10-06-2021||Editorials||For the BJP, the post-poll challenge||Electoral defeats are hard. During a campaign, a party invests all its energy, resources, networks and organisational might in securing victory, vote by vote, polling booth by polling booth, constituency by constituency. To keep up the morale of workers and to sustain a degree of motivation, a party also convinces itself that it is on the verge of victory. And that is why when the results are adverse, and a party confronts a loss or less-than-optimal performance, all equations get unsettled. There is a familiar blame-game between units of the party. Top leaders are questioned on strategy and tactics. Others begin weighing their future prospects and shift allegiances. Workers worry about protection in politically competitive, even violent, settings. And the party in power, emboldened by victory, deploys all means to crush a party that is already bruised to be able to weaken a competitor when the time is ripe.This is a familiar story in Indian politics. And the prime example, nationally, is the Congress after its 2014 and 2019 losses. But since its defeat in West Bengal and rout in Kerala, the BJP appears to be going through a similar pattern. In Kerala, the party faces questions about its sources and modalities of funding and charges of bribing of candidates, with the police officially pursuing investigations against the party’s state unit chief. In West Bengal, the BJP first bore the brunt of post-electoral violence by Trinamool Congress cadres, witnessed internal fractures among state leaders, and went on a collision course against the newly elected state government.But while post-electoral disequilibrium is often understandable in a party, the way out is to go back to the roots, review the reasons for defeat, let an elected government function while remaining a vigilant opposition, and get its house in order. That may be a lesson for the BJP in the south and the east.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/for-the-bjp-the-post-poll-challenge-101623330076721.html
10-06-2021||Editorials||A vision for Delhi-2041||The draft Master Plan of Delhi (MPD)-2041, which was put up for public scrutiny on Wednesday, envisages building sustainable infrastructure that will help the national Capital reduce local sources of pollution such as dust from construction sites and vehicular emissions. It also aims to redevelop the city’s “green and blue” assets by protecting forest cover, rejuvenating the Yamuna and preserving its flood-plains, securing and recharging other water bodies, and restricting development near and on such ecologically critical sites. MPD also aspires to tackle the depleting number of trees (Delhi is yet to have a tree census) and identify unique tree corridors or precincts, heritage trees, precincts with high carbon storage, and sequestration rates. The document, which will provide a “strategic” and “enabling” framework to guide the growth of the city till 2041, builds on the lessons learnt from implementation of the previous plans of 1962, 2001 and 2021. The Delhi Development Authority is the anchor agency for MPD.Also Read | In Delhi, 11 unpredictable monthsThe draft plan has, rightly, focussed on environmental degradation and mitigating strategies. According to the planning department of the city, Delhi’s top environmental concerns include pollution of all kinds — air (especially in the winter months), water, domestic and industrial wastewater, and vehicular — and lack of adequate solid and hospital waste management. Then there is the climate crisis, which is impacting weather patterns and turning the Capital into an urban heat island. All of this is having a deeply detrimental impact on public health and well-being.Delhi is not just the national Capital. It is a key economic hub and a centre for students, young professionals and poor migrant workers, among others. MPD is forward-looking and acknowledges that the city’s environmental crisis could impact its economic growth, make it less attractive for citizens and new talent, and negatively impact its human development indicators. Once cleared, the real challenge of MPD will be the implementation of the plans and their monitoring. A recent analysis shows that 43 of the world’s 100 most environmentally vulnerable cities are in India. Delhi has been ranked the second-highest risk city in the world (after Jakarta). India’s growth trajectory is increasingly being defined by cities that contribute 60% of GDP. Therefore, they must be made future-ready, and the best way to do that is by weaving in environmental resilience into their development plans, as many world cities are doing. MPD’s focus on green and blue assets can be a beneficial template for other Indian cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-vision-for-delhi2041-101623327196461.html
