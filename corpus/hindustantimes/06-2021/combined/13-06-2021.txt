From June 15 onwards, a majority of schools start their academic year.For parent Sangeeta Mundada, it’s not as difficult as last year. “We are quite well prepared for this year. My younger son is in Class 3 and the older daughter in Class 8. Last year, we all were confused and worried, as we didn’t know how the school was going to operate, as Covid was new for us. Comparatively, this time, we are ready. Even the children have become used to online classes and study patterns. High school fees need to be cut down this time,” she said.Pankaj Shete, also a parent, said, “Though the schools are starting online, study material is all physical, like text books and stationery items. The lockdown in Pune has just ended and there is a heavy rush at the Appa Balwant chowk book market to buy school-related things. Some of the textbooks of my son’s Class 5 are not available. The lockdown of the last two months is now impacting the academics as well.”Shaurya Somavanshi, who is in Class 9 this year, said, “We are eagerly waiting to go back to school physically. We are fed up of online classes. Initially, it was good, but later on it started to get irritating. Most importantly, the feel of the actual school campus, meeting friends, that enjoyment and atmosphere cannot be replaced online.”Winifred Bhalerao, principal, St Paul’s high school, said, “All our preparations for starting the school from June 15 are set and we have already given instructions to students and their parents for the same. It will be much easier for both teachers and students this time, as we are already into online teaching, classes and exams for the last one year. We have kept the online classes the same, at five hours every day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/schools-set-to-reopen-for-new-academic-year-online-101623608318587.html

He also said that it would be inappropriate to comment on the restarting of local train services in Mumbai, as of now. Wadettiwar pointed out that in some districts Covid numbers have slightly increased after relaxations. “Saturday’s daily Covid numbers in Maharashtra indicated more fresh cases than those that had recovered. I cannot comment on restarting local trains as of now. Let’s monitor the situation for the next eight days,” Wadettiwar said, addressing a press conference in Pune. On June 4, the state government rolled out a five-level unlocking plan for Maharashtra after the Covid curve in many districts showed a downward trend. The levels of relaxations were decided on two parameters, positivity rate and occupancy of oxygen beds. Covid curbs have since been eased in various administrative units by local authorities from June 6“In some districts, the caseload has slightly increased after the relaxations. If cases increase again then restrictions will have to be increased,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/if-covid-cases-rise-again-restrictions-will-be-reimposed-wadettiwar-101623608319212.html

Instead, we are politely telling them to go back as all the sight-seeing spots are not open, as per orders. We are only allowing people who have hotel bookings or have their houses here, to stay. For them as well, sight-seeing is not allowed,” said Dilip Pawar, senior inspector in charge of Lonavla city police station.On Sunday, when HT visited Lonavla, it faced two traffic jams at separate locations, 30 minutes each. The first was at the Bhagwan Mahavir Swami chowk -- a locality in the heart of the Lonavla, famous for its chikki shops; the second jam was on the road leading toward INS Shivaji.Among the sight-seers that had got in, no social distancing was followed and most were flouting the mask rule as well.“The rush is unbearable. Most of them are travelling with families and if they don’t wear masks in their cars we cannot fine them. Individually, they should maintain Covid norms,” said Pavan Tayde, police constable, Lonavla city police.Currently Lonavla and other rural parts of Pune district are under level 4 of the restrictions as the positivity rate is not below 10%.As per the norms of level 4, non-essential shops are still closed, and essential shops are permitted to remain open for a limited time.These levels of restrictions set by the state administration are defined by two factors - positivity rate and the occupancy of oxygen beds.The positivity rate in Lonavla is 15%. It was 22% on June 4.“Every day cases are going down. Residents of the city are hoping they will soon see more relaxations,” said Dr Sourabh Gharde, medical officer, urban primary health centre, Lonavla.For the police, handling the situation is becoming difficult because there are no orders restricting people from entering the city. The order is only for sight-seeing spots to be closed.“If we receive an order saying no outsider will be allowed, then it will help us to control the tourist movement,” said Satish Panchal, police constable rural police.Somnath Jadhav, chief executive officer (CEO), Lonavala municipal council, said, “Looking at the situation of the last two days, we will be increasing the number of check posts at the entry and exit point of the hill station.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lonavla-police-opt-for-no-entry-rather-than-fines-as-sight-seers-flock-to-hill-station-101623608317796.html

Moreover, there has been an overall increase in the number of testing within Thane city. This has had an impact on the daily positive cases as well. During the peak of the second wave, testing in Thane was around 10,000 daily. This figure reduced to around 2,000 daily during the lockdown as fewer people started venturing out. The figures have now risen to more than 4,000 tests daily. “We have increased the testing within the city as people have started to step out of their homes. The lockdown had resulted in fewer people turning up for testing, hence we had fewer testing numbers. Now, we are gradually increasing the testing, as many are returning to their jobs from the villages or other states, this has led to an increased crowd for testing at Thane station,” said a senior officer from TMC.“With hotels and shops getting permission to open up and the probability of malls as well, to open soon, many who work in these establishments are returning in the hope to be back on their jobs. This has probably led to an increase in people at the railway station for testing,” said Dhananjay Singh, founder, Rudra Pratishthan, an organisation that works for the welfare of the north Indian community in Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thane-station-sees-crowds-civic-body-increases-testing-101623607776962.html
13-06-2021||Mumbai||Activists want lady doctors for female inmates of prisons, Bombay HC says only if need genuine||While observing that “there is no requirement of law that lady inmates cannot be treated by male doctors,” the Bombay high court (HC) has asked the state government to consider sending female doctors to such prisons after it was informed that some of these prisoners were not comfortable sharing their problems with male doctors. Prof Vijay Raghavan from Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) who is assisting the HC in the suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) pertaining to the increase in death of prison inmates due to the second wave of Covid, sought visitation of female doctors on rotation basis said that he is only stressing on implementing the 2017 prison reforms wherein the health department has been asked to have a panel of female doctors to visit women’s prisons regularly.On June 10, the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the PIL was informed by Prof Raghavan of four major issues that were faced by jail inmates with regards to the availability of treatment and medical facilities in the jails across the state.Prof Raghavan pointed out that there was a shortage of doctors and paramedical staff in jails due to which inmates had to be taken to hospitals. He further stated that the unavailability of police escorts to take inmates to hospitals for treatment was delayed. He also added that apart from this there was also the issue of assigning female doctors for treating inmates of women’s prisons. In light of this, he sought regular visit of a female doctor from a civil hospital for inmates of women’s prisons. After perusing the compilation prepared by Dr Chhering Dorje, special inspector general of police (prisons), south region and hearing the submissions of advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni which assured the court of improvement in the condition of inmates as vaccination of inmates with and without comorbidities had started and many vacant posts of doctors and paramedical staff had been filled up, the court said that the schedule of MBBS doctors who would visit prisons on all seven days mentioned in the compilation would suffice to treat ailing patients. While addressing the issue raised by Prof Raghavan regarding lady doctors the court said, “There is no requirement of law that lady inmates cannot be treated by male doctors. However, we observe that if for any special reason a female inmate wishes to be attended by a female doctor and the prison authority is convinced that the request is genuine, the due requisition may be sent by the prison authorities to the health department for doing the needful.”Prof Raghavan while clarifying his request said, “I was only asking for implementation of the justice (retired) Dr S Radhakrishnan committee report on prison reforms. The committee had recommended that a panel of five doctors which included a gynaecologist and paediatrician should visit the prisons once a week for two hours. However, based on the HC directions the state has decided to send an MBBS doctor every day is also commendable.”He, however, added that the issue of lady doctors was something which inmates themselves sought as many of them were not comfortable while disclosing and discussing their medical problems with male doctors. “We have not come across any instance of lady doctors being uncomfortable while doing duty in prisons. On the contrary male doctors are hesitant to treat female inmates so much so that if there are complications they refer the inmate to a civil hospital rather than treating the inmate themselves,” said Prof Raghavan.Dr Dorje and Pradeep Vyas, the secretary health department did not respond to calls and messages for a comment on the issue.When asked about the observation of HC regarding there was ‘no requirement of law that lady inmates cannot be treated by male doctors’ activist and advocate Abha Singh said, “Lady doctors for female prisoners would be covered by article 21 of the Constitution on right to life which also envisages a right to live with dignity. If a woman inmate wants a female doctor and it is also observed that these inmates are more comfortable discussing their health issues with female doctors, then why should necessary amendments not be made in the law to make it into a requirement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/activists-want-lady-doctors-for-female-inmates-of-prisons-bombay-hc-says-only-if-need-genuine-101623607657583.html

13-06-2021||Noida||Noida: Migrant workers return, industrial units hope better production||NOIDA: With ease in Covid-19 curfew restrictions, the migrant workforce has started returning to the Gautam Budh Nagar district to their work. Entrepreneurs in the district said they hope for a better production period in coming times and if all goes well, the losses incurred due to the second wave of the pandemic can be compensated for in two months.Vipin Malhan, the president of the Noida Entrepreneurs’ Association (NEA), said most of the workers of industries in GB Nagar, who had gone to their hometowns and villages for Holi vacations in March, didn’t return as cases had started to rise around that time.“As per a rough estimate, the number of migrant workers in GB Nagar is around 0.75 million and over 50% of them either didn’t return after Holi or migrated back during the second wave. Now, with improvement in the situation, entrepreneurs have started calling them back and the workers are also responding very positively,” he said.Malhan, however, said that the enthusiasm of entrepreneurs might be a short-term affair due to the likelihood of a third wave. “Entrepreneurs are fighting half-heartedly at the moment, because they had never seen such huge losses or such unforeseen situations. We need at least two months to come out of losses incurred in the second wave as it was not a complete lockdown but a partial curfew. To compensate for the overall losses due to Covid-19, entrepreneurs need to work very hard for at least three years,” he said.Lalit Thukral, the president of Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NAEC), said that the dearth of workers in post-Holi time is not new. “Every year, workers go back home before Holi and usually return in mid-May, after the harvesting of Rabi crops in their villages. But this time, they didn’t remain in contact with their employers in fear of Covid-19. Now, however, they have started coming back and it will certainly increase the production of industries to their former strength in GB Nagar,” he said.When asked about impact on annual turnover, Thukral said that enthused with growing manpower in the apparel sector, overseas buyers have started floating orders.“Before the Covid-19 outbreak, the annual turnover of the apparel sector in the district was around ₹25,000 crore in the financial year 2019-20, which went down to ₹18,000 crore in fiscal 2020-21. If the response of overseas importers is any indication, it is expected to be ₹18,000 crore in the coming fiscal 2021-22,” he said.When contacted, Anil Kumar, the deputy commissioner of district industries centre, said the government is providing all support to entrepreneurs to help them exit the deficit faced since the Covid-19 outbreak.“The government is coming up with new plans to save lives as well as the livelihood of the people. We hope that very soon all industrial units in GB Nagar will start functioning to their full capacity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-migrant-workers-return-industrial-units-hope-better-production-101623607056934.html

As per medical experts, voluntary blood donations have reduced to a minimum since the second Covid wave hit the district in April this year.“Usually blood banks have enough stock as people voluntarily donate blood and we keep holding donation camps as well. But during pandemic situations, especially since April as cases increased, there was scarcity of blood. However, donations are carried out following all Covid protocols and especially since we are medical experts, utmost care is taken,” said Dr Satyam Arora, from Transfusion Medicine department at Child PGI.He added that before the second Covid wave, the department used to hold camps in rural areas and high-rise societies as well to encourage voluntary donations. Now the department has restarted holding donation camps.“As hospitals have also started opening non-Covid services, that include surgical procedures and patient treatments that were earlier suspended, there will be an increasing demand for blood. In such a scenario, without any voluntary donation, an acute shortage of blood can prevent procedures for those in need of life saving surgeries. Hence, people are encouraged to go out and donate blood,” said Dr Arora.The transfusion medicine department of the hospital recently held a small camp in Dadri village to gauge the response among people. “We held a small blood donation camp on June 10 in Dadri village and the response was good. There were 40 donors who came forward to donate blood in one day which was a good number, even during pre-pandemic days. This has encouraged us to hold more such camps which we will start from Monday,” said Dr Seema Gupta from the same department.She added that the department will also hold more such camps across Noida during this month in order to mark the World Donors Day 2021. On June 12, the department along with National Health Mission Blood Cell (UP) also organised an online educational event on transfusion medicine which was focused on latest updates in the field of transfusion medicine and blood banking. Over 150 medical experts attended the same from all over UP.“We have been raising awareness on social media and calling on people to donate blood. The blood bank at child PGI currently has 80 units of blood and supports patients of Thalassemia, cancer in children, cardiac surgery and newborn children requiring blood,” said Dr Arora.Dr Gupta added that people should be encouraged to donate blood before they get vaccinated.“Keeping in mind the vaccination drives happening across the district, our department is raising awareness on social media to urge people to donate blood two days before their vaccination appointment. This will help us avoid any blood unit scarcity,” she said.She further informed that Covid patients can donate blood 28 days after their recovery or discharge from hospital after a radiological and virological clearance.Meanwhile, the Rotary Blood bank in Noida will also observe the day by holding an in-house blood donation. “Our volunteers have been tasked to create awareness and encourage people to donate blood as we are holding an in-house blood donation camp at the Rotary Club on June 14 in order to mark the World Blood Donor day. However, there is still a lot of apprehension among people to donate blood. We have over 200 below poverty line (BPL) card holder patients of cancer and other diseases who require blood regularly from us, which is provided free of cost. But we have been struggling to provide them the same since the past two months as there have barely been any voluntary donations,” said Trilok Sharma, founder trustee of Rotary Blood Bank, Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/blood-donation-camps-restart-in-gb-nagar-as-covid-cases-decline-101623606997566.html

We have 62 teams at present, and we can take up the numbers to 150 to further increase our daily vaccination capacity by three times,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer of GB Nagar. According to figures of the UP health department till June 11, the GB Nagar district has a population of 356,345 in the age group of over 45 years, and it has vaccinated 326,233 people so far with a coverage of 91.55%.

13-06-2021||Noida||Man held for killing elderly parents for property||Ghaziabad The city police arrested a 40-year-old man on Sunday for allegedly killing his parents at their house in Balram Nagar area of Loni in Ghaziabad on Friday.The suspect, identified as Ravi Dhaka, owns a grocery shop in the locality. Earlier, he worked as a collection agent for online companies. According to the police, Ravi was miffed with his parents — 70-year-old Surendra Singh and his 63-year-old wife Santosh Singh — who were bent on transferring property ownership to the infant child and widow of their other son, Gaurav. Police said Gaurav had died in a road accident in 2019, and his wife had been taking care of his parents since then. During the investigation, police said they got initial clues from the neighbours who had told them that the suspect was allegedly not on good terms with his parents. “After the cremation, we interrogated Ravi, and he broke down and confessed to his crime. He said he had strangled both his parents around 10 am on Friday, before going to his shop that day. Usually, he returns by the afternoon to eat lunch and sleep, but that day, he did not go home and instead visited a neighbour’s house where he stayed till the evening. He wanted someone else to visit his house and inform the police about the murders,” the SP said. However, no one visited the house, and Ravi allegedly finally went to his house in the evening on Friday raised an alarm, after which the police reached there, the SP added.According to the police, it was a blind case, and the crime scene has been tampered with to make the incident look like a robbery and murder case. “The house was ransacked, suggesting that someone had entered there for robbery, and later, murdered the elderly couple. However, the entire situation seemed suspicious. The bodies had developed rigor mortis, which generally happens in eight-10 hours, indicating that the murders took place somewhere during the morning that day. Post-mortem reports also indicated almost similar time of deaths,” said Iraj Raja, superintendent of police (rural).Police said that Santosh was strangled first with a cloth, and Surendra was strangled with a wire later.The call records of the victims also revealed that they did not call anyone from their cellphone after 8.30am on Friday. Police said Ravi allegedly told the police that he felt neglected when he got to know that his parents wanted to transfer property ownership to his sister-in-law, who stayed in the same house. “Both Ravi’s sister-in-law, and wife were at their parents’ houses on the day of the murder. Taking advantage of this situation, Ravi, who was alone with his parents, killed them,” the SP added.A case was registered under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 302 (murder) against Ravi at the Loni Border police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-held-for-killing-elderly-parents-for-property-101623606636883.html
13-06-2021||Other||Punjab to link land record with foodgrain procurement||Chandigarh The Punjab government is set to integrate land record of farmers with foodgrain procurement from this kharif season. Farmers will get their payment (Minimum Support Price or MSP) for their produce (wheat and paddy) only when revenue record of their agriculture land is linked to the payment system. The Centre has asked the state government to implement the integration for kharif (paddy) procurement scheduled in October and November. In rabi (wheat) procurement season this year, the state government implemented the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system by transferring crop payment directly into farmers’ bank account. This bypassed the traditional system of routing payment through the arhtiyas (commission agents). Apprehending trouble from arhtiyas, the state government was reluctant to implement the DBT, but the Centre was firm that the system had to be introduced and executed. State government ministers had even met Union food and civil supplies minister Piyush Goyal, but failed to get relaxation on its implementation. Principal secretary finance KAP Sinha, who till recently also held the charge of principal secretary, food and civil supplies, said DBT was difficult and more tedious to impellent. “We have been able to implement that successfully. The next step is the integration of land record,” he said, adding that these steps were part of larger reforms in the procurement system. “It is a tedious process, but we have to implement it,” said a top officer of state food and civil supplies department. For implementing integration of land, the food department has to involve the revenue department which has details of land record of farmers. During wheat procurement, DBT showed that there were 9.5 lakh farmers in the state. The number, however, is expected to go up during paddy procurement as a greater number of farmers sell their produce to government agencies, unlike wheat, when private companies also make purchases.WHEAT RDF CONDITIONAL ON PADDY The Centre has not yet released the rural development fund (RDF) for wheat procurement that ended in May. The Centre wants Punjab to accept and implement the condition of integration of land record from this year’s paddy procurement season before giving clarity on the release of RDF. The state charges 3% RDF on wheat and paddy procured on the behalf of the Centre. During wheat procurement, the RDF was curtailed to 1%, and the Centre also asked Punjab to justify the higher rate of 3% A provisional cost-sheet sent to the state by Centre, last week, mentions accrual and other incidental expenses to be made to the state. “The cost sheet does not mention anything on the release of the RDF. The Centre wants Punjab to clear its stand on land record integration,” an officer of the food department said. With ₹25,500 crore disbursed to farmers for wheat procurement at MSP this season, the Centre owes Punjab ₹760 crore as RDF. “It is a substantial amount that will ease the state’s finances. We need it,” Sinha added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-to-link-land-record-with-foodgrain-procurement-101623606577499.html

Five members of the Dalit family, including a woman, were attacked allegedly by the local goons outside their house. Lucknow Commissioner of Police (CP) Dhruv Kant Thakur said an FIR was registered on the basis of a written complaint given by one of the victims, Bajrang Rawat, on Sunday morning. Those named in the FIR included Durga Yadav, his two sons Jai Prakash Yadav and Janaradan Yadav, Durga’s closest aide Raj Kumar Yadav, Raj Kumar’s brother Rajesh Yadav alias Raju and Ajay Yadav, he said. The CP said they have been booked under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 395 for dacoity, 397 for dacoity with attempt to cause grievous hurt, 504 for international insult, 506 for criminal intimidation as well as the charges of atrocities against Scheduled Caste (SC) people. He said the efforts are on to arrest all accused involved in the crime. Another senior police official said the presence of Rajesh Yadav has been found near the complainant Bajrang Rawat’s house when he and his family members were attacked on Saturday afternoon. “Rajesh Yadav’s presence at the spot hints the involvement of Durga Yadav and Raj Kumar Yadav, who are local land mafia of the area, behind the entire incident as they had old enmity with Bajrang Rawat,” he said. He said Durga Yadav, Raj Kumar and their aide Mahesh Verma were main accused in the murder of Bajrang Rawat’s father Beekha Ram Rawat on October 7, 2015, in a bid to grab their 2-bigha land. He said Durga and Raj Kumar were mounting pressure on Rawat and his family to compromise as they have been charge-sheeted in the murder case and are likely to be arrested. On Saturday, Bajrang, his brother Vishal and his wife Sarita and two relatives Dilip and Rajesh were injured in the attack. Of them, Rajesh suffered bullet wound on right side of the chest, Vishal suffered bullet injury in his palm while three others suffered severe injuries on their heads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/fir-against-local-land-mafia-others-for-attack-on-family-101623606517471.html

The deceased were identified as Sonu’s parents – Pratap Singh, 55 and Usha Devi, 50 – and a relative Satyapal Singh, 30. Rameshwar Kumar, station house officer of Beta 2 police station, said that the truck had broken down on the Agra-Greater Noida side of the expressway, around two kilometre from Zero Point in Greater Noida.“The truck driver had de-boarded the vehicle around 4:50am and was trying to fix it. Around the same time, the car, coming from Auraiya to Delhi via Greater Noida, hit the stationary truck,” he said. The accident was so severe that the car’s front portion was completely damaged and its occupants were trapped. Some passersby informed the police after which, a team from the Beta 2 police station was rushed, police said.

13-06-2021||Noida||UP govt to formulate rules for providing power connections in floodplain areas, says minister||NOIDA: The Uttar Pradesh government has planned to introduce a bill provide power connections to people living in floodplain areas in the Gautam Budh Nagar district. For this, state energy minister Shrikant Sharma has asked discom officials to conduct a survey of such areas and send a blueprint to the state government.If the government okays power connections in floodplains, it will benefit over 1.5 lakh people of 35,000 households residing in Chotpur, Chhijarasi, Bahlolpur, Kulsera, Haldauni, Sorkha and other villages in the district.Sharma, who was on a random inspection of the 33/11 volt amps (KVA) power sub-station in Sector 58 on Sunday, said that the decision to introduce the bill was taken in light of the long pending demands of the people residing in the floodplain areas of the district. However, it was not immediately clear if the decision would affect the rest of the state as well. “The Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) – the power distribution company in Noida – has been asked to submit a report in this regard before the state cabinet, where an amicable decision will be taken soon for these people,” he said.After the discom sends over its proposal and survey, the state cabinet will review the same and decide on the matter, the minister added. It should be noted here, however, that residential structures on floodplains are not permitted, as per the National Green Tribunal. Such colonies are deemed unauthorised by the green court. When asked by HT for his response over this, the minister chose not to respond.According to Prem Kant, who lives in Chhijarsi, the decision will be a big respite to people residing in these areas. “We have been repeatedly demanding for legitimate power connections for the last three years, giving our representations to the various elected representatives. The minister’s assurance has given us a ray of hope,” he said.Regarding the progress in conversion of single-point connections to multi-point connections in high-rise societies, he said that he has received a number of complaints from people about the hiked electricity prices from builders.“The state government is determined to bring relief to those who have opted for community living in areas like Greater Noida, Noida and Ghaziabad. People living in high-rises have repeatedly been complaining that builders are charging them extra as part of their electricity bills. In the name of power backup, the builders ask for around ₹10-12 per unit – which is illegal in any case,” he said.He said the aim of fragmenting single-point connections is to save consumers from whopping electricity charges being collected by developers. “Now the time has come that builders give multi-point connections to their clients as a replacement of single-point connections. They can’t impose unnecessary burdens on consumers. I have asked the PVVNL officials to take legal action against builders who are trying to harass residents in this manner,” he said. So far, 272 out of the 600 high-rises in Noida have given their consent for giving individual connections to the residents.“The conversion work has already been completed in eight societies and soon the work will be completed in the remaining ones. Since our government is providing adequate electricity to every consumer in the state, they in return trust us more. We’ll not let them be exploited by the hands of developers, who are virtually sub-letting them the electricity,” he said. VN Singh, chief engineer of the discom, said: “The minister also asked officials for timely redressal of consumers’ grievances and to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-govt-to-formulate-rules-for-providing-power-connections-in-floodplain-areas-says-minister-101623606456788.html

I see crowds getting unruly in some places where we’ve unlocked. We don’t want to let this happen as we can’t impose lockdown again and again,” he added. Chouhan also said the state government will come up with a plan for orphans , who lost their parents due to Covid- 19. “We cannot leave the orphans on the streets.

13-06-2021||Gurugram||Six illegal call centres busted last week, many moving out of Gurugram, say police||The police and the chief minister’s flying squad last week busted six illegal call centres, being used to defraud people, from the city, Faridabad and neighbouring Delhi, even as the police said that call centre operators are shifting their base to other cities in the National Capital Region (NCR) due to increased vigilance in Gurugram.According to the police, more than 45 people were arrested and fake documents, hard drives, workstations and laptops were seized from the locations since last March.Karan Goel, the assistant commissioner of police, DLF, said that the more than 50 such setups that had shifted out were busted from Delhi, Noida, Faridabad and Ghaziabad in the last year. “We have been regularly carrying out raids in all suspected locations such as Sohna Road, Udyog Vihar, Palam Vihar and other residential areas. Many have rented spaces in commercial complexes in other cities as it is cheaper when compared to Gurugram,” he said.The illegal call centres dupe foreign nationals posing as officials of law enforcement agencies and coercing them into transferring money to them on the pretext of fines, the police said. The suspects used to threaten US citizens that their social security numbers (SSN) would be blocked or that they would be booked for consuming drugs or taking loans based on forged documents, the police said.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that they are coordinating with other districts and the national capital to ensure these illegal setups are cleaned and strict action can be taken against the suspects. “People are moving out their operations but are easily setting up in other cities and districts. We all have to join hands and conduct regular raids in our jurisdictions so that this illegal business can be stopped,” he said.The police said that most of the operators of such call centres were repeat offenders and operated in the same groups, with not even one conviction over the last six years.Palwal’s superintendent of police (SP), Deepak Gehlawat, said they have busted three illegal call centres from Delhi’s Mayur Vihar, Peera Garhi and Uttam Nagar that were earlier operating from Gurugram. “We have recovered strong evidence against them and during questioning, they revealed that due to the strictness in Gurugram they had shifted their base,” he said.The police said the suspects did not possess any valid OSP (other service providers) licence from the department of telecommunications or any other agreement or MoU related to their work, following which action was taken against them across NCR.In January this year, Rao had directed station house officers (SHOs) to watch out for illegal call centres and warned of strict action if any such centres are found running in areas under their respective jurisdictions.Inderjeet Yadav, the deputy superintendent of police (DSP) of the crime investigation department (CID), said that they regularly received tip-offs and on average, they used to raid at two establishments every month. “Since the beginning of this year, the number of illegal call centres has reduced and many have shifted their locations to Faridabad. We are focusing on other cities also.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/six-illegal-call-centres-busted-last-week-many-moving-out-of-gurugram-say-police-101623606277877.html
13-06-2021||Gurugram||Monsoon preparations in newer sectors of Gurugram not completed: Residents||With monsoon approaching, residents of the newer sectors of Gurugram alleged that authorities have failed to undertake adequate preparatory measures and expressed concerns over an open drain, claiming that chemical waste is discharged into it and open defecation takes place in it.Ashok Malik, the president of United Association of New Gurugram, an umbrella body of 40 housing societies from sectors 77 to Sector 90, said, “We have noticed several times that local vendors of a sewage plant and maintenance staff are discharging slurry waste in this open drain. Recently, residents from slums built in the area during lockdown are also using this open drain for defecation. We have requested authorities to take necessary action to cover the drain and plant trees along its route.”Under the banner of the United Association of New Gurugram, residents wrote to the Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM) as well as the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) on June 6 regarding problems faced due to open drains in New Gurugram. Residents said that they are mainly facing problems with the drain numbered 3, a stormwater drain that connects to the Badshahpur drain.The letter states, “The residents of societies and villages from sector 85 to 95 at New Gurugram and falling under the area of Municipal Corporation of Manesar have an open drain which is creating a lot of health hazards. This drain, which flows from the Industrial Area of Manesar to the residential area of New Gurugram carries industrial chemical waste and sewage water from villages and societies along its route. It has a foul smell, releases harmful gases and is a fertile ground for breeding of mosquitoes and flies thus turning into a big health hazard…”Services such as maintenance of roads, stormwater drains and sewage system in the newer sectors are looked after by the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), while the newly formed MCM looks after sanitation, streetlights, waste management and land use records. Residents also said that not enough measures have been taken to tackle waterlogging.Praveen Malik, a resident of Sector 92, said, “Work on most of the stormwater drains in this area is incomplete. The stormwater drainage system that is already in place has not been cleaned on time. There has been no preparation done by the MCM for monsoon, be it preparing green belts or making service lanes. For a few societies in our sector, we have built service lanes ourselves through the residents’ welfare association.”Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer for infrastructure-II division of GMDA, said, “Due to different legal issues, the handover of drainage infrastructure in new sectors from Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) to GMDA has not taken place. After meetings with officials concerned, HSVP is now working on completion of all incomplete projects and will hand it over to us after testing. GMDA will manage the infrastructure after the handover.”In April, the MCM had launched a survey to identify points prone to waterlogging, to prepare the areas under its jurisdiction for monsoon, but officials said work got delayed as resources were shifted towards managing the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. The civic body of Manesar was formed in December last year.Munish Sharma, the commissioner of MCM, said, “We had conducted meetings with residents’ welfare associations in March and April, but due to Covid-19 second wave, work on the ground got affected. To solve the complaints regarding the open drains, we are looking into the situation and will be resolving it soon. We are conducting meetings with residents on online mode now and have asked them to constantly share videos and locations with us for issues related to waterlogging during monsoon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/monsoon-preparations-in-newer-sectors-of-gurugram-not-completed-residents-101623606277456.html

The AQI of Lucknow was 48, of Kanpur 44, Ghaziabad 94, Agra 62, Meerut 41, Prayagraj 29 and Varanasi 61. Most of these cities record an average AQI above 300 every year and figure among the most polluted cities in the country. According to the CPCB classification, AQI below 100 is termed satisfactory with minimum impact on human health. AQI between 101 to 200 is categorised as moderate with very little impact on human health while AQI between 201 and 300 is poor, between 301 and 400 is very poor and above 400 is severe. According to experts, the above average rainfall across the state has led to improvement in the air quality. The state recorded more than 40 mm of rainfall in June. “The state recorded around 5 days of rainfall caused by the progressing south-west monsoon, causing rain, thunderstorms and gusty winds in most parts of the state,” said director of state MeT department JP Gupta. “The rainfall helps settle particulate matter and other pollutants suspended in the air, thus cleaning the atmosphere. This leads to a considerable drop in AQI reading,” he explained. Experts feel that the coming monsoon may help to keep the AQI across UP in check. “The AQI of UP cities will remain better during the monsoon. But these changes are temporary that will subside post the monsoon. The citizens and decision-makers must try to make arrangements so that we can have cleaner air all around the year, not only for a short duration,” said senior environmentalist Devesh Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rain-cleans-up-air-aqi-below-100-in-most-cities-101623604596658.html

Both the girls have also not reached their homes in Birsanagar and Ghatshila as of yet. They don’t have mobile phones with them, but we have intensified our search. Teams have also been formed to arrest the five named accused, including MTWT director Harpal Singh Thapar and his child welfare committee (CWC) chief wife Pushpa Rani Tirkey,” Dr M Tamil Vanan, Jamshedpur senior superintendent of police (SSP), said. As per available information, the two girls escaped when the district administration and police were shifting the inmates to Bal Kalyan Ashram in Patamda on Friday evening.According to accused CWC chief Pushpa Rani Tirkey’s last press statement on Monday last week, the shelter home has 43 children, 23 girls and 20 boys, all of whom are under the age of 18. However, earlier on June 5, two girls were reported missing from the shelter home. They were later rescued by the police from Birsanagar on June 6 night, and a case was subsequently registered based on their allegations of sexual assault and torture at the home for the past four years.On June 7, a first information report (FIR) was lodged under Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and sections of the Indian Penal Code against Thapar and Tirkey, besides warden Geeta Singh, her son Aditya Singh, and another staff member Tony Singh. All the five accused are absconding. Police said mobile phones of the Thapar couple were switched off after their location was once tracked far away from Jamshedpur on Thursday last.Police also found names of accused Aditya Singh, and one Gurleen Kaur, another child of warden Geeta Singh, in the list of inmates at the shelter home. Both Aditya and Gurleen are adults, while the shelter home was meant for minors, officials said.Meanwhile, BJP district spokesperson Ankit Anand requested East Singhbhum DC Suraj Kumar to direct the 11-member district level probe committee to investigate the bank accounts of Thapar and his wife, along with MTWT’s accounts. MTWT has no links with Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-trace-of-2-missing-girls-from-mtwt-shelter-home-5-accused-still-at-large-101623603937854.html

13-06-2021||Ranchi||Monsoon covers entire Jharkhand, sowing for Kharif crops begins||With monsoon setting in, sowing for Kharif crops has started across Jharkhand amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The south-west monsoon, that hit Jharkhand on Saturday, covered the entire state on Sunday.The state agriculture department has asked farmers and seed distributors to abide by Covid-19 protocol issued by the disaster management department. “Farmers need to follow general guidelines such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing during sapling plantation on field,” state agriculture secretary Abu Bakr Siddiqui said.As per officials, the timely arrival of monsoon season is expected to boost kharif harvest prospect again this year. “We have also started seed distribution among farmers on time. If everything goes as per plan, we can hope for another great year in terms of kharif harvest,” the agriculture secretary said.Jharkhand saw a record kharif production of around 50 lakh metric tonnes last year.This is for the second time in past one decade that monsoon has hit Jharkhand almost on time. The actual date for onset of monsoon in Jharkhand is June 10. However, it has never hit Jharkhand before June 15 between 2009 and 2019.The rainy season entered Jharkhand on a very positive note and major parts of the state have been receiving decent rainfall for past three days. The state also received good rainfall on Sunday. “Monsoon covered the entire state on Sunday. As per our prediction, the state will be receiving good rainfall for next four to five days. Prospect of rainfall is also positive after that,” said senior scientist at Ranchi centre of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Abhishek Anand.He said the low pressure area over northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining coastal areas of West Bengal and North Odisha with the associated cyclonic circulation is likely to move west-northwestwards across Odisha, Jharkhand and north Chattisgarh during next two to three days.“Under its influence, widespread rainfall activity along with isolated heavy to very heavy rains are likely in Jharkhand during next five days,” he said.Anand said, “The monsoon rainfall count begins from June 1, even as monsoon this year hit on June 12. Jharkhand has so far recorded 44% surplus rainfall. The state has received 73.44mm rainfall from June 1 to 13 against the normal rainfall of 51.1mm.”Palamu has so far recorded the highest 154% surplus rainfall. This was followed by Ranchi with 147% surplus rains and Lohardaga by 138% surplus rain from June 1 to 13. There are seven districts that have recorded deficient rainfall among which Chatra stood at first with 43% rainfall deficient. However, deficit in other districts was within the normal bracket, officials said. Meanwhile, agriculture department officials said taking advantage of early rain this year, direct sowing of paddy has been started in four districts--Khunti, Gumla, Simdega and East Singhbhum.The state has set a target for sowing kharif crops on 28.27 lakh hectares of land, including 18 lakh hectares for paddy. The rest comprises 3.12 lakh hectares for maize, 6.12 lakh hectares for pulses, 60,000 hectares of oil seeds and 42,000 hectares for coarse cereals.As per data provided by the agriculture department, the paddy sowing percentage was 0.41%, maize 3.14%, pulses 0.15% and oilseeds 1.66% till now.Monsoon pattern in Jharkhand Year Monsoon onset Rainfall2021 June 12 NA2020 June-13 901.9mm2019 June-21 863.9mm 2018 June-25 784.4mm 2017 June-16 988.5 mm 2016 June-17 1096.9 mm 2015 June-21 941.9mm 2014 June-18 930.1mm 2013 June-18 844.5mm 2012 June-19 938.5mm 2011 June-15 1160.6mm 2010 June-17 578.4mm 2009 June-24 825.8mm (Note: Normal average rainfall in Jharkhand—1092mm (June, July, August, September) (Source: Ranchi Meteorological Office)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/monsoon-covers-entire-jharkhand-sowing-for-kharif-crops-begins-101623603876716.html

13-06-2021||Ranchi||Union forest ministry takes cognizance of proposed 3rd railway line in tiger reserve||Taking cognizance of the Jharkhand government’s objection over construction of another railway line through core area of Palamu Tiger Reserve (PTR), the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change has written to Railway officials for examining the technical feasibility of an alternative route, officials said on Sunday.The director general (DG) of forest under the aforesaid Union ministry, Sanjay Kumar, in his letter, a copy of which is with the HT, said, “The feasibility of alternative route to bypass the core area of PTR should be examined by Railway authorities immediately in consultation with state government officials and the NTCA. The Ministry of Railways may resolve this matter without any further delay.”Two railway lines already pass through the tiger reserve’s core area. A third broad gauge line has been proposed between Patratu and Son Nagar stations with a nine km long stretch passing through the PTR, that might lead to irreparable loss to biodiversity and fragmentation of the critical tiger habitat, state forest officials said.According to the forest officials, the existing double lines passing through a stretch of around 11km between Chhipadohar and Hehegara section within core area of the reserve has caused much damage.The Jharkhand government has been demanding to shift all railway lines--the two existing ones and the one proposed--outside the core area of the reserve.When contacted, DG Kumar said over phone, “A letter from Jharkhand was earlier received, saying that alternative route for the proposed railway line has still not been explored by Railway authorities. So, I have written to Railway authorities to conduct a technical feasibility for the alternative route. Everything has its pros and cons; they cannot be understood until a study is done.”He said if the Jharkhand government has raised concerns over the proposed railway line, the Railways must address it.The DG’s letter also mentions that at a PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation) meeting, chaired by Prime Minister in January last year, it was directed to examine the alternative route for the proposed railway line. The ministry of railways, state government officials and ministry of environment, forest and climate also taken charge to resolve the issue, the letter said. The PTR, notified a year after former PM Indira Gandhi announced Project Tiger in 1973, is one of the oldest among such reserves in India. The reserve, that once housed over 70 tigers, has now become “tiger-less” due to various reasons, including habitat loss. The big cat’s population dwindled to 10 in 2010 and came down to zero in 2018, according to an All India Tiger Estimation (AITE) 2018 report. The report did not record a single tiger in the reserve, spread over 1129.93 square kilometres. Principal chief conservator of forest (Wildlife), Rajiv Ranjan, said, “We have not received any official communication from Railways for exploration of alternative routes. Meanwhile, it (Railways) has submitted proposals for wildlife clearance, that has been forwarded to the state board of wildlife. We have raised objections over it.”He said, “At a a meeting with Railway officials on March 10 this year, we demanded to explore alternative alignment of the proposed third line and existing lines outside the PTR. However, the officials of Railway Vikas Nigam Limited, the agency that is carrying out the work, said they were not authorized to consider the proposal. They suggested consulting the Union Railways ministry in this regard.”The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has also warned against the construction of another Railway line in the PTR. “An NTCA committee in its report dated January 11, 2020 recommended that no construction of the third broad gauge line should be carried out within the core habitat of PTR, considering its wider ecological ramification on the fragile Palamu landscape and its impacts on recovery and future persistence of many endangered species including tigers,” Ranjan said.Former state wildlife board member DS Srivastava claimed that the existing double line has already caused killing of several wild animals in past 10 years. “In August last year, five deer were mowed down by a goods train in the PTR. In the past one decade, around 13 elephants were killed on track,” he claimed.“The third proposed line will divide the reserve in two parts due to frequency of trains. Wild animals will not be able to roam freely in the forest, as tracks will permanently fragment the habitat,” he warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/union-forest-ministry-takes-cognizance-of-proposed-3rd-railway-line-in-tiger-reserve-101623603756551.html
13-06-2021||Other||Know your N95 mask for credible protection from Covid virus||New Delhi: As deadly variants of the coronavirus take away precious lives and the threat of a possible third wave looms large, there is a sudden scramble for face masks that give the best protection against the killer virus and the choice obviously falls on masks that filter 94 to 95% airborne particles, even as tiny as 0.3 microns. However, if you go online to search such masks, you are sure to be led astray by online sites displaying a wide variety of masks labelled ‘N-95’ but with no third party validation of the quality. In fact many of them claim to have certificates from a number of regulatory authorities around the world, including the US, Europe and China, and even use their logos, but if you look closely, you will realize that it is a pure lie because of the absence of any proof to the effect.Consumers must know that N-95 is not a generic name. In fact the common term used for these masks is ‘Particulate Filtering Face Piece Respirators’ or FFPR and N-95 is one of the several types of FFPRs approved by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH ) and denotes a filtration efficiency of 95%. So, if a manufacturer calls his product as N-95 then it must have the approval of NIOSH, carry the approval number and must be listed on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA. However, unscrupulous manufacturers are exploiting lack of consumer awareness to claim their product to be N-95 masks.Having said that, I must point out that almost every country has its own equivalent standard . For example, it is P2 in Australia and DS2 in Japan. The corresponding Indian standard is FFP2 under IS:9473 . The Indian standard is aligned with the European standard EN149 of 1991 .(Europe has since revised it) Under European standard, these masks are classified as FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3, corresponding with minimum filtration efficiency of 80%, 94% and 99% respectively. India too classifies the masks under IS:9473 in a similar manner.The good news is that the number of manufacturers selling ISI-marked FFP2 masks have steadily grown in the last one year and the number now stands at 246. They may not crop up prominently on online stores, but one can easily identify them on the BIS website. The link www.manakonline.in/MANAK/ApplicationLicenceRelatedrpt will take you to the list of ISI-certified manufacturers — all you need to do is to key in the relevant Indian standard — IS:9473. You can also download the BIS app- BIS CARE on your mobile phone and check out the manufacturer by keying in the license number. During the first wave, because of their acute shortage, these masks were reserved only for front line health workers and others were dissuaded from using them. There is no such rationing now.The quality and effectiveness of these five layered respiratory protective devices depend on three important factors. While one is the quality of the filters and their performance, the other is their snug fit, with their edges designed to form a seal around the nose and the mouth. So besides tests to check their filter efficiency, the BIS standard puts a cap on the leakage of aerosol via filter penetration as well as the face seal (Total Inward Leakage) . Third, to ensure breathability and also the safety of the wearer, the standard also puts limits on the carbon dioxide content of the air within the mask . There are also several other tests that the mask has to go through before getting the quality seal.Indian standard allows both ear loops and head bands but the latter would be far more comfortable and whatever your choice, adjust the strap to ensure a tight fit around the nose, cheek and the chin because however good the mask, it’s effectiveness decreases if it is worn loose.Lastly, given the fact that these masks are our lifeline in these pandemic times, the government should not only bring all FFP2s under mandatory third party certification, but also ensure reduction in their price. At ₹45-90 a piece, these masks are not very pocket friendly for one-time use. The government should also distribute them free of cost to the poor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/know-your-n95-mask-for-credible-protection-from-covid-virus-101623603696586.html

The Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) has given its clearance to build a four-lane national highway on a 33-km stretch from Bakarpur (in Saran) to Manikpur (in Muzaffarpur district). The National highways authority of India (NHAI) has already embarked on the task to develop the existing 104km stretch of the state highway between Manikpur to Areraj in East Champaran into a four-lane and begun the land acquisition process. The road is being strengthened under Bharatmala Pariyojna of the Central government, which will connect many religious places of importance. Additional chief secretary, road construction department (RCD), Amrit Lal Meena said that the MoRTH had on Saturday asked the district magistrates of Saran and Vaishali to launch the land acquisition in their respective jurisdiction so that the work on the fresh stretch of the NH could start at the earliest. Once the four-lane road is ready, it would become a matter of barely two-three hours to reach Patna and AIIMS from any corner of north-western towns of the state. The NHAI has allocated nearly ₹600 crore to acquire land and build the road with one reinforced concrete cement (RCC) bridge on the river Gandak. The NHAI has already started the land acquisition in East Champaran and Muzaffarpur districts to widen around 104km-road from Mankipur to Areraj via Sahebganj, which will later connect to Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh and Kathmandu in Nepal. The NHAI has earmarked a sum of ₹1,500 crore to develop Manikpur-Areraj stretch into four-lane. Officials of the RCD said that the state government had already built a four-lane road from Bakarpur to JP Setu in Saran. “The JP setu on river Ganga is connected with a four-lane elevated road that terminates on the NH 138 near Patna AIIMS. NH138 connects Palamu district in Jharkhand with Pali in Patna. Those coming from north Bihar through the upcoming NH would have the liberty to connect other many NHs to go to UP, North East districts and Jharkhand,” said an executive engineer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/centre-gives-nod-to-build-nh-on-bakarpur-manikpur-stretch-in-bihar-101623601176376.html

The main objective of the public survey was to gauge the mood and perceptions of the people on air pollution and its impact on public health.As per survey findings, 96% of people blamed air pollution for its impact on their health, especially risks like asthma, respiratory diseases and breathing-related disorders. However, 88% of people do not know where to go and lodge complaints on polluting sources or subsequent violations.Speaking on the occasion, Mr Ramapati Kumar, CEO of CEED said, “Patna launched a Clean Air Action Plan in 2019, however effective implementation remains a big challenge. Our study indicates that even after two years, there is a lack of transparency and accountability among departments and enforcement agencies for better implementation. The State government must put words into action to convert the grey sky into a blue sky in Patna.”Elaborating the key recommendations of the report, Ankita Jyoti, Senior Program Officer at CEED said that, “We need to urgently have an integrated and responsive implementation task force at the district level, which must work in a convergent and coordinated approach. The state nodal agency must bring transparency in implementation measures and must publicise adequate information regarding ‘Grievance Redressal Cell’ for ensuring active and collaborative participation of the people in the fight against air pollution.”CEED also urged for active citizen and civil society participation in a collaborative manner on main stages of implementation as a part of preventive and mitigation measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/80-patnaites-unaware-of-clean-air-action-plan-ceed-survey-101623601122228.html
13-06-2021||Patna||Bihar: IAS Officers Association comes forward to help Thalassemia patients||A mega blood donation camp will be held on Monday by the IAS Officers Association and IFS Officers Association with the Vaishno Devi Seva Samiti in Patna for those who need safe blood, especially the Thalassemia patients.Currently, the state has nearly 4,000 Thalassemia patients. To cater to their requirements, chief minister Nitish Kumar had launched Child Thalassemia Centre at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) in the state capital on Blood Donors Day on June 14, 2020.“Thalassemia is a physical problem in which fresh blood needs to be transfused in the body of the patient after every 15 to 20 days. So the need for a regular supply of blood is always there. Blood donation and donors are always in demand to keep the lives of Thalassemia patients safe,” Deepak Kumar Singh, IAS Officers’ Association secretary, said.To encourage the donors and to make the blood donation camp memorable, the department of forests, environment and climate change has decided to offer each of them a memento, certificate and an indoor plant, he added.Mukesh Hissarya, convener of the Vaishno Devi Samiti, working for Thalassemia patients and running a nationwide network of blood donors, said that this blood donors camp is the most needed thing due to a severe crisis of donors during the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown.“The pandemic and the subsequent lockdown have aggravated the need of donors. Despite having donors’ card, many have not been able to donate blood for one or other reasons, while the need for Thalassemia patients is still not catered. They need it regularly,” he said.Last year things were worse. Even those having blood donor’s cards were not allowed to go out, he added. “Then we requested the government to allow donors to go to blood banks. This time, during the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, though the donors were allowed to go out for donations, the response has not been very encouraging. That is why there’s been the need for a blood donation camp,” he said.The activist said that the state has nearly 4,000 Thalassemia patients. “Though it’s not an official figure because there has been no such survey, we can claim on basis of our experiences. Not less than 4,000 families must have contacted us for help in the last three-four years,” he said.At present, the Child Thalassemia Centre in Patna has 350 registered Thalassemia patients, and they are availing the facility of blood transfusion here. “Chief minister launched had launched this Centre on Blood Donor Day in 2020, and since then it has made blood available to 1,700 Thalassemia patients in the state,” he said. Bihar chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, development commissioner Aamir Subhani and principal chief conservator of forests AN Sharan will attend the camp, besides other VIPs..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/biharias-officers-association-comes-forward-to-help-thalassemia-patients-101623601116999.html
13-06-2021||Patna||Bihar withdraws free supply of black fungus drugs to pvt hospitals||Faced with a shortage of drugs of mucormycosis or black fungus, the Bihar government has stopped free supply to private health facilities. This has come as an additional burden for patients, as the Liposomal Amphotericin B injection, a specific drug for the cure of mucormycosis, is costly besides being scarce and available through government channel. “We are procuring the drug for anything between ₹4,000 and ₹7,000 per vial, depending on the brand available, and billing it to our patients,” said Dr Asif Rahman, medical superintendent of the Paras-HMRI hospital, accredited to the National Accredited Board of Hospital (NABH). Depending on the severity of the fungal infection, a patient requires an average of six vials of injection of Amphotericin B a day. The government was earlier supplying them free of cost to private healthcare facilities, providing some financial relief to patients undergoing treatment in the private sector. The state government had declared mucormycosis a notifiable disease on May 22. Ruban Memorial hospital, another NABH accredited hospital, has also begun charging patients for drugs of mucormycosis. “We charge our patients for the drugs at the same price we buy them through government channel after the government stopped its free supply,” said Dr Satyajit Kumar Singh, managing director of Ruban hospital. Patients undergoing treatment at government health facilities, however, continue to get the drug free of cost. The free supply of the drug to private players was stopped around 10 days back. The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which bear the brunt of patient load, are struggling to get a requisite quantity of the drug. “We are dependent solely on government supply for drugs to cure black fungus. Against our daily requirement of over 600 vials, we get a small quantity of Amphotericin B, not even enough to last a day, at an interval of 3-4 days sometimes, causing hardship to patients,” said a doctor in the know of drug inventory at the IGIMS. The AIIMS, on the other hand, is trying to procure them directly through manufacturers or local vendors by entering into rate contract with them, said Dr Kranti Bhavana, additional professor and head, department of ENT (ear, nose & throat) at the AIIMS. “We are facing an acute shortage of drugs against our average daily consumption of 500-600 vials every day,” she said. The AIIMS had over 101 patients of black fungus under treatment as on June 11, but the government supply of the drug was erratic and inadequate. The same day, the IGIMS had 116 patients out of the total 174 cases reported at the institute since May 18, when it came up with a separate ward for patients with mucormycosis, said its medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal. The IGIMS achieved a small milestone when it operated upon its 100th patient with black fungus last Friday. “Our team of ENT, eye and neurosurgery experts performed a rare surgery on Saturday when they extricated fungus of the size of a cricket ball behind the eye orbital of a 60-year old man from Jamui district, without causing any vision loss to the patient,” said Dr Mandal. The institute had completed 106 surgeries of mucormycosis till Saturday. “We operate 8-10 patients of black fungus on an average daily,” said Dr Rakesh Kumar Singh, professor and head, ENT, IGIMS. “We use Amphotericin B and Posaconazole drugs on our patients. Depending on the severity of the infection, it takes 4-6 weeks generally for patients to become stable,” added Dr Singh. Bihar had so far reported 562 cases of black fungus and 76 deaths, of which three died on Sunday. As many as 333 patients were under treatment, as per the health department’s bulletin on mucormycosis, the first released on Sunday, after it declared the fungal infection a notifiable disease on May 22. Efforts to reach Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar, proved futile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-withdraws-free-supply-of-black-fungus-drugs-to-pvt-hospitals-101623600996259.html

The probe agency said that this is the first case in India in which edible weed is being used for baking cake. The NCB has seized 830 grams of edible weed brownie, pot brownie and 160 gram of marijuana during the raid, news agencies reported. This is a new trend among youngsters to consume edible weed, the agency said.Jagat Chaurasia, one of the arrested, is believed to be the supplier."Cannabis edibles may affect people for a longer period than smoked cannabis. The important base to all food edibles is that it has fat that has been infused with THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol)," the agency said in a statement. It explained that any food that contains butter, oil, milk, or any fatty substance can be turned into an edible. Not only brownie, candy, potato chips can also be made infused with cannabis, the agency said. It is not easy to distinguish between a regular baked good and a cannabis-infused one by seeing. Cannabis products generally have a slightly green tinge.  The NCB has registered a case against the trio under various sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.The Mumbai zone of the NCB has been conducting several raids in the city in connection with the Bollywood drug case which came up following the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput on June 14, 2020. The agency started the probe after chats between Sushant Singh Rajput and his friend actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik regarding drug consumption and procurement came to the surface.

The searing June heat was no deterrent, with the huge footfall forcing the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) to make arrangements to ensure no devotee was inconvenienced. “Based on the consumption of langar (free food) during the second wave of the lockdown, footfall of devotees had always been less than 50,000 a day. Over the past ten days, however, there has been a gradual increase in footfall. On Sunday, the number was around 80,000, again, based on langar consumption,” said Satnam Singh, manager, Golden Temple langar hall, the largest community kitchen in the world.He added that the situation was not normal yet, as devotees from overseas and other states could not come due to travel restrictions. “Before the pandemic, 1 lakh devotees visited the Sri Darbar Sahib (Golden Temple) on a week day and 1.5 lakh on weekends and special days,” he said. After a long time, the entire parkarma (circumambulation marble path around the holy water tank called as ‘sarovar’) of the Golden Temple was full of devotees. To enforce social distancing, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) had to make extra arrangements. Tents were set up outside the ‘Darshani Deori’ to ensure devotees queued up with the mandated distance between each other. Devotees jam-packed the area between the Akal Takht and the Darshani Deori with the queue extending up to the parkarma. At the Dukh Bhanjani Beri, a historic tree on the bank of the sarovar (It is believed that if anyone takes bath under this tree, he or she is freed of all sorrows), the devotees had to wait for their turn to have a dip. A queue of women had built up outside their designated changing room. Before covid-19 struck, the average collection of offerings at the Golden Temple was ₹23 lakh a day. Due to the first phase of the lockdown, the collection dipped to between ₹10,000 and ₹15,000 a day. In the present second wave, however, the number should improve as footfall did not see as drastic a dip as in the previous wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pandemic-shows-signs-of-easing-devotees-throng-golden-temple-101623600337105.html

13-06-2021||Pune||Most flood-prone areas under PMC jurisdiction, civic body claims risk minimised||The Pune district administration declared 21 flood prone areas in Pune city and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits most of which are located in the PMC jurisdiction; however, the civic body has claimed that the affected parts and affected people have been reduced as it has taken precaution to construct a retaining wall and anti-encroachment drive along the river to avoid flooding during monsoon. Under the Mula-Mutha valley, there are four dams-Temghar, Varasgaon, Panshet and Khadakwasla which supply water to Pune city and some rural parts of the Pune district. The total storage capacity of four dams is 29.15 Thousand Million Cubic feet (TMC). The water release from these dams flows through the Pune city and merges with Bhima at Rahu about 66 kilometres from Pune city. Temghar dam has a water release capacity of 12,120 cusecs and Varasgaon and Panshet can release 52,698 cusecs and 42,036 cusecs respectively. Temghar, Varasgaon and Panshet- all three dams release water to Khadakwasla dam and therefore, Khadakwasla can release maximum 98,766 cusec water which creates flood line situation in Pune city. There are nine flood prone areas like Hingne Khurd, Vitthalwadi, Erandwane (Pulachi vadi), Shivajinagar ( Patil estate), Yerawada ( Shantinagar, Indiranagar), Sangamwadi, Aundh, Baner. Rajesh Deshmukh, Pune district collector said, “Under the Pune district disaster management plan, we have made preparations to tackle the flood like situation in the monsoon season. We have identified 21 major flood prone spots in the PMC and PCMC area. We have given instructions to concerned officials to prepare as mentioned the duties and responsibilities in the disaster plan.” In 2007 and 2009, the city had faced a flood situation due to excess rainfall in the PMC and adjacent part of Pune city. Considering the history of floods, PMC Disaster Management Cell (DMC) and flood control department had spotted flood prone areas within the last few years of flood situations in the city. Mula and Mutha rivers flow through the city, the Khadakwasla irrigation division releases water when there is heavy rainfall in catchment areas of dams which affects riverside areas. In 2015, PMC identified a total 38 flood prone areas in Pune municipal limits which included Manjari (budharuk) and Mundhwa (Keshavnagar) which are tail parts of the city areas as they had experienced flood situations. Based on the last five-year experience and displacement of people in flood areas, there are only a few major areas where there is more risk as compared to the 2007-2009 flood. Ganesh Sonune, head of PMC disaster management cell said, “The PMC’s disaster plan has integrated with Pune district disaster management plan. Due to information and technology (IT) service, we are getting information in advance. Therefore, we are getting more time to take precautionary measurements as early as possible.” “As per Pune city disaster plan 2015, we had mentioned to shift around 3,000 people from low line areas along Mula-Mutha riverside. The number has come down to 300 to 500. We constructed retaining walls and removed hurdles, encroachments in most of the areas such as Pulachi wadi, Kamgar Putala near Shivajinagar, Sangamwadi and Yerawada areas reduced displacement and reduced risk of life of people. Therefore, the number of flood prone areas has also reduced, and it has come down in few numbers,” he added. In the PCMC area, Pavana dam provides water, it has a capacity of 10.77 TMC. It can release 44,466 cusec waters from dams which cause flood situations in PCMC areas, and it affects Dapodi, Sangvi.

He said that he was innocent because no offence was made out against him. Opposing the plea, the government lawyer argued that the applicant along with others was apprehended with two bulls, a bundle of ropes, one hammer, two 'ghandasas', one nail and 12 empty packets of 5 kg each on February 25.The lawyer said the police party overheard that the accused were going to slaughter the bulls and the offences were clearly made out.After hearing the matter, the bench observed, "From perusal of the FIR, it does not come out that the applicant/accused made any attempt to slaughter or executed the slaughter. Thus, the culpability of the applicant under the 1955 act is clearly not attracted. Consequently, it is prima facie apparent that Section 3 and 8 of the act have wrongly been invoked against the applicant."Thus, the bench allowed the accused's bail plea but clarified in its order, "It is provided that none of the observations made in the order shall be considered by the trial court and the trial shall proceed on its own merits.""Considering the peculiar circumstances of the case, this court finds it in the interest of justice to direct the Superintendent of Police, Sitapur to file his personal affidavit specifically adverting to the averments made in the bail application as well as indicating how the cognizance of Sections 3 and 8 of the act have been invoked against the applicant," the bench added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allahabad-high-court-grants-bail-to-man-booked-for-possessing-bulls-instruments-used-for-slaughter-101623595768199.html

13-06-2021||Chandigarh||Groundwater depletion: Haryana CM pushes for micro-irrigation||Asking farmers to adopt micro-irrigation where the groundwater level has gone down, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday said the previous governments did not pay attention to increasing water availability for agriculture. Presiding over the first meeting of Haryana Water Resources Authority in Chandigarh on Sunday, the chief minister expressed concern over the groundwater level going down to 80 feet in districts such as Kurukshetra, Karnal, Kaithal and Panipat. “The farmers should give priority to micro-irrigation in areas where the groundwater has gone down. The condition of Shahabad and Ismailabad in Kurukshetra district is worst,” he said. The dependence of people on groundwater increased, he said, because the previous governments did not pay any attention to increasing the availability of water for agricultural use. Khattar said that to raise the depleting groundwater level in the state, there is a need for a customised plan for water recharge and utilisation, so that people can get adequate supply for agriculture and domestic use. The CM said for the smooth availability of groundwater, river water and treated water to the farmers in the state, a centralised water monitoring system should be prepared over the next two years. The plan should be extended to the village level with the participation of people and public representatives. He directed the officers concerned to formulate plans on the basis of different areas of the state and prepare water availability index of each village, so that people can get information regarding availability of water. Keshni Anand Arora, chairperson of Haryana Water Resources Authority, said a customised water plan will be prepared for the availability of water as per the requirement of all people in the state. 60% blocks severely hitAdditional chief secretary (irrigation and water resources) Devender Singh said the problem arising out of groundwater exploitation has taken a formidable form in 14 out of 22 districts of Haryana, besides waterlogging and water salinity in seven districts. He said of 141 blocks in the state, 60% (85) came in the red category in 2020, up from 48% (55 of 114 blocks) in 2004, due to groundwater exploitation. “Therefore, farmers should reduce their dependence on groundwater and give priority to crop diversity,” he said. DS Dhesi, chief principal secretary to chief minister, said that the state government’s Mera Pani Meri Virasat scheme, which incentivises farmers who conserve water, has been appreciated not only in the country but also by the World Bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/groundwater-depletion-haryana-cm-pushes-for-microirrigation-101623594456366.html

Policies to protect their rights do exist, but they are usually not implemented," Soren told PTI.The CM further stated that he had been raising the issue on different platforms but to avail."Once we tide over the Covid-19 crisis, I will personally hold meetings with chief ministers and administrators of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh among other states and UTs and pitch for a robust mechanism to check workers' exploitation," Soren said.He lamented that the state had to use its own resources during catastrophes to evacuate workers or in some cases bring their mortal remains home, having received no help from the stakeholders.Citing examples, the CM said 15 Jharkhand migrant workers engaged by Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district, near India-China boundary, had lost their lives in an avalanche in April.Similarly, several workers were killed in February when a devastating flash flood demolished a 13.2 MW hydel project and caused extensive damage to another NTPC venture in along Dhauliganga in Uttarakhand, he said."We have lost workers in cloud burst in Jammu & Kashmir... in other natural disasters. Despite flagging such instances, policies to protect the migrant labourers are not being implemented," the CM maintained.Soren further said that his government, notwithstanding its unpleasant experiences in the past, had given its approval to BRO to employ workers, keeping national interest in view amid the India-China face-off in Ladakh."Hundreds of migrant workers are made to live in pathetic condition in the hilly and difficult terrains, devoid of proper amenities and wages. They are reluctant to take up similar jobs on their return to the state. Jharkhand, on its part, is augmenting the labour management system by ensuring registration for all workers, and efforts are being made for their gainful employment," he said.The CM pointed out that his government has launched the Mukhyamantri Didi Kitchen Yojana, which fed four crore people during the lockdown last year."We made sure that the first special train that was available ferried as many as 1,200 workers from Telangana to Hatia in Ranchi. Migrant workers stuck in Leh were brought to Delhi, from where they boarded another flight to Jharkhand after two months of anxiety and uncertainty," he noted.Soren was the first chief minister in the country to airlift 60 migrant workers stuck in Ladakh in May last year.The Supreme Court had on May 24 said the process of registration of migrant workers is "very slow" and it must be expedited so that benefit of various schemes can be extended to them amid the Covid-19 pandemic.The apex court had also observed that it was "not happy" with the efforts of the Centre while hearing an application filed by three activists who had sought directions to the Union government and states to ensure food security, cash transfers, transport facilities and other welfare measures for migrant workers facing distress due to the pandemic-induced curbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/need-robust-mechanism-to-check-migrant-workers-exploitation-says-jharkhand-cm-101623592474508.html

Talking to reporters, Malik said the MVA was formed on a common minimum programme (CMP) and it has taken several decisions in public interest.The common man is satisfied with the performance of the government, be it farmers’ welfare or Covid-19 management, he claimed. “State Congress chief Nana Patole has said that his party will contest the next polls independently. He aspires to be the chief minister. No one can be stopped from aspiring for any post. All parties have to work to boost the morale of its cadre and strengthen its organisation,” Malik added. The upcoming local bodies polls may be contested by all the three parties together or independently. Two of the three parties can also have an alliance. A decision about it will be taken as per the prevailing situation, he said.“The three parties are working united in the government for welfare of the people and have not decided on how to contest the 2024 elections,” he said.On Saturday, Patole had said in Amravati that the Congress will emerge as the single-largest party in the state in 2024 and only Congress’s ideology can save the country. Meanwhile Senior Congress leader Naseem Khan said if his party contests the elections separately, it would benefit it.Malik welcomed the reduction in GST on medical equipment and medicines used for COVID-19 treatment from 18 per cent to five per cent.“A committee of finance ministers was set up under the leadership of Ajit Pawar, the state finance minister. They made a recommendation, which was accepted by the GST council. The NCP welcomes it," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mva-allies-united-in-running-govt-but-no-decision-yet-on-alliance-for-assembly-polls-ncp-101623591868158.html

13-06-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav Thackeray will be chief minister for 5 years: Shiv Sena||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday denied reports that Maharashtra chief minister's post will not remain with his party. The Member of Parliament said that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is an alliance of three parties which decided that Uddhav Thackeray will be the chief minister.“It's a rumour that Shiv Sena CM will be replaced after 2.5 years. When 3 parties formed the government, they committed and decided that CM will be Uddhav Thackeray for 5 years. If someone talks about this, then it is nothing but a lie and rumour,” Raut was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Since chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a one-on-one meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 8 reports of the MVA government not being able to complete their five-year term has been doing the rounds. All three political parties in the coalition - Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congresss - have been vehemently denying such reports."Our commitment is to serve for five years and we will complete that tenure. There is nothing to be afraid of about a separate meeting that took place between chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. There is no threat to the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra," NCP leader Jayant Patil told news agency PTI.NCP supremo Sharad Pawar too denied such reports, insisting that the MVA government will complete its term in office. Pawar praised Shiv Sena as a trustworthy party, and stated that the MVA will perform well in the next Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.Meanwhile, Raut had criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at a gathering on Saturday. Raut alleged in Jalgaon that attempts were made to finish off the party.“We were like slaves, secondary people. The situation was quite bad...

13-06-2021||Bangalore||Days after ruling out leadership change, BJP incharge Arun Singh to visit K'taka||BJP General Secretary Arun Singh is arriving here on Wednesday, days after ruling out replacing Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa amid speculation in some quarters about leadership change. "Arun Singh would be in Karnataka for two to three days. It is his duty to hold meetings and take stock of the situation, for which he is coming here. I welcome him and I will be here to cooperate with him," Yediyurappa told reporters here on Sunday. According to party sources, Singh is likely to hold meetings with Ministers, MLAs and the party's core committee members during his visit. On June 10, Singh said: "Yediyurappa is the Chief Minister, he is doing a good job and will remain the Chief Minister. He has done a good job during the Covid situation, all the Ministers and the party- everyone has done a good job". Singh had also said that no discussions have happened at the party's central leadership level, regarding seeking resignation from the chief minister as he termed talks about replacing CM, and also state party president Nalin Kumar Kateel as "rumour" and "imaginary". A day later, Yediyurappa said Singh's statement ruling out his replacement, has given him "more strength" and that he will work for the development of the state during the remaining two years of the term. Speculations have been rife for some time now that efforts were on by a section of the ruling BJP to unseat Yediyurappa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/days-after-ruling-out-leadership-change-bjp-incharge-arun-singh-to-visit-karnataka-101623586222428.html

13-06-2021||Pune||Your Space: Covid unlock in Pune- Preparedness and lessons learned||With Covid cases declining, the administration has lifted many restrictions as part of the unlock plan. While the reopening of many sectors will boost the economy, have the authorities and public learned the lessons to tackle the virus and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour?Follow Covid-appropriate norms strictlyIn the later days of lockdown, the crowd on the roads had started to swell. Unlock is just an official announcement. As the cases started to drop, people lost the fear of the virus and sort of resumed their regular activities. My family and I have been following every Covid norms for more than a year. There were patients in my family and, fortunately, all recovered. If such reckless public behaviour continues, it won’t be long that we will be facing the third wave. Everything cannot remain closed forever. It is essential that people adopt the simple Covid rules such as wearing masks, social distancing, washing hands, and use of sanitisers not just to evade fines by the administration but for everyone’s safety. Unless everyone realises this and starts acting on it, we will face many such waves and possible lockdowns.Madhuri DeshpandeResidents lax about prevention protocols Wagholi is the nearest suburb to Pune city. The administration has declared the unlocking and reopening which is essential for businesses, but now it is an even bigger responsibility for everyone to follow the Covid rules. We see photos and videos of crowds on roads and markets and criticise them, but little do we realise that we became part of them when we unnecessarily roam around. When the second wave was at its peak, everyone had fear in their minds. Now that fear seems to have vanished. Every family has suffered because of Covid. Let’s not forget that.Sandip SatavChange in market timings is confusing I do not think the administration had planned the reopening phases. They should have realised that once everything is officially allowed to remain open, crowd and traffic will increase. Look at the status of roads in Pune city. Some road work is going on everywhere. They should have finished it during the lockdown. Also, now the frequently changing rules of market openings and timings have become confusing for shopkeepers like me. I run an ice cream and snacks shop. The changing shop timings even confuse customers. Once the timings are in place, it should remain unchanged at least for a week.Deepak KaroteRural areas should be closely monitoredI think the Covid situation is still worrisome in rural parts and it is difficult for the administration to monitor the virus compliance in those parts. In city areas, people are aware and at least know basic things about Covid. In rural parts, there is lack of awareness. Once the lockdown restrictions are relaxed, crowds will be seen at weddings, funerals, and other social gatherings. There should be strict monitoring in rural areas. Also, the administration should focus on improving health infrastructure in villages. Covid tests and oxygen beds should be available in every village. There is still a lot of hesitancy for Covid test and getting hospitalised when required. This fear should be addressed.Hemant TakawaleGet vaccinated at the earliestMy husband is an autorickshaw driver. During the latest lockdown, rickshaws were permitted to operate, but everything else was closed so there were no passengers. Now as the shops have reopened, there is a rise in passenger count. It’s a little relief for our family. When the vaccination had opened for 45-plus citizens, I had insisted him to get the jab as he comes in contact with a lot of people. I don’t know much about the policies and science, but I read in newspapers that vaccines can prevent the Covid infection. So, those who have to go out should get vaccinated. Surekha LandageFollow Covid rules in the new normal While most of the senior citizens have taken the first jab, if people of other age groups don’t follow the Covid norms then the risk to the elderly remains during the unlocking period. They are vulnerable. When reopening after the lockdown, the administration should imprint in people’s minds the importance of norms. There should be strict punishment for Covid violators. Otherwise the reckless behaviour will continue. Senior citizens have suffered a lot in last year and the loneliness will not go away even if the cases in second wave have dropped. Until the time the virus is tackled completely, lives cannot be back to normal. We can try to come close to normal living by following the rules. Pandurang Ingole No clear guidelines for education sectorWe hardly got a chance to go to college this year. Everyone is relying on online classes. When it comes to reopening, the administration only thinks of shops, markets and businesses. But even after a year, there is not a clear policy for education. Schools could hardly reopen. Colleges remained shut. After a point, we are missing out on a proper student life. The plus point is that we get to live at home and attend classes. So, there is no additional expenditure on hostels, mess. But we are missing the college life and friends. Our hangouts have become an online event. It’s high time that the government release a policy for the education sector which will minimise the risk, but studies will continue.Tanmay Joshi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/your-space-covid-unlock-in-pune-preparedness-and-lessons-learned-101623581796153.html

The forest department has refuted the allegations and claimed that the deceased was shot down while protecting the illegal sand mining mafia.Police said two eyewitnesses alleged that one Mahaveer Singh Tomar, a 45-years old resident of Amol Pura village, was beaten up and shot dead by forest department officials after he objected to officers’ firing at the tractor-trolley, laden with illegally mined sand, citing it was a residential area“Mahaveer’s son Rahul Tomar, 19, filed a complaint with the police and said after abusing his father, forest officials Pramod and Raghvendra shot him dead with their service gun while others used the butt of their guns to assault him. Rahul and two other villagers are claiming to be the eyewitnesses,” Morena’s superintendent of police Lalit Shakyawar said, citing the complaint filed by Mahaveer’s family.Police said they have registered a case under Section 302 (murder), 147 (punishment for rioting) and 294 (using abusive language) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the nine forest officials on the basis of the complaint and are further investigating the matter.However, divisional forest officer (DFO) Amit Nikam said that while the forest team was chasing a tractor–trolley laden with illegal sand, the villagers including Mahaveer stopped the team’s vehicle to save the mining mafia. “Mahaveer and others were trying to snatch the guns from forest officials, when a bullet was fired accidently which hit Mahaveer in his chest. We are sending a report on the whole incident to the police,” said the DFO.The heavy police force has been deployed after villagers staged a demonstration against the forest department and blocked a road connecting the village to the district headquarters.According to South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), MP was at the third spot in illegal sand mining activities with 16,405 cases registered in 2018-19.Most of the cases were from Chambal and Narmada river basins. In Morena only, at least more than 600 cases have been registered against illegal sand mining mafia. According to an estimate of environmentalist and local businessmen, every day more than 500 tractor trollies of illegally mined sand, are supplied in the market.(With inputs from Shiv Pratap Singh)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/man-shot-dead-during-ops-against-sand-mafia-9-forest-officials-booked-101623576455406.html

All religious, social and cultural gatherings will also remain suspended, he said. Religious places will be opened but visitors will not be allowed, Kejriwal added.Here is all you need to know about the easing of Delhi's Covid-19 lockdown:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/malls-restaurants-in-delhi-can-now-open-all-you-need-to-know-about-covid-curbs-101623567807651.html
13-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi shops can open all days, restaurants allowed 50% guests in new relaxations||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced further relaxations in the ongoing lockdown in the city, allowing shops located in markets to operate all days in a week, restaurants to operate with 50% sitting capacity and weekly markets on a zonal basis.“Last week, we had allowed shops in markets to operate in an odd-even basis, whereas standalones shops could operate all day. From this Monday, all shops will be allowed to operate all day. However, they have to operate between 10 am and 8 pm,” Kejriwal said in a video briefing.It essentially means, all shops – including liquor shops – will now be open all day but for a shorter time window.“Similarly, weekly markets will be allowed to operate but with restrictions – only one market in one municipal zone in a day,” said Kejriwal. Delhi has 12 municipal zones in total.He also said restaurants can also open dine-in with 50% sitting capacity while strictly following social distancing and all Covid-19 appropriate protocols.So far, restaurants were only allowed to offer take-in and home delivery services.Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) later issued an order to say: "It is directed that all district magistrates, districts DCPs, deputy commissioners of municipal corporations... and all other authorities concerned shall be responsible for ensuring Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, which is wearing of masks, maintain[ance of] social distancing ... (and) no consumption of liquor, pan, gutkha, tobacco, etc in all shops, malls, market complexes, weekly markets, restaurants, mandis, ISBTs and railway station.A senior official of the DDMA clarified, "Only restaurants are allowed to open with certain conditions this week. Bars are not allowed."Kejriwal said, relaxations implemented last week will continue including operation of factories in industrial areas, construction activities, government offices with full attendance for officers above Grade-1 and half attendance below that, private offices with maximum 50% attendance between 9 pm and 5 pm, public buses and metro at 50% sitting capacity and all day operation of standalone business enterprises.Taxis, autos and other paratransit vehicles too will be allowed with a cap on maximum number of passengers, weddings are allowed with a maximum presence of 20 guests either at courts or inside residential premises. Funerals can be attended by a maximum of 20 guests. Religious sites can open but they cannot entertain visitors. Home delivery of goods will be allowed too.Schools, colleges, coaching centres and education institutes will continue to remain closed and the restriction on social, political, cultural, religious and academic gatherings will continue too. Centres of mass congregations such as swimming pools, gymnasiums, yoga centres, cinema halls, theatres and multiplexes; banquet halls; auditoriums and business to business exhibition arenas; entertainment parks, water parks and public parks will also remain closed, said the chief minister.The lockdown in Delhi was imposed on April 19 in the light of a severe surge in Covid-19 cases which left the healthcare system overwhelmed. The city was under a hard lockdown – with only essential activities allowed – for six weeks before the first phase of relaxations were allowed last month.“The Covid-19 situation in Delhi is under control now. We are now concerned largely about recovering the economy and preparing for a potential third wave. Yesterday, we launched 22 new oxygen plants. Day before yesterday, three oxygen storage plants were inaugurated. From Monday 5 am, more or less all economic activities will be allowed except a few. And few things will be allowed to function in a restricted fashion,” Kejriwal said, explaining the government’s thinking.He added that the administration will “keenly” observe the Covid-19 trends after the latest relaxations remain in force for a week.“If cases continue going further down, all restrictions can be scaled down in a phased manner in the coming days. However, if cases go up, we may have to impose restrictions again. I urge everyone to strictly adhere to regulations and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” Kejriwal added.National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI), which has more than 5,000 members across the country welcomed the development. “The industry could not recover from the shock of the first lockdown by the time the second lockdown happened. The industry is in distress. We hope the coming days will witness economic recovery. ...But the government should also allow bars to open. Prohibiting bars, especially when liquor stores are open and dine-in is allowed, makes no sense,” said Manpreet Singh, a Delhi-based restaurateur and treasurer of the association.Arbind Singh, national coordinator of the National Association of Street Vendors of India, said: “The government should have allowed them earlier with strict protocols. But better late than never. Weekly market vendors are in extreme distress. Many of them are migrants and they have been struggling for food and ration.”Health experts however warn that Covid-19 containment protocols will have to be observed in letter and spirit if the relaxations are not to backfire.“The government should be very meticulous about the phased relaxations. 100% mask compliance should be... not just on paper but enforced efficiently as more public spaces open up. For markets and offices, the government should draft a policy of staggered timings to ensure that the crowd is under control. The government should keep a close watch on covid-19 trends and take its time in lifting restrictions from close spaces such as gyms, cinema halls, etc. Also, gatherings of any kind should not be allowed at this stage,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the clinical virology department at Christian Medical College in Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-shops-can-open-all-days-restaurants-allowed-50-guests-in-new-relaxations-101623571235248.html

After a few awareness attempts by the administration people of these villages realized the importance of vaccination for the safety of their people," the statement said.The Ranga panchayat of Masaliya block in Dumka is also heading towards the 100 per cent vaccination target. Shikaripara and Gandrakpur Panchayats, which are situated at the farthest part of the districts have achieved more than 80 per cent vaccination.Garu, a Naxal-affected block in the Latehar district has administered close to 36,000 jabs. Nearly 50 per cent of the 18 population of this block have received the vaccine jab.The district administration is running intensive awareness campaigns across the block and a rise in vaccine coverage is being reported every day."Awareness campaigns run by the government in native and regional languages are helping people understand the benefits of the vaccine. Myths and fallacies related to the vaccine are being exposed among the rural population of the state," the statement said.More than 70 per cent vaccination coverage has been recorded in the Dumka district of the Santhal Pargana region. Intensive awareness drives are being run across the district to encourage people and dispel hesitancy.Apart from the efforts made by the administration to create awareness among the rural population, every week people would gather at different parts of the village. Everyone would share their inputs related to COVID safety behaviour and vaccination.Other factors that have contributed towards this success include self-education, village-level meetings related to vaccines, and weekly social work for the upliftment of their village and their people."This created a similarity of thought among the villagers. Villages like Banmara, Jins Jara Kani and Ranga were motivated by the awareness drives run by the government, they accepted the importance of vaccination. They admitted that death due to Covid can create chaos among villagers. To avoid such mishappenings they voluntarily came ahead to take part in the Covid vaccination," the statement added.

An orange alert denotes heavy to very heavy rainfall for an area. “Extremely heavy rainfall belt has shifted southwards. So warnings are downgraded. Still, IMD expects heavy to very heavy rainfall in the city and suburbs,” IMD Mumbai’s deputy director Shubhangi Bhute told news agency ANI on Saturday.However, weather officials told Hindustan Times that an active rain spell is expected over the Konkan coast for a minimum of four to five days due to the formation of a low-pressure area over the north Bay of Bengal and cyclonic circulations in the Arabian Sea facilitating strong westerly winds.Here are the latest updates:> Mumbai has so far recorded 706.1 mm rainfall against the monthly average of 505 mm from June 1 till June 12.> Mumbai and its suburbs will witness heavy to very heavy rainfall for the next two days, IMD said on Saturday evening.

Thunderstorms with lightning, gusty winds and extremely heavy rain is expected in these two districts.> Train services in Mumbai resumed on Saturday evening as rains subsided. The services were earlier disrupted as tracks were waterlogged due to the heavy downpours in the city. Bus services were also hit as roads were submerged, making it extremely difficult for vehicles to move.> The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) once again appealed to the residents to stay home and not venture outdoors. “Heavy rain is expected in the city tomorrow [Sunday] as well as the day after. We request you to not venture out, especially near the sea,” the civic body said in a statement.> Even though Mumbai has seen a drastic fall in its coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases and is placed under level two as per the state government’s unlock plan, the city will be under level three of lockdown for the time being as a precautionary measure against the worsening weather conditions.

13-06-2021||Kolkata||Bengal minister says he was muzzled in GST council meet, Centresays not true||West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra claimed he was muzzled at the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council meeting on Saturday, resulting in the council’s “anti-people decision” to continue taxing Covid-19 drugs, vaccines and disease containment equipment. While he said he was deliberately silenced by the Union finance minister in yet another blow to cooperative federalism, Nirmala Sitharaman’s deputy denied these allegations and said Mitra’s video conference connection was not stable, making him inaudible. “I write this letter with great anguish. In your remarks near the end of today’s GST Council Meeting, you referred to several of my observations by name and yet I was not given the floor, despite repeated requests to you. Instead, you gave the floor to the minister from UP, who sought deletion of some of my comments by name and shockingly you agreed,” Mitra wrote in a letter to Nirmala Sitharaman. The 44th meeting of the GST Council decided to cut taxes on several essential equipment and medicines including mucormycosis drug Amphotericin B and Tocilizumab-- from 5% to zero; Covid-19 drug Remdesivir and anticoagulant drug Heparin-12% to 5%. It also cut taxes on medical grade oxygen and testing kits. The tax levy on ambulances was also reduced to 12% for a little over three-and-a-half months to help individuals and governments fight Covid-19 and its fallout.Alleging that his muzzling was “unprecedented” and a “major blow” to the spirit of cooperative federalism, Mitra, claimed that the GST council forced its decision to continue taxing Covid-19 vaccines and items like masks, PPE kits and hand sanitizers among others. “GoI [government of India] led the anti-people move & IMPOSED GST on VACCINE, MASK, hand sanitizer, OXYGEN, PPE [kits], oximeters, Covid test kit, Remdesivir, RT PCR machine... Since my voice [was] IGNORED, I have recorded my DISSENT by letter. Unprecedented. Slow death of the only body of cooperative federalism,” Mitra tweeted. Responding to Mitra, Union minister of state for finance Anurag Tahkur said the Bengal finance minister’s video conference line was not stable and that he was not properly audible. “During the GST Council discussions today (June 12), it seemed as if the Finance Minister from West Bengal did not have a stable VC connection. Revenue Secretary repeatedly informed him his line was breaking, that he was not properly audible & to turn off his video for better connectivity,” Thakur tweeted. He also claimed that at the end of the discussion, when Sitharaman asked whether anyone would like to speak, Mitra remained silent. “Further, during the speech made by the Uttar Pradesh finance minister, nobody heard Dr Mitra ji speak up nor did he ask to have his opinion heard. Other members can attest to this,” Thakur added. Thakur also said that the Union finance minister has never stifled dissent in the GST Council. “It is unbecoming of a senior member of the Council to suggest that this has happened. The GST Council embodies the collective spirit of all states towards debate in a healthy manner; it has been & shall continue,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-minister-says-he-was-muzzled-in-gst-council-meet-centresays-not-true-101623555154133.html

The size of the fungus was equivalent to a cricket ball and the surgery, led by Dr Brajesh Kumar, on Friday went on for three hours.The man, identified as Anil Kumar from Jamui, is currently stable. Kumar recently recovered from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and was suffering from frequent episodes of dizziness and faintings for the past few days. He was then referred to IGIMS and was detected with mucormycosis.Dr Manish Mandal, the medical superintendent of IGIMS, told Livehindustan on Saturday the fungus entered Kumar’s brain through his nose but did not spread to his eyes. And because of this, the 60-year-old’s eyes remained unharmed during the surgery. The Livehindustan report also pointed out that doctors have had to remove the eyes in a majority of the patients in similar cases.Bihar has so far reported more than 500 cases of mucormycosis, which is caused by fungal spores and has severe effects. The state government declared mucormycosis as an epidemic on May 22. People get infected by black fungus after coming in contact with fungal spores in the environment. The disease is mostly detected among recovered patients of Covid-19, diabetic patients and those with low immunity.In recent days, doctors in Bihar have complained of a severe shortage of Amphotericin B, which is used for treating mucormycosis.Meanwhile, the Covid-19 disease caseload in Bihar has climbed to 716,296 of which 9466 people have died and 701,234 have recovered. The active cases have come down to 5596. The state government is facing flak over its alleged undereporting of deaths due to the viral disease with the opposition parties accusing the former of botching up the battle against the ongoing pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/cricket-ball-sized-mucormycosis-removed-from-man-s-brain-in-patna-101623547724337.html

Staying on in the BJP is a little tough for those who come from that party (TMC) where there is cut-money and syndicate culture," Ghosh told ANI.Ghosh said that BJP will not be affected in way with the exit of Mukul Roy."He is an experienced politician. Whatever he has done, he must have done with a proper planning. The BJP will not be affected in any way by his exit. People are joining the party in thousands, if a few of them have some problem, they can leave. It is their personal problem, not party's," the BJP leader added.He further said that the BJP embraces everyone and also gives them responsibility as it functions in a democratic manner. He added that there are some who can not work with discipline and a commitment towards its ideology and such people leave.Ghosh also said that the party was built by old workers who remain committed to the party and will remain with the party."We do not care much about 'Aaya Ram Gaya Rams' (turncoats), we care for our old party workers," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/not-everyone-can-stay-in-bjp-dilip-ghose-on-mukul-roy-s-return-to-tmc-101623538578183.html

The Payal constituency is currently represented by Congress MLA Lakhvir Singh Lakha.Soon after the alliance was announced on Saturday, SAD and BSP leaders came together at Jalandhar Bypass Chowk and stated that they are confident of winning the 2022 state assembly polls. Even as BSP was not able to make a mark in the North constituency in the past, leaders stated the SAD-BSP combine will defeat the Congress. SAD had contested the 2017 assembly elections in alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in which the latter’s candidate Praveen Bansal (39,732 votes) lost to Rakesh Pandey (44,864 votes) by a margin of 5,132 votes. The BSP remained a no show and secured only 1,513 votes here in 2017.BSP district president Jeet Ram Basra said, “Congress has lost its ground as it has failed to fulfill the promises made during the last elections. Further, Pandey has also failed to work for the betterment of residents. He has even stopped meeting people of the constituency. BSP-SAD will surely win the North constituency in the upcoming elections.”Basra said there are a few BSP leaders who have been working in the constituency and the candidate will be finalised by the high command soon.Similarly, SAD district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon said, “The parties have joined hands after 25 years as earlier both the parties contested Lok Sabha elections in alliance in 1996. SAD-BSP are like-minded parties and we are confident of winning the upcoming elections as Congress has not been able to meet the expectations and fulfill the promises made to the public in the past.”Meanwhile, MLA Pandey, who was first elected from the seat in 1992 and has been representing the constituency for the last three decades, said, “It is too early to predict the results. The opposition can make big claims but the voters of Ludhiana North have always stood by my side and with the Congress party.”The major areas falling under the North constituency include Haibowal, Salem Tabri, Chhawani Mohalla, area around Clock Tower, portion of Field Ganj among other areas. As Buddha Nullah moves through the constituency and touches areas starting from Salem Tabri to Haibowal, pollution in the nullah and unhygienic conditions in the vicinity have been a major issue. Despite making tall claims in the previous elections, the authorities and public representatives failed to solve the problems. Residents here have also been raising the issue of potholed roads and contaminated water supply. SAD aspirants left disappointed SAD leaders Madan Lal Bagga and Vijay Danav who have been eyeing a party ticket from Ludhiana north constituency were disappointed after the announcement, as per party leaders.However, when contacted after the announcement of alliance, the leaders took a safe side and stated that they stand by the decision of the party and will support the BSP candidate.Bagga had contested the 2017 elections as an independent candidate after he was expelled from the party due to his rebellious attitude. He secured 12,136 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2022-punjab-polls-bsp-sad-eyes-congress-bastion-led-by-pandey-in-ludhiana-101623528752714.html
13-06-2021||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: In peril, Siswan treasure||The Punjab forests and wildlife preservation department’s lack of on-ground supervision at the Siswan Community Reserve has led to a complexity of threats to the wild flora and fauna. Taking advantage of easy access to Siswan Dam’s far end, fish poachers from the main highway to Baddi intrude in broad daylight and cast nets for small fish or minnows. Such wanton poaching takes away the small fish that are the staple diet for kingfishers, cormorants and wetland birds, including a diverse range of migratory species in passage. Fish poachers pay no heed to the avian life and disturb rare species foraging on the banks such as the greater sand plover. Their desire for fish, even the small ones, is compulsive as they fry and relish these as snacks with the night-time hooch or cheap liquor. Since there is no regular patrolling by forest guards, village dogs have created mayhem by massacring thirsty sambar fawns. Well-heeled tipplers drive their vehicles right down to the dam’s far end (where the rivulets enter from the foothills) and indulge in booze binges, evidenced by the upmarket alcohol bottles found littered in the water and on the bank. Ironically, the department has facilitated access by vehicles to the pondage area from the dam’s far side but has done little to ensure that patrolling or supervision insulates wildlife from poaching and disturbance. Interestingly, the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, submitted a detailed management plan for Siswan in 2017 after it was commissioned by the department.When this writer brought the dismal scenario to the notice of Punjab chief wildlife warden RK Mishra, he assured that a plan for Siswan’s supervision and protection will soon be drawn up by the divisional forest officer concerned. “I fully agree that this precious biodiversity reserve needs to be safeguarded from the threats you have brought to my notice,” Mishra told this writer.Good old blood and guts The hapless Sambar fawn is the fall guy for the unnatural predation by village dog packs at drying water holes and dams in the Shivalik foothills. In my rambles deep into the Shivaliks over the last two decades, I observed that the other two principal mammals, wild boar and barking deer, have gone virtually unscathed. As compared to sambars, the barking deer is too nimble, clandestine and smart a target for dog packs. The boar, on the other hand, is a formidable, well-armed opponent as compared to a sambar. The male sambar, when cornered, can merely wave its antler stack in the air or attempt to deliver a clumsy kick with its hind legs to the very agile hounds. Boars frequent water holes mostly at night when lurking dog packs are less active due to fear of leopards and are usually encountered in sounders, making them a difficult piece of meat. But the crucial factor is the boar’s defence system anchored by lethal, upward curving tusks and a thick, bristling hide. The boar’s stout neck is armour plated with hide and bristles and dogs find it difficult to lock their canine teeth and secure a killing grip.Leave aside the fate of less formidable village dog or mongrel hunting packs, pugnacious boars are known to have ripped apart and killed robust, trained hunting dogs such as bull terriers, pointers and bullies with their tusks. Boars bite hard into the soft flanks of dogs with their formidable dentition and cannot be shaken off easily. Even tigers and leopards have on occasion backed off from an old, irascible tusked boar unwilling to retreat but very willing to plunge into a headlong bloody battle.A wounded boar can run and dodge for several kilometres, greatly testing the pursuing dogs. Boars easily take refuge in thorny lantana but the invasive weed lacerates the softer skin of the pursuing dog and stymies the chase. The long legs and big, flapping ears of the sambar allow dogs to easily grip and bite the tendons to retard the deer’s getaway speed but boar legs and ears are shorter and prove evasive for snapping dog jaws. vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wildbuzz-in-peril-siswan-treasure-101623528093261.html

13-06-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: Smack down drug habit||The malice of drug abuse was unheard of when we were young and seems to be the fruit of a new affluent era. It is a silent but lethal weapon that has the potential to destroy the youth. The desire to make a quick buck, peer pressure, questionable company and youngsters’ week moral foundation have encouraged drug trafficking. Studies have revealed that schoolchildren are often targeted by peddlers and once they are hooked, they not only become regular customers but also help sell the narcotics. The government is not doing enough to control this menace; thus, the onus falls on parents and teachers to ensure that their wards are strong enough to not succumb to temptation. It sounds easy enough. However, how many parents will be successful in getting through to their children. It is traumatising for parents to realise that their child has become addicted to drugs. The clues are in the child’s changing behaviour — aloofness, poor eating habits, and declining performance in school. Those from affluent families have little trouble in procuring drugs. However, those with financial constraints start stealing and borrowing money and selling household items to fund their habit. Most of the times, parents can do little to wean off their child from drugs as they lack awareness. Providing professional help through a counsellor or psychiatrist does not come cheap. Besides, consulting a shrink is still taboo in our society. Gradually, it starts affecting the child’s health. Gender gap in treatment Those admitted to de-addiction centres hardly come out clean, and in many cases relapse soon after. It is worse for women who fall prey to the disease because of the social stigma and lack of proper de-addiction centres. Thus, a lot of women addicts remain untreated inching towards a slow death. I know a lot of families who are going through this ordeal. A man died in his mid-30s despite being admitted to a reputed de-addiction clinic as he relapsed after returning home. The pain of parents, who had to cremate their young son, is unimaginable. He is survived by his wife and two young daughters, who will forever feel the void. The parents of another addict who was gradually deteriorating tried to marry him off, hoping that it might help him recover, but who would marry an addict? The father, a senior retired officer, could do nothing but to see his middle -aged son die of an overdose. Families destroyed My aunt took a massive loan to send her son to the United States of America to fulfil his dreams. While abroad, the boy suffered some racial attacks and took to drinking. This turned into an addiction. The damage to his liver was so severe that he succumbed. Another housewife I know has not been able to overcome temptation of binge drinking despite undergoing some treatment. Her young daughter is a wreck after seeing her in a drunken state every evening. Her parents and spouse do their bit but there is no real solution. At times addicts come out strong only when their conscience pricks at them and they develop an iron will to resist the siren call. Sometimes sheer motivation helps them beat the addiction. The affliction has consumed numerous people, consigning their near and dear ones watch them decline helplessly. At times, one feels the affliction is worse than cancer, because it can be treated if detected in time. Here, the dear ones die every day watching the impending tragedy unfold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-smack-down-drug-habit-101623527673530.html

After a meeting at the party office in Lucknow on Saturday called to expand the party’s base ahead of 2022 Uttar Pradesh polls, she urged the party leaders and workers to start holding small meetings of the party cadres across the state. These cadres, she said, would connect with the masses and remind them of the various initiatives and works undertaken by the BSP leadership when the party was in power in the state. “We need to continue with such small cadre meetings,” said the four-time former UP chief minister. At the meeting, she cautioned cadres against those party leaders who were deserting the party for individual gains. “We have to realign ourselves and work with missionary zeal to ensure a BSP government in the state that works for the welfare of all. The party people must trust cadre more than such leaders who take the name of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram ji but who get sold out for individual gains,” Mayawati said at the meeting. The BSP had 18 MLAs in the state’s legislative assembly but after rebellion of 9 lawmakers, including Ramvir Upadhyaya, Anil Singh, Aslam Raini, Aslam Ali, Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind, Hargovind Bhargava, Sushma Patel, Vandana Singh as well as recent expulsion of Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar, the party’s effective strength has since been reduced to seven MLAs. In fact, as she spoke, one of her suspended party MLAs Ramvir Upadhyaya, whose son Chiragvir has already joined the BJP, was seen with BJP leaders in Mathura. Upadhyaya was among BSP’s key Brahmin leaders who served as power minister in the Maya government in 2007.“We are in an election year now so the effective current strength of parties in assembly is meaningless. The model code would come into force in another seven to eight months’ time. Defections are common in an election year but those who have left BSP for other parties have soon realised that they have been used,” a BSP leader said. At the meeting Mayawati, party leaders said, cautioned the cadres against leaders who ‘bik jaate hain’ (get sold out). “Such people don’t hesitate about harming the party movement and get sold out though in the end these people end up harming themselves the most which they realise later. We need to stay wary of such people,” she said. Mayawati followed the ‘bik jaate hain’ phrase by reminding the cadre that BSP was a ‘movement-based’ party which unlike other political parties, didn’t rely on donations from corporate world. Instead, it relied on cadres for support, a BSP leader said. This was the first time Mayawati spoke after expelling two of her trusted MLAs in the party— veteran Lalji Verma and former UP BSP chief Ramachal Rajbhar. Both the leaders expelled on the charges of anti-party activities during the recently concluded panchayat elections had denied that they were in touch with either the BJP or SP and appealed to Mayawati to give them a hearing.The BSP chief, however, hasn’t responded to their appeals so far. Party cadres felt Mayawati’s address to the cadres to be cautious about ‘opportunists’ was in a way an attempt to pre-empt more desertions from the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maya-cautions-bsp-cadres-against-leaders-who-sell-out-for-personal-gain-101623527613146.html

In another major respite, the number of daily deaths also dipped to two, a first in three months.The district currently has 1,531 active cases. Since the outbreak in March 2020, Ludhiana has recorded a total of 86,153 Covid cases and 2,060 deaths.It was on March 8 this year that the daily count of cases remained in double digits at 92 following which the cases consistently went up, reaching a peak of 1,729 on May 9.The two who died on Saturday are women aged 65 and 57, residents of Mandaini Kalan and Guru Nanak Colony respectively.There are 26 Covid patients currently on ventilator support in various hospitals of the city.The daily count cases first started swelling on April 25 when a burgeoning 1,389 cases were recorded. On this day, the cases had not only surpassed the 1,000-mark but also increased by a whopping 60% from the previous day’s count of 861 cases.The spike then continued for the next two weeks, reaching an initial peak of 1,600 cases on May 1 followed by 1,729 cases and 22 deaths on May 9. On May 10 and May 11, the death count was 30 which sent a wave of panic across the city and left the cremation grounds choked to capacity. All hospitals in the city were fully occupied during this time with the medical fraternity going through the worst of times, witnessing horrifying moments with so many deaths happening on a daily basis.The huge number of daily cases and deaths fuelled the administration to announce a slew of restrictions, including a 17-hour daily curfew from May 9. Restrictions started to ease only after May 20 when curfew timings were first relaxed with shops being allowed to open till 1pm instead of noon. At present, all shops are open from 5am to 6pm on all week days and Saturdays.Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said while it is a huge respite that daily cases and deaths have come down, there should be no complacency and residents should adhere to wearing masks and practicing social distancing at all times. “Venture out of homes only when absolutely necessary. As restrictions are being eased, it is observed that people tend to be casual, which should not happen as we have to avoid the third wave,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhianas-daily-covid-count-goes-below-100-for-first-time-in-96-days-101623527557734.html

13-06-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: Ride with a real reel-life character||Characters in films are often inspired by real people. However, sometimes it so happens that a character from the reel manifests in real life as well. It so happened that I was driving towards Shimla from Nahan when I stopped at a roadside tea stall near Chandigarh to grab a bite. There I caught sight of a handsome middle-aged man speaking to the stall owner, his baritone clearly audible to everybody in the vicinity. His bus had broken down and he desperately wanted a lift up to Shimla. I recognised him at a glance, he was none other than Manu Gupta, the irritating blabbermouth from 2011 movie, Chalo Dilli, essayed by the versatile Vinay Pathak. Impulsively, I offered him a lift and in no time he was cheerfully sitting beside me, sprouting a steady stream of chatter. In a little while, I realised that we were reliving a scene from the movie, only instead of Mihika, played by Lara Dutta, I was the victim of his endless blabber. He would start a full-blown commentary at everything that came in sight. As we zoomed pass an election rally, he immediately got fresh ammunition. “In politicians ka bhi koi dharm imaan nahin hota!” he began, pontificating on the subject for a few kilometers. The conversation then seamlessly segued into corruption in society. A billboard displaying the poster of the latest movie triggered a monologue on the quality of movies of yore. His mouth seemed to be a pause-less cassette player. However, to his credit, his comments were witty and knowledgeable. By the time we crossed Chandigarh and entered Kalka, I was exasperated by his constant chatter. Hoping to dam the cascade, I turned on the CD player. Reaching common ground I had always been a lover of classical Hindustani music and only had those CDs in my car. A chota khayal rendition in Raga Yaman had just started when my co-passenger exclaimed, “Wah! Wah! I simply adore his voice. Pure bliss!” My incredulity must have been apparent on my face because he blurted out, “Arre bhai saab! It is the inimitable Bhimsen Joshi, who else? His melodious voice always soaks my mind and soul!” His acquaintance with classical music astonished me and he steadily rose in my esteem. At Dharampur, we made a pit stop at Gyani Ka Dhaba. While ordering food, I asked my companion if he would like some beer. He eagerly responded in the affirmative. After finishing our food and beer, I took out my wallet and cast an oblique glance towards my partner, half expecting him to offer to pay. But no protests came as I settled the bill as he was busy comparing the voices of Pandit Jasraj and Bhimsen Joshi. I had yet again revised my opinion about my new travel buddy by the time we resumed our drive. Now, he seemed to be a parasitic freeloader who fooled people through sycophancy and smooth talk. For the rest of the journey, he remained unusually silent most of the time, perhaps lost in the euphoria induced by the beer and music. I dropped him at his destination in Shimla and forgot about the episode. A friend in need But this narrative does not end here. It reached an interesting climax a few months ago. We were living at our winter sojourn in Panchkula when the second wave of Covid swooped in. My wife was severely infected. It was a very difficult time with the blood oxygen in her body dipping to alarming levels and no vacancy available in any hospital. I tried hard to procure an oxygen concentrator but without success. I dropped a message in all the WhatsApp groups stating my desperate requirement. One evening, when I returned to my flat, I found an oxygen concentrator delivered anonymously. There was a note attached to it with a phone number, requesting to be informed when the need for the machine was fulfilled. I immediately dialled the number to offer my gratitude. After a brief pause, a familiar voice boomed from the other side: “Perhaps, I have slipped from your memory, bhai saab! But how can I forget that blissful drive with beer and Bhimsen Joshi on the serpentine road to Shimla! No, you don’t have to thank me or pay me anything. I have just earned that beer as well as that rapturous ride today after 10 years!” The writer is a Shimla-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-ride-with-a-real-reel-life-character-101623527316307.html

The accused Gurdas Singh, his mother Krishna Devi of Ranjit Nagar, Kharar; her sister Raj Dulari and Gurdas’ friend Dinesh Singh of Santemajra, were sent to a four-day police remand on Saturday. The victim, Maya Devi of Kharar, was found murdered in a manhole near Morinda on Thursday. She had lent the accused ₹2.5 lakh and was killed when she demanded the money back. The car, in which Maya was murdered, has been recovered, police said. The vehicle had been rented by Gurdas, who organises tours for a living, and was driven by Dinesh, who works at a hotel in Kharar. Police said Krishna and Raj Dulari forced Maya into the car and covered her face to prevent her from raising the alarm. Later, Krishna and Gurdas strangled her. After Maya fell unconscious, the accused popped a pesticide tablet in her mouth before dumping her body, 20km from Morinda, police said. A case has been registered on the complaint of the victim’s son Vikas Tomar under Sections 302 (murder) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at the Kharar (City) police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/motherson-duo-among-four-held-for-kharar-moneylender-s-murder-101623527072386.html
13-06-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: Executive accountability in Covid – a fool’s errand||As the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic causes carnage throughout the country, the legislature has been conspicuously silent, refusing to convene, ostensibly on grounds of the danger posed by the pandemic to members of the House.Against this backdrop, it is pertinent to understand the system of government envisaged under the Constitution and whether this system has fulfilled its original purpose during the times of the pandemic. India is a Parliamentary democracy based on the Westminster model where the executive emanates from the legislature. The executive power of the Union vests in the President but he is merely a formal figurehead. A closer reading of the Constituent Assembly Debates sheds light on the architecture of Indian polity. Elaborating on the position of the President, Dr BR Ambedkar, had said, “He is the head of the State but not of the executive. He represents the nation but does not rule the nation.”The Apex Court has reaffirmed the Parliamentary nature of the executive and has said that the satisfaction of the President does not require his personal satisfaction but satisfaction in the constitutional sense, that is, of the council of ministers.Ambedkar felt a non-parliamentary executive will be less responsibleThe chief protagonist of the parliamentary system was Dr Ambedkar who believed that a non-parliamentary executive will be less responsible. In comparisons drawn with the American presidential system, where strict separation between the legislature and executive existed, the consensus was that it created impunity for the executive. The parliamentary system, it was argued, will preclude the possibility of a dictatorial executive through the principle of collective responsibility. More importantly, it provided for daily assessment of responsibility through questions, resolutions and debates. Such daily assessment, according to Ambedkar, was more effective and necessary than the periodic assessment done by the electorate at time of the election. Thus, the touchstone for choosing the system of government was the one providing greater responsibility.The inefficiency of the legislature in exercising vigil over the executive has reached the nadir under Covid. Data from PRS Legislative Research reveals that the Lok Sabha has cumulatively met for 34 days in the financial year 2020-21, lowest to date. The 2020 budget session shortened amid the pandemic outbreak, which was followed by a curtailed monsoon session where the question hour was suspended. The winter session was cancelled altogether. The 2021 budget session was adjourned sine die on March 25, two weeks ahead of the original schedule.The constitutional imperative on calling of sessions is that a period of six months shall not elapse between the last sitting of one session and the first sitting of the next. However, the government of the day enjoys discretion in summoning and proroguing of sessions (excepting cases where President exercises discretion). This provision has been opportunistically utilised to reduce the legislature to a rubber stamp for bulldozing of the annual budget, approval for ordinances and passing of laws through its brute majority. But as evidenced by the Constituent Assembly debates, the legislature is much more than just a law-making forum. The true performance metric of the executive for its daily activities lies in the legislature.Executive has unchallenged monopoly in summoning sessionsHowever, the current system ensures the predominance of the executive as it has an unchallenged monopoly in summoning of sessions. In such a scenario, daily assessment of the executive is woefully inadequate when the legislature refuses to meet regularly during a public health emergency such as the pandemic. At a time when the executive has abjectly failed in designing a coherent vaccine policy and securing seamless medical supplies, the legislature does not have an avenue to expeditiously hold the executive accountable since the government can avoid scrutiny by conveniently paying lip service to the six-month condition. Time is of the utmost essence, and it would be futile for the legislature to do a post-mortem analysis of the executive once the tide has passed. This loophole has unintentionally created a crippled legislature leaving it ill-equipped to carry out its basic function of ensuring ‘greater responsibility’.Thus, the current design of Indian Parliamentary system with no fixed calendar and vesting the executive with the sole power to convene a session is dysfunctional. It betrays the original principle of greater responsibility and compromises the independence of the legislature. The indifferent attitude of the executive during Covid-19 is merely a symptom. The real disease lies in the hollow functioning of our parliamentary system and until we have a thorough reinforcement of the parliamentary ethic and spirit, daily assessment will remain elusive.(The writer is an advocate at the Punjab and Hayana high court.

The power went out at 9.30pm and could not be restored till about 2am in several areas. In some areas, the supply resumed around 11am on Saturday.In areas connected to the sub-stations of Kitchlu Nagar, GT Road and Chaura Bazaar, it took more than six hours for workers to rectify the fault. Residents of Pritam Nagar were in for a shock as power went out again on Friday, a day after it was restored after a 48-hour outage that started on Tuesday. Angry residents came out their houses and staged a protest against Punjab State Power Corporation Limited officials. They said that the transformer in the area got damaged but despite submitting complaints online, supply was not restored till 11am on Saturday.Varun Gupta, a resident of Pritam Nagar, said, “At 9.30 pm, the power suddenly went off. Our family could sleep the whole night due to the unscheduled power cut.”The situation was no different in areas such as Punjab Mata Nagar and Pakhowal Road where power was restored after 14 hours. PSPCL officials said that in many areas, transformers got damaged due to excessive load. Ishneet Sharma, a resident of Punjab Mata Nagar, said, “Due to the outage, I was not able to sleep last night. Usually, the fault is rectified in one or two hours but after Friday’s power cut, supply was restored around 11am on Saturday. Water supply on the first and second floors of the house was also affected due to this.”In Surjit Colony, no power since 3 daysFor the last three days, residents of Surjit Nagar have been without electricity. With no power to run household appliances and erratic water supply posing a problem, residents say the experience is nightmarish. “We have called the helpline number but even after registering a complaint, no one has come to resolve our issue. We are living in hell as there is no power or water at home. We have been purchasing drinking water for the last three days. For washing clothes and bathing, we have no water. We have no option but to wait till regular supply resumes,” said Sukhwinder Kaur, a resident.As per officials, workers are repairing the faults in two areas Aggar Nagar and Focal point and will restore the power by evening. PSPCL chief engineer, distribution (central), Bhupinder Singh Khosla, said, “The blackout was due to a problem in the feeder on Hambran Road. It took several hours to fix the problem. Workers remained on their toes the entire night and used flood lights to check the fault. Supply in most areas was restored between 1 to 2 pm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/blackout-in-ludhiana-as-220-kv-feeder-develops-a-snag-101623526892566.html

Rathod was arrested last month in a bribery case. A senior ACB officer said that as such as the agency had seized ₹3.46 crore in cash from his official bungalow at Aarey Milk Colony, Goregaon (East), there is strong possibility that he may have amassed illegitimate assets during his service all these years. The cash was hidden under a bed, in gunny bags kept in the backyard and on the terrace. During the open inquiry, all the movable and immovable assets – including Rathod’s savings in bank, lockers, private investments, insurances –would be scrutinised to ascertain if the assets owned by him are from sources other than his known income. “To ascertain the quantum of possible illegal assets, an open inquiry has been initiated against him. Generally, such an open inquiry takes nearly six months. But given the high amount of cash seized from his official residence, we have expedited the process and are trying to complete it as soon as possible. If the inquiry finds out excess properties in the names of Rathod or any of his family members, then a fresh case of DA will be registered against him,” the officer said. Rathod, 42, was arrested on May 24 after his aide Arvind Tribhuvam Tiwari, 57, was nabbed while accepting ₹50,000 on the CEO’s behalf. A resident from Aarey Colony had complained to ACB against Rathod on May 14 for allegedly demanding bribe from him for granting permission to carry out the repair work of his house. It is mandatory to secure prior permission from the office of CEO to carry out any construction/repairing work at Aarey Milk Colony, as the state owns the area. Rathod, who was also holding the charge of the deputy commissioner of Worli Dairy – which is considered to be a post held by a senior bureaucrat – is in judicial custody. He is facing charges under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/disproportionate-assets-case-acb-starts-open-inquiry-against-aarey-colony-ceo-101623526351828.html

He had also met President Ram Nath Kovind before returning here on Friday evening.Back in the state capital, he met more than 12 legislators, two MPs, a few ministers and BJP office bearers from some districts. He viewed a presentation about the progress of implementation of a vision document for development of Ayodhya and also asked senior officers to take necessary action to step up the economic activity.What came up for discussions at the meetings with legislators and MPs was not immediately known. An official spokesman said the chief minister keeps on meeting public representatives almost regularly and he carried on with his official business as usual.“The chief minister wants economic activity stepped up in the state. He has given directives to ensure that vacant posts in different departments are filled and people get jobs. He wants more loan melas to be organised and expeditious implementation of development projects,” said a senior official functionary.“The Uttar Pradesh government has given about four lakh government jobs in the past four years and the chief minister wants this number to be taken to five lakh jobs by December 2021,” said the functionary.About the cabinet reshuffle, the functionary said more discussions may be required with the party leaders before any final call was taken on the issue.The names of former bureaucrat and BJP MLC Arvind Kumar Sharma, former Union minister Jitin Prasada and leaders of BJP’s allies are already doing rounds in the corridors of power here. The BJP’s allies, including Apna Dal (Sone Lal) and Nishad Party, have been pressing for their representation in the state and central ministries. Apna Dal (Sone Lal) MP Anupriya Patel and Nishad Party chief Sanjay Nishad had met union minister Amit Shah in New Delhi and raised the issue there. A senior BJP office bearer said the party and government would do all that may be needed to step up preparations for the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP leadership may have more discussions at various levels on the issue and an appropriate decision would be taken at the appropriate time, said the office bearer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/after-returning-from-delhi-it-is-business-as-usual-for-yogi-in-lucknow-101623525872980.html

The security forces have cordoned off the area.Lashkar behind ambushThe Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) was behind the attack on security forces in Sopore, J&K director general of police (DGP) Dilbag Singh said here.On the sidelines of a wreath-laying ceremony for the two slain police constables, Singh asserted that the perpetrators had been identified and would be brought to justice very soon.He said it was a Sopore police station team on Covid-19 duty that came under attack. Even as they mounted a retaliation, four police personnel and three civilians were injured, the DGP said.Constables Waseem Ahmad and Showkat Ahmad succumbed to injuries later, while sub-inspector Mukesh Kumar and special police officer Danish are undergoing treatment, and their condition is stated to be stable, he said.The civilians who died in the firing were identified as Manzoor Ahamd Shalla of Shalimar Colony and Bashir Ahmad Pahloo of Taliyan, Sopore.

Fadnavis made the statement a day after poll strategist Prashant Kishor met Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar at the latter’s Mumbai residence for three hours, fuelling speculations that efforts were on to form a national coalition against the ruling BJP for the next national elections. “There are no restrictions on meeting people. Those in ruling as well as in opposition parties prepare their strategies. But let me tell you one thing, irrespective of the strategies prepared, Modiji will come back even in 2024 elections,” Fadnavis said in response to the meeting.Pawar has been insisting on a united forum of opposition parties to take on the BJP, which is in power for the second consecutive term.Dismissing other speculations, the NCP clarified that it is not giving any responsibility to Kishor for making political strategies for the party. Party chief spokesperson Nawab Malik said Kishor may have discussed the current political situation. “The party is not considering to rope in Kishor to formulate strategies. He is an experienced strategist and has the ability to see things with different angles and understand them well. We believe he shared his experiences with Pawar saheb and discussed the political situation in the country,” Malik said on Saturday.“It’s true that Pawar saheb wants to bring all the opposition leaders together and he has been vocal on this issue. He had planned to visit West Bengal during the Assembly polls, but had to postpone the visit due to health issues.

As per the recent data of positive samples sent from microbiology department, GMCH Jammu, to National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi, for genetic sequencing, 68.5% of the infected patients were reported to have B.1.617.2 variant, generally known as the double mutant and classified as a variant of concern by the WHO.She added said that the mortality rate among patients admitted at GMCH’s in the high-dependency unit was 62.5% in those infected with the variant of concern, with a huge number of young patients, indicating the higher public health implications of the variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delta-variant-led-to-raging-second-wave-in-j-k-say-experts-101623525575617.html

13-06-2021||Mumbai||Maratha quota stir set to intensify from June 16||The agitation for restoring the Maratha quota scrapped by the Supreme Court (SC) in May is likely to intensify in the coming days as groups and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati have begun mobilising the community. The agitation is set to begin on June 16. On Saturday, Sambhajiraje visited Kopardi village in Ahmednagar where a minor girl from the community was raped and brutally murdered in 2016, triggering a large-scale agitation for justice for the victim, along with their old demand of reservation. After visiting the village, Chhatrapati demanded formation of a special bench of the Bombay high court (HC) to complete the hearing in six months in order to provide justice to the affected family.He then visited residence of Kakasaheb Shinde, a 28-year old Maratha youth in Aurangabad district, who committed suicide by jumping into the Godavari river in July 2018. He was the first youth who committed suicide demanding reservation after which a few more youths from the community ended their lives for the demand. He also reiterated this announcement that Maratha outfits will start holding silent protests for reservation from June 16.Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, a descendant of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji, has taken the lead for providing reservation to the community after the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act 2018, which was enacted by the state government to provide quota to the community, was quashed by the Supreme Court on May 5.“Today I met the family. They want justice as the case is still pending before the high court. I want the state government to write to the high court to constitute a special bench and complete the hearing in six months. I will also personally speak to the chief minister on this,”Chhatrapati told reporters.“As decided, we will start our agitations from June 16 demanding reservation for the Maratha community. We will be holding silent protests across 36 districts, which will start from Kolhapur,” Chhatrapati said.The BJP MP had given an ultimatum till June 6 to the state government for taking decisions on the demands put forth by him, after which he announced to start silent protests on June 6. The demands include review and curative petitions in the Supreme Court against its order to scrap the quota, as well as a petition to the Centre for the reservation. Besides, he also had demanded other benefits such as hostel facilities and scholarships for the community’s students and revival of Sarthi — a Pune-based institute — to ensure educational and social well-being of Maratha youth.On May 5, the Supreme Court quashed the 12% and 13% reservation given in education and jobs to Maratha community under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018. The state government then appointed a committee of retired high court judge Dilip Bhosale to study the ruling and suggest a way forward. In its report, the committee has recommended the government to move a review petition in the SC challenging its verdict.On July 13, 2016, a 14-year-old from Kopardi village in Ahmednagar district was raped and brutally murdered by three men from Dalit community. The incident had triggered silent protests by the Maratha community demanding justice to the family. The trial of the case was completed in a fast track court. The Ahmednagar sessions court has found all three accused guilty of the charges of rape and murder and pronounced death sentence on November 29, 2017||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-quota-stir-set-to-intensify-from-june-16-101623525331733.html

However, due to heavy rainfall and waterlogging, many low-lying parts of the city experienced slow-moving traffic,” said a traffic police officer.A study by TomTom, that analyses traffic data and provides real time traffic management data of 416 cities worldwide, showed that this year, during the lockdown months of March, April and May, traffic congestion in Mumbai was the lowest at 8% on the 16th and 17th weeks (April 19-25 and April 26-30). This means that it took 8% more travel time to reach their destinations.The graph from March to June, as revealed by TomTom, pointed out that in the 9th week (March 1-7), the traffic congestion was at 32% percent – the highest this year – in Mumbai which came down in the 16th and 17th weeks and again rose to 20% in the 22nd week.“In January 2020 (pre-lockdown), the congestion level was 64% in Mumbai. The congestion levels measured in March, April and May 2021 were 29%, 14% and 11%, respectively – which is a tremendous reduction in the congestion levels owing to the state lockdown,” said Parag Bedarkar, manager, enterprise sales, TomTom.In 2020, when a complete lockdown was announced in Mumbai, the 10th week (March 2-8) showed the congestion level at 45%, but it dropped to 0% on week 22 (May 25-31), which meant that an emergency worker could reach one point to another in time in the city. Mumbai was among the three cities of India that feature in the top 10 most-congested cities in the world, as per TomTom Traffic Index 2020. With 53% of traffic congestion in January-December 2020, Mumbai ranked second in the world after Moscow, which had 54% traffic congestion. The four cities from India which featured in TomTom list, which analysis real-time traffic to help drivers and city planners to manage traffic, are Mumbai, Delhi, Pune and Bengaluru. The other global cities that had featured in the top 10 include Manila (Philippines), Bogota (Colombia), Moscow (Russia), Lima (Peru), Istanbul (Turkey) and Jakarta (Indonesia).In 2019, Mumbai was the fourth-congested city with 65% congestion and in 2018, it ranked number two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/double-the-vehicles-on-mumbai-s-roads-after-unlocking-101623525091743.html

Given the strict quarantine rules, many have been discouraged from registering at vaccination centres outside the campus,” said a student requesting anonymity.Students have raised four major concerns, he said. “IIT-B should hold a free vaccination programme because that is the policy declared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. If IIT-B takes the private vaccination route, then it should do so at the rate decided by the government. If the price is higher than the one decided by the government, then the institute must provide a satisfactory justification for it and not just conjectures. In case there is a private vaccination drive, the institute must provide financial assistance to those who want it,” read a statement by students.Despite registering at a government vaccination centre, the hospital on campus has not been able to procure vaccine doses. The institute is now planning to hold a vaccination drive with the help of private hospitals for its students on campus.A workplace vaccination drive is being planned where beneficiaries have to pay ₹1,000 plus taxes, much to the disappointment of students. Tapanendu Kundu, dean, student affairs, said, “We are doing our best to reduce the financial burden on students for vaccination. The aim is to get more and more students inoculated during the drive. There are no government rules for institutes to pay for students’ vaccines.”The institute is considering to adjust the vaccination charges in the fee paid by students towards hostel amenities. “We are also in touch with alumni groups to raise funds for the vaccination drive,” said Kundu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chorus-for-free-vax-on-campus-grows-at-iitbombay-101623524972731.html
13-06-2021||Chandigarh||Capt, Sisodia in war of words over state of school education||A bitter war of words has erupted between Punjab chief minister (CM) Capt Amarinder Singh and Delhi deputy CM and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Manish Sisodia over the Performance Grading Index 2019-20. In the performance grading index of school education released by the Centre on June 5, Punjab topped the chart with a score of 929 out of 1,000, followed by Chandigarh (912) and Tamil Nadu (906). Whereas Delhi is at number six in these rankings.While Sisodia, who is also the Delhi education minister, on Saturday alleged a “secret” friendship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amarinder, the latter said the AAP was crying foul in the face of its imminent wipeout from Punjab in the 2022 assembly polls. Sisodia claimed that Punjab’s government schools are in a “miserable state” yet the Central report says that the schools are outstanding. “This shows ‘jugalbandi’ between two leaders,” he added.“Captain (Amarinder Singh) has got the blessings of Modiji. Delhi’s schools have been ranked much below. Nearly 800 government schools in Punjab have been shut down in the last five years and many schools have been handed over to private entities but Punjab has been ranked on the top,” he said.Sisodia alleged that Punjab’s government schools have poor educational facilities for students and parents prefer to send their children to private schools. The index is an effort to hide the incompetence of the Punjab government in the field of school education, he alleged.“Maybe later, the government might release a report saying Punjab’s hospitals are best. There is a secret friendship between Modiji and Captain,” Sisodia added. Ridiculing the allegations, Amarinder said the AAP leadership was so obsessed with electoral politics that it saw poll conspiracies even in something as basic as school education. The fact was that the AAP, which had failed to make a dent in Punjab’s political arena over the past over four years, beginning with its poor performance in the 2017 elections, could see the rout, which it was facing in 2022, he added. “Come to Punjab and I will show you around our schools. Revamp of the state’s schools was an exercise undertaken by the Congress government as a top priority, and the Performance Grading Index reflected the success of those efforts,” said Amarinder. “If you are really interested in improving the education system of Delhi, maybe you should do a ‘jugalbandi’ with me, and I will teach you how to manage things better,” Amarinder said. “From a ranking of 22 on the earlier index that was in place when I took over as CM to Number 1 on the scale, Punjab’s school education has undergone a massive transformation,” the CM said.“Your political dialogues cannot undermine this success,” he said, terming Sisodia’s comments as an obvious case of sour grapes. Meanwhile, Punjab school education minister Vijay Inder Singla said teachers and staff of the Punjab education department have worked hard to bring the state to the top position. He added that it also helped increase around 15% enrolment in government schools. “More than three lakh private school students have shifted to government schools in the past two years,” Singla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-sisodia-in-war-of-words-over-state-of-school-education-101623524972274.html

NAAC accreditation is a performance indicator for higher educational institutes and is mandatory for applying for funds from Central agencies. The university had been granted a ‘Grade A’ score by NAAC in 2012. However, the score expired in March 2017 after the university failed to apply for re-accreditation in time.The university is now entering a fifth academic year without a NAAC grade as the accreditation process remains on hold. While the varsity submitted its self-study report (SSR) to the NAAC committee early this year, the council is yet to send a peer review committee for a visit to its campuses in Mumbai. “Because of the pandemic and the lockdown in Mumbai, the peer review has not happened yet. We have completed our part of the application process and are waiting for the NAAC committee to visit,” said a senior official from MU.The peer review team was expected for a visit in February. “A peer team is a contingent of various members. It’s a big team. It is likely that amid travel restrictions and strict quarantine rules, the council has not been able to put a team together,” said the official. The university took a while to complete its application process and put together all documents. In December 2019, the varsity had submitted the institutional information for quality assessment (IIQA) and the same was approved by the apex grading body. The process for SSR, however, got delayed as the university was shut for at least six months in 2020 due to the pandemic and eventual lockdown.While IIQA is a document recording the university’s compliance with the criteria and policies of the NAAC committee, SSR is a form of self-evaluation to identify strengths and rectify deficiencies.“We are now waiting for the peer review team’s visit to our campuses. We are completely prepared for the next steps of the application process,” said Ravindra Kulkarni, pro-vice chancellor, MU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/application-stuck-amid-lockdown-university-of-mumbai-s-likely-to-enter-5th-yr-without-naac-grade-101623524851779.html

So far, the Centre has not issued any guidelines allowing door-to-door vaccination. The state task force on vaccination is working on formulating protocol and guidelines for allowing home vaccination of such citizens. “The Maharashtra government is planning to start door-to-door vaccinations for those who are bedridden and cannot step out of their homes. There will be a separate protocol for such beneficiaries. Their family members will have to give us in writing that if there is any AEFI (adverse effect following immunisation) they would bear the small risk. A certificate from the family doctor will also be required stating that the beneficiary needs vaccination at home. Once the protocol and guidelines are ready, we would be able to start the vaccinations. However, door-to-door vaccination for all will not happen,” said Tope.The minister added that people are inoculated in hospitals as there are medical facilities available in cases of any minor AEFI. Last week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) wrote to the Union health ministry, expressing the civic body’s willingness to conduct door-to-door vaccinations for severely ill and bedridden people. BMC also requested the Centre to issue guidelines for such drives. The Bombay high court had asked the Centre to respond to BMC’s June 10 letter. If Maharashtra starts door-to-door vaccination of bedridden citizens in the absence of any standard operating procedure from the Centre, it would follow the footsteps of Kerala and Jammu & Kashmir.Meanwhile, the state administered 289,096 doses till 8pm on Saturday across 4,100 centres, taking the number of beneficiaries to 25,863,029, as per the data on the CoWIN portal.

Doctors claim that though the method does not cure the infection, the treatment helps in preventing the development of Covid-19 severity among mild to moderately infected patients with severe comorbidities, if administered within seven days of the infection. Antibodies produced naturally in bodies fight against diseases. Monoclonal antibodies, too, work similarly, but are made artificially in a laboratory that helps in defending against the disease. Casirivimab and Imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies that are specifically directed against the spike protein of Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) that helps to block the virus’ attachment and entry into human cells. The two antibodies of 600 milligram each are mixed like a cocktail. It is administered intravenously or even subcutaneously (under the skin) like an injection. If it is given subcutaneously, these injections can be given at four spots in the body. A full dose of an antibody cocktail is given to the patient within 30 minutes. The patient will then be monitored for an hour to check for any reactions. The therapy has previously been used to treat infections such as Ebola and HIV (human immunodeficiency viruses). The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) approved the therapy in May, following which a few private hospitals in the city such as Nanavati Max Super Speciality Hospital (Vile Parle) and Wockhardt Hospital (Mira Road) started using the new method. Since June 1, Nanavati Hospital has successfully treated four patients with multiple comorbid conditions, including two severely obese individuals with Body Mass Index of over 45, using the cocktail therapy. Dr Salil Bendre, consultant pulmonologist at the hospital, said a 58-year-old severely obese, chronic smoker, weighing 130kg, with a history of severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was the first to receive the antibody cocktail at the hospital. “He was a high-risk patient with no hypoxia, but had mild symptoms like body ache. As the patient had tested positive on May 30, we decided to administer the monoclonal cocktail to avoid the development of severe Covid-19 complications. Despite having severe comorbidities, the patient didn’t develop any further ailments. Two weeks on, his condition is now completely stable,” Dr Bendre said. In another case, a 50-year-old woman weighing 125kgs with a history of poliomyelitis, hypertension and borderline diabetes with mild Covid-19 infection showed improvement after receiving monoclonal antibody therapy. She was treated by Dr Girish Parmar, who is a senior consultant, endocrinology and diabetology, at the hospital said. Dr Parmar said, “The woman visited us on the seventh day of her Covid-19 infection. She was mildly symptomatic with cough and fever. Considering she was a high-risk patient, we decided to administer the monoclonal antibody cocktail within the initial window of disease advancement.” Wockhardt Hospital has treated two female patients above the age of 60 with comorbidities like diabetes, kidney disease and high blood pressure, using monoclonal antibody therapy. Dr Jinendra Jain, consultant physician at the hospital, said, “The antibody cocktail therapy is for those above the age of 65, home isolation patients having an oxygen saturation of 93% or require no oxygen support but are at risk of developing a severe form of the infection owing to comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, liver disease, heart ailments, and chronic lung disease.” The therapy works effectively when administered within three-four days of contracting the infection, when the virus replicates and multiplies, said Dr Jain. However, he also cautioned that the therapy is not recommended for patients who have severe Covid-19 infection, require oxygen therapy and have allergies. However, doctors have cautioned about over-emphasising the term ‘life-saving drug’. “Yes, it has helped in reducing the viral load, shortening the duration of the treatment and lowering the probability of hospitalisation. But if a patient’s condition is already serious, then the treatment should be avoided. We need more studies on it,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, consultant pulmonologist, Hinduja Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbais-pvt-hospitals-adopt-monoclonal-antibody-cocktail-therapy-to-reduce-severity-of-covid19-101623524431662.html
13-06-2021||Other||Maharashtra reconciled 13K Covid-19 deaths since May 21||Maharashtra added over 13,700 deaths in its data reconciliation process over the past 22 days. Since May 21, the state reconciled 13,708 Covid-19 fatalities and added to the toll, health department data showed. However, state health department officials clarified that the reconciliation process was owing to delayed reporting of deaths and not because of underreporting or misreporting. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said that there is no question of hiding the death count. As per the state health department data, between May 21 and June 12, Maharashtra added 21,715 fatalities to its toll, of which 13,708 were reconciliation deaths. In the past three days, the state has added 1522, 2,213 and 1,606 deaths respectively through the reconciliation process. The cumulative number of people who died due to the pandemic in the state now stands at 108,333. Officials said that the reporting of deaths on the Centre’s portal is a time-consuming process and the large number of Covid-19 cases in April and May led to delay in reporting of these deaths. A statement from the health department read, “The scope of data on Covid-19 cases, recovery of patients and deaths is vast. For that, the state’s integrated disease surveillance programme is working in a transparent manner... Due to technical reasons, there is a delay in reporting data. However, the districts and municipal corporations have been asked to immediately complete it.” A senior health department official said that the districts update cases on CV Analytics portal and deaths on Covid-19 portal of the Union government. The official said that the process of reconciliation of Covid-19 cases and deaths happens fortnightly. “However, there was a delay on part of private hospitals and district administration due to the load during the second wave. Private hospitals have been provided with a “facility app” to upload discharges and deaths, but they do not do it regularly. Districts or municipal corporations then compile this data and add the data. Besides that, laboratories have to upload positive cases on ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) portal. When there is a delay from that end, there cannot be real-time reporting of deaths and discharges,” the official said.Another senior official said that the parameters for categorising a death as Covid and non-Covid are laid down by ICMR and World Health Organization (WHO). “It generally takes five-seven days to classify a death as Covid or non-Covid. If a person has comorbidities, the doctors have to look at the medical history. Death audit committees at district level check the health complication and cause of death. If they are unable to categorise it due to multiple complications, then it is referred to the state audit committee,” the official said.On Saturday, Maharashtra added 10,697 fresh Covid-19 cases and 1,966 fatalities, including 1,606 reconciliation deaths. Out of the 1,606 deaths, 315 occurred in Nashik, 276 in Nagpur, 230 at Pune, 149 in Satara, 138 in Ahmednagar, 126 in Thane, 41 in Sangli, 36 in Jalna, 34 in Ratnagiri, 30 in Dhule, 29 in Nanded, 28 at Buldhana, 27 in Palghar, 19 each at Latur and Raigad, 16 in Solapur, 13 in Yavatmal, 12 in Chandrapur, 11 at Aurangabad, nine in Gondia, eight each at Jalgaon and Parbhani, seven in Wardha, six each at Beed and Osmanabad, five in Kolhapur, three in Sindhudurg, two each at Akola and Amravati and one in Bhandara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-reconciled-13k-covid-19-deaths-since-may-21-101623524312833.html

Jakhar said this opportunistic tie-up is not going to save their sinking ship. “BSP leaders may have forgotten the way they were treated after their 1996 alliance which did not even last one year, but Dalits and poor people who associate themselves with the party have not forgotten it,” he said in a statement. The Punjab Congress chief cautioned BSP leader Mayawati against taking (Akali Dal leader and former CM) Parkash Singh Badal’s invitation to contest from Punjab at face value. “(BJP leader) Arun Jaitley Ji had taken their invitation at face value and had to suffer a humiliating defeat.

At the time, seven pistols were recovered from these accused, some of whom are in jails and would be brought on a production warrant. On Thursday, Jagjit Singh, alias Jaggu, of Purian Kalan village in Batala was arrested. Preliminary investigation suggests that all weapons were smuggled from Pakistan. Police say Jaggu has links with Pakistan-based terror outfits and pro-Khalistani elements based in the US, Canada and the UK. They also claimed that Jaggu was operating at the behest of his US-based handler Darmanjit Singh, alias Darman Kahlon, a former gangster.Kahlon’s name had also cropped up in November 2020, when the State Special Operation Cell (SSOC) had arrested 10 in from Amritsar in connection with the recovery of seven pistols that were allegedly smuggled from Madhya Pradesh (MP). Seven of the ten accused have been identified as Gagandeep Singh of Tarn Taran, Ravideep Singh, Rajbir Singh, Hira Singh Pawandeep Singh and Gurpreet Singh of Gurdaspur district, and one Rahul of MP. The investigation into this case had found that Kahlon had given ₹1.5 lakh for the smuggling of weapons.“We will question all ten accused arrested in the 2020 case,” said ADGP (internal security) RN Dhoke, adding that it was unclear as to how much funding Kahlon had given in the Thursday night seizure case. He added that their teams were also working to ascertain the identity of banned and pro-Khalistani organisations in the US, Canada, the UK and Pakistan. “Most weapons are foreign-made and the possibility of their being smuggled from Pakistan can’t be ruled out,” the AGDP added. Kahlon had fled to the US after accusations emerged that he had orchestrated the escape of a notorious gangster, Harwinder Singh alias Manu, from police custody in 2017. Police are now working to ensure his extradition. A senior police official said, “Jaggu was nabbed soon after he received the weapon consignment. He had instructions from Kahlon to conceal it till further orders. He does not know who delivered the weapons. We are looking for this absconder.” Assistant inspector general (AIG), SSOC Amritsar, OS Ghumman said, “Investigation is on.” Police added that Jaggu came in contact with Kahlon during his stay in Dubai from 2017 to 2020. They remained in touch even after Jaggu’s return from Dubai. Batala police have said that Jaggu did not face any criminal case, prior to his arrest on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amritsar-weapon-haul-10-held-in-november-2020-to-be-quizzed-101623524132158.html
13-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai rains: Stay home, civic body tells citizens||Do not venture out of your homes, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) directed its citizens, following a heavy spell of rain over Friday night and Saturday morning, resulting in waterlogging across several areas. The BMC said the city will witness extremely heavy rain on Sunday and Monday. The advisory is an upgrade from Friday’s notice of not venturing near the sea and coast. The BMC, in a statement on Saturday, said, “Heavy rain is expected in the city tomorrow [Sunday] as well as day after. We request you to not venture out, especially near the sea.” The city also witnessed a high tide of over 4m, owing to which the gates were closed, and hence the city reported waterlogging, said BMC officials.According to BMC officials, between 11am and 12 noon, several locations in the city and suburbs received 40-60 mm rainfall due to which waterlogging was reported in several parts of the city. In the city, waterlogging was reported at 10 locations, which included Andheri Veera Desai Road (Sorata Pada), Malad Subway, Antop Hill road no 07, Bandra National college, Hindmata, Kurla Kamani, Gandhi market (King’s Circle), Sangam nagar(Wadala), Sion Road no 24 and Western Express Highway (WEH). As the day passed, water from all locations drained out after the rainfall stopped. Suburban train services on Central Railway (CR) were also disrupted due to waterlogging. However, activists claimed waterlogging in the city was reported much before the gates were closed. Nikhil Desai, a Matunga resident, said, “At Gandhi Market, waterlogging was reported at 8am itself, and it is not possible that gates were closed at that time. The high tide has been used by the BMC as an excuse for many years now. It is high time they accept that their management is not proper. On Saturday, there were no dewatering pumps present at Gandhi Market when water logging was reported. If this is the arrangement during heavy rainfall warning, the city will obviously have water logging.”On the other hand, Gautam Rao, a resident of Santacruz, said, “Just two days ago, during heavy rain on Wednesday, there was waterlogging within minutes of rainfall. Assuming the BMC learnt from this, we should not have had waterlogging on Saturday. But again, on Saturday, we had water logging. This is after the BMC set up a newly built pumping station by spending over Rs100 crore.”Further, the island city’s Colaba observatory got 90mm of rainfall between Friday morning and Saturday evening, followed by Santacruz observatory registered 171 mm. On Saturday, city reported five tree falls, nine incidents of short circuits. However, no injuries were reported in the incident.On Saturday, local train services were also suspended between Kurla and Dadar railway stations on the (CR mainline on Saturday afternoon at 12.15 pm. Train services suspended due to waterlogging at Sion railway station.Though train services were operational between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus(CSMT) and Dadar railway stations. However, as heavy rain stopped and water receded on the railway tracks, train services resumed at 1.15 pmOn the harbour railway, local trains were delayed as they were operating with caution. It was due to waterlogging at Chunabhatti railway station.There was no disruption of train services on the Western Railway (WR).The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) also diverted its buses on 50 routes in the city due to waterlogging at arterial roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-rains-stay-home-civic-body-tells-citizens-101623523891689.html

13-06-2021||Other||Be wary of leaders who get ‘sold out’ for personal gains: Mayawati||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati, who has expelled 11 party MLAs and three state party chiefs in the past three years and seen several of her key aides’ defecting either to the BJP or the SP, has hit out at party deserters who get ‘sold out’ for individual gains. After a meeting at the party office in Lucknow on Saturday called to expand the party’s base ahead of 2022 UP polls, she urged the party leaders and workers to start holding small meetings of the party cadres across the state. These cadres, she said, would connect with the masses and remind them of the various initiatives and works undertaken by the BSP leadership when the party was in power in the state. “We need to continue with such small cadre meetings,” said the four-time former UP chief minister. At the meeting, she cautioned cadres against those party leaders who were deserting the party for individual gains. “We have to realign ourselves and work with missionary zeal to ensure a BSP government in the state that works for the welfare of all. The party people must trust cadre more than such leaders who take the name of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram ji but who get sold out for individual gains,” Mayawati said at the meeting. The BSP had 18 MLAs in the state’s legislative assembly but after rebellion of 9 lawmakers, including Ramvir Upadhyaya, Anil Singh, Aslam Raini, Aslam Ali, Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind, Hargovind Bhargava, Sushma Patel, Vandana Singh as well as recent expulsion of Lalji Verma and Ramachal Rajbhar, the party’s effective strength has since been reduced to seven MLAs. In fact, as she spoke, one of her suspended party MLAs Ramvir Upadhyaya, whose son Chiragvir has already joined the BJP, was seen with BJP leaders in Mathura. Upadhyaya was among BSP’s key Brahmin leaders who served as power minister in the Maya government in 2007.“We are in an election year now so the effective current strength of parties in assembly is meaningless. The model code would come into force in another seven to eight months’ time. Defections are common in an election year but those who have left BSP for other parties have soon realised that they have been used,” a BSP leader said. At the meeting Mayawati, party leaders said, cautioned the cadres against leaders who ‘bik jaate hain’ (get sold out). “Such people don’t hesitate about harming the party movement and get sold out though in the end these people end up harming themselves the most which they realise later. We need to stay wary of such people,” she said. Mayawati followed the ‘bik jaate hain’ phrase by reminding the cadre that BSP was a ‘movement-based’ party which unlike other political parties, didn’t rely on donations from corporate world. Instead, it relied on cadres for support, a BSP leader said. This was the first time Mayawati spoke after expelling two of her trusted MLAs in the party— veteran Lalji Verma and former UP BSP chief Ramachal Rajbhar. Both the leaders expelled on the charges of anti-party activities during the recently concluded panchayat elections had denied that they were in touch with either the BJP or SP and appealed to Mayawati to give them a hearing.The BSP chief, however, hasn’t responded to their appeals so far. Party cadres felt Mayawati’s address to the cadres to be cautious about ‘opportunists’ was in a way an attempt to pre-empt more desertions from the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/be-wary-of-leaders-who-get-sold-out-for-personal-gains-mayawati-101623523292451.html

Those who successfully complete the more in-depth training at the driving schools will not have to go to RTO for a test to acquire a driver’s licence.The idea behind the move is to produce skilled drivers to put a check on road accidents in the country.Exercising its powers under Section 8 of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, the Central government has made rules with regard to accreditation of driving training centres.As a result, driving training centres (schools) in Uttar Pradesh – like elsewhere in the country – will need to fulfil certain minimum requirements before they get accreditation from the registering authority. Some of these include being equipped with simulators and dedicated driving tracks.A candidate, who successfully completes training at an accredited driving training centre and gets a certificate to that effect, will be exempt from taking a test at the regional transport office (RTO) when he goes there to procure a driving licence.“On June 7, the ministry of road transport has published a notification wherein the requirements to be fulfilled by accredited driver training centres have been mandated to help them impart proper training and knowledge to candidates,” transport commissioner Dheeraj Sahu said. “The new rules that will be called the Central Motor Vehicles (Eleventh Amendment) Rules, 2021, come into effect from July 1, 2021. They will help the state get skilled drivers and this will surely have a positive impact on road safety,” he pointed out. The new rules stipulate that no person ‘shall’ establish or maintain an accredited driver training centre without an accreditation (to be applied through Form 11 A) granted by the state transport authority or any authorised agency notified by the central government.While considering an application for the grant or renewal of an accreditation under this rule, the designated authority shall ensure that the facility has two classrooms with teaching aids like computers and multimedia projectors for holding theory classes or lessons on traffic rules and regulations, driving procedures, public relations, apart from being equipped with simulator(s) and dedicated driving tracks.The applicant (driving school) also needs to have a biometric attendance system, qualified instructors, e-payment, real time evaluation, online evaluation process and adequate staff resources. The rules also have a prescribed syllabus and duration of training. They mandate the designated authority to monitor the operation of the centre and compliance of these rules through regular and surprise audits and inspections.“The candidates who successfully pass the test at these accredited centres will be exempt from the driving test requirement at the time of applying for a driving licence, which is currently being taken at the RTO,” Sahu pointed out, quoting the rules. These centres, he added, would be allowed to provide industry-specific specialised training as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/producing-skilled-drivers-minimum-requirements-for-driving-schools-accreditation-set-101623522871623.html

The court has asked Nair to vacate the servant quarters occupied by him even after he was dismissed from the job in 2014.Nair was appointed in 2003 as full-time driver/chauffeur to Shah and his family by Mukund Limited, where Shah was a chairman. Nair was given an accommodation in a service quarter annexed to Suneeta Building, Malabar Hill, where Shah resided. The company continued to provide him with the service when he resigned from the company in 1999.However, after Shah died on March 2013, the company terminated services of Nair.Nair then approached Anjana saying he would continue his services for a monthly salary of ₹30,000. Anjana did not accept his offer, following which Nair misbehaved with the Shah family. He was then removed and asked to vacate the quarters.Nair refused to vacate the house and asked for alternative premises of a self-contained room kitchen on ownership basis in south Mumbai or ₹70 to ₹80 lakh cash to purchase the same, either by plaintiff or by the company.Nair claimed he was a tenant of the quarters and paid rent to Shah. He claimed to have paid a deposit of ₹12 lakh along with monthly rent of ₹2,300. He also denied that he was their driver. The court has rejected Nair’s claims as he could not produce any document or proof to show that he had paid deposit or rent to Shah for occupation of the premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/wife-of-former-west-bengal-governor-wins-case-against-driver-101623522693825.html

The artificial lake was built in 1890 at an expense of around ₹40 lakh and it has a capacity to store 5,450 million litres of water in it, which is used mainly only for industrial use and not for drinking purpose.Meanwhile, though the city has received heavy rainfall in the past few days, the seven lakes that supply drinking water to the city did not see significant increase in the water stock as their catchment areas did not get enough rainfall, said BMC officials. According to the data, as of Saturday, lake level at the seven lakes was 185,971 million litres or around 12.85% of the total capacity of 1,447,363 million litres. The same on Tuesday was 185,864 million litres. This indicates that not much has changed in the ongoing week.A BMC official said, “Though the city has got heavy rainfall, catchment areas have not got much rainfall, due to which the lakes have not seen any major increase in water levels. Currently, we have enough water for around 50 days and there are no plans for water cuts.”As per the data, Upper Vaitarna lake has no water stored, Modak Sagar has 33.66% water stock, Tansa has 12.98%, Middle Vaitarna 12.23%, Bhatsa which supplies 55% of city’s water has 11.39% water, Vihar has 51.17% and Tulsi has 52.41% water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/powai-lake-overflows-lakes-supplying-drinking-water-do-not-get-much-rainfall-101623522632769.html
13-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra braces for heavy rainfall in coastal districts||On the backdrop of prediction of extremely heavy rain in the coastal districts of Maharashtra, the state administration has shifted locals from low-lying and landslide prone areas to safety, and deployed 12 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams in Raigad, Ratnagiri, Mumbai and Palghar districts. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted extremely heavy downpour on Sunday.The regional meteorological centre had issued red alerts in Raigad and Ratnagiri districts for Saturday, while it upgraded alert status from orange to red for Mumbai and Palghar for Sunday. Raigad and Ratnagiri continued to remain on red alert as forecast of extremely heavy rainfall is made for these four districts. Extremely heavy rainfall, as per definition, is above 204.5mm rainfall.According to government officials, the districts have sounded alerts asking people to remain indoors. An official from Raigad collector’s office said the district administration has moved over 1,000 people from around 20 villages to safer locations. “Raigad has been receiving a lot of rainfall; in the past 24 hours we received over 80mm rainfall. Since there was a risk of landslide in some talukas, we have moved 1,138 people from 20 villages,” said the official, who did not wish to be named. Officials from Ratnagiri collector’s office said the state has deployed three teams there. Mumbai too has braced for heavy downpour on Sunday. The city has three NDRF teams deployed. State environment minister and Mumbai guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray said, “People should remain extremely careful while stepping out. There is forecast for heavy rains in Mumbai, besides that we still have Covid-19 restriction. So we have to remain careful.”Palghar collector Manik Gursal said on Saturday there was not much rain, but they are prepared. “We have level four Covid-19 restrictions in place [except in Vasai-Virar] so there is hardly any movement. We have issued advisory in the fishing villages and have two teams of NDRF in place for any situation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-braces-for-heavy-rainfall-in-coastal-districts-101623522632182.html
13-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai, Konkan coast under orange alert till June 15||The entire Konkan coast and Mumbai are expected to see heavy to extremely heavy rains at isolated locations on Sunday and Monday. Raigad and Ratnagiri districts have been placed under a red category weather alert for Sunday and Monday, indicating a higher chance of severe weather, while Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Sindhudurg districts have been placed under orange category alert.Earlier on Saturday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued a red alert for Mumbai and the entire Konkan region, but this was later downgraded to an orange category alert for all districts except Ratnagiri and Raigad, as the “heavy rainfall belt has moved southwards”, IMD officials clarified. However, with the formation of a low-pressure area over North Bay of Bengal and cyclonic circulations in the Arabian Sea facilitating strong westerly winds, an active rainfall spell is expected over the Konkan coast for at least four to five days, IMD officials said. Mumbai has recorded a total of 706.1mm of rain as of 5.30pm on Saturday, a sharp increase from the monthly average rainfall of 505mm, between June 1 and June 12. This includes pre-monsoon showers that took place between June 1 and June 8. In the 24 hours ending 8.30am on Saturday, Mumbai had received 107mm of rainfall, as per the automatic weather station at Santacruz. In the nine hours ending 5.30 pm, it recorded 64.8 mm rain.Mumbai’s only operational doppler radar at Colaba, meanwhile, was revived after over three weeks on Saturday. The radar had been defunct since May 16, a day before Cyclone Tauktae passed by the city on its way to Gujarat. Dr MN Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, had told HT on Friday that it was likely to remain defunct for at least two months. Despite repeated requests, IMD officials did not clarify the reason for the radar’s speedy recovery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-konkan-coast-under-orange-alert-till-june-15-101623522631603.html

13-06-2021||Lucknow||Yogi asks UP officials to distribute aid through public representatives||LUCKNOW Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday asked the officers concerned to ensure that disaster relief or any other government monetary aid was distributed through local public representatives.He also directed the officials to activate the bank accounts of all the newly elected gram pradhans (village heads) at the earliest.“Local MLAs and MPs should be present at such events (organised for distribution of aid),” he said at the Covid review meeting. He also said, “It’s time to make serious efforts to create new sources of income in villages. The government is taking many steps to empower gram panchayat (village governments).”Asking officials to train all the newly elected gram pradhans, he said it should be ensured that gram sabhas (village councils) held their meetings regularly.“They should be educated on how to select useful development projects for the respective villages. Village heads, with collective efforts, can do innovative projects,” he said.Yogi Adityanath said the rainy season had begun which was also the time when vector-borne diseases like encephalitis and malaria were transmitted faster.He directed better preparations, precaution, prevention and treatment arrangements in the districts of Gorakhpur, Basti and Devipatan divisions and those bordering Nepal.“From June 15, launch door-to-door medicine kit distribution for children. Also, do surveillance for diseases in a better manner,” he said.He said the Covid pandemic intensity had decreased in UP and the situation was under control in all the districts.“Now, there are only 9,806 Covid active cases, which is similar to the pre-March 31 situation. The daily positivity rate is a mere 0.2% and the recovery rate is 98.1%. In the past 24 hours, 524 new cases were recorded while a total of 1,757 people recovered and were discharged from hospitals. So far, a total of 16.7 lakh people in the state have recovered from Covid (since March 2020),” he said.Nevertheless, the aggressive Covid testing policy should continue and daily test numbers should be increased, the chief minister said.He also said Covid vaccination was progressing fast in the state and 4.61 lakh doses were administered in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 2.24 crore doses (since January 16).“Currently, on an average, four lakh doses are being administered daily and this capacity has to be increased to 10-12 lakh doses per day by next month. Also, run a campaign in the rural areas, telling people the need and benefits of the Covid vaccination,” he said to the officials at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-asks-up-officials-to-distribute-aid-through-public-representatives-101623520711518.html
13-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt places fresh order to streamline distribution of food grains scheme||The Delhi government has placed fresh orders to procure 5,000 metric tonnes (MT) of wheat and rice to ensure no more hiccups in its scheme to provide free food grains to people without ration cards in the city, senior officials said on Saturday.“A large number of people turned up at our centres over the past two weeks. The demand was clearly way more than what we had expected. But people should not panic. Delhi government will provide free ration to every deserving person and no one will return empty handed from our centres. We have placed orders with the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for more food grains, which will arrive soon,” said Imran Hussain, Delhi food and civil supplies minister.Over the past two weeks, beneficiaries faced a lot of problems with the distribution centres running out of food grains due to huge demand. Till Friday, centres set up at schools in Hauz Rani, Munirka, Shahpur Jat, RK Puram, Ber Sarai continued to send people back citing shortage of stock, said functionaries on the ground.On Saturday, Hussain said the government has “taken note of all the grievances” reported by people. “We assure you that things will be further streamlined in the coming days to make the entire process smooth and hassle-free. The Aam Aadmi Party government believes that ration is the right of people,” he said.On May 18, Kejriwal announced that people without ration cards too will get free food grains, pegging the number of beneficiaries at 2 million over and above those covered under the public distribution system. Under the scheme, which was implemented on June 5, each beneficiary gets 4kg wheat and 1kg rice.Department reports showed that from June 5 till Saturday afternoon, the Delhi government distributed 5,000MT of food grains to 450,000 beneficiaries through 280 centres. Each ward in Delhi has one distribution centre set up in a government school.Himanshu Bisht, a resident of East Vinod Nagar who got his package of ration on Saturday, said the system does not require prior registration. “I just had to show my Aadhaar card and got 5kg of free ration. A lot of us have had to face pay cuts and have even lost our jobs. This scheme of the Delhi government has proved to be extremely helpful,” he said.Kalyan Rai, a resident of Seelampur, said these are walk-in centres. “I just walked in at the school near my jhuggi. The officials took details such as my name, parentage, mobile number, Aadhaar and so on. Then an SMS was sent on my mobile number after which I got my ration,” she said.Officials said even those without a mobile phone are being given free ration. “Those who cannot provide a mobile number are being given a code (token) generated in the system on the spot, after which ration is given to them. If one doesn’t have any ID proof, we still give ration for one person. If all the members of a family have Aadhaar cards, then everyone will get 5kg ration each,” said an official on condition of anonymity.The 280 free ration centres remain open from 10am to 4pm on all working days, except on gazetted holidays and on Sundays. Apart from walking in at any of these centres, people can also call up the 1031 helpline, to identify the location of schools from which ration is being distributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-places-fresh-order-to-streamline-distribution-of-food-grains-to-those-without-ration-cards-101623519091481.html
13-06-2021||Delhi||High risk of third Covid wave, preparing on war footing: CM||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the chances of a third wave of Covid-19 (the fifth for Delhi) are “quite real” and assured that the Delhi government is preparing to combat it on a “war-footing”, as he inaugurated 22 oxygen pressure swing absorption (PSA) plants in nine state government-run hospitals.“We are now at the risk of the third wave of Covid-19 and are receiving indications that the United Kingdom has already started experiencing the third wave. Covid-19 cases are rising rapidly, even though 45% of the people are already vaccinated there. However, initial indications suggest that the intensity is lower this time. So, we also have to be fully prepared for the same. Delhi government is committed to preparing with full conviction,” Kejriwal said in a digital address during the inauguration of the oxygen plants.These 22 small-sized oxygen plants can, in total, produce 17.3 metric tonnes (MT) of medical oxygen, while 17 more such plants will be commissioned by July.The Delhi government plans to set up 57 oxygen generation plants with a total capacity of 64MT, which will generate 35,000 litres of oxygen per minute, data seen by HT showed. Of the 57 oxygen plants, 22 were inaugurated on Saturday, five were commissioned in May, while the Central government has already installed six. The Delhi government will set up 17 more plants, while the Centre will open seven.“The fourth wave of Covid-19 in Delhi saw a huge shortage of oxygen. Delhi is not an industrial state and so it doesn’t have its own source of [medical] oxygen. Usually, Delhi needs a lesser share of oxygen for its hospitals, which is obtained from other states. But during the fourth wave, the demand increased manifold. Delhi needs 150-200 MT of medical oxygen for non-Covid purposes, apart from industrial purposes. This demand rose to 700 MT during the fourth wave because every patient needed oxygen,” Kejriwal said.“We didn’t have the ability to produce oxygen, nor did we have tankers to procure oxygen from states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on the directions of the central government. Now, we have to be fully prepared,” he said.In addition to oxygen plants and at least 6,000 oxygen cylinders, the government has also set up three storage plants of 57 MT each, and arranged oxygen tanks of 13.5 MT each.Roshni Nadar Malhotra, chairperson of HCL Technologies, said HCL is contributing 21 ready-to-install oxygen plants imported from France. “Seventeen of these have already been installed across seven hospitals in Delhi. The remaining four have also arrived and will be installed over the next few days,” she said.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said of the 22 PSA plants, 17 have been given by HCL, and the remaining five by Maruti Udyog. “HCL will be supplying four more plants, which will arrive soon. Similarly, five such plants have already been installed in hospitals like Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Satyawadi Raja Harishchandra, Ambedkar Nagar hospital, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, and Burari Hospital. These plants have already been commissioned,” he said.Hospitals such as Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital, Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital, Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital and Nirankari Field Hospital have got the plants installed recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/high-risk-of-third-covid-wave-preparing-on-war-footingcm-101623519092125.html
13-06-2021||Delhi||Pre-monsoon showers likely in Delhi from Saturday night, says Met dept||Parts of Delhi are likely start receiving pre-monsoon showers from late Saturday night and early Sunday morning, coupled with dust storms, the India Meteorological Department said.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the showers will intensity over on Sunday.“From Sunday, we have a forecast of moderate rain across Delhi. Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) will receive intermittent rain for the next three to four days, while temperatures will drop to around 34 degrees Celsius,” said Srivastava.On Saturday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for the entire city, was 35.8°C, four degrees below normal, while the minimum temperature was 28°C.At the Palam weather station, the maximum temperature was 38.6 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal, the minimum temperature was 27.3 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal.The Met department on Friday said the south-west monsoon will reach Delhi and most of north-west India by June 15, almost a fortnight ahead of schedule, due to a low pressure system building up over the Bay of Bengal.The monsoon usually arrives in Delhi by June 27-28, but this year it is set to advance swiftly due to weather conditions in the northern Bay of Bengal, Met officials said.Scientists attributed the sudden advancement to the formation of a low-pressure system over the northern Bay of Bengal. When a low-pressure area is formed at the onset of monsoon, it creates conditions that conducive for the advancement of monsoon.IMD said that except for some parts of Rajasthan and Gujarat, the monsoon is likely to cover all of north-west India by June 15.HT reported on Friday that the monsoon was racing across the country after arriving two days late in Kerala, and was likely to cover the entire country a fortnight ahead of the usual July 8 date under favourable conditions.HT last month reported that Delhi since August 2020 has broken a historical weather record every month — either by being hotter, wetter, or colder than usual. This, for example, is likely to be the first June in Delhi to not get a single heat wave day as rain brings down the temperature further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/premonsoon-showers-likely-in-delhi-from-saturday-night-says-met-dept-101623519031396.html
13-06-2021||Delhi||Sisodia demands full-tax waiver on Covid items at GST meet||The Delhi government reiterated its demand for full tax waiver on all Covid-19 medical items till the end of the pandemic at the GST Council meeting on Saturday, said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who attended the meeting chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.“Today (Saturday), at the GST Council meeting, I recommended that it is necessary for us to make Covid-19 medical equipment such as vaccines, masks, sanitisers, thermometers, oximeters and so on tax free. Expenses related to masks, sanitisers, thermometers have now been added into the monthly budget of people. So, people are waiting to see whether their bill for a sanitiser or mask will remain at Rs.500 or go up to Rs.550 with tax. There should be no tax for such items till the pandemic at least,” said Sisodia, who is also the finance minister, in a statement on Saturday evening.In the advent of a possible third wave, the Delhi government also sought a clarification from the Centre. “Keeping in mind a possible third wave, central and state governments across the nation have already started ramping up medical facilities. Private sectors have also been asked to invest in public healthcare. If a state government asks a private company to invest ₹10 lakh in a hospital to increase its ICU capacity, does this mean that the hospital will get the full amount or will that hospital receive a deducted amount after tax?,” asked Sisodia.The deputy CM said ministers across several BJP-ruled states are against the suggestion of making Covid-19 medical equipment tax-free. “The BJP-led central government showed their discontent against state governments, which recommended making medical items tax free. The GST Council did not listen to any of us and did not accept our suggestions. I appeal to the central government to have an open heart, to think about the sufferings of the people and make these equipment tax-free. It is the need of the hour and will help people when they plan their monthly budget,” said Sisodia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sisodia-demands-full-tax-waiver-on-covid-items-at-gst-meet-101623519032130.html
13-06-2021||Delhi||‘Not viable to run jab centres with ₹150 cap on service fee’||Several private hospitals in the Capital have shut drive-through and outreach Covid-19 vaccinations in offices and colonies, arguing that the ₹150 cap on service charge imposed by the Centre does not allow them to adequately recover costs involved in the inoculation process.One of Delhi’s first drive-through vaccination centres, set up at a mall in Dwarka by Akash Healthcare, which provided free shots to the under-privileged, shut on Friday, after the hospital said it was no longer viable to run.“...We have decided to stop it now, owing to the new vaccination pricing, as running it has become non-viable now,” the hospital said in a statement.As he announced free vaccines for Indian states on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that private hospitals will be allowed to charge a maximum service charge of ₹150 on the fixed price of the jabs.Hospitals have, however, said this fee is too low to cover the cost of maintaining the cold chain, transporting consumables, medical staff, ambulances, and proper bio-medical waste disposal.Madhukar Rainbow hospital, which had set up outreach vaccination points in various colonies with the help of the local resident welfare organisations, said the centres are all incurring losses.“There is the cost of the vaccine, and many additional costs if we set up outreach camps. We need to pay for the ambulance, the nurse and doctors, dispose of the biomedical waste properly. There is a cost to all of this. We are planning to send a letter to the government asking them to review the prices for these outreach camps,” said Dinesh Vashishth, COO of the hospital.Earlier, Fortis Healthcare, in a statement also said the ₹150 cap was too little to run outreach centres.Also Read | Third Covid wave chances real, Delhi govt preparing on war-footing: Kejriwal“Unfortunately, the cap of service charge at ₹150 will not cover the additional costs incurred for such off-site vaccination camps which involve substantial costs like ambulance, transport, extra staff and doctor, plus TDS involved in many cases. We urge the government to consider a higher charge for off-site vaccination camps to enable expanded coverage,” the hospital had said in a statement the day the announcement was made by the prime minister.Others, such as BLK-Max hospital, which is running one of the biggest vaccination centres, have started operating on the lower costs.“The ₹150 is enough for hospitals to carry out vaccination at their premises but it is too less if they need to set up drive-throughs and outreach camps. The thing is, it is not clear whether the government will object to extra charges for such camps. The problem was that many hospitals had started charging an overhead cost of ₹300 to ₹400, which is why the government had to step in to regulate the prices. We need to rationalise this cost; we will pick this issue up in the next meeting,” said Girdhar Gyani, director general of Association of Healthcare Providers (India) – an organisation of over 10,000 healthcare providers from across India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/drivethrough-offsite-vaccination-sites-shut-as-hospitals-say-centre-s-service-fee-cap-not-viable-101623518971436.html

The civic agency has partnered with a private company to dispose of old and unserviceable IT equipment and other electronic items from offices, households, resident welfare associations (RWAs) and markets under the jurisdiction of the SDMC.Municipal officials said that as per the agreement, the private firm will purchase e-waste from the citizens through tenders and will ensure its safe disposal. The e-waste will be collected on the basis of requests received on the online system.“The ministry of environment, forest and climate change has notified the E-waste Management Rules, 2016, following which the SDMC has engaged a private firm RBH E-Waste Recycle Hub Pvt Ltd on the basis of open tender for disposal of e-waste collected through online facility. To ensure proper disposal, the corporation has launched an application https://ewaste.mcdservices.for submitting the online request for collecting e-waste. Citizens can raise the request on this portal and the vendor will collect the e-waste from their doorsteps as per approved rates of e-waste,” said an SDMC spokesperson.E-Waste is a general term given to electronic and electrical items like computer, transformer, switches, TV, etc. Civic officials said e-waste contains toxic chemicals and minerals like arsenic, cadmium, acid among others and hence, should be recycled in a scientific manner.“Currently, people sell e-waste to random scrap dealers, who either dispose them without any scientific procedure or sell them to other companies. If such item is not disposed of in a scientific manner, it can cause massive damage to the environment. So, the SDMC has introduced the online facility for e-waste collection,” the official said.Municipal authorities said the SDMC has also fixed rates for e-waste items which is available on the civic body’s website. They said that citizens will also be provided a certificate regarding safe disposal of their e-waste by the vendor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sdmc-floats-online-facility-for-e-waste-collection-101623518851375.html

13-06-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: The day a toddler called the shots, and stole the show!||Last week, I had fun while re-living the experiences of working with children in my first film. While I was re-reading the article, I realised that I have worked with them in almost all my projects henceforth! And they include children of all ages – from newborns to toddlers to pre-teens to children who feel they are old enough to understand everything! Working with them was not by design, but I am glad this happened. In all these I was left scratching my head and (eventually) with a smile on my face. I starkly remember working with two-year-old Raghav Joshi on the set of a film of mine – “Baapjanma”. I was fresh on the heels of directing “Dhappa”, after directing as many as 19 kids in a few scenes and I thought I would be able to pull it off, even though Raghav was remarkably younger. I had met him at a party just a month back and was pleasantly surprised with how easily he was socialising with the fifty people present there. When we had begun casting for that part, a friend of mine reminded me of him and he was finalised immediately. So, while Raghav’s character was in many scenes, there were two scenes where we needed specific reactions from him. Most of his scenes were lined up at the beginning of the schedule. When he came on set, his attitude was exactly how I remembered from the party. He got along with everyone and shooting with him was a breeze. Thankfully, he was supposed to be cheerful and happy in all of his scenes. Sharvari Lohakare, who was playing his onscreen mother, also got along with him behind the camera and that helped me get an amazing moment on camera. There was one more reaction left, but I was not worried about it now. Our lead actor – Sachin Khedekar – joined the set a few days after the shoot started. Raghav’s next important scene was with him. I was eagerly waiting to see the warm scene between a man and his grandson translate from paper to screen! The performers were a veteran actor and a young charmer. But the charmer had other plans! He just wouldn’t let Sachin dada near him. Maybe it was because we were shooting in a dimly-lit basement and he was not used to it. We tried many things, from playing games with him, to asking his mother to be in front of him, to offering chocolates to taking him out for some fresh air. But nothing seemed to be working for him. We thought it was just not our day and thankfully found something else to shoot. The next day though was no different! We started the shoot with that shot, but his mood was no different. So, we postponed it to later in the day and made sure that Sachin dada and Raghav interacted between shots and in breaks. He used to be ok then. But when we tried shooting that particular shot, his mood would change drastically. We tried till we had nothing left to shoot for the day, but were nowhere close to canning this shot! I guess the pressure of losing time was evident on my face, as I was being suggested various solutions by all team members – which ranged from taking their shots separately to using a large doll! But I wanted their combined shot because I believed that would create the desired impact. I racked my brain and tried to find any theatre exercise, any moment while watching the making of any other film, any book excerpt which will prove to be my “eureka” moment, but I was left witless. Sachin dada’s friend, a doctor, was visiting the set that day. He came up to me and said that if you want him in a good mood, feed him some sugar. I told him that we had offered him chocolates and it hadn’t worked. The doctor just told me to use it a preventive measure, not a curative one. He said that the sugar rush will open up a small window, but it will most likely work for the shot! With that in mind we kept everything else ready and rehearsed the shot before. We cleared the room and kept a minimal crew. We fed him some chocolate before the shot and got him in the basement immediately, where Sachin dada was waiting. Raghav seemed to be in a better mood. Without any formal calls of “action” we just started shooting whatever we could get. And it was good! Once we were satisfied with one angle, our cameraman immediately lifted the camera and ran to another spot, the camera attendants scrambling after him. Again, we just rolled the camera and let the two actors be! The whole exercise must have lasted for hardly fifteen minutes, but the shots that we got were better than the ones we had spent many hours on previously. I came outside and thanked the doctor. It was such a simple, but effective suggestion. Something that helped me in my next film too. The bar of chocolate that helped us through this also made the cut of the film and is visible in the scene!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/the-day-a-toddler-called-the-shots-101623511951053.html
13-06-2021||Pune||After backlash, minister suspends SPPU move to charge fee for stroll on campus||Following severe criticism from locals, Maharashtra’s minister for higher education, Uday Samant, has asked Savitribai Phule Pune University’s (SPPU) administration to suspend its decision of charging ₹1,000 from those who visit the campus for morning and evening walks, the minister announced the same via Twitter. Samant in a tweet on Saturday morning said, “The decision to charge fees from those on morning and evening walk at SPPU’s oxygen park has been suspended. The plan will be revised soon and a notification on the same will be issued,” said Samant.The SPPU has created an oxygen park by planting various saplings where it had invited people to take a stroll and pay ₹1,000. Several locals, who take morning and evening stroll in the university campus, criticised the decision, forcing Samant to issue a clarification that the administration has been asked to revise its plan. On Saturday, Samant retracted the proposal of ‘Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) Oxy Park’ under which the university had decided to charge ₹1,000 from people from June 20.Ashish Deshpande, a regular visitor to the university campus, said that the decision to charge money from people who come to the university is not right.“It is a state university, and the campus is open for everyone. Due to the pandemic, more and more people are trying to remain fit. Visiting the campus for a morning and evening walk is a regular habit for me. Charging money from those who visit the campus is not correct at all. It is a good thing that the proposal was withdrawn,” said Deshpande.Another regular visitor, Anand Kulkarni, said that decision was not welcome at all.“People pay exorbitant amounts of money for a gym but such a natural campus for regular walks is a good place. Money should not be charged from visitors. The university campus is not private property and so such a fee is not acceptable,” said Kulkarni.As per the earlier notification issued by the SPPU, ₹1,000 was charged for a month. For children between the age group of nine years to 13 years, no fee was to be charged; only a registration fee of ₹500 was to be paid. The SPPU would provide an identity card to members. Family members of the Oxy park member would get 25 per cent off on their membership, as per the previous notification. Following Samant’s intervention, SPPU replaced the notification by afternoon after the backlash with new order stating that ‘SPPU Oxy Park’ will be inaugurated on International Yoga Day that is June 21. “The SPPU Oxy park scheme will be updated and relaunched with new sports and other facilities included in it. Meanwhile, the notification issued on June 11 is withdrawn,” stated officials from SPPU. Despite several attempts, registrar Prafulla Pawar was not available for a comment. SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said he cannot comment on the issue as he is in Nashik and not on campus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/after-backlash-minister-suspends-sppu-move-to-charge-fee-for-stroll-on-campus-101623510811108.html
13-06-2021||Pune||Purandar airport proposal sent to Centre: Pawar||The Maharashtra government has put the ball in the Centre’s court regarding the progress of the proposed international airport to be built in Pune district.“We have completed the paperwork in terms of the proposed Purandar airport and have sent it to the Centre. The state government is positive about this project,” Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said in Pune on Friday. By saying this Pawar hinted that now it’s up to the Centre to give a green signal to the pending project.In February 2021, Pawar had said that a report had been submitted to the Central government regarding the new site for Purandar airport. The originally proposed site for the Pune International Airport was changed because of the opposition from the villagers in Purandar Tehsil. Then a revised proposal, with the change in the location site, was submitted to the Centre for approval.But opposition has emerged for the new site as well. Even if the Centre gives a go-ahead, the land acquisition process will not be a cakewalk for the administration.Speaking on the resistance from the locals during the land acquisition process for the developmental infrastructure projects, Pawar said that the rates of compensation money have been increased now and dialogue with the locals is essential.“Infrastructure projects, such as the construction of airports, ring roads, dams, face opposition from some locals. This phenomenon is not recent. Dialogue is the key in such situations. Earlier, the land compensation was very less. Now, the compensation is four times that of ready reckoner. If you get four times compensation for your land, you can buy land elsewhere,” said Pawar.A stiff resistance has also been encountered by the officials in the land acquisition process for the western part of Ring road to be constructed by Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC).Commenting on this Pawar said that the Ring Road is necessary considering the requirement of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad cities. “I personally believe that the Ring road is necessary for PMC, PCMC, and the district’s population. If we consider the traffic in Pune city and suburbs, then the Ring road is planned by thinking for the next 50 years. The benefits of this project have to be explained to the affected people. It will be discussed with them. If someone is losing the agricultural land, then more compensation can be given,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/purandar-airport-paperwork-complete-proposal-sent-to-centre-ajit-pawar-101623510690908.html
13-06-2021||World||US water and power are shockingly vulnerable to cyberattacks||When the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was hacked in 2018, it took a mere six hours. Early this year, an intruder lurked in hundreds of computers related to water systems across the US. In Portland, Oregon, burglars installed malicious computers onto a grid providing power to a chunk of the Northwest.Two of those cases -- L.A. and Portland -- were tests. The water threat was real, discovered by cybersecurity firm Dragos.All three drive home a point long known but, until recently, little appreciated: the digital security of US computer networks controlling the machines that produce and distribute water and power is woefully inadequate, a low priority for operators and regulators, posing a terrifying national threat.“If we have a new world war tomorrow and have to worry about protecting infrastructure against a cyberattack from Russia or China, then no, I don’t think we’re where we’d like to be,” said Andrea Carcano, co-founder of Nozomi Networks, a control system security company.Hackers working for profit and espionage have long threatened American information systems. But in the last six months, they’ve targeted companies running operational networks like the Colonial Pipeline fuel system, with greater persistence. These are the systems where water can be contaminated, a gas line can spring a leak or a substation can explode.The threat has been around for at least a decade -- and fears about it for a generation -- but cost and indifference posed obstacles to action.It isn’t entirely clear why ransomware hackers -- those who use malicious software to block access to a computer system until a sum of money has been paid -- have recently moved from small-scale universities, banks and local governments to energy companies, meatpacking plants and utilities. Experts suspect increased competition and bigger payouts as well as foreign government involvement. The shift is finally drawing serious attention to the problem.The US government began taking small steps to defend cybersecurity in 1998 when the Clinton administration identified 14 private sectors as critical infrastructure, including chemicals, defense, energy and financial services. This triggered regulation in finance and power. Other industries were slower to protect their computers, including the oil and gas sector, said Rob Lee, the founder of Dragos.One of the reasons is the operational and financial burden of pausing production and installing new tools.Much of the infrastructure running technology systems is too old for sophisticated cybersecurity tools. Ripping and replacing hardware is costly as are service outages. Network administrators fear doing the job piecemeal may be worse because it can increase a network’s exposure to hackers, said Nozomi’s Carcano.Although the Biden administration’s budget includes $20 billion to upgrade the country’s grid, this comes after a history of shoulder shrugging from federal and local authorities. Even where companies in under-regulated sectors like oil and gas have prioritized cybersecurity, they’ve been met with little support.Take the case of ONE Gas Inc. in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Niyo Little Thunder Pearson was overseeing cybersecurity there in January 2020 when his team was alerted to malware trying to enter its operational system -– the side that controls natural gas traffic across Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas.Hacker DogfightFor two days, his team was in a dogfight with the hackers who moved laterally across the network. Ultimately, Pearson’s team managed to expel the intruders.When Richard Robinson at Cynalytica fed the corrupted files into his own identification program, ONE Gas learned it was dealing with malware capable of executing ransomware, exploiting industrial control systems and harvesting user credentials. At its core were digital footprints found in some of the most malicious code of the last decade.Pearson tried to bring the data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation but it would only accept it on a compact disc, he said. His system couldn’t burn the data onto a CD. When he alerted the Department of Homeland Security and sent it through a secure portal, he never heard back.Robinson of Cynalytica was convinced a nation-state operator had just attacked a regional natural gas provider. So he gave a presentation to DHS, the Departments of Energy and Defense and the intelligence community on a conference call. He never heard back either.“We got zero, and that was what was really surprising,” he said. “Not a single individual reached back out to find out more about what happened to ONE Gas.”The agencies didn’t respond to requests for comment.Such official indifference -- even hostility -- hasn’t been uncommon.The 2018 break-in to the L.A. water and power system is another example.These weren’t criminals but hackers-for-hire paid to break into the system to help it improve security.After the initial intrusion, the city’s security team asked the hackers to assume the original source of compromise had been fixed (it hadn’t) while hunting for a new one. They found many.Between the end of 2018 and most of 2019, the hired hackers discovered 33 compromised paths, according to a person familiar with the test who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. Bloomberg News reviewed a report produced by the hackers for Mayor Eric Garcetti’s office.It described 10 vulnerabilities found during their own test, along with 23 problems researchers had discovered as early as 2008. (Bloomberg News won’t publish information that hackers could use to attack the utility.) The person familiar with the operation discovered that few, if any, of the 33 security gaps have been fixed since the report’s submission in September 2019.It gets worse.Soon after the hackers produced the report, Mayor Garcetti terminated their contract, according to a preliminary legal claim filed by the hackers hired from Ardent Technology Solutions in March 2020. The company alleges the mayor fired the hackers as a “retaliatory measure” for the scathing report.Ellen Cheng, a utility spokeswoman, acknowledged that Ardent’s contract was terminated but said it had nothing to do with the report’s substance. She said the utility frequently partners with public agencies to improve security, including scanning for potential cyber threats.“We want to assure our customers and stakeholders that cybersecurity is of the utmost importance to LADWP and that appropriate steps have been taken to ensure that our cybersecurity is compliant with all applicable laws and security standards,” Cheng said in a statement.Garcetti’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment.The case of the Oregon network -- the Bonneville Power Administration -- is no more encouraging.The testing went on for years beginning in 2014 and involved an almost shocking level of intrusion followed by a pair of public reports. One published in 2017 admonished the agency for repeatedly failing to take action.By 2020, two-thirds of the more than 100 flaws identified by the Department of Energy and the utility’s own security team hadn’t been resolved, according to interviews with more than a dozen former and current Bonneville security personnel and contractors and former members of the Department of Energy cyber team, in addition to documents, some accessed via Freedom of Information Act request.Doug Johnson, a spokesperson for Bonneville, said a team reviewed the security reports in mid-2019 and that efforts to remediate those are ongoing. The utility acknowledged that hackers were able to breach certain BPA systems in those test hacks, but Johnson said “at no time were they able to gain access to any of the BPA systems that monitor or control the power grid.”Dragos estimated in its 2020 cybersecurity report that 90% of its new customers had “extremely limited to no visibility” inside their industrial control systems. That means that once inside, hackers have free rein to collect sensitive data, investigate system configurations and choose the right time to wage an attack.The industry is finally focused on fighting back.“If the bad guys come after us, there has to be an eye-for-an-eye, or better,” observed Tom Fanning, chief executive officer of Southern Co., at a conference this week. “We’ve got to make sure the bad guys understand there will be consequences.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-water-and-power-are-shockingly-vulnerable-to-cyberattacks-101623602238905.html
13-06-2021||World||Joe Biden suggests 'autocrat' Putin's Russia might be weaker than it seems||US President Joe Biden said on Sunday that "autocrat" Vladimir Putin was right to say that relations were at their lowest point in years though he suggested that Russia might be weaker than it seemed and that Moscow had overreached in the Middle East.Biden used the G7 summit in the English seaside resort of Carbis Bay to argue that the world's richest democracies now faced an existential contest with "autocrats" that would define the 21st Century.After attending a NATO summit on Monday, Biden will meet Putin on June 16 in Geneva for a meeting that promises to be a combative encounter after disputes over spying, hacking, election meddling, Ukraine, Belarus and human rights.Biden, who called the former KGB spy a killer in March, cast Russia as engaging in unacceptable behaviour on a range of fronts but also pointed to Russia's own "dilemmas" - its post-Soviet economic collapse, what he called overreach in Syria and problems with Covid-19.Asked why Putin, who has served as Russia's paramount leader since Boris Yeltsin resigned in 1999, had not changed despite years of Western sanctions, Biden quipped: "He's Vladimir Putin"."Autocrats have enormous power and they don't have to answer to a public and the fact is that it may very well be if I respond in kind, as I will, that it doesn't dissuade him - he wants to keep going," Biden said of Putin.The two former Cold War foes have had a turbulent relationship for years though relations soured after Putin sought to rebuild some of the clout lost in the chaotic 1991 Soviet collapse and began meddling far beyond Russia's borders.US and other Western leaders now see Putin and Xi Jinping's China as their main strategic threats, though the Kremlin dismisses as fiction almost all allegations against Russia and says the West is gripped by anti-Russian hysteria.The West casts Russia as a dictatorial kleptocracy governed by a mercurial elite that has involved itself in irresponsible escapades such as the 2014 annexation of Crimea, attempts to meddle in US and European elections, and a series of high-profile espionage and assassination attempts abroad.Russia says Putin is democratically elected.Russian "Dilemmas"Biden, though, depicted Russia - whose economy is 13 times smaller than the United States - as weaker than it might be perceived."Russia has its own dilemmas, dealing with its economy, dealing with COVID and dealing with not only the United States and Europe writ large, and in the Middle East," he said."Russia has engaged in activities which we believe are contrary to international norms, but they have also bitten off some real problems, that they're going to have trouble chewing on," Biden said.Biden cited Syria as a case in point and an area in which the two powers could work together to find "an accommodation".Asked about a Russian statement that Moscow would be ready to hand over cyber criminals to the United States if Washington followed suit, Biden said that was a good sign and "progress."Biden said Putin was right that relations were at a low."He's right it's a low point," Biden said.Biden said he had told Putin before being elected he would look at whether the Russian leader had been involved in trying to interfere with the U.S. election."I checked it out, so I had access to all the intelligence, he was engaged in those activities," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-suggests-autocrat-putin-s-russia-might-be-weaker-than-it-seems-101623603605443.html

The female calf has not been named yet, but both baby and mother are healthy and doing well.“The baby rhino appears to be strong and is nursing alongside her mother,” the zoo said in a statement posted on its Facebook page Saturday.Alake was paired with the only adult male in the Tampa zoo, Ongava. Their calf will join the crash, or group of rhinos, in the coming weeks, zoo officials said. Visitors will be able to see the baby rhino in the new Expedition Wild Africa attraction, set to open soon.The zoo says the white rhino population had dropped in the early 20th century to between 50 and 200, but conservation efforts made the population increase to 20,400 in Africa. White rhinos are still classified as near-threatened because of habitat loss and poaching for their horns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-zoo-announces-birth-of-southern-white-rhino-101623602242344.html

After the conclusion of the G7 summit, Biden told a news conference that the US will deal with China in a straightforward manner and will state the disagreements frankly.“I think we are in a contest, not with China per se, but a contest with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in the rapidly changing 21st century,” said Biden.In a communique published on Sunday, the seven richest democracies said that they recognise their responsibility in upholding a rules-based international system and commit to playing their role in it. The G7 nations further stated that, with regard to China, they will continue to consult on collective approaches to challenging non-market policies and practices which undermine the fair and transparent operation of the global economy.Also Read | G7 demands Covid origin study in China, calls on Beijing to respect human rightsThe G7 also called on China to respect human rights in the Xinjiang region and a higher degree of autonomy in Hong Kong, a former British colony, which has been undermined by China’s draconian national security law.

Where we cooperate, we will cooperate, where we disagree, we will state it frankly,” he added.People familiar with the G7 discussions on China said that there was no immediate consensus on how forcefully they should call out Beijing over the alleged human rights abuses.

The G7 leaders, in an almost finalised version of the communique, reiterated their demand to restore the higher degree of autonomy in Hong Kong, a former British colony, which has been undermined by China’s draconian national security law."We will promote our values, including by calling on China to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially in relation to Xinjiang and those rights, freedoms and high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law," the G7 said.In recent times, Beijing has drawn the ire of the West over its alleged human right violations and forced labour practices in the Xinjiang region, largely inhabited by Uyghur Muslims, an ethnic minority group in China. Several reports have claimed Uyghur Muslims have been facing persecution at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the name of “re-education camps”.Also Read | G7 agrees to increase climate finance, calls on others to joinG7 countries repeated the demand earlier made by the United States for the second phase of the investigation into Covid-19 origins and the route of introduction to the human population, to be convened by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The people arriving in Abu Dhabi from there countries will just have to undergo an RT-PCR test at the airport, the emirate's administration, the reports added.The passengers who are fully vaccinated will need to undergo a follow-up RT-PCR test after six days, while those not fully vaccinated have been directed to hold another test on Day 12, the media reports said quoting the emirate's tourism ministry.Abu Dhabi's gree list now comprises of 28 countries which are as follows: Australia, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, Brunei, China, Cuba, Germany, Greenland, Hong Kong (SAR), Iceland, Israel, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Malta, Mauritius, Moldova, Morocco, New Zealand, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, United States of America and Uzbekistan.Notably, the United Kingdom and India are not part of the new list. It will replace the previous 'green list' issued by the emirate on May 23.Abu Dhabi last week made it mandatory for its residents to have a green pass on the country's Covid-19 app in order to enter shopping malls, restaurants, cafes and other public places from June 15. The restrictions will also apply to gyms, hotels and their facilities, public parks, beaches, swimming pools, entertainment centres, cinemas, and museums, Abu Dhabi's media office said.Visitors will have to prove they have been vaccinated or have recently tested negative through the Alhosn app, which displays an individual's vaccination and testing history.The mobile app will show green if the person has been vaccinated or has tested negative.The UAE announced last month that from June 6, attendance at live events and social activities, including weddings and bars, would be limited to those who could prove they had been vaccinated.The UAE has one of world's highest inoculation rates with the AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinopharm and Sputnik V vaccines available to citizens and residents.In Abu Dhabi, those immunised with the Chinese-made Sinopharm shot are also able to take a dose of Pfizer/BioNTech as a booster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-abu-dhabi-expands-green-list-uk-india-not-added-101623583447593.html

The leaders of the seven richest economies arrived at a consensus to offer developing nations to counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is seen by many as a “debt trap”. India has vehemently objected to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship project under BRI, as it runs through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir."Trudeau's message today was that we really need to work to build a consensus on a unified approach to the challenges that China presents all of us. We have to show solidarity as a group and show action as a group as well," news agency Reuters quoted a person familiar with the discussions as saying.During a background press call on US President Joe Biden’s meetings at the G7 summit, a senior US official said that the administration is working to respond to non-market economic practices that are objectionable in a global economy and pursuing an affirmative infrastructure initiative that’s high standards and transparent. The White House said that the G7 leaders hope the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative, the plan to counter China’s BRI, will provide a transparent infrastructure partnership to help narrow the $40 trillion needed by developing nations by 2035.Also Read | Explained: How G7 counter to China's Belt and Road Initiative will benefit IndiaWhile the G7 leaders agreed on the infrastructure plan, reports suggest that there was no immediate consensus on how forcefully they should call out Beijing over the alleged human rights abuses.

It recorded 2,281 new cases on Saturday, bringing the total so far to around 596,000 cases. Daily cases peaked at almost 4,000 a day in early February.DHA said 90% of the Covid-19 patients admitted to intensive care units in Dubai hospitals were unvaccinated, without specifying when that statistic was recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-has-fully-vaccinated-two-thirds-of-eligible-people-against-covid19-101623580068715.html
13-06-2021||World||Who is Naftali Bennett, the ultra-nationalist leader poised to replace Netanyahu as Israel PM?||Israel’s ultra-nationalist leader Naftali Bennett is poised to become the country's next prime minister after parliament votes for a new government on Sunday, ending Benjamin Netanyahu’s 12-year hold on power. The new coalition consists of eight parties from across Israel’s political spectrum, including a small Arab party, which makes it extremely fragile. The disparate opposition parties have come together, mainly, to keep Netanyahu out of the office and avoid another election.Naftali Bennett, 49, has served as minister of defence as well as of education and the economy in various governments under the leadership of Netanyahu. Born in the Israeli city of Haifa to immigrants from San Francisco, California, Bennett stormed into national politics in 2013 after renouncing his US citizenship.The far-right Yamina party leader is a religious ultranationalist who supports the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the annexation of most of the occupied region. Bennett made the annexation of parts of the West Bank that Israel captured in a 1967 war a major feature of his political platform. He is against a two-state solution and argues that a Palestinian state would be suicide for Israel due to security reasons.Also Read | Explained: What to expect from Israel’s next govt under Bennett in aftermath of Gaza violenceLast year, as Netanyahu pushed the West Bank annexation plan and settlement building during the final months of the Trump administration, Bennett, then defence chief, said, "The building momentum in the country must not be stopped, even for a second." The plan was eventually scrapped as Israel moved to normalise ties with the UAE under Abraham Accords.Following through on expansion will now be politically unfeasible since the so-called “change” coalition, which relies on the support of the United Arab List, a small party with Islamist roots, would collapse even if one party bolts.Bennett, also a self-made tech millionaire, formed a start-up in 1999 and then moved to New York, eventually selling his anti-fraud software company, Cyota, to US security firm RSA for $145 million in 2005.

However several European Union member states have stopped administering it to people below a certain age, usually ranging from 50 to 65, restricting its use to the older population, due to the rare cases of blood clotting, mainly among young people."In a pandemic context, our position was and is that the risk-benefit ratio remains favourable for all age groups," Covid-19 task force chief Marco Cavaleri told the Italian newspaper La Stampa.However, as the number of Covid-19 cases is falling and taking into account that the younger population is less exposed to Covid-19 related risks, Cavaleri said it would be better to use on them Covid-19 vaccines based on messenger RNA (​mRNA) technology, such as Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.Asked whether health authorities should avoid giving the Astrazeneca vaccine to people aged over 60, Cavaleri said: "Yes, and many countries, such as France and Germany, are considering it in the light of greater availability of mRNA vaccines."The Italian government said on Friday it would restrict the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to people aged over 60, after a teenager who had received the shot died from a rare form of blood clotting.Like many European countries, Italy briefly halted AstraZeneca inoculations in March over concerns about the rare blood clotting problems.It resumed them the following month with the recommendation that the product be "preferably" used for people over the age of 60, after the EMA said its benefits outweighed any risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-shots-should-be-halted-for-over-60s-too-ema-official-101623572901317.html

The WHO Director-General hoped there would be better cooperation and transparency when the next phase of the probe into the virus's origin is underway."As you know we will need cooperation from the Chinese side," he said. "We need transparency to understand or know or find the origin of this virus...after the report was released there were difficulties in the data sharing, especially in the raw data."He further said that the preparations for the probe's next steps were underway and that the issue of the origin of the virus was discussed by G7 leaders on Saturday, WSJ reported.Earlier this week, the US and the UK had extended support to a "timely, transparent and evidence-based independent process" for the next phase of the WHO-convened study of Covid-19 origins."We will also support a timely, transparent and evidence-based independent process for the next phase of the WHO-convened Covid-19 origins study, including in China, and for investigating outbreaks of unknown origin in the future," a joint statement said after US President Joe Biden met British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Thursday.This comes amid growing calls for a timely, transparent, and evidence-based independent process for the next phase of the WHO-convened origin study.Recently, the calls to investigate further the origins of the virus have intensified. President Biden has also ordered a fresh US intelligence inquiry into the origins of the pandemic.The origin of novel coronavirus that caused havoc around the world has remained a mystery even after 1.5 years the first case of infection was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Now, scientists and world leaders are calling for further investigations to figure out whether the virus originated naturally or leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-asks-china-to-cooperate-with-probe-into-origins-of-covid19-101623565411373.html

How could their hate be so strong?” Murphy said. “But today I have an even harder time understanding why some politicians still refuse to take the most basic steps to prevent the next shooting,” she added, speaking live during a national discussion hosted by a coalition of human rights and gun safety groups.Also Read: On fifth anniversary of Pulse Nightclub shooting, Joe Biden to name site a national memorialThe attack, which took place as “Latin Night” was being celebrated at the club, is considered the deadliest on the LGBTQ community in US history. It left 49 people dead and 50 others injured. Shooter Omar Mateen of the Islamic State was killed after a three-hour standoff by SWAT team members following the incident.“Bigotry and hatred are not asleep. They still move around us,” said Brandon Wolf, a survivor of the attack. “And if we are going to snuff them out, we must make the same defiant choice we made on this site five years ago today, and that is to embrace the power of community and reject the temptation to come apart at the seams of our differences.” he said, according to news agency AP.Moreover, the anniversary of the shooting should remind people to recommit themselves to taking action, he added.According to Orlando's deputy police chief James P Young, a gay man who reported to the scene on that fateful night, said he has seen friendships strengthen and the community unite over the past five years.“If we use our shared experiences and our shared values, including those of strength and unity, love will always win,” Young said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pulse-nightclub-shooting-victims-of-massacre-remembered-after-5-years-101623552602692.html

Victoria emerged from the lockdown on Friday as new cases declined, but some physical distancing rules remain."My expectation is by later in the week, we will be in a position to announce further easing of restrictions for regional Victoria and ... for metropolitan Melbourne," Merlino said.Merlino added he was keen to get people back to attending sporting events and theatre, though he had no announcement to make yet in that regard.Under existing curbs, Melbourne residents can only travel up to 25 kilometres (15.5 miles) from home while outdoor gatherings are limited to 10 people.

13-06-2021||World||Netanyahu's record reign set to end as Israel's Knesset to vote for new government today||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year hold on power was set to end on Sunday when parliament votes on a new government, ushering in an administration that has pledged to heal a nation bitterly divided over the departure of the country's longest serving leader.Also Read: Israeli lawmakers to vote Sunday on coalition formed against PM NetanyahuNetanyahu, 71, the most dominant Israeli politician of his generation, had failed to form a government after Israel's March 23 election, its fourth in two years. The new cabinet, which will be sworn in after a Knesset confidence vote it is expected to win, was cobbled together by the centrist opposition leader Yair Lapid and ultra-nationalist Naftali Bennett.Also Read: What to expect from Israel’s next govt under Bennett in aftermath of Gaza violenceBennett, a hawkish hi-tech millionaire, will serve as premier for two years before Lapid, a former popular TV host, takes over. They will head a government that comprises parties from across the political spectrum, including for the first time one that represents the 21% Arab minority. They plan largely to avoid sweeping moves on hot-button international issues such as policy toward the Palestinians while they focus on domestic reforms.With little to no prospect of progress toward resolving the decades-long conflict with Israel, many Palestinians will be unmoved by the change of administration, saying Bennett will likely pursue the same right-wing agenda as Netanyahu.BYE BYE BIBI?On the international stage, with his polished English and booming baritone voice, the telegenic Netanyahu has become the face of Israel. Serving in his first term as prime minister in the 1990s and since 2009 winning four more terms in succession, he has been a polarising figure, both abroad and at home.Also Read: Thousands of anti-Netanyahu protesters in Jerusalem claim 'victory' on eve of Israel voteOften referred to by his nickname Bibi, Netanyahu is loved by his hard-core supporters and loathed by critics. His ongoing corruption trial, on charges he denies, has only deepened the chasm.His opponents have long reviled what they see as Netanyahu's divisive rhetoric, underhanded political tactics and subjection of state interests to his own political survival. Some have dubbed him 'Crime Minister' and have accused him of mishandling the coronavirus crisis and its economic fallout.Celebrations by his opponents to mark the end of the Netanyahu era began late on Saturday outside his official residence in Jerusalem, the site of weekly protests against the right-wing leader for the past year, where a black banner stretched across a wall read: "Bye Bye, Bibi, Bye bye", and demonstrators sang, beat drums and danced.But for Netanyahu's large and loyal voter base, the departure of "King Bibi" as some call him, may be difficult to accept. His supporters are angered by what they see as the country turning its back on a leader dedicated to its security and a bulwark against international pressure for any steps that could lead to a Palestinian state, even as he promoted diplomatic deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.None of those moves, however, nor the role he played in securing COVID-19 vaccines for the country's world-beating inoculation campaign, were enough to grant Netanyahu's Likud party enough votes to secure him a sixth term in office.Bennett in particular has drawn anger from within the right-wing camp for breaking a campaign pledge by joining forces with Lapid. He has justified the move by saying another election, which would likely be called were no government formed, would have been a disaster for Israel.Both he and Lapid have said they want to bridge political divides and unite Israelis under a government that will work hard for all its citizens.Their cabinet faces considerable diplomatic, security and financial challenges: Iran, a fragile ceasefire with Palestinian militants in Gaza, a war crimes probe by the International Criminal Court, and economic recovery following the coronavirus pandemic.On top of that, their patchwork coalition of parties commands only a razor-thin majority in parliament, 61 of the Knesset's 120 seats, and will still have to contend with Netanyahu - who is sure to be a combative head of the opposition. And no one is ruling out a Netanyahu comeback.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahus-reign-set-to-end-as-israel-s-knesset-to-vote-for-new-govt-today-101623561271888.html

Michael Packard told local paper Cape Cod Times he was diving for lobster off the coast of the northeastern state of Massachusetts when the humpback whale trapped him in its mouth before coughing him back up."I was in his closed mouth for about 30 to 40 seconds before he rose to the surface and spit me out," the 56-year-old wrote on Facebook hours after. "A humpback whale tried to eat me. I am very bruised up but have no broken bones," he said.Packard initially thought he was inside a great white shark, but he couldn’t feel any teeth and he hadn’t suffered any wounds. “I was completely inside; it was completely black. I thought to myself, ‘there’s no way I’m getting out of here. I’m done, I’m dead.’ All I could think of was my boys — they’re 12 and 15 years old,” Packard told the Cape Cod Times from hospital.Packard was released from Cape Cod Hospital on Friday afternoon, just hours after the incident.'Hard to believe'However, experts and fellow seamen were sceptical about the encounter described by Packard.The New York Post reported citing a doctor at the Cape Cod Hospital, where the lobsterman was treated, saying that a person involved in such an encounter should expect more serious injuries. Hearing loss, because of the sudden change in water pressure from that depth, noted the physician, who did not treat Michael Packard after his brush with the leviathan.“He reportedly ascended from a 45-foot depth in 20 to 40 seconds and didn’t have any evidence of barotrauma?” the Cape Cod Hospital emergency room doctor was quoted as saying by the New York Post.Some fellow seamen were also sceptical. “People who are in the fishing industry, and people who know whales, are finding this hard to believe,” a Bay State lobsterman, who has fished the area for 44 years, told the Post.“It’s a first-ever that this would happen. For a guy to be in the middle of that giant school of fish corralled by a whale doesn’t make sense,” the lobsterman, who was not named by the Post, added.'Wrong place, wrong time'But Jooke Robbins, the director of humpback whale studies at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Massachusetts, said does not doubt Packard's account. "I didn't think it was a hoax because I knew the people involved... So I have every reason to believe that what they say is true," she told AFP.Robbins said she had never heard of an "accident" of this type, but "it may be that he (Packard) was just in the wrong place at the wrong time." "When they (whales) fish... they rush forward, open their mouth and engulf the fish and the water very quickly," she saidShe added that whales have large mouths but throats so narrow they wouldn't be able to swallow a human. The whale "may not be able to detect quickly enough that something is in the way," she said.Charles “Stormy” Mayo, a senior scientist and whale expert at the Center for Coastal Studies, told the Cape Cod Times that such human-whale encounters are rare. Mayo said humpback whales are not aggressive and that it was an accidental encounter while the whale was feeding on fish, likely sand lance.Humpback whales can grow to 40 tonnes and are toothless filter feeders who corral large schools of fish or other small marine life in a tight circle before taking massive gulps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fisherman-says-swallowed-by-humpback-whale-experts-weigh-in-101623549528649.html

This year, the theme of the celebration is 'Strength Beyond All Odds'.According to the global body, the theme was chosen to highlight the achievements of people with albinism around the world, show that people with albinism can defy all odds, celebrate how people with albinism worldwide meet and exceed expectations in all domains of life and encourage everyone during this time of a global pandemic to join the global effort to build back better.Here is all you need to know about albinism:-Albinism is a rare and genetically inherited condition present at birth. It is also non-contagious.-For albinism to be passed on, both parents must carry the gene, even if they do not have the condition themselves.-Albinism is found in both sexes, regardless of ethnicity, and in all countries of the world.-Albinism results in a lack of pigmentation (melanin) in the hair, skin and eyes, causing vulnerability to the sun and bright light.-As a result, almost all people with albinism are visually impaired and are prone to developing skin cancer. In some countries, a majority of persons with albinism die from skin cancer between 30 and 40 years of age. -There is no cure for the absence of melanin that is central to albinism.-It is estimated that in North America and Europe, one in every 17,000 to 20,000 people have some form of albinism.-Albinism is much more common in sub-Saharan Africa, with estimates of 1 in 1400 people being affected in Tanzania and prevalence as high as 1 in 1000 reported for a few populations in Zimbabwe and for other specific ethnic groups in southern Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-albinism-awareness-day-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-condition-101623546881543.html
13-06-2021||World||Evidence in Mexico serial killer's house suggests 17 victims||Investigators digging under the house of a suspected serial killer on the outskirts of Mexico City said Saturday they have found 3,787 bone fragments so far, apparently belonging to 17 different victims.Prosecutors in the State of Mexico, which borders Mexico City, suggested the grisly finds may not end there. In excavations carried out since May 17, authorities have dug up the floors of the house where the suspect lived. They now plan to extend the search to the soil beneath several other rooms he rented out on the same property.ID cards and other possessions from people who disappeared years ago were found at the junk-filled home, suggesting the trail of killings may go back years.The number of bone fragments found underneath concrete floors at the suspect's home would imply the corpses may have been hacked into tiny pieces. That could make sense: the suspect, identified by prosecutors only as “Andrés,” was formerly a butcher and in fact sectioned and filleted his last victim.“The bones fragments are being subjected to ‘lateralization’ studies, which include carefully cleaning each one, identifying what part of the body they are and then placing them in their anatomical position, providing a method for determining the approximate number of victims,” the office said in a statement.“This analysis indicates that, up to now, the bone fragments found may possibly be those of 17 people,” the statement said.Authorities have not released the full name of the 72-year-old suspect under Mexican laws protecting a suspect’s identity.He has been ordered to stand trial in the killing of his last victim, a 34-year-old woman whose body he allegedly dismembered with a butcher’s hacksaw and knives on May 14.He was caught, not as a result of keen investigative work, but because his most recent alleged victim was the wife of a police commander whom he knew personally. He was to have accompanied the victim on a shopping trip the day she disappeared, so her husband suspected him when she failed to return.The police officer gained access to police surveillance cameras showing his wife had entered, but not left, the street where the suspect lived; the policeman went to the home, confronted the suspect, and found his wife's hacked-up body inside.But what investigators also found was women’s clothing, voter IDs and audio and video tapes suggesting he may have recorded his victims.The format of the video tapes found at the house may suggest how far the killings went back: authorities found 28 8mm video tapes, which were discontinued around 2007, and 25 VHS cassettes, which largely fell out of favor by 2016.However, outdated tech formats often remain in use in Mexico after they have been abandoned in other countries.In total, prosecutors said they have found 91 photographs, many of the type people would have used to obtain ID cards; eight cellphones, and women's jewelry and makeup.Prosecutors said they are still examining the bone fragments to see if they can extract any DNA to identify the victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/evidence-in-mexico-serial-killer-s-house-suggests-17-victims-101623547524104.html

13-06-2021||World||Rash of mass shootings in three US states kill 2, injures at least 30 people||Two people were killed and at least 30 others wounded in mass shootings overnight in three states, authorities said Saturday, stoking concerns that a spike in US gun violence could continue into summer as coronavirus restrictions ease and more people are free to socialize.The attacks took place late Friday or early Saturday in the Texas capital of Austin, Chicago and Savannah, Georgia.In Austin, authorities said they arrested one of two male suspects and were searching for the other after a shooting early Saturday on a crowded pedestrian-only street packed with bars and restaurants. Fourteen people were wounded, including two critically, in the gunfire, which the city's interim police chief said is believed to have started as a dispute between two parties.No arrests were reported by late Saturday in the two other shootings.In Chicago, a woman was killed and nine other people were wounded when two men opened fire on a group standing on a sidewalk in the Chatham neighborhood on the city's South Side. The shooters also got away and hadn't been identified by mid-afternoon Saturday.In the south Georgia city of Savannah, police said one man was killed and seven other people were wounded in a mass shooting Friday evening, police said. Two of the wounded are children — an 18-month-old and a 13-year-old.Savannah's police chief, Roy Minter, Jr., said the shooting may be linked to an ongoing dispute between two groups, citing reports of gunshots being fired at the same apartment complex earlier in the week.“It's very disturbing what we're seeing across the country and the level of gun violence that we're seeing across the country," he told reporters Saturday. "It's disturbing and it's senseless.”The attacks come amid an easing of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions in much of the country, including Chicago, which lifted many of its remaining safeguards on Friday. Many hoped that a spike in US shootings and homicides last year was an aberration perhaps caused by pandemic-related stress amid a rise in gun ownership and debate over policing. But those rates are still higher than they were in pre-pandemic times, including in cities that refused to slash police spending following the death of George Floyd and those that made modest cuts.“There was a hope this might simply be a statistical blip that would start to come down," said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. “That hasn't happened. And that's what really makes chiefs worry that we may be entering a new period where we will see a reversal of 20 years of declines in these crimes.”Tracking ups and downs in crime is always complicated, but violent crime commonly increases in the summer months. Weekend evenings and early-morning hours also are common windows for shootings.Many types of crime did decline in 2020 and have stayed lower this year, suggesting the pandemic and the activism and unrest spurred by the reaction to Floyd’s death didn’t lead to an overall spike in crime.The two mass killings in 2020 were the lowest annual total in a decade, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. The database tracks all mass killings including shootings, defined as four or more people dead not including the perpetrator.According to that definition, there have been 17 mass killings, 16 of those shootings, already this year, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist and professor at Northeastern University.The Gun Violence Archive, which monitors media and police reports to track gun violence, defines mass shootings as those involving four or more people who were shot, regardless of whether they died. Overall, according to its database, more than 8,700 people have died of gun violence in the U.S. this year.The GVA also found that mass shootings spiked in 2020 to about 600, which was higher than in any of the previous six years it tracked the statistic. According to this year's count, there have been at least 267 mass shootings in the U.S. so far, including the latest three overnight Friday into Saturday.“It’s worrisome,” Fox said. “We have a blend of people beginning to get out and about in public. We have lots of divisiveness. And we have more guns and warm weather. It’s a potentially deadly mix.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rash-of-mass-shootings-in-three-us-states-kill-2-injures-at-least-30-people-101623541189685.html

13-06-2021||World||Iran casts doubt on reviving nuclear deal before its election||Iran cast doubt on the chances of reviving a nuclear accord with world powers before Iranians elect a new president next week who’s likely to be less willing to make concessions.Diplomats convened a sixth and possibly final round of negotiations in Vienna on Saturday. At stake is the 2015 agreement that capped Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Then-President Donald Trump jettisoned the accord three years ago and unilaterally reimposed punishing penalties, prompting Iran to dramatically increase its production of nuclear fuel.”I don’t think we can reach a final conclusion this week,” Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Iranian state television. “I believe we need to return to capital cities at least one more time. So I don’t think we’ll reach a conclusion in this round of talks...I can’t even predict how many days this round of talks will last.”A deal would remove US sanctions on Iran’s oil exports and could help calm the Middle East, after the standoff between Tehran and the Trump administration fueled regional conflicts and coincided with a spate of unclaimed attacks on shipping.Plenary talks between China, France, Germany, Iran, Russia and the U.K. convened before technical groups break off to negotiate over sanctions and nuclear activities. Enrique Mora, the European Union’s deputy foreign policy chief who’s coordinating sessions, is charged with shuttling messages and instructions between delegates and American envoy Robert Malley as long as the US formally remains outside the accord.Hours before arriving in Vienna for talks, Araghchi accused the Biden administration on Twitter of continuing to “immiserate” Iranians by levying sanctions amid a pandemic.Russia’s envoy Mikhail Ulyanov said questions remain about whether a final document can be achieved.European diplomats have warned for weeks that resurrecting the deal could become more complicated if an agreement isn’t struck before Iran’s presidential election on June 18.Araghchi said the outcome of Iran’s election will have “no bearing” on the talks in Austria.Asked if one week is enough time to reach a deal, assuming there’s a will on both sides to do so, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters Thursday that “big issues” continue to divide the sides.“We are moving at a pace that is consistent with our desire to see Iran’s nuclear program once again restricted and to see Iran, once again, subject to a permanent and verifiable ban on ever obtaining a nuclear weapon,” he said.Previous deadlines for mid-May and early June were missed after sides remained deadlocked over the scope and timing of sanctions relief, as well as the possibility of follow-on talks about regional security.An Iranian government spokesman said this week that the country’s approach toward restoring the deal won’t change after President Hassan Rouhani, who championed the accord, leaves office in August. But he’s widely expected to be succeeded by conservative cleric Ebrahim Raisi, who’s generally seen as hostile to engagement with the US.Mora told delegates after adjourning the last round of negotiations that both the US and Iran needed to make “hard decisions” that could ruffle domestic political constituencies.‘Galloping Forward’Members of both parties in the US Congress remain opposed to the accord, making it harder for the Biden administration to lift non-nuclear-related sanctions -- as demanded by Iranian lawmakers -- before Tehran rolls back the advances in its enrichment program.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that Iran’s nuclear program is “galloping forward” in the absence of an agreement. Iran, home to the world’s No. 2 natural gas and No. 4 oil reserves, began enriching uranium close to the levels needed for nuclear weapons in April and its stockpile of fuel has been growing.“It’s becoming increasingly difficult,” said International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi this week, whose inspectors will face greater restrictions on access to Iranian nuclear sites once a temporary monitoring pact expires on June 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-casts-doubt-on-reviving-nuclear-deal-before-its-election-101623533620552.html

While studies show many vaccines reduce viral load, and likely spread, not all varieties have been fully studied.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, “The risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in fully vaccinated people cannot be completely eliminated as long as there is continued community transmission of the virus.”Less than 12% of Brazil's population so far has received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Ministry of Health, and many Brazilian experts say masks can only be abandoned after the majority of the population has been vaccinated.Bolsonaro also was fined for failure to wear a mask during a rally with supporters in May in the northeastern state of Maranhao.Governors of that state and Sao Paulo have been feuding with Bolsonaro over their restrictive measures to stifle the spread of the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-bolsonaro-fined-for-flouting-covid-19-mask-rule-during-motorcycle-rally-in-sao-paulo-101623529763092.html

Biden said in a statement Saturday that he has “stayed in touch with families of the victims and with the survivors who have turned their pain into purpose" and described the club as “hallowed ground.”The president emphasized that the country must do more to reduce gun violence, such as banning assault weapons and closing loopholes in regulations that enable gun buyers to bypass background checks. Biden said the nation must acknowledge that gun violence has hurt members of the LGBTQ community“We must drive out hate and inequities that contribute to the epidemic of violence and murder against transgender women — especially transgender women of color,” Biden said.White House advisers Susan Rice and Cedric Richmond hosted a virtual roundtable on Friday with LGBTQ leaders, gun violence survivors and gun control advocates.Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Douglas Emhoff, walked Saturday with the crowd for the Capitol Pride Walk And Rally in Washington.“We still have so much to do," Harris said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-fifth-anniversary-of-pulse-nightclub-shooting-joe-biden-to-name-site-a-national-memorial-101623528949797.html

I am almost crying. We fought peacefully for this and the day has come," said protester Ofir Robinski."Netanyahu only tried to divide us and set each part of society against the other. But tomorrow we'll be united: right, left, Jews and Arabs."Protesters blew vuvuzelas or beat drums, while some wore T-shirt that read in Hebrew: "Bibi Lekh" (get out)."We are about to be done with a dark era for Israel," said Ram Shamir.Another protester, Gali Israel Tal, 62, was also optimistic that the Knesset vote on Sunday would spell Netanyahu's political demise."This is our last Saturday here. We won. Tomorrow the Knesset will vote and this prime minister will go. It is good. He will go," she said.Anti-Netanyahu protests have been staged each Saturday since July last year to denounce his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the economy.Protesters have condemned Netanyahu who became the first sitting Israeli prime minister indicted while in office, and is on trial for corruption.He is accused of accepting improper gifts and seeking to trade regulatory favours with media moguls in exchange for positive coverage -- allegations which he denies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-anti-netanyahu-protesters-in-jerusalem-claim-victory-on-eve-of-israel-vote-101623528619949.html

He said that reaching the goal requires 100 million doses in June and July, and 250 million more by September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-says-covid-19-vaccine-need-outstrips-pledges-by-g7-countries-101623526417157.html

But the administration of President Joe Biden has signalled willingness to rejoin the deal under terms that would broadly see the US scale back sanctions on Tehran and Iran return to abiding by the limits on its nuclear activity contained in the 2015 agreement.“The EU will continue with the talks with all the participants...and separately with the United States to find ways to get very close to a final agreement in the coming days,” Matton said.Diplomats say complicating factors have included the sequence of the proposed measures, dealing with advances in Iran's nuclear processing capability since the United States withdrew, and the presidential election in Iran next week.Officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the 2015 deal provided Iran vital sanctions relief in exchange for a commitment to allow extensive international monitoring as it dismantled much of its nuclear programme.Former President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal in 2018, arguing that it handed Tehran too many concessions while failing to curb its aggression in the region and ambitions to build a nuclear weapon. US sanctions that were re-imposed and intensified under Trump tipped Iran into a severe recession and enriching more uranium than permitted under the deal.Iranian officials have balked at the suggestion that some of the terms agreed to in 2015 would have to be updated, insisting that it would return to nuclear compliance as soon as Washington restored its pre-Trump sanctions policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-nuclear-deal-eu-talks-up-hope-of-breakthrough-at-meetings-in-vienna-101623523273206.html
13-06-2021||India||‘Feeling insulted in BJP’: Party’s Bengal SC front chief, a former TMC MLA||Three days after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national vice-president Mukul Roy created a stir in Bengal politics by returning to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) after 42 months, more ruling party turncoats who joined the saffron camp in the last two years either voiced dissent or kept their options open. “Mukul Roy, being a senior leader, felt insulted in the BJP for various reasons. I, too, felt insulted and betrayed,” Dulal Bar, president of the BJP’s scheduled caste (SC) morcha (front) in Bengal, told HT on Sunday afternoon. Bar, a former TMC legislator from Bagdah in North 24 Parganas district, was not given a ticket. He was not seen at any important meeting of the BJP. Prior to the polls, he resigned from the morcha but was somehow pacified by the leadership. Though the BJP failed to meet its target of winning more than 200 of the state’s 294 seats and bagged only 77, the party was supported by the SC community in several parts of the state. During the 2011 census, the state’s SC population stood at 21.4 million, or 23.51 % of the total population of 91.3 million. The total population is now projected to be 101.9 million. “If I get an invitation from the TMC I will certainly give it a thought. I will decide my next step in case I don’t get one,” added Bar, who joined the BJP in 2019 and was suspended from the assembly for a year on disciplinary ground after staging a protest on the floor of the House against an alleged attack on another turncoat MLA, Biswajit Das. In the recent polls, Das, who earlier represented the Bongaon North assembly seat in North 24 Parganas, was fielded by the BJP from the district’s Bagdah seat that Bar represented. Das, who won the seat, on Saturday said, “I have a very cordial relationship with Mamata Banerjee and Abhishek Banerjee (TMC national general secretary). Time will decide my next course of action.” Speculations over Das started on September 2, 2020, when he and Sunil Singh, the turncoat MLA from Noapara, who is also a relative of BJP Lok Sabha member Arjun Singh, had a meeting with the chief minister for 20 minutes at her chamber in the state assembly in the presence of two ministers. Das was even seen touching Banerjee’s feet to seek her blessings. A day later, the BJP MLAs were offered security by the state but they declined to take it after senior BJP leaders talked to them. Das and Singh joined the BJP at the party’s headquarters in Delhi in June 2019, a month after the BJP set a record by winning 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats. Singh lost the election held in March-April. After Mukul Roy joined the TMC on Friday, Singh said, “Roy is respected by all.” For 67-year-old Roy, the tryst with the BJP ended because of differences between different lobbies of state and central leaders, said leaders aware of the development. They said although Roy successfully contested the Krishnanagar North seat he had differences with state president Dilip Ghosh. “Leaving parties has become a habit for many. The BJP depends only on those who toiled and shed blood to strengthen the organisation. One has to sacrifice to stay in the BJP. Those who only want to enjoy power can’t stay. We will not keep them,” Ghosh tweeted on Sunday afternoon. Leader of the opposition in the assembly, Suvendu Adhikari, who defeated Mamata Banerjee in the polls, said he would demand action under the anti-defection law if any of the 77 MLAs switched sides. Explaining the BJP’s stand on TMC turncoats abandoning the saffron camp, state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said, “We will do nothing if people such as former minister Rajib Banerjee or Sonali Guha (once a close aide of the chief minister) leave the party because they did not win elections. However, the case is quite different for elected representatives.” “In the last 10 years, the assembly speaker did not take action under the anti-defection law against any of the MLAs who left the Congress and Left parties and joined the TMC. We will not allow that. The law passed by the Parliament mandates that two-third of the elected members of a party have to join another camp to escape the law,” Majumdar added. No TMC leader commented on the possibility of more BJP MLAs following Mukul Roy’s footsteps. The speaker, Biman Banerjee, did not take calls. While welcoming Roy and his son, Subhranshu, a former MLA, on Friday, the chief minister said more BJP leaders will join the ruling party in the coming days. But she added a rider. “Traitors who joined the BJP before the elections for money will not be taken back. We will take back only those who do not spread bitterness,” She said. For the record, Banerjee referred to Adhikari and Rajib Banerjee as “gaddar” (traitor) during the election campaign. Rajib Banerjee, who stoked speculations on Saturday by meeting TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh, was seen at the funeral of senior minister Partha Chatterjee’s mother on Sunday evening. BJP national secretary Anupam Hazra said, “It can be easily guessed why Banerjee met Kunal Ghosh but his appearance at the funeral is a different issue. He and Chatterjee are old associates.” Hazra, on Friday, raised a storm when he talked of lobbies in the Bengal BJP. “Lobbying in the Bengal unit of the BJP and projecting one or two leaders while ignoring and insulting capable leaders, has had its effect. The Bengal BJP should stop this lobby politics immediately and utilize leaders in accordance to their merit,” Hazra wrote on his social media page. Incidentally, on June 6, the BJP state unit formed a three-member committee to keep a track on social media posts by party leaders in view of growing dissent. Political science professor and poll analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay said, “More people are likely to join the TMC but for the sake of fairness, the MLAs should resign from the assembly because they were elected by people who supported the BJP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/feeling-insulted-in-bjp-party-s-bengal-sc-front-chief-a-former-tmc-mla-101623608978203.html
13-06-2021||India||India a natural G7 ally: PM at summit||India is a natural ally for the G7 and its partners to defend democracy and freedom of thought from challenges arising due to authoritarianism, terrorism, disinformation and economic coercion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday.Modi made the pitch in his virtual address to two outreach sessions on climate crisis and open societies at the G7 summit held in the British seaside resort of Cornwall. The meet brought together the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, while India, Australia, South Korea and South Africa joined selected sessions as guest countries.Indian officials said the country’s participation in the meet reflects understanding within the G7 that the resolution of key global crises won’t be possible without India’s engagement, involvement and support. India will remain engaged with G7 and its partners on major global issues such as access to vaccines, diversification of supply chains, building economic resilience and climate action, they said.Modi, who was a lead speaker in the outreach session on “open societies and open economies”, highlighted India’s civilisational commitment to democracy, freedom of thought and liberty. “As the world’s largest democracy, India is a natural ally for the G7 and guest countries to defend these shared values from a host of threats stemming from authoritarianism, terrorism and violent extremism, disinformation and infodemics and economic coercion,” he said.While highlighting the impact of digital technologies such as Aadhaar, DBT (direct benefit transfer) and JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) trinity on social inclusion and empowerment, he also pointed to “vulnerabilities inherent in open societies” and asked “tech companies and social media platforms to ensure a safe cyber environment for their users”.Modi’s views in this regard were appreciated by other leaders, P Harish, additional secretary (economic relations) in the external affairs ministry, told a news briefing.The leaders of the G7 states and guest countries emphasised their commitment to a free, open, inclusive and rules-based Indo-Pacific and resolved to collaborate with partners in the region, Harish said.Modi also made a strong pitch for reform of the multilateral system based on openness, democracy, transparency and inclusion.At the session on climate crisis, Modi sought collective action and said this challenge couldn’t be addressed in silos. He pointed out that India is the only G20 state on track to meet its Paris Accord commitments, and highlighted the need for climate action to include all aspects of mitigation, technology transfer, financing, climate justice and lifestyle change to provide necessary space to developing countries to grow.Modi also called on the G7 states to meet their “unfulfilled promise of $100 billion annually in climate finance”.India has closely worked with the UK, the current president of G7 and the co-president of the COP26 Summit to be held later this year, on climate action. India is committed to installing 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030, and it will work with the UK to provide climate resilient infrastructure through a new facility under the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) to small island developing states.India has also endorsed the “30 by 30” targets, which call for protecting 30% of the country’s land and 30% of oceans by 2030. It is committed to achieving domestic land degradation neutrality and restoring 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. At the same time, India has highlighted at the G7 the importance of recognising the different trajectories and historical responsibilities of developed and developing nations in relation to climate change, Harish said.At another outreach session on health on Saturday, Modi urged the G7 states to adopt a united approach to the coronavirus pandemic and future health emergencies with the mantra of “one earth, one health”. He had also sought support for the India-South Africa proposal at the World Health Organization (WHO) for waiver of patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines.Modi was invited to the G7 Summit by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, but did not travel to Cornwall because of the pandemic situation. The theme for the summit was “build back better” in the aftermath of the devastating impact of the pandemic over the past 18 months, and the need for ambitious and targeted recovery measures.The Prime Minister’s speeches at the three sessions focused on health, climate change and open societies, and he highlighted that democratic and transparent societies have additional responsibilities and added advantages in responding to contemporary challenges.Harish said India’s shared values such as democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, unwavering commitment to a rules-based international order and inherently open and transparent systems made the country a natural partner for the G7.With the focus on equitable and affordable access to vaccines in all parts of the world and the need for stronger systems to respond to future pandemics, the G7 pledged to donate an additional one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by 2022. The G7 leaders also called for a fresh investigation into the origins of the pandemic.UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres identified the waiver of patent protections for vaccines as an important element of his “global vaccination plan” to vaccinate the global population by doubling vaccine production, while French President Emmanuel Macron spoke of the need to focus on ramping up vaccine production capacity in Africa with expertise from India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-a-natural-g7-ally-pm-at-summit-101623607958486.html
13-06-2021||India||Talks on with SP for U.P. poll alliance, says RLD’s Jayant||Jayant Chaudhary, the newly appointed chief of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), said on Sunday that his party is in talks with the Samajwadi Party (SP) for high-stakes election battle in Uttar Pradesh in 2022. “We are in talks with the Samajwadi Party (SP). We fought the last election together as well. We may formalise the alliance by making a common stand on issues and settle seat sharing soon,” said Chaudhary, appointed as the chief of the RLD last month, after party’s founder-president and his father Chaudhary Ajit Singh succumbed to Covid-19 on May 6.The 42-year-old leader, who has been vocal against the Centre’s three farm laws, is confident that the unity of farmers and the youth in western UP is likely to dent Bharatiya Janata Party’s poll prospects. “The farmers’ struggle and unity is commendable. It will help us bring this government to account in the coming polls. We note that the declining faith in Modi’s personal leadership has come about because of lies to farmers on doubling income and inability to respond to the current protests in a humane and just manner. In western UP, farmers and the youth will break caste and religious boundaries and provide a formidable opposition to the BJP. The same response was observed in the recent Zila Panchayat polls,” the RLD chief said. For the past six months, farmers from across the country are protesting at Delhi’s borders against the three farm laws-- Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020-- brought by the Centre in September last year. In an interview with news agency PTI, Chaudhary also asserted that his party will not allow a communally polarised campaign to ruin the Hindi heartland state and said that artificial issues such as “love jihad” and “cow terror” will not work. “Love jihad, cow terror, Kairana exodus and other useless artificial issues will be rejected; healthcare, education and balanced development will win (in the polls),” he said.Responding to question on carrying forward the legacy of Chaudhary Ajit Singh, and grandfather and farmer leader, Chaudhary Charan Singh, the RLD chief said, “It is a challenge but not a burden...I am enriched by the history and the bonds that are still strong and am proud of the work and the legacy of these two stalwarts...We will try and address the issues with an eye on the past and a new language to usher in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/talks-on-with-sp-for-u-p-poll-alliance-says-rld-s-jayant-101623607657031.html

Tomorrow I am coming to Gujarat, and will meet all the brothers and sisters of Gujarat," Kejriwal said in a tweet posted in Gujarati on Sunday. During his visit, Kejriwal is scheduled to inaugurate the party's Gujarat state office in Ahmedabad.This will be Kejriwal's second visit to Gujarat. He had last visited Surat in February after the party emerged as the main opposition after the civic body elections there in its maiden fight there.His visit assumes significance as the AAP is eyeing to contest the December 2022 Gujarat Assembly election and aggressively preparing for it.In a release, the state unit of the AAP said, “As per Kejriwal's day-long itinerary of his Monday visit, he will arrive at Ahmedabad airport at 10.20 am, from where he will go to the circuit house. At 11.40 am, he will hold a press conference at the city's Vallabh Sadan after "taking the blessings of Lord Krishna.”He will then leave to inaugurate the party's new state office located on Ashram Road. Kejriwal will leave for Delhi on the same day, party's spokesperson Tuli Banerjee said.The AAP had made inroads into Gujarat politics by winning 27 seats in the 120-member Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), emerging as the main opposition. The party had also fielded candidates across all the local bodies- municipal corporations, municipalities, as well as district and taluka panchayats, winning on several of them.The AAP is looking to present itself as a formidable alternative to the Congress in Gujarat and challenge the BJP in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home turf. The party is trying to fill in the gap left by the Congress, which has seen setbacks in the recent past with several of its MLAs resigning, and its poor performance in the local body polls held in February this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-gujarat-will-change-says-kejriwal-ahead-of-his-visit-101623606829146.html

The family of the deceased has alleged that the sisters, aged 14 and 16, were raped and murdered. Five persons have been arrested so far, police said. “The family members of the victims said that there was no reason for them to commit suicide. The entire incident appears mysterious. That’s why I came to interact with the family and held discussions with officials, seeking details on the incident,” Sarma told reporters. The two sisters were found hanging from a tree inside a small forest away from their home on Friday evening. The deceased’s family told local media that the sisters went missing on Friday afternoon. The bodies of the victims were sent to Kokrajhar civil hospital on Saturday for post-mortem. The reports of the examination are awaited. “If it is a murder, the accused should be arrested and given appropriate punishment. If it is a case of suicide, then the probe should be on what led the sisters to commit the act. I have directed the police to probe both these angles,” he added. “The role of some persons is suspected and police have already detained five persons for questioning. Two of them were found to have deleted all the messages from their mobile phones but there is evidence of them making calls, lasting for over an hour, to the victims,” the chief minister said. Sarma said such incidents (of crimes against women) were taking place in districts of lower Assam and that a sense of insecurity had developed among the residents here. “I came to visit the family in order to convey a message to all that my government won’t tolerate any such incident, especially those targeting the poor and oppressed sections,” he said.“We have arrested five persons in connection with the incident and are questioning them. The arrested persons are residents of the area to which the victims belonged. The post-mortem reports will give further leads on the exact nature of the deaths. Further investigations are on,” Kokrajhar superintendent of police Thube Prateek Vijay Kumar said. The chief minister was accompanied by BTR chief executive member Pramod Boro, United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) legislator Lawrence Islary and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Ashok Singhi.

General secretary of the Trust Champat Rai said he won't comment on the allegations without studying the matter. "They keep making allegations on us. It has been like this for the last 100 years. They blamed us also for the death of Mahatma Gandhi. I will not say anything in the matter without a study," Rai told news agency ANI.Samajwadi Party leader Tej Narayan Pandey sought a CBI probe into the alleged land scam in which the price of the land was changed within minutes. Trust member Anil Mishra and mayor of Ayodhya Rishikesh Upadhyay are witnesses in both the sale agreements, Pandey said."The Trust purchased a piece of land, which had been bought in ₹2 crores just 10 minutes before, in ₹18.5 crores on March 18," he alleged.रवि मोहन तिवारी और सुल्तान अंसारी ने शाम 7:10 PM पर 2 करोड़ की ज़मीन ख़रीदी शाम 7:15 PM पर राम जन्म भूमि ट्रस्ट के चम्पत राय ने 18.5 करोड़ में उनसे ये ज़मीन ख़रीद ली।क्या दुनिया में कहीं 5.50 लाख रु प्रति सेकेण्ड ज़मीन महँगी होते देखा है ये काम किया है #चंदा_चोर_चम्पत ने pic.twitter.com/kR6bf6uRljAam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh too released several documents on social media and said, "Ravi Mohan Tiwari and Sultan Ansari bought land worth ₹2 crores at 7.10 pm. At 7.15 pm, Champat Rai of Ram Janmabhoomi Trust bought this land from them for ₹18.5 crores. Out of this ₹18.5 crore, ₹17 crore was paid through RTGS. This means, there has been an increase of ₹5.50 lakh every second. Is there any place in the world where land prices change so quickly? But this happens at Lord Ram's birthplace."According to the allegations, the land in Ayodhya belonged to Kusum Pathak and Harish Pathak. From them, Sultan Ansari Ravi Mohan Tiwari purchased the land at a price of ₹2 crore. Within minutes, the land was bought from them by the Trust at ₹18 crore. In both the transactions, Anil Mishra and Rishikesh Upadhyay were the witnesses."There is another clue in the irregularities. The stamp for the first transaction was bought at 5.22pm while the stamp for the second transaction was boight at 5.11pm. So, the stamp for buying the land which was not sold at that time was bought first," the AAP leader said.Appealing to PM Modi, CBI and ED for a thorough probe into the money laundering, the AAP leader said, "Devotion of crores of devotees, who donated for the construction of the temple, is at stake," the AAP MLA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-mandir-opposition-alleges-major-land-scam-won-t-comment-now-says-trust-101623601501512.html

The email system is totally safe and secure," the government clarified.Also read: Data of millions on CoWIN portal safe, assures govt, denies reports of ‘hacking’In response to the media report, the Union ministry for electronics and IT said cybersecurity breach on external portals may not impact the users of government email services, unless the government users have registered in the portals using their government email address and have used the same password as the once used in the official government email account.On Saturday, a report claimed to have accessed internal communication and said, "Compromised emails on government domains such as @nic.in and @gov.in are potential cyber threats as they are being used by “adversaries” to send malicious mails to all government users."Several government officials, including defence ministry officials, were sent a malicious link through WhatsApp and SMS, asking them to update their Covid-19 vaccination status. The message asked the officials to click on https://covid19india.in for digital certificate of vaccination. The link would redirect them to a page with the government domain "@gov.in", which resembled the official website mygov.in, and asked for their emails and passwords, as per the report.Dismissing the report, the government said NIC email system has various security measures like two-factor authentication and change of password in 90 days. Any change of password in NIC email requires mobile OTP and if the OTP entered is incorrect, the password could not be changed. The ministry also said NIC email is capable of mitigating any attempt of phishing using NIC email.Also read: Domino’s Pizza says financial info safe, as data of 180 million users breached"NIC also undertakes user awareness drives from time to time and keeps updating the users about potential risks and safety protocols," the ministry said.In the last week of February, a highly sophisticated cyberattack targeted Air India that affected around 45 lakh "data subjects" in the world.

Nirmal, 85, breathed her last at Fortis hospital in Mohali on Sunday. Former captain of the Indian women’s volleyball team, Nirmal’s health deteriorated a few days after she was admitted to the hospital.There was a drop in her oxygen level owing to Covid-19 and she was put on HFNC (high flow nasal cannula) and NIV (non-invasive ventilator) intermittently since then. She was stable but her condition had not improved. She was admitted to the hospital in last week of May after she had developed Covid-19 pneumonia. At that time, 91-year-old Milkha was also admitted at the same Mohali hospital. When Milkha’s health improved, on his family’s insistence, he was sent home, however, ailing Nirmal stayed back for further treatment. Their son and India’s ace golfer along with sister doctor Mona had been co-ordinating with the doctors in the hospital.Her family released a statement later on Sunday, “We are deeply saddened to inform you that Mrs Nirmal Milkha Singh passed away after a valiant battle against COVID at 4 PM today. Former Director of Sports for Women in the Punjab Government and former captain of the Indian Women’s National Volleyball Team, Nirmal ji fought a valiant battle till the very end. A back bone of the Milkha Family, she was 85 years old. It is tragic that the Flying Sikh Milkha Singh ji could not attend the cremation which was conducted this evening itself as he is still in the ICU himself. The family has expressed its grateful thanks to everyone for their solidarity and prayers right through the battle which gave them the strength to face it bravely.”As a couple, Milkha and Nirmal ruled the roost and commanded love and respect from all corners in Chandigarh. With Nirmal leaving the world, the world lost a gem and spirit of Milkha household.Legendary Milkha’s love-story with Nirmal goes way back to 1960s. Nirmal was born as in Sheikhupura, Pakistan, on October 8, 1938. She was captain of the Punjab volleyball team on three separate occasions. In 1955, she also went on tour to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) as part of India volleyball team. There she met young Milkha. However, their friendship blossomed while both were deputed as sports administrators in Chandigarh in 1960 and 1961. While Milkha joined Punjab administration in Chandigarh as deputy director of sports, Nirmal was director sports for women. Milkha married Nirmal back in 1962. She had a Political Science Master’s degree in 1958 from Punjab University. She is known to have worn ‘Salwar Kameez’ instead of shorts or skirts during the national as well as international volleyball tournaments.Nirmal was a hard-task master as a director sports for women and responsible for bolstering the sports infrastructure in Chandigarh. She retired in the early 90’s.“Madam has played a huge role in building Chandigarh’s sports infrastructure. The Sector 42 Sector 7 and Sector 46 Sports Complexes were built during her tenure. She made sure Chandigarh had the best sports facilities. Her contribution towards developing sports complexes and playgrounds in Chandigarh, including the hockey and tennis stadiums, has been significant. The standard of sports also improved. Besides national meets, she organised an international level regatta and hockey championship. I remember Chandigarh successfully hosted Asian level rowing and water-sports tournament in 1989. She had a heart of gold. Always very kind towards poor athletes,” said Vijaypal Singh, secretary Volleyball federation of India and also secretary of Chandigarh Volleyball Association. Nirmal remains to be Patron-in-Chief of Chandigarh Volleyball Association. She first captained India women in 1955 during a tour to Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirmal-kaur-milkha-singh-s-wife-dies-after-fighting-covid-19-for-3-weeks-101623599387780.html
13-06-2021||India||India natural ally for G7, partners to take on global challenges: PM Modi||India is a natural ally for the G7 and its partners to defend democracy and freedom of thought from challenges arising due to authoritarianism, terrorism, disinformation and economic coercion, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday. Modi made the pitch in his virtual address to two outreach sessions on climate change and open societies at the G7 Summit held in the British seaside resort of Cornwall. The meet brought together the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, while India, Australia, South Korea and South Africa joined selected sessions as guest countries. Indian officials said the country’s participation in the meet reflects understanding within the G7 that the resolution of key global crises won’t be possible without India’s engagement, involvement and support. India will remain engaged with G7 and its partners on major global issues such as access to vaccines, diversification of supply chains, building economic resilience and climate action, they said. Modi, who was a lead speaker in the outreach session on “open societies and open economies”, highlighted India’s civilisational commitment to democracy, freedom of thought and liberty. “As the world’s largest democracy, India is a natural ally for the G7 and guest countries to defend these shared values from a host of threats stemming from authoritarianism, terrorism and violent extremism, disinformation and infodemics and economic coercion,” he said. While highlighting the impact of digital technologies such as Aadhaar, DBT (direct benefit transfer) and JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) trinity on social inclusion and empowerment, he also pointed to “vulnerabilities inherent in open societies” and asked “tech companies and social media platforms to ensure a safe cyber environment for their users”. Modi’s views in this regard were appreciated by other leaders, P Harish, additional secretary (economic relations) in the external affairs ministry, told a news briefing. The leaders of the G7 states and guest countries emphasised their commitment to a free, open, inclusive and rules-based Indo-Pacific and resolved to collaborate with partners in the region, Harish said. Modi also made a strong pitch for reform of the multilateral system based on openness, democracy, transparency and inclusion. At the session on climate change, Modi sought collective action and said this challenge couldn’t be addressed in silos. He pointed out that India is the only G20 state on track to meet its Paris Accord commitments, and highlighted the need for climate action to include all aspects of mitigation, technology transfer, financing, climate justice and lifestyle change to provide necessary space to developing countries to grow. Modi also called on the G7 states to meet their “unfulfilled promise of $100 billion annually in climate finance”. India has closely worked with the UK, the current president of G7 and the co-president of the COP26 Summit to be held later this year, on climate action. India is committed to installing 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030, and it will work with the UK to provide climate resilient infrastructure through a new facility under the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) to small island developing states. India has also endorsed the “30 by 30” targets, which call for protecting 30% of the country’s land and 30% of oceans by 2030. It is committed to achieving domestic land degradation neutrality and restoring 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. At the same time, India has highlighted at the G7 the importance of recognising the different trajectories and historical responsibilities of developed and developing nations in relation to climate change, Harish said. At another outreach session on health on Saturday, Modi urged the G7 states to adopt a united approach to the Coronavirus pandemic and future health emergencies with the mantra of “One earth, one health”. He had also sought support for the India-South Africa proposal at the World Health Organization (WHO) for waiver of patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines. Modi was invited to the G7 Summit by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, but did not travel to Cornwall because of the pandemic situation. The theme for the summit was “build back better” in the aftermath of the devastating impact of the pandemic over the past 18 months and the need for ambitious and targeted recovery measures. The prime minister’s speeches at the three sessions focused health, climate change and open societies, and he highlighted that democratic and transparent societies have additional responsibilities and added advantages in responding to contemporary challenges. Harish said India’s shared values such as democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, unwavering commitment to a rules-based international order and inherently open and transparent systems made the country a natural partner for the G7. With the focus on equitable and affordable access to vaccines in all parts of the world and the need for stronger systems to respond to future pandemics, the G7 pledged to donate an additional one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by 2022. The G7 leaders also called for a fresh investigation into the origins of the pandemic.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres identified the waiver of patent protections for vaccines as an important element of his “global vaccination plan” to vaccinate the global population by doubling vaccine production, while French President Emmanuel Macron spoke of the need to focus on ramping up vaccine production capacity in Africa with expertise from India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-natural-ally-for-g7-partners-to-take-on-global-challenges-pm-modi-101623598476929.html

Ahead of his arrival, protesting group 'Save Lakshadweep Forum' has announced its plan to observe 'Black day' on Monday, following which security has been tightened on the island. Protestors have also sought time to meet the administrator who is holding additional charge of the island. Dadar and Diu administrator was given the additional charge after the death of the former administrator.On Saturday, over a dozen Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) members in Lakshadweep resigned over the sedition case against filmmaker Aisha Sultana. During a debate in one of the Malayalam channels, Sultana had termed Patel a bio-weapon launched by the union government, following which BJP president C Abdul Khadar Haji filed a police complaint against her, accusing her of sedition.BJP Kerala state vice president KS Radhakrishnan said the BJP members were "terrorised and coerced" into resigning.He said that since the BJP has only a nominal presence in the union territory, the 15 party members were left with no other option but to endorse the view of the majority, news agency ANI reported."There is the nominal presence of BJP in Lakshadweep. The majority of the people do not belong to BJP. They were terrorised and coerced by the majority and they had no other option but to endorse the views adopted by the majority party. That is what happened there," Radhakrishnan told ANI.Witnessing furore for over a month now, residents of the archipelago have been protesting against decisions by the administrator stating that they will affect unique culture and tradition of a group of islands. The locals are up in arms against three draft regulations that propose to develop the island as a major tourist destination, goonda act and the plan to restrict the slaughtering of cattle. They also allege these regulations will destroy the islands' character and identity since 97% of the islands are covered by forests and 95% of its Muslim population belongs to the protected scheduled tribe category.People are protesting against the draft legislations like Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (Goonda Act), Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation and Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, 2021 among others.Patel, who was appointed as the Administrator of Lakshadweep in December 2020, is facing opposition over policies introduced by him from the people of the union territory and politicians, both from within Lakshadweep and the neighbouring state of Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/black-day-to-be-observed-in-lakshadweep-as-praful-khoda-patel-returns-to-island-101623591507017.html

The Food and Drug Administration of the United States has also refused to grant emergency use authorisation to the Indian vaccine, which has also invited backlash from several quarters. However, the company has said that it is fully committed to maintaining transparency. And the FDA denial is not being considered as a setback as the US is not giving emergency use approval to any vaccine now as the Covid-19 situation in the US is relatively under control. Also, the company will now pursue full licence, which no vaccine produced in India has in the US.Clinical trials in the USBharat Biotech will conduct clinical trials of Covaxin, the Covid-19 vaccine developed by the company in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research, in the United States as its US partner Ocugen has said that it will now apply for a full licence in the US. To obtain this, Bharat Biotech — through its US partner will have to follow the process of biologics licence application for which clinical trial will be required. So, the vaccines will be now tested on US participants. It is not yet known whether it will be a large-scale study or a small bridging study. The company will not go down the emergency use authorisation route again after being denied by the Food and Drugs Administration.Research papers on CovaxinThe company said that there is enough data on the efficacy of the vaccine. There are nine research studies on the safety and efficacy of Covaxin in five globally reputed peer-reviewed journals, it said. It is the first and only product to have published any data from human clinical trials in India. It is the only product to have any data on emerging variants. EUA in CanadaBharat Biotech's US partner has said it will pursue an emergency-use approval application in Canada. The company has already secured exclusive right to commercialise Covaxin in CanadaHow many countries are administering Covaxin?Covaxin is being administered in six countries at present while the EUA has been obtained in 13 countries.If Covaxin gets full licensure in the United States, it will be a great leap, the company said as no vaccine manufactured or developed from India has ever received EUA or full licensure from USFDA.Covaxin in IndiaThe government has said that it is satisfied with the data it provided to the Drug Controller General of India and the FDA decision will have no impact on India's ongoing vaccination drive. While the company is ramping up its production, its trial on children between the age of 12 to 18 years is going on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clinical-trial-in-us-eua-in-canada-what-s-next-for-bharat-biotech-s-covaxin-101623588615606.html

The plant at Maharaja Agrasen Hospital will be operated and maintained by the IGL for one year.The nation came together to meet heightened oxygen demand during the second wave of the pandemic. The steel companies played a major role by supplying liquefied medical oxygen (LMO) across the country by diverting their oxygen producing capacities towards producing LMO and by reducing steel production, he said. Pradhan also has the steel portfolio.The plant at Maharaja Agrasen Hospital has a capacity of 60 NM3/hour, which can give oxygen with purity of upto 96%. The plant can also fill 12 Jumbo type-D Medical oxygen cylinders per hour through an oxygen compressor at 150 bar apart from providing medical oxygen support to the beds connected to the hospital manifold through pipes, the statement said. There is no requirement of any specialized raw material. The PSA uses the technology, whereby a chemical acting as Zeolites Sieve is used which filters nitrogen and other gases from air and end product is medical oxygen, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dharmendra-pradhan-inaugurates-oxygen-plant-at-maharaja-agrasen-hospital-101623587795981.html
13-06-2021||India||‘India needs resurgent Congress but…’: Kapil Sibal on crisis in party||Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal remarked on Sunday that the country needs a "resurgent" Congress, though he also called for the party to undergo reforms at various levels."India needs a resurgent Congress but it also needs to show it is active and in a mood to engage meaningfully," Sibal told news agency PTI, adding that the party needs organisational polls, widespread reforms at central and state levels to show it is no longer "in a state of inertia."The former Union minister further claimed that currently, there is a void of a political alternative in the country. "The country needs a strong and credible opposition," Sibal, a member of the Congress' dissenting "G-23" group of leaders, said. He also stressed upon the "urgent" need to strike a balance between young and experienced leaders of the party.Sibal's comments come at a time when the Congress is facing troubles on multiple fronts. The party has been without a full-time president for nearly two years now. Rahul Gandhi, the last full-time Congress president, resigned after Congress' defeat in the 2019 general elections. It was the party's second successive defeat in a general election against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Gandhi succeeded his mother Sonia Gandhi as Congress president in 2017 but the latter was forced to return as the party president, albeit in an interim capacity - a post she still holds - in the wake of Gandhi's resignation.The party has also seen defections by several young leaders to the BJP. On June 9, two-term Lok Sabha MP and former Union minister Jitin Prasada joined the BJP, more than a year after Jyotiraditya Scindia switched sides, triggering a collapse of the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh. In other states too, where the Congress is in power, there are rumblings which could bring trouble for the party. Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who nearly walked out last year, is currently in Delhi, and is likely to meet Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday. In Punjab, there is infighting between chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu.Also Read: AICC panel submits report on Punjab Congress infighting to Sonia GandhiPunjab is likely to go to polls early next year. In 2017, the Congress, under Singh, won a comfortable majority, displacing the BJP-Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) government in the process. However, in the recently held assembly elections in four states and a Union territory, the Congress was on the winning side only in Tamil Nadu, as a member of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-led alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-needs-resurgent-congress-but-kapil-sibal-on-crisis-in-party-101623580875488.html

Pradhan said Gandhi should ask chief ministers of states where Congress is in power if he is concerned about the burden on the common man.Fuel prices in seven Indian states like Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka have already crossed the ₹100-mark, registering historic highs."Rahul Gandhi must answer why is fuel expensive in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Punjab? If Rahul Gandhi is concerned about the poor being hit by fuel prices, he should ask chief ministers of Congress-ruled states to cut taxes," Pradhan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also read | 'Accept rising petrol, diesel prices problematic but...': What minister saidGandhi should ask Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray to reduce taxes, Pradhan added.However, the petroleum minister did not suggest a similar action for states ruled by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), like Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, where the consumers are feeling the pinch of rising fuel prices. The fuel prices have been hiked 23 times since last month.Rahul Gandhi, in his latest attack on the government, asked as to how much will the BJP "loot". "GDP crashing, Unemployment soaring, Fuel prices skyrocketing. In how many more ways is #BJPLootingIndia," he asked in a tweet on Friday.Congress on Friday held demonstrations in several parts of the country against the rising fuel prices, during which over 150 members were detained in Gujarat, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh for allegedly violating Covid protocol and protesting without permission.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. As a result, the petrol retails at over ₹100 per litre mark in six states and union territories - Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Ladakh.Also read: Congress protests fuel price hike in Punjab, HaryanaPetrol and diesel have risen to an all-time high across the country after fuel rates rose by ₹5.72 to ₹6.25 per litre in less than six weeks.Pradhan's remarks came during an inauguration of a medical oxygen generating plant at Maharaj Agrasen Hospital in New Delhi, the first of seven such units being set up by state-run oil companies in the national capital ahead of the impending third wave of Covid-19 pandemic.Acknowledging the brunt borne by citizens, Pradhan said he accepts that fuel prices are pinching consumers. The central and state governments need additional money from the taxes on petrol and diesel to meet expenses for fighting pandemic as well as development work, he told the reporters.The spike in fuel prices in India is due to a combination of rising international oil prices and record-high central and state taxes.While international oil prices have crossed USD 72 per barrel in anticipation of demand recovery following the rollout of vaccination programme by various countries.Last year, when rates collapsed to a two-decade low, the Union government instead of passing on the benefit to consumers raised excise duty to record high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-must-answer-oil-minister-on-fuel-price-hikes-in-congress-ruled-states-101623580791726.html

Naik said she didn’t know the woman, who asked her to get something to eat while she waited with her child.The woman then walked out of the hospital premises, hired a motorcycle taxi and was seen on CCTV cameras at Mapusa heading north.“Upon interrogation, the accused claimed she kidnapped the child as she wanted to raise it as her own. She is a housewife and lives in Saleli with her husband and four daughters,” Saksena added.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant praised the police for successfully completing what he described as one of the “biggest manhunts” in the state.“I congratulate Goa Police for successfully leading one of the biggest manhunts in the State and safely rescuing a one month old child within 24hrs.

The district administration has issued a show-cause notice to the woman health worker, who administered the jab after a complaint was filed with the district administration.Geeta, who had performed at the Namaste Trump event, posted a photo of getting the jab sitting on a sofa at her house, which led to an uproar on social media following which the photo was taken down.Kanpur admin orders probe as cricketer Yadav takes Covid jab at 'guest house'"As per the complaint received by me yesterday, Geeta Rabari had taken vaccination at her house at Madhapar village on Saturday evening. I issued instructions to officials to identify the health staff who went to her home to administer the vaccine, and on whose approval it was done," said Kutch DDO Bhavya Verma, as reported by PTI. He has also confirmed to the news agency that the 25-year-old singer had booked a slot on Saturday but instead of going to the public health centre, she got it done at home. Further action into the case will be taken after the healthcare staff explains to the administration what happened, the DDO said.Sharing the photo of the singer, which she took down, social media users are questioning whether door-to-door vaccination has been started in Kutch. While PM Modi and the chief minister can go to the vaccination centre, why the singer can't, Twitter users have asked.A similar case happened with cricketer Kuldeep Yadav who took the vaccine at a guest house, while his slot was booked at Jageshwar Hospital in Govind Nagar, Kanpur.

The entire incident appears mysterious,” said Sarma, while visiting the victims’ family, which has alleged that the sisters were raped and murdered.The two girls, aged 16 and 14, were found dead inside a small forest, some distance away from their home, on Friday evening a few hours after they went missing. “If it’s [a] murder, [then] the accused should be arrested and handed an appropriate punishment. And if it’s a case of [death by] suicide, the probe should be on what led to it. I have directed the police to probe both these angles,” he added. Bodies of the two victims were sent to Kokrajhar civil hospital on Saturday for post-mortem. The reports were awaited. Sarma said police have already detained five persons for questioning. “Two of them were found to have deleted all messages from their mobiles phones, but there’s evidence of them making calls, lasting over an hour, to the victims,” he said. Sarma added that crimes against women in districts of lower Assam had led to a sense of insecurity, however, his government wouldn’t tolerate such incidents, especially those targeting the poor and the oppressed sections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-cm-says-deaths-of-2-minor-sisters-mysterious-calls-for-thorough-probe-101623579275677.html
13-06-2021||India||Malnutrition and diseases directly linked, says UN's WFP India official||Underlining that there is a direct link between malnutrition and diseases, India country director of UN World Food Programme Bishow Parajuli suggested safeguarding and promoting access to nutritious, safe, and affordable diets and investing in improving maternal and child nutrition to protect children's right to nutrition in the Covid-19 pandemic.India has been battling high prevalence of malnutrition among its population, especially children, with National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4 (2015-16) data showing that 35.7 per cent children below five years are underweight, 38.4 per cent are stunted and 21 per cent are wasted in the country. Even NFHS-5 which was conducted in 22 states and union territories presented a grim scenario and showed a rise in malnutrition.In an interview with PTI, the World Food Programme India's country director said malnutrition is particularly lethal in combination with infectious diseases such as ARI, malaria, measles, diarrhoeal diseases -- the major killer diseases affecting children.Responding to a question if malnutrition can become a comorbidity for children infected with Covid-19, he said in general, there is a direct link between malnutrition and diseases like coronavirus disease."Malnutrition can make a person more susceptible to infection through a lowered immune response, and infection further contributes to malnutrition resulting in a vicious cycle of repeated infections, reduced immunity, and deteriorating nutritional status. It is known that malnutrition magnifies the effect of disease and a malnourished person has more severe disease episodes, more complications, and spends more time ill for each episode," he said.There have been speculations that the third wave of Covid-19 may impact children more. However, the available evidence show that children are as much affected as adults."It is, however, important that parents and caregivers of children get vaccinated so that they act as a protective ring around the children till such time vaccination is not opened up to young children," he said.Noting that even though many programmes are still in place, the country director said to mitigate the impact of the crisis on families and society and to protect the nutrition of the most vulnerable families and individuals, further action is urgently needed from national and state governments.He suggested five urgent actions to protect children's right to nutrition in the Covid-19 pandemic -- safeguarding and promoting access to nutritious, safe, and affordable diets, investing in improving maternal and child nutrition through pregnancy, infancy, and early childhood, re-activating and scaling-up services for the early detection and treatment of child wasting, maintain the provision of nutritious and safe school meals for vulnerable children and expand social protection to safeguard access to nutritious diets and essential services.Elaborating on WFP's work on fortification and take-home ration (THR), he said WFP is collaborating with Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Odisha to design nutritious take-home rations aligned to both ICDS norms and global guidelines for such products for young children and pregnant/lactating women; set up THR production units where the same is produced by women's self-help groups following industrial quality assurance and control protocols; capacity building of women's self-help groups and establish the link between THR and social behaviour change communication."This intervention, though focused on nutrition, is also known to empower women, generate livelihoods whilst at the same time trigger rural economies," he said.The collaboration was done after WFP found that the nutritional value of the THR is limited due to high percentage contribution to energy from sugar, poor quality proteins, and low levels of fats/ micronutrients though the products may be aligned to the norms of energy and proteins established by the government."It was also noticed that quality control protocols were poorly followed and the THR did not find a mention in the nutrition health education sessions conducted by the front line functionaries despite huge spending by the Government on THR. All of this led to the limited acceptability of the products in the community," he said.Responding to a question on impact on children's nutrition over unavailability of mid-day meals due to closure of schools, he said during the period January-March 2021, MDM was found to be functional in various forms in nearly all states and UTs."Seven states are providing hot cooked meals. However, in four states, the government is using a mixed approach where a hot cooked meal is served to upper primary students while FSA (Food Security Allowance) is provided to primary students as schools continue to remain closed for these children. In one State, schools are providing hot cooked meals to elementary students attending classes and also providing FSA to absent students," he said. In the remaining 24 States, he said FSA is being provided."In eight of the 24 States, both dry food rations and the cooking cost is being provided while in the remaining 16 states only dry food rations are being provided which may vary from only grains to a more nutritious food basket consisting of grains, pulses, oil, potatoes, eggs, salt, condiments, etc," Parajuli said.He added that only in one State that the MDM was not found functioning in any form.Welcoming the Centre's decision to extend the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana that entitles each beneficiary 5 kg of free food grain every month until November, he said there are increasing concerns that some of the most deserving families are having difficulties accessing the support."Additionally, like the last time the scheme should include pulses as it would also provide nutritional diversity in the diet," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malnutrition-and-diseases-directly-linked-says-un-s-wfp-india-official-101623576838479.html
13-06-2021||India||Kotkapura firing: Ex-Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal summoned by SIT||A special investigation team (SIT), probing the Kotkapura firing case, has summoned former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal. The three-member SIT of Punjab Police is headed by additional director general of police (vigilance bureau) LK Yadav. Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal and Faridkot range DIG Surjit Singh are the other two members.During the previous government led by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), torn pages of Sikh religious text Guru Granth Sahib were found at Bargari in Faridkot. Later, in an incident of police firing at anti-sacrilege protesters, two people were killed at Behbal Kalan and many injured at Kotkapura.The Punjab and Haryana high court had on April 9 quashed all reports filed by the previous SIT headed by the inspector general of police (now retired) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh in the case.The state governemnt then constituted a new three-member SIT, which was directed to complete the probe in six months.The new SIT started its investigation on May 13 and summoned people, which gave statements to previous investigation team, to appear before it.The SAD has, meanwhile, said that the one-man commission set to probe the 2015 desecration incidents nor the earlier constituted SIT indicted former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and his deputy Sukhbir Badal in the case.But the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have been targeting the party, demanding action against its leaders in the case.Last month, Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu shared on his Twitter handle video clips of purported police action on people protesting the desecration of a religious text in Punjab's Faridkot in 2015 and purported contents of the report of Justice Ranjit Singh Commission that had probed incidents of the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib.The tweet was in response to SAD chief Sukhbir Badal's statement in which he had dared the Congress leaders to share the proof.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kotkapura-firing-ex-punjab-chief-minister-parkash-singh-badal-summoned-by-sit-101623576874510.html

Reveal names, says Rajasthan minister as Pilot loyalists complain||As the Ashok Gehlot government is again facing the old allegations of tapping the phones of its MLAs, Rajashthan minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas on Sunday said those who are raising these allegations should reveal the names of those MLAs whose phone are being 'tapped'. They should speak to the chief minister instead of passing the buck to other MLAs who presumably said their phones ar being tapped. The comment comes as Congress MLA Ved Prakash Solanki, who belongs to Sachin Pilot camp, said some Congress MLAs talked about phone tapping. He also added that he was not sure whether his phone was being tapped or not."Rajasthan govt doesn't tap anyone's phone, that's not our character. If an MLA says that his phone is not tapped but mentions other MLAs who say that their phones have been tapped, then he should reveal those names and speak to the CM," the minister said.Also Read: Sachin Pilot may meet Priyanka Gandhi today, Cong says trying to resolve issuesSolanki said some MLAs have already informed Gehlot about phone tapping. "I do not know if my phone is being tapped or not. Some legislators have told me that their phones are being tapped. I am also not aware if the state government is involved in phone tapping. Many officials told them (legislators) that it seems that there are efforts underway to trap them," Solanki said.The charges of phone tapping against the Congress government in Rajasthan is not new as this was one of the points the rebel camp, led by Sachin Pilot, highlighted in July last year. The government at that time gave some audio clips to the Rajasthan Police for an investigation into whether these MLAs were hatching any plan against the government. The case was closed after the issue between the Pilot camp and Gehlot was resolved after the intervention of the Congress high command.Amid rumours of Sachin Pilot joining the BJP, which the Congress leader vehemently rubbished, Pilot is likely to meet Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi to push for the demands that have not been fulfilled in the last 10 months after the patch up of the two warring camps in Rajasthan Congress.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whose-phones-are-being-tapped-reveal-names-says-rajasthan-minister-as-sachin-pilot-loyalists-bring-back-old-allegations-101623575986605.html

Because of this, almost 21% of India's population has benefited and improved quality of life. This has been a huge transformational change at the grassroot level," Kant was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Kant said that the program has been able to make difference to lives of citizens of India, in education, health, nutrition, financial inclusion, skill development and this has made a difference to some most backward and most geographically far-flung districts of the nation."I am very satisfied that what PM had envisioned for this program. We have come a long way, we have achieved substantial difference in making a qualitative difference to lives of citizens of India," the Niti Aayog CEO said.Talking about the state of India's economy amid coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, Kant said, "I am a great believer that for this economy, we need to vaccinate fast which we are doing now, government has ordered a lot of vaccines to come in in subsequent months, so I agree with govt approach that by December we should have vaccinated entire population."An independent appraisal report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has lauded India's Aspirational Districts Programme (ADP) and said it has resulted in sectoral growth and improvements in governance and administration."A very successful model of local area development" that "should serve as a best practice for several other countries where regional disparities in development status persist for many reasons," the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-aspirational-districts-program-benefited-21-population-amitabh-kant-101623574777585.html
13-06-2021||India||Nationwide sero survey will help in building strategy on Covid vaccination, lockdown: Health expert||Health experts dealing with Covid-19 believe that a nationwide coronavirus serological survey will be beneficial as it will help in bringing out exact viral load and thus help in building up strategies.Sero surveys estimate as well as monitor infection trends in the population which is specifically location-based to understand the current course of the virus.The Centre recently announced that it would commence a nationwide sero surveillance project and has asked the States to participate for fact-based monitoring of the situation.Associate Professor, Department of Medicine, AIIMS Dr Neeraj Nischal told ANI, "Most of the COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. They may not actually seek any test or medical intervention so there can be a substantial chunk of people who have got infected but are not aware of their status. The basic role of sero surveys is to know the exact burden of infection. From this point of view, sero surveillance becomes very important because based on that one can find out which particular area has a susceptible population."According to experts, serological surveillance specific strategies of particular areas can be built up and following them can further lower the positivity rate.Dr Nischal said, "One can always decide a strategy based on this type of surveys. Through this, one can encourage people to take vaccination in the area and thus we can strengthen the vaccination strategy of that area. Also if a disease outbreak happens in any particular area one can impose a micro lockdown in that area and thus the vulnerable population can be protected."A strategy can be decided based on these surveys - it could based on vaccination or a decision regarding lockdown - which can definitely help in saving lots of lives, says doctors.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will start 4th national sero survey in June to assess Covid-19 spread.Member Health NITI Aayog Dr VK Paul on Friday said, "Preparation for national sero survey done. ICMR will begin work for the next sero survey this month. But if we want to protect our geographies we won't have to depend on national sero survey alone, we'll have to encourage states for sero surveys too."India on Saturday reported 80,834 fresh cases and 3,303 deaths, the data released by the Union Health Ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nationwide-sero-survey-will-help-in-building-strategy-on-covid-vaccination-lockdown-health-expert-101623574904280.html

Save Lakshadweep Forum, a body formed to mount protests against the “draconian” orders, has announced it will observe a “Black Day” on June 14. The protesters have also sought time to meet Praful Patel, who is also the first administrator of the joint UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu (DNHDU).Also Read: Lakshadweep residents hold hunger strike over new rulesWith Patel set to arrive in Lakshadweep, security has been tightened on the island.Also Read: Amid ‘disturbing developments’ in Lakshadweep, former bureaucrats write to PM ModiAt the heart of the ongoing protests are norms like Goonda Act, Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (LDAR) and two-child rule among others. The Goonda Act proposes to detain a person in jail for up to 12 months without any legal representation. Lakshadweep has the lowest crime rate in the country, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report in 2019. Locals, therefore, allege the new law would be misused to detain people without valid reasons, in order to create a “fear psychosis.”Also Read: Kerala assembly to pass resolution seeking withdrawal of latest reforms in LakshadweepLDAR, they say, would give the administrator sweeping powers to take over land forcefully, relocate people and propose harsh punishment to those who object to the regulation. The two-child norm, proposed under the draft Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation Act, 2021, proposes a ban on contesting elections on those with more than two children. Hence, this would take away from the islanders their right to contest an election as the birth rate is very high among the rural populace, critics argue.Another bone of contention is the proposed ban on animal slaughter without a certificate from a competent authority, as well as the removal of beef from the menu of the mid-day meal scheme for students of Lakshadweep. Since the UT has a 95% Muslim population, critics see this as an attempt by the Centre’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to impose its political and ideological views on the islanders.The orders have also faced protests from several members of the BJP’s Lakshadweep unit. Over a dozen members have quit in protest over a sedition case filed against filmmaker Aisha Sultana for allegedly calling the Lakshadweep administrator a “bio-weapon launched by the Centre.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweep-administrator-to-arrive-on-island-tomorrow-amid-row-over-regulations-101623571309732.html

Govt invites bids||The people living in the remote corners of the country may soon get Covid-19 vaccine through drones. HLL Infra Tech Services Limited, on behalf of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), on Friday invited expression of interest for delivery of medical supplies (vaccines/drugs) by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) at select locations in India.The company said that ICMR will engage UAV operators to operate beyond visual line of site (BVLOS) in fixed pre-defined or pre-approved flight paths and deliver Covid-19 vaccine. It has also given the proforma for interested parties to apply for it.HLL has given specification for the UAVs required. As per the company's note, the drone should be able to cover a minimum aerial distance of 35km at a vertical altitude of minimum of 100 metres, take off vertically and carry minimum payload of 4kg, and capable of returning to home base.HLL has made it clear that parachute-based delivery will not be preferred.The proposed agreement will be valid for 90 days, and can be extended depending on the performance of the UAV operator and need of the programme, HLL further said.This comes nearly two months after ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) and directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) granted conditional exemption to ICMR for conducting feasibility study of Covid-19 vaccine delivery using drones. The ICMR has partnered with IIT-Kanpur for the project.The Centre said that the exemption will be valid for a period of one year or until further orders.Meanwhile, e-commerce company Flipkart on Friday said that it has partnered with Telangana government for delivery of Covid-19 vaccines and other essential supplies using drones in the remote parts of the state.

It’s true that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is very hurt by its crushing defeat in the recently concluded West Bengal polls, but then, there is no need for the Central government to take this defeat by heart,” said Sena MP Sanjay Raut in his weekly column ‘Rokthok’.He said the face-off between the Bengal government and the Centre over former Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay’s resignation was like ‘women fighting over water at the common water tap.’Bandopadhyay was caught in the middle of a political firestorm after chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Bandopadhyay decided to skip a scheduled meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Kalaikunda airbase to review the damage brought about by Cyclone Yaas on May 28, upsetting the Centre.Bandopadhyay, a 1987-batch Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer of West Bengal cadre, was set to retire on May 31 but the state asked Centre for a three month extension of his tenure, which was granted but with an order to report to the department of training and personnel in New Delhi by 10am on May 31, his last working day. Bandopadhyay chose to retire and was subsequently appointed as the CM Mamata Banerjee’s chief adviser. Centre then show caused the officer for skipping the meeting with the PM and also made vigilance clearance mandatory earlier this month for states or government departments offering post-retirement jobs to bureaucrats.Raut also said that former Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta’s-- who resigned from the Upper House in March to contest the West Bengal assembly elections--renomination to Rajya Sabha after loss in Bengal assembly polls was unprecedented.“Dasgupta has been nominated by the President. This man had resigned from the Rajya Sabha to contest the assembly polls. He was defeated and within one month, he was renominated again. This has never happened in the history of the Rajya Sabha ever since it was founded in 1952,” said Raut.Raut also took potshots at the Central government saying it was spending time and money on the Central Vista Project instead of tackling the important issues facing the nation. “The Central government is focussed on constructing new residences for the Prime Minister and the vice president. They will get new houses, but what about the citizens? Citizens have slipped into poverty, while in April 2020, 130 million people lost their jobs due to Covid-19,” said Raut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-says-centre-s-tussle-with-bengal-was-a-challenge-to-federal-system-101623569195141.html

13-06-2021||India||Sachin Pilot may meet Priyanka Gandhi today, Cong says trying to resolve issues||Sachin Pilot is likely to meet Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday to press for demands that he has said have not been fulfilled even after assurances, reports said. Sachin Pilot, who left for Delhi on Friday, is in the Capital for the second time in less than a year when the young leader rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot. “It has now been 10 months. I was given to understand that there would be swift action by the committee, but now half of the term is done, and those issues haven’t been resolved. It is unfortunate that so many of the party workers who worked and gave their all for getting us the mandate are not being heard,” Sachin Pilot said. The meeting is expected in the backdrop of demands for cabinet expansion and political appointments by Pilot’s loyalists. They have been questioning the delay in addressing the issues raised by then deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot against Ashok Gehlot even as a panel set up last year. Earlier this week, Pilot told HT that the Congress high command has failed to deliver on the promises that were made to him when he along with 18 legislators returned to the party after a month-long drama.Priyanka Gandhi, who played an important role in resolving the political crisis, is working to address the dissent within the ruling Congress and to fulfil promises made to Sachin Pilot, people aware of the matter said. The former deputy chief minister is in touch with Priyanka Gandhi and she has assured him of resolving the issues and asked him to be patient, a Pilot loyalist said on condition of anonymity.Pilot is also expected to meet Rajasthan Congress in-charge Ajay Maken and general secretary KC Venugopal, the members of the panel, who are yet to submit their report.Speculations about Pilot’s departure from the party gathered steam after Jitin Prasada, a close aide of Rahul Gandhi, switched to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday. However, Pilot has time and again said he will not join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On Friday, he rejected BJP’s Rita Bahuguna Joshi’s statement that she had spoken to him about joining her party. He added Joshi does not have the courage to speak to him. “Rita Bahuguna Joshi said she spoke to Sachin. She might have spoken to Sachin Tendulkar. She does not have the courage to speak to me,” Pilot said.HT has reported the Congress’ central leadership was trying to work out a cabinet reshuffle in Rajasthan. On Saturday, Congress’ Rajasthan unit president Govind Singh Dotasra said that a cabinet reshuffle will soon take place in the state and asserted there is no problem within the party's state unit. "As told by Ajay Maken Ji (Congress in-charge for Rajasthan), a reshuffle will take place in the state," Dotasra told reporters. Pilot and his supporters left Jaipur in July last year to camp at a secret location in Haryana, threatening the stability of the Gehlot government. Pilot was removed as Pradesh Congress Committee president, and it was only when the Gandhis intervened and set up a committee under Ajay Maken that he returned to the fold.There are nine vacancies in the Rajasthan cabinet as there can be 30 ministers but there are only 21 currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-pilot-may-meet-priyanka-gandhi-today-cong-says-trying-to-resolve-issues-101623565909744.html

Six others, including three women, a 15-year-old boy, and the driver of the van suffered serious injuries, while a girl escaped unhurt, he said.In a similar incident on Thursday, four women died and 11 others were injured when the vehicle they were travelling in rammed into a roadside tree in Rajnandgaon district of the state. Police said the vehicle carried workers of a private company returning home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-5-women-killed-in-road-accident-in-gariaband-district-101623566254904.html
13-06-2021||India||Former Odisha minister Pradip Panigrahi out on bail after 7 months||Former powerful BJD leader and Gopalpur MLA Pradeep Panigrahy was released on bail on Sunday after spending little over seven months in jail in a case of cheating youths with fake promises of jobs in Tata Motors.The 56-year-old was granted bail by Orissa high court on Friday in connection with the Tata Motors job fraud case registered at Golanthara police station in Ganjam district. The court had earlier granted him bail in six similar cases registered against him.Three cases were lodged against Panigrahy at Golanthara police station, two with Baidyanathpur police station in Ganjam district and one with Odisha crime branch. Panigrahi deposited a cash security of ₹69.45 lakh for all the cases, including ₹47.45 lakh and ₹6 lakh for the cases lodged with the CID and Baidyanathpur police station respectively.Panigrahy, who recently tested positive for Covid, was lodged in jail since December 3 following his arrest by the state CID for collecting bribes from job aspirants with the false promise of employment in Tata Motors. Police said he was taking money on behalf of Akash Pathak, son of former IFS officer Abhay Pathak, who was given compulsory retirement last month due to corruption charges. Panigrahi’s daughter was scheduled to get married to Akash in December last year at a palace hotel at Udaipur.Once a blue-eyed boy of the chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, Panigrahy took care of CM’s assembly constituency Hinjili in Ganjam district for nearly a decade. He was first elected to Odisha assembly in 2009 from the seaside Gopalpur constituency, the seat he won thrice on a trot. In 2014, Patnaik made him the minister of the rural development, higher education and science and technology departments. He was dropped from the cabinet in 2017 but was still seen to be powerful. He was made BJD’s Ganjam district president in 2015 despite the district having 3 senior cabinet ministers. Ahead of the 2019 assembly elections, Panigrahy was given charge of 12 of the 15 assembly constituencies of the undivided Ganjam district.But he ran out of favour soon. Last year, he wrote several letters to the chief minister, demanding that Odisha bring back migrant workers from Gujarat during Covid-19 lockdown and also to complain that the state government was ignoring local MLAs in the fight against Covid-19.After his arrest, chief minister Naveen Patnaik expelled him from the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-odisha-minister-pradip-panigrahi-out-on-bail-after-7-months-101623561694551.html
13-06-2021||India||Digvijaya Singh's Article 370 remark sparks row, Congress points to official stand||Digvijaya Singh's comments on Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir have invited a volley of criticism by several Union ministers and leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP on Saturday leaked an audio chat of Digvijaya Singh allegedly saying that Congress "would certainly have to relook" the decision of revoking Article 370.After Digvijaya Singh's alleged remarks sparked a row, the Congress asked its leaders to follow the party's stance on the issue of abrogation of Article 370. "The Congress party has clearly stated its position on Jammu and Kashmir, in its resolution of August 6, 2019, of the Congress Working Committee (CWC). This is the only official stance of the party. I urge and request all senior leaders to refer to the same," Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said when asked about Singh's remarks.अनपढ़ लोगों की जमात को Shall और Consider में फ़र्क़ शायद समझ में नहीं आता।Khera was referring to the CWC resolution, which said it "deplores the unilateral, brazen and totally undemocratic manner in which Article 370 of the Constitution was abrogated and the State of Jammu and Kashmir was dismembered by misinterpreting the provisions of the Constitution."CWC on Article 370The Centre revoked Article 370 in August 2019, which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the region into two Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh."Every principle of Constitutional law, states’ rights, Parliamentary procedure and democratic governance was violated. The Indian National Congress pledges to stand with the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh and to fight the BJP and its divisive and diabolical agenda with every power in its hands. We urge the people of J&K to maintain peace and calm," it said.Also watch | ‘Congress & Pakistan..’: BJP slams Digvijaya for Kashmir remarkThe CWC "strongly reaffirmed the consistent and stated position" of the Congress that J&K, including the areas under the illegal occupation of Pakistan and the part ceded by it to China, are an integral part of the Republic of India. The integration of J&K with India is final and irrevocable, it said.Clubhouse chatDigvijaya Singh allegedly made these remarks speaking on the audio chatroom app Clubhouse on the issue. He was responding to a question by a Pakistani journalist who asked what the Congress party would do on Article 370 if it happens to return to power at the Centre."Democracy was not there in Kashmir when they revoked Article 370. Then Insaniyat was not there because they had put everyone behind bars. Kashmiriyat is something that is basically the fundamentals of secularism. Because in a Muslim majority state, there was a Hindu Raja and both were together," Digvijaya Singh can be heard saying in the audio clip of the Clubhouse chat released by BJP's Amit Malviya."In fact, Kashmiri Pundits were given reservations in Kashmir in government services. So, therefore, the decision of revoking Article 370 and reducing the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir is an extremely sad decision. And the Congress Party would certainly have to have a relook into this issue," he said.Digvijaya Singh responded to all the criticism in a series of tweets. "....Millions of Congress workers sympathisers and all those who are opposed to BJP Modi Shah regime would fight every inch to vote out this disastrous regime," he said in one of his tweets."Perhaps, a class of illiterate people doesn't understand the difference between 'shall' and 'consider'," Singh said in another tweet in Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digvijaya-singh-s-remark-on-article-370-sparks-row-congress-reacts-101623559912195.html
13-06-2021||India||Explained: How G7 counter to China's Belt and Road Initiative will benefit India||The seven richest economies in the world, known as G7, got in a huddle on Saturday to hammer out a plan to counter China's growing economic clout. They arrived at a consensus and offered developing nations an infrastructure plan which can rival China's multi-million-dollar Belt and Road Initiative or BRI.The infrastructure plan is being led by United States president Joe Biden. The Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative, will provide a transparent infrastructure partnership to help narrow the $40 trillion, the leaders at the G7 summit hoped.Also Read: PM Modi makes global health pitch at G7An official of the Biden administration said that until now, the West had failed to offer a positive alternative to the "lack of transparency, poor environmental and labour standards, and coercive approach" of the Chinese government that had left many countries worse off.What is China's BRI?China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) scheme, which president Xi Jinping launched in 2013, involves development and investment initiatives that would stretch from Asia to Europe and beyond.More than 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate in BRI projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure.Critics say Xi's plan to create a modern version of the ancient Silk Road trade route to link China with Asia, Europe and beyond is a vehicle for the expansion of Communist China. Beijing says such doubts betray the "imperial hangover" of many Western powers that humiliated China for centuries.What the G7 countries are offering?The B3W plan discussed by the US, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Italy calls for spending hundreds of billions of dollars in collaboration with the private sector while adhering to climate standards and labour practices.It's designed to compete with president Xi's BRI, which has been criticised for creating massive debt and exposing countries to undue influence by Beijing.However, there is no announcement about how exactly the plan would work or how much capital it would ultimately allocate.India's concernsIndia has expressed concerns about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the flagship project of BRI, as it traverses through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The massive infrastructure project connects China’s Xinjiang province with Gwadar port in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.China has been defending the CPEC, saying it is an economic project not aimed at any third country.India refused to join the Chinese initiative in the past and raised its voice against the BRI. Though India has officially not reacted to G7 countries' latest plan, it is expected to be a welcome news for New Delhi.Also Read: G7 leaders to sign Carbis Bay Declaration to prevent pandemic in 100 daysAccording to a Refinitiv database, as of mid-last year, more than 2,600 projects at a cost of $3.7 trillion were linked to the BRI, although the Chinese foreign ministry said last June that about 20% of projects had been seriously affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.As part of the G7 plan, the United States will work with the US Congress to supplement existing development financing and to "collectively catalyse hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment", the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-how-us-led-counter-to-china-s-bri-will-benefit-india-101623560229495.html

His wife Atebari Kujur and five children including four daughters aged between 2-15 years stayed in an adjacent room.“On Friday evening, his wife left food outside his room which he ate. At around midnight, he picked up a meat cleaver and started attacking his children and wife in their sleep. He first killed his 3-year-old daughter Salima Kujur with the cleaver and then attacked his three other daughters and wife, injuring them severely. He however spared his son,” said inspector of Govindpur police station, Pratap Rana.Police said Kujur’s wife somehow ran away from the house with his bleeding children and hid outside. On Saturday morning, she narrated the incident to the villagers, who locked up Suku, who had bolted the room from inside, and informed police. When police opened the room, they found Kujur bleeding heavily from a throat wound apparently received from the same cleaver.He was rushed to the district headquarters hospital and then VIMSAR Medical College and Hospital in Burla, where he succumbed to his injuries on Saturday afternoon. His three daughters aged 15, 7 and 2 years along with wife, have been discharged from the hospital.Police officers said they are still unsure why Suku attacked his own family members. “He had married Atebari a few years after his first wife died. But he never fought with his wife as per her own admission. He was not into drinking. But he may be in depression as he was out of work due to [the] lockdown. A few days ago he was asking for money from one of his friends. Now that he is dead, it would be difficult to know why he attacked his own family members,” said inspector Rana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-daily-wager-slays-3yrs-old-daughter-attacks-4-others-before-killing-self-101623559474537.html

According to the English calendar, Maharana Pratap Jayanti falls on May 9 every year. However, the Hindu calendar shows the warrior king’s birth anniversary on the Tritiya tithi of Jyeshtha’s Shukla Paksha, and hence is being celebrated on June 13 this time.Several states, including Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, celebrate Maharana Pratap Jayanti in full swing and also declare the day as a public holiday.Here are some lesser-known facts about Maharana Pratap:1. Maharana Pratap was born in a Rajput family on May 9, 1540. His father, Udai Singh II was the 12th ruler of the Mewar dynasty and the founder of Udaipur. Pratap, the eldest child in the family, had three brothers and two stepsisters.2. Maharana Pratap is known for his military resistance against the expansionism of the Mughal empire and his crucial role in the Battle of Haldighati and the Battle of Dewair. He had defeated Mughal emperor Akbar thrice - in 1577, 1578 and 1579.3. Maharana Pratap had 11 wives and 17 children. His eldest son, Maharana Amar Singh 1, became his successor and was the 14th king of the Mewar dynasty.4. Maharana Pratap died at the age of 56 on January 19, 1597, after he was injured in a hunting accident.Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tributes to Maharana Pratap on May 9 and said he brought glory to the country with his valour, boundless courage and battle skills. His sacrifice and devotion to the motherland will always be memorable, Modi added.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharana-pratap-jayanti-today-5-facts-about-the-rajput-warrior-101623551342537.html

Mitra claimed that when he tried to voice objections after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the GST Council's decision, his "voice was muzzled as the secretary brought the meeting to a close and the virtual link was cut off".Mitra wrote a letter to Sitharaman in this regard. “I write this letter with great anguish. In your remarks near the end of today’s GST Council Meeting, you referred to several of my observations by name and yet I was not given the floor, despite a repeated request to your comments. Instead, you gave the floor to the minister from UP, who sought deletion of some of my comments by name and shockingly you agreed,” Mitra's letter read.In response, Thakur said such an incident never happened and it was "unbecoming" of a senior leader like Mitra to claim that it did. "The Finance Minister has never stifled dissent in the GST Council. It is unbecoming of a senior member of the Council to suggest tht this has happened. The GST Council embodies the collective spirit of all states towards debate in a healthy manner; it has been & shall continue," Thakur posted on Twitter.Also Read | GST rates slashed on various Covid-related items: Full listThakur, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, said that in his experience as the minister of state in the last two years, he has not seen Sitharaman cut off anyone during the GST Council meeting. "She has patiently given each and every speaker as much time as they needed, even if it meant discussions went on for long hours," he said.He also said that Mitra's connectivity during the meeting was not good. "During the GST Council discussions today(June 12),it seemed as if the Finance Minister frm West Bengal did not have a stable VC connection. Revenue Secy repeatedly informed him his line was breaking, that he was not properly audible & to turn off his video fr better connectivity," he tweeted."Further, during the speech made by the Uttar Pradesh Finance Minister, nobody heard Mitra speak up nor did he ask to have his opinion heard. Other members can attest to this," he said.The minister also said that Mitra remained silent even after Sitharaman asked the GST Council whether anyone would like to speak and add their comments at the end of the meeting. "Mitra again remained silent and did not speak up. The Finance Minister has never stifled dissent in the GST Council. It is unbecoming of a senior member of the Council to suggest that this has happened. The GST Council embodies the collective spirit of all states towards debate in a healthy manner; it has been and shall continue," he said.During the Saturday meeting, it was announced that the recommendations of the Group of Ministers (GoM), set up to look into tax relief on Covid-19 medical supplies, have been accepted by the GST Council and the GST rate has been reduced from 12% earlier to 5% now on Covid-19 testing kits, medical-grade oxygen and ventilators.For ambulances, the GST rate has been reduced from 28% to 12% and for hand sanitisers from 18% to 5%. These rates will be valid till September 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-council-meeting-amit-mitra-s-video-connectivity-was-poor-says-anurag-thakur-on-his-voice-muzzled-accusation-101623542004381.html

The decomposed carcass of a male elephant was recovered near Darhora village under Pratappur forest range on Friday, said Anurag Shrivastava, chief conservator of forest (Surguja Circle). Forest officials rushed to the spot after being alerted by locals and a three-member team of veterinarians was constituted for the post-mortem, which was done on Saturday, he said. “According to veterinarians, the tusker died after he was struck by lightning while moving around in the jungle. The carcass had been lying there for seven to eight days,” the CCF said, adding that further probe is underway. When asked how forest personnel on the ground could not locate the carcass, range officer P C Mishra said an investigation was underway and further action would be taken accordingly. On March 29 this year, an elephant calf was found dead in Raigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elephant-found-dead-in-chhattisgarh-s-surguja-district-101623524192327.html
13-06-2021||India||1 in 5 fatalities old: Pandemic toll rises as states reconcile numbers||Nearly one out of every five deaths that added to the national death toll in the past 30 days was a fatality that occurred days ago and had gone unreported, according to data analysed by HT. In the past month, at least six states – Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Goa, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh – have been steadily reconciling their death data and have added a total of 20,741 fatalities not logged earlier.In Bihar, three out of every four deaths in the past month was added to the state’s tally in just one day -- on June 9. In Maharashtra, more than half the number of deaths reported in the last 30 days were old backlog statistics. In Uttarakhand, this proportion was 30%.Such statistical correction has not only pushed up the country’s death count in the past month, but also implied that the fatalities reported during the peak of the outbreak in India during April and May were under-reported.On Saturday, for instance, a total of 3,302 daily deaths were added to the country’s tally. However, only 1,676 deaths actually occurred that day.All figures are from HT’s dashboard of national Covid-19 statistics, which is updated with data released by the authorities of each state.The remaining 1,626 were old deaths due to the disease that were added by states to their respective tallies – 1,606 deaths were added by Maharashtra, nine by Punjab and 11 by Uttar Pradesh. This means that 49% of all new deaths had taken place days before.Similarly on Friday, 4,000 daily deaths were added to the country’s tally. But, on that day Maharashtra added a backlog of 2,213 deaths, Uttarakhand added 10 old fatalities and UP added four. This means that 56% were old. On Thursday, this proportion was 45% of the 3,410 reported deaths that day – 1,522 by Maharashtra, one in Goa, 14 in Uttarakhand, three in Punjab and one in UP.This reconciliation touched a peak on Wednesday, when the national death tally touched a record high of 6,141, according to HT’s dashboard. Of these, 71% were old deaths, with a majority (3,951) coming from Bihar’s reconciliation. Other major contributors were Maharashtra (400) and Uttarakhand (30).For Maharashtra and Uttarakhand, the reconciliation process has been a near-daily occurrence over the past month. The western state has updated its tally 25 days in the last month, while the hill state has done so 27 times in the same period.In absolute numbers, Maharashtra has added 15,756 old deaths to its tally in the past month – constituting 53.5% of all fatalities the state reported in this time period. Uttarakhand has reconciled 807 deaths in the same time period – constituting 30.1% of its fatalities.In Punjab, the process is a little more complicated as while reconciliation is a near-daily occurrence, the state also reduces repeat deaths fairly frequently. UP, which has been updating its case as well as death count like Punjab, has added at least 78 old deaths to its tally in the past month. Goa has only done so on four days between June 7 and June 10, adding a total of 75 deaths (7.7% of fatalities in the past month).The Union health ministry, in response to an article in an international magazine that claimed India has suffered perhaps five to seven times ‘excess deaths’ than the official number, on Saturday said that states and Union territories record Covid-19 deaths as per guidance issued by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It added what it labelled as “unsound analysis” of extrapolation of data “without any epidemiological evidence”.States and UTs have been urged through formal communications, multiple video conferences and through the deployment of Central teams for correct recording of deaths in accordance with laid down guidelines, Centre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-in-5-fatalities-old-pandemic-toll-rises-as-states-reconcile-numbers-101623523653390.html
13-06-2021||India||800 OTT, digital news platforms have shared info under new IT rules: Official||Over 800 over the top platforms, which include video streaming services such as Netflix and Hotstar, and digital news media outfits, have shared details under the new intermediary and digital media ethics rules, according to an official from the ministry of information and broadcasting.“Most of the top OTT players have done it, Netflix, Amazon, Jio,” said an official familiar with the matter. “More number of entries have been received from new media houses, this includes both big and small players.”HT reached out to Netflix and Amazon but did not receive a response immediately,The government has also issued a point-by-point clarification to concerns it received regarding the new rules to counter what it said were “misapprehensions” regarding compliance burden on publishers, excessive government control by way of emergency powers, the concerns with the new oversight mechanism by way of an inter-departmental committee and the suggestions relating to the self-regulating body and its registration by the government.The new intermediary and digital media guidelines require platforms to appoint officers, grievance redressal officers in case of OTT and digital news media platforms, institute a three-tier mechanism for grievance redressal with an inter-ministerial committee at its apex and give the I&B ministry takedown powers over the content circulated online. The rules, which were notified in February, have been challenged in the court by several digital news media outfits, including LiveLaw and TheWire.While there is no requirement for the digital news media publishers to be registered with the ministry, information pertaining to their grievance redressal officer in India, self-regulating body of which the publisher is a member and the details of the editor were sought by the ministry on May 26. Similar information has been sought from the video streaming services, with details of the content manager instead of the editor. The ministry had given the platforms two weeks to share the details.The News Broadcasters Federation, which consists of 78 news channels in 14 languages, representing broadcasters from 25 States, wrote on Twitter on Friday that they have complied with the rules.In a separate notification dated June 10, the ministry said that digital arms of traditional media houses would not be exempt from furnishing the details under the new rules.“The rationale for including digital news portals/websites of traditional media houses under the ambit of the digital media rules 2021 is well reasoned,” the ministry has said in its communication. “Making any exception of the nature proposed will be discriminatory to digital news media publishers who do not have a traditional TV/print platform.” Hindustan Times on February 28 first reported that websites of traditional media houses would be brought under the guidelines, in effect making them subject to section 69(A) of the IT Act that gives the government takedown powers.On May 27, the News Broadcasters Association wrote to I&B minister Prakash Javadekar to seek that traditional news media be exempt from the new guidelines as they are already covered under the Cable Television Act. “The IT Rules 2021, if applied to the digital media of the linear television medium, would only result in duplication of the adjudicatory and redressal mechanism resulting in the creation of parallel adjudicatory bodies. The IT Rules, 2021 prescribe administrative regulations, which will make it virtually impossible for small or medium-sized traditional news media organizations to survive,” the letter said. “Any additional mandates as contemplated under the IT Rules, 2021 would result in increasing the employee costs and compliance requirements of the traditional news media organizations along with duplication and creation of parallel processes.”With respect to the issue of the compliance burden, the government has clarified that it will take appropriate action if a representation is received from any digital news publisher citing the exact number of complaints relating to the code of ethics and the redressal of said grievances. With reference to self-regulation, the ministry has clarified it is only an “extension of existing institutional practices”. The government has also assured that the “apprehension of excessive government control is misplaced”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/800-ott-platforms-have-shared-info-under-new-it-rules-official-101623523831613.html
13-06-2021||India||Eye on expansion, JD(U) pitches for berth in Union Cabinet||Amid speculations of expansion of the Union Cabinet, the ruling Janata Dal ( United) has pitched for ministerial berths in the council of ministers with the party reasoning that it should get preference for being a key ally of the NDA government in the state. On Saturday, party’s national president R C P Singh said he was aware of chances of a possible expansion of the Union Cabinet and stressed that the JD(U) should be consulted in getting ministerial berths. “JD(U) is a partner in the NDA and the party should get preference in getting representation in cabinet expansion. Allies should get due respect in the coalition,” he said, while talking to reporters in Patna.Right now, the JD(U) has no representation in the Union Cabinet though it had an offer to join soon after Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had realigned with the BJP by breaking away from the grand alliance in July 2017. Out of 40 parliamentary seats in Bihar, JD(U) had won 16 seats while BJP had won 17 seats. LJP, another ally of the NDA, has six MPs while Congress has one MP. There are five Union ministers from Bihar, all from the BJP. The former Lok Janshakti Party patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan was also a minister in the Union Cabinet till his death last year. The party has not got any representation in the Union Cabinet. Insiders in the NDA said the JD (U) might insist on at least three cabinet berths and two berths of state minister rank with the BJP. Several contenders for ministerial berths include party’s national president, former minister and MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh and party’s Rajya Sabha MP Ramnath Thakur. However, a section of leaders in the JD(U) felt the decision of the party to join the Cabinet would depend much on whether the BJP led NDA government at the Centre chooses to give representation to the LJP or not. “If the LJP gets representation in the Union Cabinet, the JD(U) might not join the ministry. There are many factors at play, which would decide the party’s decision to join the Cabinet,” said a senior JD(U) leader, wishing not to be named. The JD(U) top leadership is said to be still peeved at the LJP for apparently playing spoilsport in the October-November assembly polls when the regional party led by Chirag Paswan had chosen to contest over 100 seats alone following disagreement on seat adjustment with NDA partners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-expansion-jd-u-pitches-for-berth-in-union-cabinet-101623523652274.html

The GST Council on Saturday slashed the tax rate on medicines such as Remdesivir and equipment like oxygen concentrators and medical grade oxygen. The tax cut is based on recommendations by GoM amid the pandemic.“In today’s GST Council meeting, the GoM submitted their report and it was discussed in the Council. GoM recommended a reduction in the rate of tax on some medicines from 5% to nil, remdesivir from 12% to 5% and oxygen generation equipment and covid testing kits from 12% to 5%. For temperature checking equipment and gas/electric furnaces for the crematorium, GoM recommended a reduction from 18% to 12%. No reduction was recommended on ambulances,” read a statement. “The minister also thanked the union finance minister and Government of India for approving GST compensation loan of ₹18109 Crore for 2021-22 and stated that this will help in the fight against Covid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karanataka-minister-bommai-hails-tax-cut-on-covid-goods-101623523531653.html

This will ruin her family and future and this is not in the right spirit of the island,” said one of the signatories of the letter, Abdul Hameed Mullipuzha, who is the general secretary of the party’s Kavaratti unit.“We can’t go ahead like this. I am resigning from the party,” said B C Cheriya Koya, president of the Andrott unit.On June 10, the Lakshadweep police registered a sedition case against filmmaker Aisha Sultana for allegedly calling the Union territory’s administrator, Praful Khoda Patel, a “bio-weapon” launched by the Centre. The FIR was registered against the filmmaker on the complaint of BJP Lakshadweep wing president C Abdul Khader Haji.Sultana, a Lakshadweep resident, allegedly made the comment during a TV discussion amid anger in the region over new rules introduced by Patel, which his opponents say threaten the livelihoods of islanders.The filmmaker later defended her statement, saying she will move the High Court against the police action. “I had used the word bio-weapons in one of the TV debates. I did not attack the country or the union government. I was referring to some of the decisions of Patel which infuriated local people. Despite popular sentiment he continues to antagonise people. As a local resident I have every right to criticise him,” she posted on her Facebook account.Many cine actors and others have extended support to her and deplored the local administration’s move. The Kerala government, too, assured Sultana of legal support.For over a month now, residents of the archipelago have been protesting against the administrator, saying his moves will affect the “unique culture and tradition” of the island.The draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation that Patel has introduced proposes to develop the islands as a major tourist destination. Residents allege it will destroy the islands’ character and identity since 97% of the islands is covered by pristine forests and 95% of its Muslim population belongs to the Scheduled Tribe category.Many parliamentarians, former bureaucrats and artists have described the draft regulations as arbitrary and aimed against the community of the islands.The Kerala assembly passed a unanimous resolution seeking the recall of the administrator. As many as 93 retired bureaucrats sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticising the “partisan attitude” of the new administrator and urged him to protect the unique culture and tradition of the islands.The BJP, however, underplayed the resignations. “Most of them have quit much early. They are raking up their resignations repeatedly to get attention. The party is intact in the island,” said national vice-president of the party A P Abdullah Kutty.Earlier, on Thursday, the CPI had assured Sultan of legal aid. “Despite local leaders protest the BJP and union Government are going ahead with their plan. It shows adamant posture of both” CPI leader P Raju said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpleaders-in-lakshadweep-resign-to-protest-sedition-case-against-filmmaker-101623523471615.html

The session focused on global recovery from the pandemic and strengthening resilience against future pandemics.He pointed to the special responsibility of democratic and transparent societies to prevent future pandemics and called for global unity, leadership and solidarity.

He said India is willing to share its experience and expertise with other developing countries.While expressing India’s commitment to collective efforts to enhance global health governance, Modi sought the support of G7 states for the proposal by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization (WTO) for a waiver of patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines and technologies.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, also a special invitee to the outreach session, and others supported the proposal for patent waivers, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.New Delhi’s emphasis on keeping open supply chains for raw materials and components to help boost vaccine production in countries such as India received widespread support, the people said.French President Emmanuel Macron, in his remarks, said countries such as India should be provided adequate raw materials and components to ensure the mass production of doses.Modi also expressed appreciation for support extended by the G7 states and other countries during the second wave of Coronavirus infections in India.Modi was invited to the Cornwall summit by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson but called off his visit because of the devastating second wave. He will virtually participate in two more outreach sessions on Sunday.Ways to fight the pandemic, a call for a fresh investigation into the origins of the Coronavirus and China’s aggressive actions around the world have dominated the discussions at the G7 Summit that has brought together the leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US in the British seaside resort.The other countries invited as special guests for the outreach sessions are Australia, South Korea and South Africa.India has engaged closely with the G7 states on issues such as health, climate and environment, digital and technology, and economic resilience.

13-06-2021||India||Maharashtra govt forms 6-member panel to probe killing of tigress Avni||Following a rap from the Bombay High Court on the forest department’s lack of accountability, the Maharashtra government has finally constituted a six-member committee to hold those accountable in the shooting of the ‘problematic’ tigress, Avni (T1), which witnessed a national outrage a couple of years ago.The tigress was shot by Asghar Ali Khan, a shooter from Hyderabad in Yavatmal district after he was engaged by the forest department to eliminate the tigress that, by then, was believed to be responsible for the death of 13 villagers.Responding to a PIL, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court had criticised the forest department for negligence in fixing accountability of officers who, prima facie, did not perform their duty properly during the shooting of the tigress.The state committee will be headed by senior IFS officer Vikas Gupta, an additional principal chief conservator of forests, while DFO Shatanik Bhagwat will be a member-secretary. Other members include Yavatmal deputy SP, director of Regional Forensic Laboratory, Nagpur, Tushar Bawne, assistant commissioner (animal husbandry), and JP Patil, law and judiciary department. It is the third committee to probe tigress Avni’s killing.Earlier, Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Avinash Gharote, who studied the inquiry reports of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and state committee, apparently found that there had been several gaps in the investigation, especially on the part of the state government during a hearing the PIL in January. The high court had also observed that there were some officers from the forest department who, prima facie, have not performed their duty, and the department made no inquiry into their negligence to fix accountability. The court had also said there was a lack of clarity in the orders issued by the chief wildlife warden and chief conservator of forest (CCF), Yavatmal, regarding the specific role, responsibility and authority delegated.The reports state that there was a lack of transparency in assigning the execution of the operation to Pandharkawda deputy conservator in Yavatmal district, which was a major reason for the operational and other errors in decision-making regarding the execution of the order to capture T1 alive or dead.During the period, the then union minister and BJP leader Maneka Gandhi also criticised the killing of Avni. However, the then Maharashtra forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar and union minister for transport Nitin Gadkari defended the killing of the tigress after dubbing it as a man-eater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-govt-forms-6-member-panel-to-probe-killing-of-tigress-avni-101623521671641.html
13-06-2021||India||House panel to discuss ‘misuse of social media’ with Twitter, IT officials||The parliamentary panel on information technology has asked officials from Twitter and the ministry of electronics and information technology to appear before it on June 18 to discuss “prevention of misuse of social media platforms”, with people familiar with the matter saying that the issue of the so-called Congress toolkit may be raised by the panel.The case pertains to a document that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) says demonstrates a conspiracy by the Congress to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, while the opposition party has said the document is fake. Twitter labelled posts linking to the document as “manipulated media” sparking off a spat with the Union government.“The issue is topical and relevant to the panel’s overall discussion,” one of these people said. “The panel members may want appropriate explanations. There will also be other wide ranging discussion as the report of the committee shapes up. If there is quorum, the meeting will be held.”Also Read | Days after banning Twitter, Nigerian govt joins KooThe schedule and agenda of the meeting has been uploaded on the Lok Sabha website. This is the first time that the panel will meet since the onset of the second Covid wave in March. The last panel meeting was held on March 16.The topic has been particularly contentious with BJP MP Nishikant Dubey hitting out panel chairperson and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor for demanding an explanation from the ministry over its decision to ask Twitter to remove the manipulated media tag from posts made by several BJP leaders.The controversy began when Twitter tagged a May 18 post by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra and other senior BJP leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe and party’s national social media in-charge Priti Gandhi, as “manipulated media”.The BJP alleged the toolkit was aimed at building a biased narrative over the Indian government’s handling of the second wave of Covid-19, and the Central Vista Project. Many top BJP leaders, including its chief JP Nadda and Union ministers Smriti Irani, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Hardeep Puri, Anurag Thakur, Piyush Goyal, amplified Patra’s tweet. The Congress subsequently reached out to Twitter to tag the tweets of the union ministers as well and even registered an FIR in the case.The action prompted the ministry of electronics and information technology to write to Twitter on May 21, asking it to remove the tag as the matter was under investigation by law enforcement agencies. This was followed by a visit and notice to the social media firm from the Delhi Police special cell, which sought information from Twitter -- although the police force was yet to register a case regarding it.The microblogging platform, in turn, raised concerns regarding “intimidation tactics by the police” and with the “core elements” of the new social media and intermediary guidelines on May 27. It also flagged concerns regarding its employees in India and the “potential threat to freedom of expression”.The dispute escalated further when Congress MP and chairperson of the panel Shashi Tharoor wrote to the ministry, asking it to explain why it asked the social media firm to drop the “manipulated media” tag.A petition has been filed in the Delhi high court against Twitter’s decision to leave the tag up, with the petitioner saying the company must adhere to directions under the new Information Technology Act rules, that compel the company to heed to government directions. The company is yet to fully comply with the rules, which has been challenged in at least 8 petitions filed in several high courts for being unconstitutional on several counts.The “manipulated media” tag set off a political spat within the panel itself.BJP MP and panel member Nishikant Dubey accused Tharoor of using the panel to further his “party’s political agenda”. “He (Tharoor) is more concerned about his party’s and Mr Rahul Gandhi’s agenda than the nation itself. Recently, on the Twitter toolkit controversy, he is asking for explanations from the Ministry of Information and Technology when Twitter’s action is against this nation’s IT law,” Dubey said. Dubey wrote to the speaker seeking Tharoor’s removal as chair of the panel.Tharoor, however, clarified that the panel communicates with the ministry in writing, given that it is unable to meet during the pandemic. “W/reference to allegations circulated publicly recently by a member of the ParliamentaryCommittee on IT relating to the #ManipulatedMedia issue, this is to clarify that, given the Cmt’s inability to meet in current circumstances, it communicates w/Ministries in writing as reqd,” he wrote on Twitter. Tharoor added that the ministry had sent the panel a detailed response on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-to-discuss-misuse-of-social-media-with-twitter-it-officials-101623521551533.html
13-06-2021||India||Choksi a fugitive from justice, CBI tells court||Mehul Choksi is a fugitive from justice, the chief conspirator and main beneficiary of the fraud perpetrated on Punjab National Bank (PNB) , and is yet to cooperate with the investigations despite repeated summons, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has said in its affidavit filed in Dominica’s high court of justice. The agency called Choksi’s “gratuitous offer” of being interviewed at the place of his choice outside India meaningless, citing the evidence, physical, oral and documentary, with which he needs to be confronted.The affidavit accuses Choksi of misleading courts in Dominica by claiming there are no proceedings against him in India. He is fully aware of proceedings in India and has even appointed lawyers in the country, says the affidavit, a copy of which has been reviewed by HT.The affidavit, filed by deputy inspector general Sharda Raut, explains the procedures of investigations and criminal trials in India. It says Choksi, according to the Criminal Procedure Code, cannot be tried in absentia. It is only after an accused is produced in court or appears in court that charges can be framed for a trial to begin, the document points out.Raut flew to Dominica on May 28 along with other officers in a special jet with documents to back Indian attempts for Choksi’s deportation from Dominica.Choksi went missing from Antigua and Barbuda, where he is a citizen (and fighting a case on not having his citizenship revoked), on May 23. He was found in Dominica the next day and has since been charged with illegal entry into the Caribbean country.Choksi’s lawyers, Vijay Aggarwal, Wayne Marsh, and his wife, Priti Choksi, have alleged he was abducted and taken to Dominica.HT on Saturday reported the two affidavits India has filed in the Dominica court detailing serious fraud charges against Choksi and proof that he continues to be an Indian citizen. That India would argue along these lines in the court was first reported by HT on May 30. Choksi’s lawyers have maintained he has given up his Indian citizenship and hence cannot be deported. India’s argument is that this was not approved by the appropriate authority as required by the rules.The Dominica court refused to grant Choksi bail on Friday saying he is a flight risk, and that he has no ties to the country. It observed the court cannot impose any conditions to ensure he will not abscond.The CBI affidavit has called Choksi the “mastermind” behind a series of shell companies used to launder money from the fraud on the state-owned bank. It says there is evidence that the businessman laundered funds using dummy companies and market operators, round-tripped in the guise of fraudulent export-import transactions with entities in places such as Dubai and Hong Kong.The affidavit says Choksi owes $950 million (close to ₹7,000 crore) to the bank, in which the Indian government has an 85% stake. It adds the CBI made attempts to arrest Choksi after the fraud was unearthed in 2018, but his whereabouts were unknown.The CBI affidavit says there is an Interpol red notice issued against Choksi, which is the highest level of notice that can be issued in respect of a fugitive.It also refers to other cases under investigation against Choksi in India. They include fraud cases registered in Bengaluru and Delhi in 2015 and 2016 as well as a 2018 cheating case.Vijay Aggarwal, Choksi’s lawyer, said the defence team is not bothered by the affidavit as the facts stated therein are not relevant considerations before the court hearing his client’s bail plea. He added they have the liberty to reapply for bail. “Every day in custody is a fresh circumstance and bail can be re-applied (for). The court has not ruled on merits but only on the ground that we need to satisfy the court about my client‘s presence in Dominica to face the trial and prove his innocence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksi-a-fugitive-from-justice-cbi-tells-court-101623521431629.html
13-06-2021||India||Kerala forms SIT to probe tree felling, smuggling||The Kerala government on Saturday constituted a special investigation team (SIT) under additional director general of police S Sreejith to investigate the alleged illegal cutting and smuggling of hundreds of precious rosewood and teakwood trees from Wayanad and other districts, according to an official order.The SIT comprises officials from the forest department and the vigilance, revenue and crime branch, an order issued by chief secretary V P Joy said.“It (the tree cutting) is suspected to be an outcome of a conspiracy by some people,” he said. The special investigation team was constituted considering the “seriousness, impact and dimensions of the offences”, the top official added.The rampant felling of trees is the first major political controversy faced by the recently re-elected Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF and the opposition plans to move the high court seeking an investigation by a central agency. The smugglers were found to be misusing a government order from last year that allowed the cutting of trees on revenue land allotted to farmers before 1964. After the Muttil (Wayanad) incident, where 101 rosewood trees were found to have been illegally felled and smuggled, similar instances have come to light in many other districts.In Thrissur, officials say they foiled an attempt late on Friday to burn stumps of felled teakwood trees so as to destroy evidence.Green activists said trees worth at least ₹500 crore were plundered using the government order and they suspect a nexus between politicians, officials and the timber mafia . Chief Minister Vijayan on Saturday said it was a serious issue and that his government would not spare the guilty. The government admitted in the high court last week that a big tree-cutting mafia was involved and that the recovery of wood worth ₹50 crore was the tip of the iceberg.In October 2020, the state revenue department issued an order allowing the felling of protected trees such as rosewood and teak grown by farmers on land alloted to them before 1964. It is believed that the modus operandi for what could well be one of India’s largest environment crimes involved members of the timber mafia misusing this order to fell trees in forests, on private land, or on land belonging to poor uneducated farmers who might not have been aware of what was being done.The activists have also claimed that principal secretary (revenue) A Jayathilak should not have issued the controversial order.Indeed, soon after the order was issued, Wayanad district collector Adeela Abdullah warned her superiors of potential misuse but nobody took it seriously. Meanwhile, Divisional Forest Officer (Flying Squad) P Dhanesh Kumar, who played a key role in unearthing the alleged smuggling, was reinstated in the probe team after public outrage over his removal. After the case came to light, he was transferred although forest minister A K Saseendran claimed on Friday that he was not aware of the abrupt transfer of the officer. Kumar has survived two attempts on his life, allegedly by the timber mafia.Kumar was instrumental in reclaiming over 7,500 acres of forest land. The Wildlife Protection Society of India honoured him in 2006 for tiger protection and he received the chief minister’s award in 2007 for busting an inter-state sandalwood gang. Two plants in the Western Ghats have been named after him, Rotala Dhaneshiana and Syzygium Dhaneshia. “I can’t talk about the case. But I will be on the forefront to save forest and wildlife,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-forms-sit-to-probe-tree-felling-smuggling-101623521191573.html
13-06-2021||India||2 more girls missing from Jharkhand shelter home amid sexual assault probe||Two girl inmates have been reported missing from a state-registered shelter home in Jharkhand’s East Singhbhum district, whose director and staff have been booked for alleged sexual assault and torture of underage girls, senior officials familiar with the matter said on Saturday. The incident came to light late Friday evening when the authorities were shifting 41 inmates from the home to Bal Kalyan Ashram in Patamda.“Thirty eight inmates have been shifted to Bal Kalyan Ashram in Patamda from the MTWT in Kharanghjar under Telco PS last evening (Friday). It came to notice that two inmates were missing. An investigation is underway in the matter,” said Parameshwar Bhagat, Jamshedpur deputy development commissioner (DDC).One of the two girls missing since last evening hailed from Birsanagar and the other one hailed from Ghatshila.Earlier, on June 5, two other girls were reported missing from the shelter home, which is run by Mother Teresa Welfare Trust (MTWT) NGO. The two tribal girls, aged 16 and 17, were later rescued by the police from Birsanagar on June 6 night, and a case was subsequently registered based on their allegations of sexual assault and torture at the home for the past four years.On June 7, a first information report (FIR) was lodged under Posco (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and sections of the Indian Penal Code against Harpal Singh Thapar, director of the home, his wife Pushpa Rani Tirkey, the chairperson of East Singhbhum district child welfare committee (CWC), warden Geeta Singh, her son Aditya Singh, and another staff member Tony Singh.According to the MTWT’s list of inmates, the shelter home has 43 children, including 23 girls and 20 boys, all of whom are under the age of 18.MTWT has no links with Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity.Meanwhile, more questions marked the investigation after BJP district spokesperson Ankit Anand posted an October 2020 interview of Tirkey, where she told a local newspaper that the home had 55 inmates.“Pushpa Rani Tirkey had said in her interview published on October 24 last year that there were 55 children kept and taken care of at the MTWT in Kharanghjar. But she said there are now 43 inmates in MTWT in her press conference before fleeing from the city in the wake of sexual abuse case. I have requested the DC to probe if this is data mismatch or where 12 inmates vanished,” he said in the tweet.Jamshedpur ASP Kumar Gaurav said: “Nothing could be said conclusively till we get the final list of inmates from the Jamshedpur district Child Welfare Committee (CWC).” Accused Aditya Singh, too, is mentioned in one of the lists of inmates, he added.In a similar case at a shelter home in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur, which came to the fore three years ago, 12 people, including main accused Brajesh Thakur, were sentenced to life imprisonment in February 2020 by a Delhi court, which heard the case following orders from the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-more-girls-missing-from-jharkhand-shelter-home-amid-sexual-assault-probe-101623521131502.html
13-06-2021||India||GST rates slashed on essential Covid items||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council on Saturday temporarily removed GST on two medicines, slashed tax rates on 15 other items such as drugs, medical grade oxygen and testing kits to 5%, and reduced the levy on ambulances to 12% for a little over three-and-a-half months to help individuals and governments fight Covid-19 and its fallout.While GST on Amphotericin B (used to combat mucor) and Tocilizumab has been slashed from 5% to zero, tax on remdesivir and anti-coagulant Heparin has been reduced from 12% to 5%. A flat GST rate of 5% has been retained on all drugs recommended by the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) and the department of pharmaceuticals (DoP) for Covid treatment.After the 44th meeting of the council, its chairperson and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the levy of 5% GST on Covid-19 vaccines will continue as 75% vaccines are available to people free of cost in government hospitals (the tax burden will borne by the central government which is paying for all these vaccines).“These rates will be valid till September as against August-end [that was] recommended by the GoM,” she said, referring to a June recommendation by a ministerial group to the effect. According to the minister, the GST Council will review the situation later and take a decision on extending the exemption period further. The GST Council is chaired by Sitharaman and finance ministers of states are its members.The 43rd meeting of the council on May 28 decided to form a group of ministers (GoM) to consider tax waivers on individual Covid-19 essentials such as vaccines, testing kits, drugs, medical oxygen, oxygen concentrators, ventilators, alcohol-based sanitizers and hand wash. A day later, Sitharaman constituted an eight-member ministerial panel under the convenership of Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma, which submitted its recommendations to the council on June 6.In order to bring down costs on oxygen, oxygen generation equipment and related medical devices, the council reduced GST on medical grade oxygen, oxygen concentrator, oxygen generator (including personal imports), ventilator, ventilator mask, canula and helmet, BiPAP machine and high flow nasal canula (HFNC) devices from 12% to 5%.The GST rates on Covid testing kits and specified inflammatory diagnostic kits, D-Dimer, IL-6, Ferritin and LDH , have also been brought down from 12% to 5%.Other Covid-related equipment have been also made cheaper. While GST on pulse oximeters (including for personal imports) has been reduced from 12% to 5%, taxes on hand sanitizer, temperature check equipment, and gas, electric and other types of furnaces for crematoria, including their installation, have been slashed from 18% to 5%. Relief has also been given on the purchase of ambulances by reducing GST on them from 28% to 12%.The immediate revenue impact of these changes is not known.MS Mani, senior director at Deloitte India, said that the shorter duration of exemptions will make it difficult for businesses to plan new investments and expand supply chains. “Businesses engaged in their manufacture and trading will hope that the period is extended beyond 30th September,” he said.Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consultancy firm EY, said that the council’s decision to bring down the GST rates on key Covid relief items would “reduce the cost of such critical Covid items for the end users”.The GoM was constituted after several states demanded a GST waiver on Covid essentials. Other members of the GoM were Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitinbhai Patel, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Goa transport minister Mauvin Godinho, Kerala finance minister KN Balagopal, Odisha finance minister Niranjan Pujari, Telangana finance minister T Harish Rao and UP finance minister Suresh Kr Khanna.On Saturday, some states demanded a complete waiver on taxes.“This is totally an anti-people decision that is being thrust on us at the GST Council. As representatives of the people, we have no way to justify these decisions of draconian nature,” said West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra, expressing his dissent in a letter to Sitharaman. He added that his voice was muzzled at the council meeting on Saturday. Union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur denied the allegation that Mitra was not allowed to speak during the council meeting, and wrote in a series of tweets that such accusations were “unbecoming” of a senior leader.Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma. however, welcomed the move. “The government had been taking all possible major and minor step towards fighting Covid from time to time... Cutting GST on Covid related items and services is a major step towards fighting the pandemic and providing people a relief in it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-rates-slashed-on-essential-covid-items-101623521071513.html
13-06-2021||India||SAD, BSP join hands to fight Punjab polls||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) announced on Saturday they will fight next year’s Punjab election together, with the leaders of the two parties calling it a “historic” move that will usher in inclusive development to the state.“Today is a historic day... A big turn in Punjab’s politics. This is not just an alliance for 2020 assembly polls but for other coming polls as well, as SAD has the history of not betraying its alliance partners,” Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said at a joint press briefing with BSP national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra.The Mayawati-led BSP is likely to contest 20 seats and the SAD the remaining 97 in the 117-member state assembly,Last year, SAD pulled out of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance due to differences over the new agricultural laws that triggered an agitation by farmers, a majority of whom are from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.BSP and Akali Dal also presented themselves as an alternative to the Congress and the BJP in the state, and said they will fight under the umbrella of shared values. The farmers’ agitation and the Dalit vote appear to be the key planks on which the two parties are likely to focus their campaign.BSP general secretary Mishra on Saturday said chief minister Amarinder Singh had “lost the trust” of his own cabinet colleagues. He was referring to the infighting between the ruling Congress government in Punjab, which is currently working to put up a united front ahead of the election next year and has set up a three-member panel to resolve the issues.Mishra added: “The SAD and the BSP are pro-farmer parties, who have worked to uplift Dalits, labourers and weaker sections (of the society).”Nearly one-third (31.94%) of Punjab’s population are Dalits, who are largely settled in Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Nawanshahr and Kapurthala districts.The Akali Dal and the BSP are coming together into an alliance after 25 years. In 1996, they fought the Lok Sabha election together, with the alliance winning 11 of 13 seats in Punjab.BSP chief Mayawati on Saturday wrote in a tweet that the tie-up was a “new political and social initiative”, which will bring progress and prosperity in the state.After Saturday’s announcement, SAD patriarch Parkash Singh Badal called Mayawati and invited the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister to visit Punjab. He also described the formation of the SAD-BSP alliance as “the beginning of a secular, federal democratic revolution in the state and the country for a total socio-economic and political revamp of polity”.BSP will contest seven seats in Malwa, five in Majha and eight in Doaba region of Punjab, Sukhbir Badal said, adding that the two parties will form a coordination committee to chalk out various programmes ahead of the polls.The Akali Dal fought the previous assembly election with its former ally BJP in 2017. The alliance won in just 18 constituencies. The BSP contested the 2017 state election on its own, but could not open its tally in Punjab.“This opportunistic tie-up is not going to save the sinking ship of Akalis. BSP leaders may have forgotten the way they were treated after their 1996 alliance which did not even last one year, but Dalits and poor people who associate themselves with the party have not forgotten it,” said PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar.Punjab BJP General Secretary, Subhash Sharma, said, “Addition of Two zeros cannot make any difference. Alliance by SAD with the BSP is a desperate attempt to get Dalit support as BJP has already said the next chief minister of the party will be a Dalit.”With inputs from PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sad-bsp-join-hands-to-fight-punjab-polls-101623521072078.html

The injured policemen were identified as sub-inspector Mukesh Kumar, who was in-charge of the team, and Special Police Officer (SPO) Danish. Both were referred to the Army hospital in Badami Bagh cantonment for advanced treatment, police said.Inspector General of Police, Kashmir Range, Vijay Kumar said Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists were behind the attack on the forces. “Two police personnel and two civilians were killed in the attack. Three policemen and one civilian were also injured. The policemen were enforcing Covid protocols,” Kumar said.Kumar visited Sopore and inspected the spot where the attack took place and held a meeting with Army’s Sector Commader, Deputy Inspector General of JKP and the CRPF. “Local LeT terrorists are involved in today’s attack and have been identified as Fayaz War and Mudasir Pandit. JKP and security forces are on the job and these terrorists will be neutralised at the earliest,” The inspector general said.Director General of Police Dilbagh Singh said that police have identified the Lashkar terrorists who carried out the attack on Saturday. “The forces have launched an operation in the area, and we are hopeful that we will soon bring to justice the perpetrators of the crime... ,” the DGP said, adding, “They (attackers) won’t be spared.”The civilians who died in the firing were identified as Manzoor Ahamd Shalla of Shalimar Colony and Bashir Ahmad Pahloo of Taliyan Sopore. The injured civilian has been identified as Tariq Ahmad Dar of Kralteng, Sopore, police said.Meanwhile, leaders of the mainstream political parties condemned the attack that left four people dead.“Terrible news coming in from Sopore. Such attacks must be condemned without reservation. Prayers for the injured & condolences to the families of the deceased,” National Conference leader Omar Abdullah tweeted.Stating these incidents defame Kashmir, Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti said be it the “gun of Delhi” or youth of Kashmir who picked the arms, it never helps to resolve things. “These types of attacks defame our Kashmir and give reasons for using more force against common people,” Mufti told reporters at neighbouring town Baramulla.Peoples Conference chairman Sajjad Lone said the attack has left a dozen or more orphans. “Five succumbed in Sopore attack. 3 civilians and 2 policemen. Mr gunmen— Approximately—5 Kashmiri funerals. 5 widows. 10 grieving old parents. A dozen or more orphans. All Kashmiris. So mr gunmen. Really want to know. Whose bloody side r u on (sic),” Lone tweeted.Soon after the attack, the security forces launched a search operation in the area to track the terrorists responsible for the attack.In March, terrorists killed two counsellors of Sopore Municipal Council and a policeman in the attack inside the council office. Later, police claimed that people responsible for that attack were identified and arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cops-civilians-among-4-killed-in-j-k-attack-101623521011509.html
13-06-2021||India||1 in 5 fatalities old: Covid toll rises as states reconcile numbers||Nearly one out of every five deaths that added to the national death toll in the past 30 days was a fatality that occurred days ago and had gone unreported, according to data analysed by HT. In the past month, at least six states – Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Goa, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh – have been steadily reconciling their death data and have added a total of 20,741 fatalities not logged earlier.In Bihar, three out of every four deaths in the past month was added to the state’s tally in just one day -- on June 9. In Maharashtra, more than half the number of deaths reported in the last 30 days were old backlog statistics. In Uttarakhand, this proportion was 30%. Such statistical correction not only pushed up the country’s death count in the past month, but also implied that the fatalities reported during the peak of the outbreak in India during April and May were under-reported. On Saturday, for instance, a total of 3,302 daily deaths were added to the country’s tally. However, only 1,675 deaths actually occurred that day. All figures are from HT’s dashboard of national Covid-19 statistics, which is updated with data released by the authorities of each state.The remaining 1,627 were old deaths due to the disease that were added by states to their respective tallies – 1,607 deaths were added by Maharashtra, nine by Punjab and 11 by Uttar Pradesh. This means that 49% of all new deaths had taken place days before.Similarly on Friday, 4,000 daily deaths were added to the country’s tally. But, on that day Maharashtra added a backlog of 2,213 deaths, Uttarakhand added 10 old fatalities and UP added four. This means that 56% were old. On Thursday, this proportion was 45% of the 3,410 reported deaths that day – 1,522 by Maharashtra, one in Goa, 14 in Uttarakhand, three in Punjab and one in UP. This reconciliation touched a peak on Wednesday, when the national death tally touched a record high of 6,141, according to HT’s dashboard. Of these, 71% were old deaths, with a majority (3,951) coming from Bihar’s reconciliation. Other major contributors were Maharashtra (400) and Uttarakhand (30). For Maharashtra and Uttarakhand, the reconciliation process has been a near-daily occurrence over the past month. The western state has updated its tally 25 days in the last month, while the hill state has done so 27 times in the same period. In absolute numbers, Maharashtra has added 15,756 old deaths to its tally in the past month – constituting 53.5% of all fatalities the state reported in this time period. Uttarakhand has reconciled 807 deaths in the same time period – constituting 30.1% of its fatalities. In Punjab, the process is a little more complicated as while reconciliation is a near-daily occurrence, the state also reduces repeat deaths fairly frequently. UP, which has been updating its case as well as death count like Punjab, has added at least 78 old deaths to its tally in the past month. Goa has only done so on four days between June 7 and June 10, adding a total of 75 deaths (7.7% of fatalities in the past month). The Union health ministry, in response to an article in an international magazine that claimed India has suffered perhaps five to seven times ‘excess deaths’ than the official number, on Saturday said that states and Union territories record Covid-19 deaths as per guidance issued by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

It will also rectify the errors that the city’s horticulture departments have made over the years.Krishen said that initially only 13 tree species were chosen to line the avenues of Lutyens’ Delhi; the number was subsequently increased to 16.“The criteria were that the shape and the size of the trees chosen for that particular avenue should be just right in order to frame the feature they were facing. Three things were kept in mind: they had to be the right size, they had to be evergreen and they should not be common. That was the reason why species that the Mughals preferred, such as mango, or shisham did not find space in the avenue scheme,” Krishen explained.Lutyens’s plan accounted for around 450 trees in all, of which at least 385 were rai-jamun trees. Today, however, there are at least 3,200 large trees (4,000 if the smaller ones and shrubs are included). Around 1,080 are rai-jamun trees, a spokesperson for HCP Design Planning and Management Private Limited (HCP), the firm in charge of the project design said. Of these, 21 are being transplanted to make space for amenities like toilets for the public, the spokesperson added.To be sure, trees of this size can’t usually be successfully replanted.Historians said that Lutyens initially designed this part of Delhi with all streets crossing at right angles. However, this was later tweaked, taking into account the dusty Delhi weather. Thus, the trees, hedges, even roundabouts were carefully designed as barriers to seasonal dust storms.Also Read | Centre busts myths around Central Vista, says 'claims mischievously exaggerated'Krishen said that as an advisor to the Central Vista project, he has tried to retain the original patterns of Lutyens’s design as much as possible. He said that the new design might also rectify the plantation done by the Central Public Works Department and the New Delhi Municipal Council over the years.For instance, there was an original grid plan for the plantation of jamun trees. The design, which was called the “diamond grid”, only involved around 385 jamun trees, all planted in a diamond-like pattern.“If you look at aerial images, the pattern is very interesting. It’s like small Xs drawn all over and at each end of the X a jamun tree was planted, and the rest of the space was left empty. But the CPWD in their course of plantation completely lost track of this pattern, mainly because they did not understand the original design,” Krishen said.The spaces left empty by the original gardeners to create that pattern, was filled in by planting new jamun trees.But no one wanted to go back to that plan entirely or immediately because “that would mean getting rid of a huge number of jamun trees and nobody wanted that,” he added.Krishen said that it was finally decided to have a “long-term replacement strategy”.“We decided to adopt a scheme with a validity of at least 30 years, which means that in the future when a tree dies, it will not be replaced by a jamun tree so that a khali (empty space) remains khali and a bhara (occupied space) remains bhara, or will be replaced by a tree of another species,” Krishen said.Project documents shows that 26 old jamun trees will be affected during constructions. These nearly 100-year-old trees, planted around 1921, are to be transplanted and not felled, but experts fear that they might not survive the transplantation.Based on documents and aerial photographs dating back to the 1920s,HCP was able to recreate Lutyens’ tree plan along the avenue: a serrated grid of trees, comprising primarily of rai-jamun trees that flanked either side of the Central Vista Avenue and pines, maulsari and bistendu trees that were to cluster around what is now Vijay Chowk. The trees along the avenue criss-crossed over the waterways providing ample sitting space under the shade.HCP’s proposal, based on advice from horticultural experts Kishen (based in Delhi) and Dr Prabhakar Rao (based in Bengaluru), aims to create a “tree plan” that will be realized over the next two to three decades as these trees reach their natural end.“The draft plan for the plantation at Central Vista Avenue is likely to be a more populated criss-cross grid, similar to Lutyens’ pattern, which aims to preserve as many of these trees as possible without needing to transplant them,” the HCP spokesperson added.“ Many of the jamun trees are already at the end of their life cycles and are likely to die over the next two decades. So when they die, what should come up in that space? Should it be left alone? We’re trying to come up with a planting plan based on Lutyens’ cross pattern,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-central-vista-plantation-to-be-as-close-to-the-original-lutyens-designs-101623519391373.html
