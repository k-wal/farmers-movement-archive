As per civic officials, she was asymptomatic and recovered completely. Delta Plus, which is a mutation of the highly transmissible Delta variant of Sars-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2) and detected in the state during the second wave, is currently considered a “variant of interest” and is not yet a “variant of concern”.In April, when the pandemic curve was at its peak, public health officers noticed the transmission rate in some families was high thereby indicating a mutation of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Taking this into consideration, the local health officers started sending blood samples for genome sequencing from hotspots and families with high infection rate.Genome sequencing is an exercise to study the changes in the structure of the virus over time. A combination of changes in the ribonucleic acid of the virus can give birth to a new variant.The septuagenarian was among hundreds whose blood samples were collected as her family recorded a high infection rate. “As per the report submitted to us, all her family members had Covid-19. So, randomly blood samples including hers were collected for genome sequencing. She was asymptomatic and didn’t even have any complications,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer. She has recovered completely without any post-Covid health complications, as per civic officials. On Monday, state health minister Rajesh Tope confirmed they had found 21 Delta Plus Covid-19 variant cases in Mumbai, Thane, Ratnagiri, Jalgaon, Palghar and Sindhudurg in the state. The file that has been sent to BMC doesn’t mention Delta Plus variant, but ‘variant of concern’ in the subject line. “So, officially on record, we are not being told that it is a Delta Plus variant. Also, out of the two mentioned cases in Mumbai, one of them is from Thane,” said a senior health officer from BMC.In view of the rise in infections across the state in March-April, the state government in April had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) to undertake genome sequencing of 4,000 positive swab samples.“It is a regular exercise for all districts to send samples for genome sequencing from hotspots, containment zones, families with high infection rate and international travellers,” said Dr Archana Patil, Maharashtra director of health service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-78-year-old-woman-is-city-s-first-delta-plus-patient-101624386585800.html

This announcement was made in a meeting held in Mumbai with officials and representatives from Marathi theatre groups.Pawar said that Marathi theatre has always been part of the culture of Maharashtra and it is necessary to lend a helping hand in this time of Covid.He also said that the state government has always strived to help solve the problems of the Marathi theatre and has given concessional rates for the government- owned theatres and rehearsal spaces. The government will now take into consideration demands for concessions on tolls for buses carrying equipment and parking spaces.Theatre companies and producers welcomed this move. “It is an important decision and it was needed to help theatre. It is also very encouraging for theatre, which unlike web or TV, needs a ‘live’ audience. The momentum has been punctured with this lockdown,” said Alok Rajwade, actor and director, Natak Company.Pradeep Vaidya, a veteran producer of many successful plays, feels that the government should not give out grants to producers. “Instead they should be allotted experimental theatre companies to reduce the chances of losses. Small theatres should be set up, so that a play can survive. Grants in the form of money should be given only for children’s plays and musicals,” said Vaidya. Girish Pardesi, actor/ director said, “It is a welcome move from the deputy CM, and very assuring for it will give us confidence and assurance that the state has not forgotten theatre. This action will help many people who work backstage, drama competition holders and experimental productions to revive plays with confidence.”Financial aid is always the need for experimental theatre and for full-time theatre performers feels Niranjan Pednekar, producer/writer, Rang Dhristi. “There are experimental platforms like Sudarshan Rang Manch, The Box, Lalit Kala who are solely dependent upon the audience to help them break even. With such aid from the government, it will help keep such spaces open for plays.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/marathi-theatre-groups-welcome-govt-aid-announced-by-dy-cm-pawar-101624386580717.html

22-06-2021||Lucknow||BJP holds unity meetings to stitch up loose ends||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday put up massive unity show, scripted by general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, who is on his second back-to-back visit to the state capital. After a surprise luncheon meet, largely interpreted as a patch-up bid, for which chief minister Yogi Adityanath drove to his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya’s residence and that took place in the presence of key RSS leaders, including Dattatreya Hosbale and Krishna Gopal, the BJP leadership supervised another visible unity effort. Shortly, the scene shifted to the BJP office where the party held an even bigger show, inviting all the former state BJP chiefs for a crucial meeting that featured the chief minister, his ministers and top-level BJP functionaries. Described by UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev as meeting of ‘satta aur sangathan’ (government and organisation), the meeting featured sidelined leaders like former BJP chiefs Vinay Katiyar, an OBC and a product of the temple movement, and Laxmikant Bajpai, a Brahmin. Also seen was the newly inducted former Congress leader Jitin Prasada amid indications that the BJP would organise more high profile joining of key leaders of other parties in the run-up to the elections. BJP stalwarts, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, are expected to visit UP regularly from July onwards. Since Monday, BL Santhosh, seen as an emissary of top BJP leadership, has been holding series of meetings, including ones with RSS leaders, chief minister, ministers and party functionaries. He had also tweeted in praise of Adityanath on Monday, his third tweet praising the CM. “We will win an even bigger majority than in 2017 UP polls,” said Laxmikant Bajpai while denying that there were any misgivings between him and the party. Party leaders said ahead of assembly polls, the BJP, having fared behind Samajwadi Party in the first round of panchayat polls, is now looking to even the score by winning maximum number of zila panchayat chairpersons’ posts in the July 3 elections. Ever since he visited UP and held feedback sessions between May 31 to June 2, BL Santhosh has been working on party’s unity plan ahead of crucial assembly elections. Also, among those who arrived for the unity meeting was the newly appointed BJP vice president AK Sharma, a former IAS officer who worked with PM Modi, took voluntary retirement, was moved to UP where he was made an MLC. Sharma flashed the victory sign on his arrival but didn’t say anything. On Monday he had sent a missive to UP party chief Swatantradev Singh saying Modi’s name and patronage was sufficient to win polls and that people of UP loved him as much as they did in 2013-14. He had also added that the party would contest the 2022 UP polls with Adityanath as chief minister, an important statement given the fact that several of Yogi’s ministers had been making confusing, conflicting statements on who would be BJP’s face during the 2022 assembly polls. When asked about the party’s face in 2022 polls, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had said that the decision would be taken by the party’s central leadership, a point that was also reiterated by state’s labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya. “It’s an exercise to stitch up loose ends ahead of elections,” said Irshad Ilmi, a veteran journalist and political observer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bjp-holds-unity-meetings-to-stitch-up-loose-ends-101624386220874.html

The robbers remained in the house for nearly one and a half hours and ransacked the entire room in which the woman slept. Their activities were captured in a CCTV camera installed inside the house. The businessman and his 22-year-old son were sleeping in their respective rooms with the air-conditioners (ACs) on when the dacoity was being committed at their house. They could not hear anything and remained in their sleep when the robbers fled with the cash and jewellery, the police said.“The robbers also took away the woman’s iPhone so that she could not call the police or anyone about it. While leaving the house, they threatened to kill her family members if she raised an alarm. The woman was so scared that she did not wake up her father or brother, fearing that the robbers were inside and they may harm them. She in fact alerted her friend through a messaging application on her laptop,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.The woman’s friend informed the police about the crime. The woman’s family members learnt about the crime when the police reached their home. The dacoity took place between 2.30 am and 4 am, the police said.“We have registered a case and are trying to identify and nab the robbers. Prime facie, it appears that someone known to the family had tipped off the robbers about the cash and jewellery. It is because the robbers specifically asked the woman about the jewellery her family members had purchased for her wedding,” the officer added. Police said that the businessman, Ramesh Bansal, deals in steel utensils and has a factory in Wazirpur. He lives with his daughter, Arushi, and son, Chetan, at their ground floor flat in BN block in Shalimarg Bagh. His other family members live on the upper two floors of the building. Arushi is pursuing her physiotherapy course from a private institute, the police said.Initial investigation into the case revealed that since security guards were present at the entry and exit gates of the residential society, the suspects cut the iron fencing of a park close to the businessman’s house and entered the building premises by scaling the boundary wall. They twisted the lock of a slider door and entered his ground floor flat.“The robbers went straight to the woman’s room and overpowered her. They threatened to kill her if she screamed. The robbers asked her to tell them where the jewellery purchased for her wedding were kept. They broke open the almirah, took out cash and the jewellery and fled,” said the officer, adding that the suspects appeared to be in the age group of 30 and 35.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/robbers-break-into-businessman-s-house-in-shalimar-bagh-decamp-with-cash-and-jewellery-worth-rs-20-lakh-101624385440006.html

They also razed 10 under-construction shops on the land.During the demolition drive, the developer resisted the action being taken by the enforcement team, but 150 officers of the Gurugram police, who were present at the sites, ensured that no obstruction was caused, said the DTCP officials.RS Bhath, district town planner, said that the two colonies were being constructed on agricultural land without any permission, or license acquired by the developer. “The enforcement team used two earth-moving machines to demolish the structures. We had repeatedly asked the people to refrain from buying plots in these illegal colonies, as these are liable for demolition,” said Bhath.Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner (enforcement), said that they are conducting a survey on the outskirts of the city, particularly in rural areas, to ensure no illegal colonies are built. “During the lockdown, some people tried to take advantage and carve out such colonies, but we are taking strict action against the violators,” Sharma said.In Gurugram, illegal structures on around 700 acres of land have been demolished in the past two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-demolishes-2-illegal-colonies-in-pataudi-101624385325302.html

The positivity rate in June, so far, is at 0.7%, after cases peaked in April and May as the second wave hit Gurugram hard. On Tuesday, 14 new infections were confirmed, while 27 recovered from the illness. Currently, 187 cases are active in the district. Health officials attributed the decline in the cases to lockdown alone, but experts said that multiple factors could be behind the decline in cases. “The decline in cases started in the last week of May that led to a slight plunge in the positivity rate. From 21.2% in April, it declined to 19.17% in May and further to 0.7% in June. It was the impact of the lockdown, which continues to show its effect,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer for Covid-19. On June 19, the district reported five new cases, the lowest number of cases in a day over the past year. Till Monday, 647 cases were confirmed in June, with 90,078 tests administered. The case positivity rate peaked to 23.9% last June despite recording only 4,573 new cases as the number of tests done was comparatively lower, 19,072, than those done in subsequent months. The number of tests increased by almost four times in July 2020, with significant increase in subsequent months.According to the health department data, in January, 1,416 cases were confirmed out of 80, 330 samples tested during the month. The positivity rate was 1.7%. In February, it declined to 1% as only 786 cases were confirmed from 78, 554 samples. The surge started in March with a sudden escalation in new cases. As many as 4,020 cases were confirmed from 114, 572 tests in March and the positivity rate increased to 3.5%. The second Covid-19 wave reached its peak in April, with almost a 93% increase in the new cases. Over 59, 921 cases were reported, the highest case count in a month since the outbreak of the pandemic. Over 282,364 tests were administered for mass surveillance in large outbreak areas and the positivity rate reached 21.2%.Across the state, Gurugram reported the maximum number of cases in a day, with the number peaking on April 29, with 5,042 new cases reported. The surge in Covid-19 cases continued in May with 57,012 new infections being confirmed from 297,299 tests. “From 5,000 to only five cases in almost a month has been possible due to lockdown. The downfall is likely to continue but it is difficult to make a prediction. Going by the trend of the last two Covid-19 waves, it is likely that a third wave can strike after one-and-a-half to two months. But as vaccination has been ongoing and testing numbers are high, the upcoming trend in Covid-19 infection cannot be confirmed,” said Prakash. Senior epidemiologist Dr Rajesh Kumar, the former head of community medicine department and school of public health, PGIMER-Chandigarh, said, “There are two factors for the ongoing decline. First, every epidemic has a cycle where cases begin to decline on their own. Second, when cases increase, there is a behavioural change in the people along with the restrictions imposed by the government. These two factors work in unison, therefore, it will be incorrect to say that only lockdown led to the sharp decline.” Explaining that predictions for the next wave will depend upon the variations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Kumar, said, “Variants of the coronavirus will define the next wave as the virus has been mutating. It will be responsible for the further transmission of infection in the future, which cannot be predicted currently. It is crucial that people are vaccinated at the earliest to control the next surge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-positivity-rate-in-gurugram-at-lowest-this-month-since-start-of-pandemic-101624385323579.html

Despite extending the deadline for payment several times, according to the DTCP officials, the developers did not pay the dues. Due to this, many external developmental works in and around the licensed colonies have been put on hold, they said.As per the directions issued by the DTCP director, Makrand Pandurang, the task force — formed in the second week of June — will comprise Haryana chief town planner, IT and Monitoring chief town planner, chief accounts officer (headquarters), senior town planners and district town planners concerned.“Above ₹8,000 crore interest is pending on account of the EDC, that the developers from across Haryana got to pay. No doubt, there is a slowdown, but the department had extended the deadline several times, and also gave rebates against interest payment to the developers. Earlier, we had cancelled licences of some of the developers, but that also did not work out. This task force will look into different aspects, and find out a solution to recover the dues,” said Pandurang.“We can also take 10% money the colonisers deposited into the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HRERA). The state government gave a nod on this,” he said.As per the details shared by the DTCP, around ₹4,000 crore EDC charges to be paid by the developers in Gurugram is also pending, apart from the interest. The issue of EDC collection assumes significance, as in a recent meeting, the Haryana government had asserted that EDC collected from the district should be given to the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) to carry out developmental works.According to the DTCP officials in Gurugram, licences of many developers had been cancelled in the past two years for the non-payment of EDC, but due to the creation of third-party rights, they face a lot of issues in closing these projects. “This task force can take a holistic view, and since senior officials from Chandigarh are involved, decisions could be taken quickly,” a DTCP official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/task-force-to-recover-pending-charges-from-developers-101624385324103.html
22-06-2021||Gurugram||State govt starts probing irregularities in MCG||The Haryana government has initiated an audit of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) after it received several complaints of widespread corruption and negligence in the workings of the civic body, officials familiar with the developments said on Tuesday.A team sent by the principal accountant general of Haryana, Vishal Bansal, visited the city for the purpose and directed MCG’s engineering wing to submit details of tendering processes, the number of projects, type of projects, original projected cost, final cost and the status of all projects executed by the civic body since 2016.“All support is being lent by the MCG to the state audit team. Directions have been issued to the respective departments for expediting the same,” a senior MCG official, requesting anonymity, said.Besides the engineering wing, the state audit team also sought all records of the MCG’s account branch for the past five years.Over the past two years, the state’s home minister and urban local bodies (ULB) minister, Anil Vij, said on multiple occasions that a special audit of the MCG will be carried out as he had received several complaints about the civic body’s functioning.Most recently, Vij reiterated that an audit would be done during a councillors’ meeting in February. Despite calls and texts, he could not be reached for comment.A second senior MCG official, requesting anonymity, said, “Files from both, the accounts branch and the engineering wing, are in the process of being submitted to the state audit team for perusal. The files are being sent as per the fiscal year. The entire process will take around two to three months to complete as all records will be scrutinised for spotting errors and other discrepancies. Subsequently, the department or individual concerned would be asked to explain the irregularities. If his or her answer is found to be unsatisfactory, a departmental inquiry will be initiated.”Over the last 18 months, various discrepancies in the functioning of the MCG were brought to public attention.In November last year, an executive engineer of the MCG was suspended for allegedly paying the entire project cost of ₹47.50 lakh to a contractor for fixing potholes and re-carpeting roads in Ward 34, even though work had not started on-ground. As per the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, a contractor can only be paid the final amount after a project has been completed or the running costs for it.In September last year, a contractor was found to have been paid ₹50 lakh, for a ₹2 crore project, even though only 10% of the work of laying pavement tiles in Ward 25 was completed.In February 2020, a local politician alerted the MCG that a contractor was paid ₹1.67 crore, the total project cost for constructing a two-kilometre road in Ward 1, even though construction was yet to commence.In December 2019, a local councillor alerted the MCG that a contractor was paid ₹35 lakh for constructing a 1.7-kilometre pathway between Khushbook Chowk and Bristol Chowk along Gurgaon-Faridabad Road, despite work being completed on only 600 metres, and the cost for the same amounting to around ₹11 lakh. The contractor was subsequently blacklisted by the MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/state-govt-starts-probing-irregularities-in-mcg-101624385322409.html

Officials of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the construction agency, said the restoration and strengthening work would be completed within three months. The Imambada’s restoration is an outcome of the efforts of a city-based heritage activist to save the monument. “The majestic Imambada was lying in a of neglect. Despite being a protected and a well-known structure, the Imambada had fallen victim to the apathy of the officials concerned. Then I approached the ASI, the Imambada’s custodian Hussainabad and Allied Trust (HAT) and district administration, demanding immediate intervention,” said Mohammed Haider, a heritage activist and a lawyer. His letters and correspondence managed to attract the attention of the authorities, including the ASI, which eventually started the restoration work. ASI officials engaged in the restoration work said that the walls of the Nawabi era structure perhaps got badly damaged following prolonged water seepage. This led to de-plastering, which further affected the artistic designs on the walls. They said they would first check the water seepage and then start restoration. Kinshuk Srivastava, additional city magistrate (ACM) II, who called a meeting with ASI officials to discuss the state of the heritage structure, said as per the ASI officials it would take three months to complete the maintenance and repair of the heritage structure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/restoration-of-shahnajaf-finally-imambada-begins-101624385320688.html

Health officials attributed the achievement to the six near-to-home vaccination centres in the district which have come up under the cluster vaccination project. According to the Co-WIN portal figures at 8.30pm on Tuesday, the highest number of Covid vaccinations on the day was achieved by Gorakhpur (28,155), followed by Ghaziabad (26,797) and Gautam Budh Nagar (24,360) districts. On Monday, the Ghaziabad district had recorded its single-day highest vaccination of 28,001 beneficiaries while the cluster vaccination centres contributed with 10,053 doses, the officials said. At the cluster vaccination centres, the beneficiaries can opt for on-spot registration and get the jabs.“The vaccination on Tuesday was lesser than what we achieved on Monday, but we could have surpassed it. There were some centres, for instance at Sadik Nagar, where vaccine stock got exhausted. So, some minor issues hampered vaccination, but we managed to inoculate more than 25,000 people for the second consecutive day,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. The centres under the cluster vaccination drive, which started on Monday, are operational at Maharajpur (945 doses), Sadik Nagar (2,459), Vasundhara (1,143), Adarsh Nagar (1,515), Kailash Mansarovar Bhawan in Indirapuram (4,693) and Bhojpur (1,986) in Modinagar. Together, they administered 12,733 doses on Tuesday. According to the Co-WIN figures, the district till Tuesday administered 887,468 doses while Uttar Pradesh has administered 271,650,48 doses. Under the cluster vaccination, UP on June 21 administered 729,197 doses while it administered 763,097 on Tuesday. According to the officials, the cluster vaccination drive involving near-to-home vaccination centres will try to administer one million doses of Covid-19 vaccine to beneficiaries from July 1. The target has been assigned by the chief minister. As per the Co-WIN portal, Lucknow leads the vaccination tally with about 1.27 million doses administered till Tuesday, followed by GB Nagar with about 1.04 million doses and Ghaziabad on third spot with 887,468 doses. “The near-to-home scheme will provide encouraging results in coming days as vaccination centres will be near to residential localities and approachable to local population. However, more awareness about vaccination should be spread. The officials should also ensure that proper stock of vaccine be procured at the centres,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-achieves-more-than-25-000-vaccinations-for-second-day-second-highest-in-up-101624385259979.html

About 20 to 25 former legislators, out of more than 150 invited, turned up at the meeting that Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu convened at the UPCC headquarters here to seek their suggestions for making the party organisation ready for the polls. A picture that Lallu posted on social media also showed about 20 people in the audience and four to five on the dais when Lallu delivered his address there. “This picture must have been taken at the beginning. We understand 40 to 45 former legislators attended the meeting. We did not invite many, only a select few of former legislators,” said a former MLA while defending the poor turnout at the UPCC headquarters. Others who attended the meeting said this was a reflection on the poor infrastructure that the party had at the grassroots level ahead of polls. “We don’t see the Congress at grassroots level anywhere in the state. We have no organisational infrastructure in many constituencies. As the BJP may face strong anti-incumbency in the 2022 polls, the people have begun talking about the Samajwadi Party as an alternative. The Congress does not figure because of poor organisational infrastructure and should find the reasons for this,” said a senior leader. Others who turned up at the meeting said Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra should be more active in the state and begin her tours now. There were also demands for projecting Priyanka as the chief minister’s face of the Congress in the forthcoming polls. A suggestion to consider options for alliance was made but many leaders opposed this, saying the Congress would suffer badly if a decision for any alliance was taken. A demand to inform the party’s would be candidates well in time was also made as the party’s list of candidates was often declared at the last minute. When contacted, some of the former MLAs said they were busy in their assembly constituencies and so they could not make it to the meeting at the UPCC headquarters on Tuesday. “Lallu appears to have failed in finding acceptability among all the sections of party men. Many former MLAs have stayed away from most of the meetings Lallu has convened so far. UPCC needs a leader who can lead the organisation in the polls,” said another Congress leader. Will the Congress go for a change in leadership ahead of polls? “The Congress leadership has to take a call on the issue. Lallu is seen leading the agitations. But he leads only a handful of party men. A question mark hangs on his fate in view of poor organizational infrastructure,” said another leader. About taking all the sections of the party along, a UPCC functionary said efforts had been made to bring back old timers, including those who left or were expelled for some reason or the other. “If our leaders have any complaints with us, we are ready to speak to them,” said a party functionary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thin-attendance-of-former-legislators-at-upcc-meeting-101624385139994.html
22-06-2021||Delhi||Work on Golden Temple replica at south Delhi park stopped after Sikh leaders object to it||A day after members of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), led by committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa, dismantled a replica of the Golden Temple that was coming up at the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC)’s Bharat Darshan Park in Punjabi Bagh, mayor Mukesh Suryan on Tuesday said the project has been “put on hold for now”. Sirsa said the sentiments of his community were hurt as replicas of the holy site (Golden Temple) are not allowed in the Sikh faith.On Monday, he tweeted pictures of the replica followed by a video that captured the dome of the structure being lifted using a crane. “We have succeeded in getting the replica of Sri Darbar Sahib dismantled from Punjabi Bagh park. This replica was against Sikh maryada (customs) because Darbar Sahib is not a tourist place which can be replicated,” he wrote. Suryan, however, said consultations will be held with members of the Sikh community to allay their concerns, and added that the goal of the replica was to “familiarise people with the country’s culture”.“The work on the replica has been put on hold for now. We will discuss the matter with prominent leaders of the Sikh community and proceed accordingly. We do not seek to hurt the sentiments of any community,” he said. The mayor said since the park’s theme was Bharat Darshan, prominent elements of other religions, too, are being set up at the park. “Besides symbols of the Sikh faith, we have symbols from other religions as well. No one else has raised any objections,” Suryan said. Spread over 8.5 acres, the Bharat Darshan Park is being developed with replicas of popular monuments from across the country, including the Mysore Palace, Hyderabad’s Charminar and the Khajuraho temples of Madhya Pradesh. The replicas are being built from scrap material, SDMC officials said. Sirsa, meanwhile, said that matter was closed. “The replica has been demolished and removed from the site. I’m shocked and surprised by comments from municipal officials that the project is on hold. Elected authorities of the community have raised objections to the replica and officials are still insisting that they will talk to the community,” said Sirsa. “It will be disrespectful to have a replica of any place of worship there (in the park). People would click selfies, step on them... the sanctity of the place would not be maintained in such circumstances. People attach importance to places of worship. Our faith does not allow recreation or replicas,” he said. Kailash Sankla, councillor from Punjabi Bagh, said the issue was being politicised ahead of the upcoming Gurdwara governing body elections. “DGCMC elections are round the corner and this has been made into a political issue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/work-on-golden-temple-replica-at-south-delhi-park-stopped-after-sikh-leaders-object-to-it-101624385081242.html
22-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt, MCDs to join hands for smooth transition of students to Class 6||The Delhi government’s Directorate of Education (DoE) and the Municipal Corporations of Delhi (MCDs) on Tuesday joined hands to track each student who transitioned from corporation schools to government ones in Class 6 this year. The move comes after government schools faced several challenges in tracking such students last year as their admissions were done virtually due to the closure of schools in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Every year, around 170,000 students move from municipal schools that offer education only up to Class 5 to government schools in Class 6. Owing to the pandemic, the induction of such students is happening online this year as well, on the basis of names sent by municipal schools. As per the official data, only 76% of the students who transferred from municipal schools last year could be traced.On June 8, Hindustan Times reported that the Delhi government was planning to collaborate with the three civic bodies to track and trace Class 6 students who were transferred to DoE-run schools.Education minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday chaired a meeting with the municipal commissioners of North, South, and East Delhi corporations on the matter. During the meeting, Sisodia asked the three corporations to provide the correct contact details of transferred students. “Last year, at the beginning of the session, only about 30-35% of students’ phone numbers were correct. So, a large number of students could not get the worksheets or participate in the semi-online classes. Government school teachers made special efforts to ascertain the whereabouts of these children and, eventually, 76% of students enrolled in Class 6 could be reached,” the government said in a statement.“We should ensure that students transitioning from MCD to DoE schools get the same emotional and learning support that students of other classes enjoy. Joint efforts between MCD and DoE school teachers will help tremendously in getting the correct contact details of students,” Sisodia said.Initially, government schools will try to contact students and in case their phone numbers are found to be incorrect, the municipal teachers will try to find out the correct details with the help of their other students. “Apart from contact details, the MCD teachers may also share details about each student’s special circumstances, if any, including but not limited to the death of a parent/parents, emotional support requirements, medical history etc, so that the DoE schools are better prepared to support these students,” the government statement said. Both the DoE and MCD run schools will also conduct a combined parent teacher meeting (PTM) for Class 6 this July. MCD officials said they have also been asked to provide details of students who have not been attending online classes or visiting schools to collect worksheets. “Due to the no-detention policy (no student can be declared failed up to class 8), we have to transfer all Class 5 students to Class 6. There are many students who are not in touch with their feeder schools and we have to provide details of such students to the DoE schools.Together, we will make efforts to trace them,” said a senior official of the east civic body’s education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-mcds-to-join-hands-for-smooth-transition-of-students-to-class-6-101624385080018.html

With just a week left in the closure of sand mining, contractors had expedited work in major rivers across the state and large quantity of sand had been dumped at various sites in Bundelkhand and east UP, said a mining department officer. In a letter to the district magistrates, secretary, geology and mining, Roshan Jacob said the permission to store sand at the dump sites was given to ensure that adequate sand was available to the people as well as construction agencies during monsoon. There was no shortage of sand and ‘maurang’ during rainy season and they were available at reasonable rates. Sand mining would remain prohibited from July 1 to September 30, she said. The sand and ‘maurang’ would be stored at the spots approved by the district administration. The name of the contractors and the rate of the mineral would be displayed on a board along with geo-tagging of the spot. This would be connected with Mine Mitra portal so that the officers in the directorate office in Lucknow could monitor the activities at the sand stores. The DMs would maintain vigil on the supply of sand at various spots in the district, Jacob said. A mining department officer said in the raids conducted in various districts, illegal sand mining with machines was detected at various spots. FIRs had been registered against the contractors while confiscating the machines and trucks. In Banda illegal sand mining was detected in river Ken while in Hamirpur illegal mining was seen in river Betwa. At some places it was found that sand mining was goning on in the river bed, endangering aquatic life.. The geology and mining department has set the target of ₹4,000 crore revenue in the year 2020-21. It collected ₹3120 crore after the state government permitted sand mining during corona Curfew and partial lockdown, the officer said. The mining department has lodged 536 FIRs in 2020-21 on the charge of violation of mining rules as well as storage of sand. The role of the district mining officers had been detected in illegal mining and departmentsl inquiry had been ordered against half a dozen officers, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dms-told-to-crack-down-on-illegal-sand-mining-and-storage-101624385020692.html
22-06-2021||Mumbai||Amravati MP Navneet Kaur Rana gets reprieve from SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed an order of the Bombay High Court that ordered authorities to cancel and confiscate the caste certificate issued to Amravati member of Parliament Navneet Kaur Rana.Rana, who was elected to the Lok Sabha as an Independent in 2019 from the reserved constituency of Amravati, had claimed to belong to “Mochi” scheduled caste. The high court earlier this month ruled that the certificate was “fraudulently obtained.The top court’s order comes as a huge relief to the sitting MP who was on the verge of losing all benefits obtained on the strength of her caste certificate, including her election to the Lok Sabha.Senior lawyer Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Navneet Kaur Rana, told the court that the high court failed to consider vital documents produced in support of her caste identity based on pre-independence records. A vacation bench of justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari issued notice on her plea and stayed the operation of the High Court order of June 8 till the next date of hearing on July 27. Senior lawyer Kapil Sibal, who represented Shiv Sena leader and former MP Anandrao Adsul who had complained about Rana’s caste certificate, opposed the grant of stay.But Sibal was told by the bench that the high court appeared to have erred.“The high court records that the manner by which the caste scrutiny committee decided on the caste certificate of the petitioner (Rana) was not correct. It expressed dissatisfaction. Ideally, the high court should have sent the matter back for re-scrutiny by the Committee. Instead, the high Court goes into a fact-finding process which was not correct.”Adsul and the Maharashtra government, which was not represented at Tuesday’s hearing, have been told to file their response by the next date of hearing.The high court’s June 8 order said the lawmaker got the caste certificate validated from the caste scrutiny committee by producing fabricated and fraudulent documents, and reversed the November 2017 order of the Mumbai suburban district caste scrutiny committee which had found it in order.The high court also cancelled the caste certificate issued in August 2013 by the then deputy collector of Mumbai recognizing Rana as scheduled caste and imposed a ₹2 lakh fine.The high court had also pulled up the caste scrutiny committee for doing its job “sloppily” and noted its failure to execute statutory obligations required under the Caste Certificate Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amravati-mp-navneet-kaur-rana-gets-reprieve-from-sc-101624384480607.html
22-06-2021||Dehradun||War of words after Uttarakhand allows AYUSH doctors to prescribe allopathic medicines during emergencies||War of words sparked between allopathic doctors and AYUSH medical practitioners after the state decided to allow Ayurveda doctors to prescribe allopathic medicines during emergencies, HT has learnt. Uttarakhand AYUSH minister Harak Singh Rawat on Monday announced that the state government has decided to allow Ayurveda doctors to prescribe allopathic medicines in the state during emergencies. Rawat made this announcement while talking to the media after attending the function organised on the occasion of the International Yoga Day in Dehradun. Dr DD Choudhary, senior member of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Uttarakhand said this is an unprecedented development. “Can allopathic doctors be allowed to practice Ayurvedic medicine? No. Then how can they be allowed to prescribe allopathic medicines? This is ridiculous,” he said Dr Choudhary said that if the government issues an order in this regard, then the IMA will convene a meeting and discuss the future course of action in the matter. Dr Ajay Khanna, secretary Indian Medical Association (IMA) Uttarakhand chapter said perhaps the AYUSH minister is not aware that he cannot do such a thing. “It is like asking a pilot to operate a train as well. Who will be responsible if something happens to a patient who is given allopathic medicines? There is a Supreme Court order which already prohibits allowing of such mixopathy”, he said. Dr Khanna said if the state government issues order in this regard, under which norms or legal process can they take such a decision? Dr Hardev Rawat, general secretary, Association of Ayurveda and Unani doctors in Uttarakhand, said if states like Himachal Pradesh have done the same, why can’t Uttarakhand also follow suit? “Allopathic doctors have economic interests in serving in urban areas. Most of their hospitals and clinics are in urban areas. Now, if this decision can help people in rural areas, why are they opposing it? We want to thank the AYUSH minister for taking this decision,” he said. Dr JN Nautiyal, senior Ayurveda doctor in the state said the proposed decision by the state government will bring relief to the 80% of people living in rural and remote areas of the state. “In such areas, you won’t find many allopathic doctors as they are mostly concentrated in urban areas. But Ayurveda doctors are already serving in the remote and rural areas of the state and can now help people in case of an emergency,” he said. Dr Nautiyal said the IMA has a habit of opposing any issue when it comes to Ayurveda doctors. “They will not go and serve in rural or remote areas and will not allow us also to provide some relief to the people in distress or during emergencies,” he said. Dr IS Grewal, secretary, state chapter of National Integrated Medical Association, said many states in India have already allowed this practice. “The Supreme Court has also left this upon state governments decide on this. When allopathic doctors are not available in rural areas, why is there an opposition to Ayurveda doctors saving people’s lives? The Apex court has allowed this and Ayurveda doctors have to go for a one-year bridge course for this. I think there should be no opposition to this decision as it will benefit people in remote areas,” he said. Uttarakhand AYUSH minister Harak Singh Rawat said opposition by the IMA in this matter is not right as the decision has been taken to ensure that people in rural and remote areas, where there are no allopathic doctors, get healthcare in case of emergencies. “If the government in Himachal Pradesh can allow this, why can’t we do the same here? We have around 800 Ayurveda doctors in the state and around 2,700 sanctioned posts for allopathic doctors. So had to take a such a decision to ensure people get proper treatment during emergencies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/war-of-words-after-uttarakhand-allows-ayush-doctors-to-prescribe-allopathic-medicines-during-emergencies-101624383880494.html
22-06-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka excise department logs 10% boost in revenue during lockdown||The Karnataka excise department has reported 10% more revenue during the period of coronavirus-induced lockdown than under normal circumstances, state excise minister K Gopalaiah said.During the launch of Covid-19 vaccination drive in Bengaluru, Gopalaiah talked about the rise in revenue by ₹500 crore by quoting statistics. “During the period between April 1 and June 15 when lockdown was introduced, the total revenue earned by the excise department was ₹4,500 crore. This is 10% higher than the usual business quarter, as in a typical quarter, the state’s excise revenue hovers around ₹4,000 crores," the minister said.This hike in revenue is attributed to the increased sale of liquor. Though the bars were closed during the entire period of lockdown, the liquor stores were allowed to operate for four hours. This relaxation allowed the consumers to buy liquor and enabled its steady sale. Member of the Karnataka Federation of Wine Merchants, Ganesh Shetty said, the sale of IMFL stocks and foreign-made liquor was particularly faster and in bulk. IMFL is a shortened form for 'Indian- made foreign liquor'. On Fridays and Saturdays the liquor sale almost doubled in select outlets."With the lockdown coming to an end in many districts, we look forward to the return of normalcy to our business too. But nevertheless we will continue to operate and abide by the Standard Operations Protocols", Mr. Shetty added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-excise-department-logs-10-boost-in-revenue-during-lockdown-101624383408865.html

The woman died on March 17, 2007, and her father lodged a police complaint four days later alleging that she was poisoned to death because of non-fulfilment of her husband's demand for a motorcycle."The medical evidence and the forensic evidence do not prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was a case of homicidal death," the bench said in its order.The high court observed that the judgment of the additional sessions judge is an example of "how not to write a judgment"."It has repeatedly been emphasized by the Supreme Court that the Courts and Judges must make a dispassionate assessment of evidence and that the Courts and Judges should not be swayed by the horror of crime and the character of the person."The judgment should be made by a Judge uninfluenced by his own imagined norms of the functioning of the society," the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-high-court-acquits-man-sentenced-to-death-for-murdering-wife-101624381392727.html

He allegedly smuggled SLR rifles during the years 1992-1995. From the year 2000, he started smuggling AK 47. According to police sources, Parvez used to hide the smuggled rifles at his home to keep them out of police reach. He used to charge a hefty amount from smugglers in return. His name came to the limelight when police arrested one Mohammad Imran with three AK 47 guns in Jamalpur. Police said that the accused were booked under Sections of IPC, Arms Act and Section 39 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).Shafiqul said that due to the non-submission of the charge sheet, two of the accused got relief under Section 167 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code and were released on bail from the court. “The accused were entitled to claim bail as the police had failed to file the charge sheet within the stipulated period,” said senior advocate Shashikant of Patna session court.Munger police busted the racket and registered a case against 32 named accused and some unknown persons under the leadership of then SP Babu Ram. Police had recovered 22 AK-47 assault rifles and more than 500 spare parts stolen from the COD. The NIA in October 2018 took over the case from the Bihar Police on the Union Home Ministry’s orders and has arrested 15 accused in the case so far. Earlier, Munger DIG recommended departmental proceedings against the then Sheikhpura SP Daya Shankar and SDPO Amit Sharan for their alleged involvement in protecting the accused officers who fraudulently transferred over ₹50 lakh, meant for payment as increments to other policemen across the district between January 2015 and October 2018, into their accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/former-munger-additional-sp-in-soup-for-not-filing-charge-sheet-in-2018-smuggling-case-101624380819901.html

Traders say the system is causing confusion and leading to losses. In a letter written on Tuesday and addressed to Renu Devi, deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad and Patna Sahib MP Ravi Shankar Prasad, the traders said other states allowed all business establishments to open on a regular basis as they eased lockdown imposed amid the second wave due to Covid-19 pandemic and suggested allowing all shops to open five days in a week while keeping them closed on weekends. Kamal Nopani, chairman of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), Bihar, said, “The odd- even system has created confusion among buyers. People tend to forget closing and opening days of shops due to which business is low and slow.” “Things will change if all shops will be allowed to open every day.This is being done in many other states,” he said.On Monday, the state government, while announcing further relaxations from Wednesday, directed all traders and businessmen to stick to the existing odd-even opening system till July 6. The lockdown was imposed in the state on May 5 following a sudden surge in cases and has been extended multiple times since then. Responding to the traders’ request, Devi said the odd-even system was in place for “safety of people’s lives”. “If everything is allowed to open on a regular basis, there will be huge rush, which is risky. Social distancing has to be followed, as many experts have predicted the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic,” Devi said, adding that requests and suggestions of traders and businessmen will be considered if Covid-19 situation in the state remains under control for next 15 days. “Unlock-3.0 has just been announced and made effective till July 6. But, we are considering opening colleges and universities in July. Opening of the shops will be reconsidered after reopening academic institutions,” she said. On the other hand, CAIT president Ashok Verma said the odd-even system was also resulting in loss for the government. “Even the government is losing revenue. In fact, the loss of business on a single day is huge and recovery is not as easy,” he said, adding that they have asked traders and businessmen to strictly follow Covid-19 norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-traders-oppose-odd-even-for-shops-minister-says-system-to-stay-for-now-101624380759862.html
22-06-2021||Patna||Bihar CM urges bankers to lend more, assures security||Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday expressed displeasure over the low credit deposit (CD) ratio in the state and urged bankers to disburse more loans to agriculture and MSME sectors in the current fiscal (2021-22).Kumar, who was addressing the state level bankers’ committee ( SLBC) meeting attended by representatives from commercial and private banks through virtual mode, said the state’s CD ratio at 46.40% in 2020-21 was much lower than the national average of 76.5%. “It is imperative the ratio is improved to meet the annual credit plan of ₹1,61,500 crore. Money deposited in banks in the state is going to developed states,” he said. In 2019-20, the CD ratio stood at 43.03%, an improvement for previous years when it was below 40% in the state. The low CD ratio has remained a sore point between the state government and bankers for several decades. While successive governments have been putting pressure on the bankers to lend more, the latter cite high rate of non-performing assets ( NPAs) or bad loans as the reason behind the reluctance of banks to give more loans. Sources said the total NPAs till March 2021 stood at ₹20,444 crore. In 2019-20, it was ₹16,000 crore. At the meeting, the CM told bankers to achieve the target of disbursing s ₹51,500 crore in agriculture sector and also lend more to MSMEs and medical sector ( setting up oxygen plants) and help investors keen on setting up ethanol plants as per the new policy. Kumar also asked banks to open at least one branch at gram panchayat level so that rural population gets better banking facilities. He also reminded the bankers that their plan of opening one branch for a population of 5,000 had not been achieved so far.The CM also urged them to lend support to over 10 lakh self- help groups in the state under Jeevika programme, a World Bank-aided rural livelihood project.The SLBC meeting was also attended by deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, industry minister Shahnawaj Hussain, agriculture minister Amarendra Pratap Singh and senior officials. Law and order The CM assured the bankers that the state government was committed to providing all possible help for security of bank premises. The assurance came after a mention of rising incidents of bank loot over the past few months.“The government has taken prompt action in investigating cases of bank loot and made breakthrough in several cases. In the recent Hajipur case, police have made big recovery of the looted amount and several persons have been arrested,” Kumar told the bankers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-cm-urges-bankers-to-lend-more-assures-security-101624380700589.html

Elected members across all the parties raised the question over the pre-monsoon cleaning and asked details about the amount spent on it. The administration kept mum on the issue in the meeting on Tuesday, however mayor Muralidhar Mohol instructed to offer a written explanation to the general body in the coming days. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ganesh Bidkar asked the question that administration must give detailed responses like the number of nalas in the city, its length and the money spent on it. Every year the same issue is being discussed. The nala cleaning is part of technical work and the administration must sort out a permanent solution for it. Opposition parties on Tuesday held an agitation in the PMC general body meeting. Despite the start of the monsoon season, the PMC not finished cleaning nalas yet, the opposition alleged. NCP city unit president Prashant Jagtap said, “The mayor visited Ambil odha last week and announced that 90 per cent nala and drainage cleaning work has been completed, then why are their own party members raising questions over nala cleaning?” NCP’s Ashwini Kadam said, “Despite asking questions, the administration not giving answers on why the work of bridge at Aryaneshwar stopped? Even the encroachments in nalas are not removed.” BJP’s Manjusha Nagpure said, “Last two years city is facing heavy rainfall. By considering this experience, it was expected that the administration would do proper work this year.” BJP’s Pravin Chorbole said, “The contractors are cleaning the nalas but keeping all the mud on the banks of it. After few days, same mud is falling in the nala, then why is the PMC spending money on it if that debris and mud will again go in the nalas?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/all-parties-question-pmc-on-incomplete-pre-monsoon-work-101624377879730.html

22-06-2021||Pune||BJP accepts mismanagement in road-digging work across city||Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) accepted that as a ruling party in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) they are on the backfoot on issues of road digging for 24x7 water pipeline and cable laying that is underway across the city without proper planning. The elected members across all parties on Tuesday raised the issue of rampant road digging and not having proper reinstatement of roads after finishing the digging work. PMC leader of house Ganesh Bidkar from the BJP said, “It is true that the road digging work is going on without any planning. The Maha Metro is carrying out the work in the city and it is mainly on prominent roads but there is no chaos due to metro work. They are carrying out work with proper planning and creating awareness about it. Before work, they are doing proper barricading of sites. “ Bidkar accepted, ‘If the Metro is carrying the road digging without disturbing citizens’ routine, why has the PMC administration failed to create awareness and do the work with proper planning?” NCP leader Vishal Tambe said, “Few years before, just because of potholes, Congress lost the power in PMC. Now all the major roads in the city are in worse condition. It is alarming for BJP as the elections are just a few months away.” Tambe added that the situation is similar across roads in the city, half of the road is tar and the digging part is matched by laying concrete. The opposition parties also raised the question of allowing cable laying work for private cable operators in monsoon.

22-06-2021||Kolkata||‘UT status demanded for Bengal districts by MPs, not endorsed by party’: BJP||The Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday said it neither endorses nor supports the demand for separate statehood or Union territory status for certain districts as raised by two of its Lok Sabha members.“The demands do not adhere to our party’s official stand. We see Bengal as one state,” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon amid strong reaction in political circles against the demands raised by John Barla, the MP from Alipurduar in north Bengal and Saumitra Khan, who represents the Bishnupur constituency in south Bengal’s Bankura district.Barla, a tribal leader, joined the BJP in 2014 while Khan, who was the Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP from Bishnupur since 2014, switched over to the saffron camp before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and retained the seat.“These people joined the BJP in recent years. They have to toe the party line. It is a fact that large parts of north and south Bengal have been neglected for decades and local people have grievances against the state government. The leaders must have raised the demands out of frustration and anger because our workers are facing atrocity ever since the assembly polls ended but they cannot make such statements in public,” said Ghosh. He did not name Khan and Barla.Last week, Barla said he will urge the Centre to either form a state or Union territory by clubbing the districts in north Bengal. On Monday, Khan voiced the same demand for certain parts of West Burdwan, Bankura, Purulia, West and East Midnapore and a part of Hooghly district. They were supported by a handful of local leaders and legislators from these regions while the BJP maintained its distance.TMC workers have lodged complaints at several police stations in Bengal against Barla and Khan, accusing them of attempting to create disturbance.“We will not allow anyone to split Bengal,” chief minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee said last week and citizens vented their anger against the BJP on social media.Incidentally, the BJP performed well in the regions for which the two MPs demanded separate status.In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, as well as the recent state elections, the BJP outperformed the TMC in the north Bengal region. In 2019, the saffron camp bagged seven of the eight Lok Sabha seats in the eight districts starting from Malda to Darjeeling. In the state polls, two prominent TMC ministers lost in north Bengal while BJP candidates won 30 of the region’s 54 assembly segments where identity politics played a key role.Although the BJP was trounced by the TMC in these polls in most parts of south Bengal, which accounts for 240 assembly and 34 Lok Sabha seats, the saffron camp managed to make inroads in Bankura, Purulia, West Burdwan, Nadia and parts of Hooghly and East and West Midnapore districts.“I refuse to believe that the two MPs raised the demand without any support from their party. The BJP must be having a bigger plan,” Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said.In north Bengal, Barla’s demand has drawn strong criticism from tribal and Gorkha groups. Leaders of the Gorkha Jana Mukti Morcha in the Darjeeling hill region and the Greater Cooch Behar People’s Association (GCPA) in the plains have accused the BJP of trying to create unrest before the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.The BJP suffered a setback in north Bengal on Monday when Ganga Prasad Sharma, president of the unit in Alipurduar district, where the party bagged all five assembly seats in the recent assembly polls, joined the TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/ut-status-demanded-for-bengal-districts-raised-by-mps-not-endorsed-by-party-bjp-101624375540495.html
22-06-2021||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh creates record, 1.64 mn people vaccinated in a day||Madhya Pradesh government created a record of administering Covid-19 vaccines to 1.64 million people in a day on Monday after a sudden drop of vaccinations in the past three days, experts said, claiming that data shows the state stockpiled vaccines to create the record.On Sunday, only 4,098 people received the Covid vaccine jab, just 2% of the weekly average of vaccination in the state since the first week of May. The weekly average of vaccination in MP is 1.5 lakhs or more since May 2 when vaccination for 18 plus started. For the first time since May, vaccinations touched a new low on Sunday, according to the data of the state health department. Vaccination on Saturday and Sunday were below the daily average. The state government officials said offers, which had been declared to invite more people for vaccination on Monday, and Sunday lockdown, were the reasons behind the low number of vaccinations on Sunday. Member of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, SR Azad, said, “There was a slow pace of vaccination in MP. After PM Modi’s announcement of a mass vaccination programme and providing vaccines free of cost, the state government swung into action and started publicizing the campaign in a new way. The focus shifted from daily vaccination to one-day record. Stockpiling is obvious because they have limited stock for vaccination. To grab attention and praises, the state government focused on vaccination on International Yoga day only.” “All the districts administration, officers of different departments, politicians and social workers came out to motivate people and offer them something in return whether it is a free recharge or lucky draw. It is good but they should maintain this till vaccination of all. Like previous campaign, this shouldn’t be a mere ritual of one day,” he added. Another activist, Rachna Dhingra said, “It is good that the state government make vaccination process a competition among cities and villages. But will they be able to sustain this? The chances are very low because for the ‘big-day’ they called National Health Missions (NHM) nurses and staff members, posted at different government hospitals, which is not possible daily. Similarly, how will they ensure the availability of the vaccines? If they maintain this, they can achieve the target of 100% population by December 31.” Requesting anonymity, an officer of the state health department said, “It is wrong to say that the state government was doing stockpiling of vaccines but yes, the government was focusing more on Maha abhiyan. It was not the state government but the central government which wanted to create a record and that’s why we received vaccines in abundance before the big day and will soon get about 50 lakh vaccines. Earlier, we had to hold the vaccination campaign with maintaining the stock as we were not receiving vaccines in large quantities like we are getting now.” Medical education department minister Vishwas Sarang said, “It is true that fewer people were turning up for vaccination whether due to fear about the side effects of the vaccine.” “More people turned up for vaccination on Monday as we celebrated the day to end the fear for vaccination from the mind of people. The chief minister, BJP leaders, ministers, local administration, famous personalities and businessmen became part of this campaign to motivate people. Many collectors and private partners offered many things to invite people. Now, it will go on smoothly. Those who were misguided about the vaccination will start trusting us and vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/madhya-pradesh-creates-record-1-64-mn-people-vaccinated-in-a-day-101624370260521.html
22-06-2021||Delhi||‘Crowds beyond shops not in our control’: Delhi traders’ bodies on overcrowding||Delhi’s traders bodies on Tuesday pointed out that responsibility of social distancing and enforcing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) preventative measures at markets lies with the administration not with the shopkeepers. The traders’ bodies of Delhi’s markets said it is not possible for them to control crowds outside their shops and the onus lies with the administration.The traders’ bodies reaction comes in response to the Delhi high court taking cognizance of the violation of Covid-19 protocols across Delhi’s markets. The court also said that such breaches will only hasten the probable third wave of Covid-19. The court directed the Centre, the Delhi government and administrators to take strict measures in enforcing the measures. It had also asked them to meet with markets and vendor associations in this regard.Following the gradual reopening of the national capital, Delhites were seen thronging markets, malls and restaurants, which were closed following the rise in deaths due to Covid-19 in the city. Markets can now open fully between 10am to 8pm.Brijesh Goyal, chairman of the chamber of trade and industry, said that as far as crowds inside shops are concerned that comes under the ambit of the shopkeeper but crowds outside the shop in the common areas of the markets lie with the administration. He said traders can only ensure compliance inside their shops, godowns or offices.“It is the administration and the police who have to ensure that the protocols are followed in streets and other public spaces,” Goyal was quoted as saying by news agency PTI urging the authorities to hold meetings with market associations to find ways of crowd control. He said the issue is limited to a few markets out of the 950 major markets of Delhi.“Our only aim is to have some customers every day. We make sure that not more than three customers are inside a shop at a time and five if it is a big shop. If we have to manage the crowd outside as well, who will manage the shop?” Ashok Randhawa, president of the Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Traders' Association asked. Randhawa said that it will impact the business of shopkeepers if they ask shoppers in groups to step outside. He said this job is better suited for police or civil defence volunteers.Sanjay Bhargava, president of the Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, pointed out that presence of police and civil defence volunteers would make visitors more likely to be more mindful of their conduct. He also said that ‘drastic precautions’ should be taken till the wedding season begins. He said that markets can also follow an odd-even system so that the crowds can be controlled till August 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/crowds-beyond-shops-not-in-our-control-delhi-traders-bodies-on-overcrowding-101624369348287.html

22-06-2021||Lucknow||Standing by artistes for a better tomorrow||Pandemic has hit several industries fairly hard and many have been rendered jobless. One such sector that has suffered unrecoverable losses and left many without work is the industry of performing arts. Artistes, largely dependent on live shows, from the field of theatre, singing, dance; music and other folk arts are bearing the brunt due to the ongoing pandemic. Pained with their suffering, some artistes, associations and individuals have come forward to support them. Sufi-Kathak founder Manjari Chaturvedi, with support of a few, is helping distressed 180 artistes’ families — largely from Uttar Pradesh — in tune of ₹3000-5000 every month. “When lockdown started and we were busy baking cakes and posting recipes, I got a call from a qawaal who shared that they were literally starving. I transferred some amount to him that followed more requests. Thinking on how to help them, I sent messages to my contacts on phone list and social media with an option of either send directly or through us,” says the kathak danseuse. Initially, she supported 17 artistes and since then has been helping families from different part of country which has now reached to 180 families. “Big thanks to the people who are supporting the cause. Like a doctor I know is funded 70 musicians! Organisations, foundations, fund-raisers, charitable institutions we are trying all means. Maximum people are from rural belt, but we also have SNA awardees and even a music teacher from Mumbai,” says Manjari. She feels that governments must take initiatives with the kind of funds they have for art and culture. Helping handsBureaucrat couple Dr Anita Bhatnagar and Ashu Jain on personal level supported around 200 artistes. “We supported them with ration packets and medicines. Artistes have huge self-respect and don’t come forward asking help so through our contacts we help them in a small way.” City-based theatre body Kalakaar Association supported 36 artistes with ration kits while cash to some. “Mostly established artistes and Lucknowites have contributed and we trying best help performing artistes who are left workless in the pandemic,” says association president Sangam Bahuguna. Folk singer Malini Awasthi shared an instance about an artiste. “For a programme I called a qawaal but I was told he is now in Aligarh making locks on daily wages. In absence of shows their situation has become bad to worse! Last year, with help of appeal from established artistes, we collected ₹38 lakhs and supported some 1,450 artistes. This year we have already transferred some amount to 30 artistes from the collection while on personal level have provided ration,” she said. The singer informs that before the second wave government has organised programmes like Awadh Mahotsava and in Varanasi where artistes performed. “I have come to know that a series of online and later offline events will be held where artistes will get opportunity to perform and earn,” she said. Perform & earnUttar Pradesh Tourism, Cultural Department and UP Sangeet Natak Academy is going to organize a two-day Ramayana Conclave in 10 cities where artistes will be given a platform to perform, informed a senior government official.Manjari adds that uncertainty has made artistes suffer from depression. “Soon we are going to start an artiste sustainable programme and through these shows they will be able to perform and earn. Along with money, mental support is also what they need at this hour,” says the Sufi Kathak Foundation founder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/standing-by-artistes-for-a-better-tomorrow-101624368339967.html

This marked one more success in the fight against Maoists in Odisha.Inspector general of police (anti-Maoist operations) Amitabh Thakur said on Monday that the police team was combing Kumbhaharu village under Gochhapada police station of Kandhamal when the Maoists started heavy firing. The Maoists however took the benefit of dense forests and difficult terrain to escape from the spot. The seizures included a .303 rifle, a hand grenade, a 12 bore country-made gun and INSAS rifle among other ammunition.Thakur said the seizure comes a week after police seized a huge cache of arms and ammunition from a forest near Kulabeda village in Malkangiri district following an exchange of fire with Maoists. An INSAS, 19 rounds of 5.56x39 mm ammunition, 15 rounds of 7.62x45 mm ammunition, one AK-47 magazine and 2 INSAS magazines were recovered from the spot.There have been at least four seizures of Maoist arms by Odisha police this year. In January, a detonator, two hand grenades, two packets of explosives, three magazine pouches were recovered from the forest near Lengerimunda village under Chakapad Police station of Kandhamal district following an encounter. The same month, several bomb-making devices, explosives, wires and other incriminating articles were recovered by police and BSF jawans from Matikhal forest under Gorasetu region of Malkangiri district.In February, a huge cache of arms and ammunition, including 6 single barrel muzzle loading guns, 205 pipes for SBML guns, 50 gelatin sticks, 2 claymore mines, 3 tiffin bombs and 3 kilograms of iron splinters were seized from the Atmakunda forest in Narayanpatna area of Koraput district during a search operation.The same month, a team of Border Security Force (BSF) jawans recovered 60 Gelatin sticks, 50 electric detonators, 5 bundles of flexible wires, 30 small iron pellets and 2.5 kilograms of urea in Pindamali-Bhitarpara forest area in Swabhiman Anchal area of Malkangiri.Police officials said repeated seizures were a good sign as it leads to reducing the firepower of the rebels. “This year, two Maoists have been killed in an encounter with police. This month, Rabindra, a member of Bolangir-Bargarh-Mahasamund (BBM) divisional committee of Maoists, with ₹5 lakh reward money on him, was killed during an encounter at Jhanj Reserve Forest in Bargarh district. Had Maoists from Chhatisgarh not been coming to Odisha, we would not have any Maoist-related incidents,” said a senior police official.In Odisha, there are 230 Maoists active, of which around 20 are homegrown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-police-seize-rifle-ammunition-from-maoist-hideout-in-kandhamal-101624367261615.html
22-06-2021||Pune||Pune Metro project: PMC, state’s share of cost increases||PUNE With the central government having reduced its share of financial contribution to Pune’s metro, from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, Maha-Metro has now requested the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the state government, to cover the outstanding amount.The shortfall in finance is specific to the funds needed for the extension of the Metro route between Swargate and Katraj.For the first phase of the Metro which covers two lines, Vanaz to Ramwadi and PCMC to Swargate, the funding pattern was Central and state government’s to contribute 20 per cent each, PMC would give 10 per cent, and the balance 50 per cent would be taken as a loan from a bank.Now, the proposal submitted to the PMC states that both PMC and the state government need to bear 15 per cent of the cost, each, with the Central government bearing 10 per cent and the balance 60 per cent will be a loan.Maha-Metro’s public relation’s officer Hemant Sonawane said that the proposal was submitted to the PMC on Monday.Another Maha-Metro official speaking on condition of anonymity, said, “Because this is an extension of phase one of the project, which was already cleared, the Central government has approved 10 per cent. It is a a common formula used by Centre. If there is an extension to what has already been decided it contributes only 10 percent. If the PMC had submitted this extension as part of the second phase, clubbing all the extension routes together, there were chances the Centre would have stuck to its 20 per cent contribution. But, that kind of proposal needs a lot of permissions and it is a time consuming process.”Congress party leader Gopal Tiwari criticised the Central government’s decision to approve only 10 per cent for the Pune metro. Tiwari said, “I am going to raise this issue with the national leadership. The central government is running from its responsibility and forcing the municipal corporation to take on an additional burden as well as borrow extra.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-metro-project-pmc-state-s-share-of-cost-increases-101624366361401.html

22-06-2021||Chandigarh||Awaiting the good news that hardly breaks soon!||The pining of the star-crossed Ranjha for his beloved Heer mightn’t have been as intense as that of a writer wistfully yearning to see her write-up getting published. Wielding a pen, I often wonder what else could dread the writers’ fraternity more than receiving a soft-toned rejection by the august editorial team; exhorting them to further hone their writing skills. It takes years of reading and inking reams of sheets in practice to frame a well-rounded, all-inclusive, and relevant piece worth passing muster for publication. No sooner had an acceptance mail hit my inbox, weighed down with a truckload of rejected mails, than a vehement maelstrom of ecstasy would begin whirling dreamily all around. The news would transform me into a broken record parroting out the content of the received mail verbatim to the entire family for its veracity. My sane conscience, silently at times, would exhort me to contain my self-indulgent childlike animation the moment somebody asked me the date of its publication. Over time, one realises that awaiting the publication of a piece turns out to be irascibly itching at the subliminal level even more so than awaiting the editor’s final word. Breaking of the dawn injects an overdose of edginess into my yoga sessions as my closed eyes and unreceptive ears apparently sapped all their energy into paying heed to the anticipated sound of the newspaper that could any time flop onto my balcony, brushing the edges of the iron grilles. Disrupting the rhythm of my deep breathing, I rush out at full steam to pick up the newspaper before the rest of the family. My impatient mind reflexively urges my fidgety fingers into skimming through the pages fast, overlooking the hottest headlines of the day to jump straight to the Spice of Life column only to end up folding the paper slowly with a crestfallen visage having failed to muster a moral goodwill to read the write-up of a fellow author. Thanks to the long queue of writers of all ages and professions, the wait grows longer. Days stretch to weeks and untowardly morph into months, wilting the enthusiasm. Then out of the blue dawns a balmy day when fortune smiles upon you. Reading your name in the author’s adored space pumps pleasure and contentment into the heart, reflecting on a lofty thought that the hard work coated in a thick layer of patience has finally come out with flying colours. With small, slow, painstaking strokes of a scissor, you merrily snip out the article. What makes your day even more special, lending an indelible and unforgettable aspect to the experience, are all those heart-warming feedbacks that land in the inbox and comment section on social media platforms, refilling the pen with the much-needed tonic of rejuvenation and impetus to get the momentum going. That over-the-moon feeling hangs in the air for long until the world around begins enquiring about your next write-up.

SAD leaders Prem Singh Chadumajra, Maheshinder Singh Grewal and Dr Daljeet Cheema also said that Singla was sent to keep tabs on the SIT questioning. Singla asked the former CM regarding his role in the 2015 firing case but following Badal’s objection he did not ask any more questions, according to a report by HT.Parkash Singh Badal was the chief minister of Punjab in 2015 when the incidents of desecration of religious texts and subsequent police firing on people protesting over the issue occured in Faridkot. The Punjab government in May 2021 set up a new SIT on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court. The SIT led by additional director of police LK Yadav quashed the report submitted by the first SIT led by inspector general Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh in April.The new SIT is probing two FIRs which were registered on October 14 in 2015 and August 7 in 2018 with relation to the Kotkapura firing incident. The SIT has already questioned former DGP Sumedh Saini along with other police officers. The previous SIT also questioned the former chief minister who called the probe ‘politically motivated’ and said that the probe was initiated to defame him. A separate probe in the 2015 Behbal Kalan firing case is also underway. Police fired at demonstrators who were protesting the desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sit-quizzes-parkash-badal-for-more-than-2-hours-in-kotkapura-police-firing-case-101624359021977.html

Mawya’s family originally belongs to Lamberi village on the Line of Control (LoC) in Rajouri district. Her father, Vinod Kumar Sharma, is an engineer in the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board. The family is settled in Jammu. Her uncle, Raj Sudan, recalled Mawya’s journey. “She did her schooling from Carmel Convent School and later joined JK Public School in Kunjwani. She then earned a government scholarship to study outside J&K. She went on to pursue her graduation at MCM DAV College in Chandigarh,” he said. “Since her childhood she was attracted towards flying machines and used to draw their sketches on the walls in her room. She was into sports also,” he added. He described Mawya a self-motivated person, who used to watch helicopters hovering in the sky on the LoC in her native village. After her graduation, Mawya took the Air Force Common Admission Test (AFCAT). While waiting for her results, she joined Panjab University for postgraduation in defence studies. “Barely two months into the course, she qualified the AFCAT. We are very proud of her achievement,” Raj said. Mawya has an elder sister, Tanya, who is an alumna of Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode. She was inducted as a fighter pilot during the combined graduation parade ceremony in Hyderabad last Saturday. She is the 12th woman fighter pilot in the IAF. J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha has congratulated Mawya on her achievement. “Congratulations to Mawya Sudan, daughter of J&K, who has been commissioned as a flying officer in the Indian Air Force. It is a matter of immense pride & joy to see you scripting history. With this achievement, you have lent wings to the dreams of millions of our daughters,” he said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mawya-sudan-becomes-iaf-s-1st-woman-fighter-pilot-from-jk-101624358499861.html
22-06-2021||Bangalore||'DK Shivakumar’s word is final’: Cong leader amid murmurs of feud over CM face||Former Karnataka deputy chief minister G Parameshwara on Monday said that there is no factionalism in the state unit of Congress and the decisions taken by party president DK Shivakumar are the collective and final decisions of the party. His statement was in response to the Koppal MLA Raghavendra Hitnal’s demand to project former chief minister Siddaramaiah as the Congress’ chief ministerial candidate in the upcoming polls.“Whatever DK Shivakumar says is the party’s opinion. State party president is supreme here. The president could be DK Shivakumar, Dinesh Gundu Rao or me, whatever business it is, the president is supreme. Whatever he says comes with the Congress high command’s permission,” Parameshwara was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.People familiar with the developments told news agency ANI that murmurs of discord regarding the chief ministerial candidate for the 2023 elections surfaced soon after DK Shivakumar took oath as the Karnataka Congress president as cadres and MLAs are divided between Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah. The person cited above said that the high command told partymen to focus on the Karnataka legislative assembly elections rather than focusing on projecting a chief ministerial candidate.“Be it Zameer Ahmed or anyone else in the party, they must follow the instructions of DK Shivakumar as he is the state party president. The party high command will clear any issues raised by anyone. There is no factionalism in the Congress,” he further added.Parameshwar said that the party should focus on winning the polls and returning to power while highlighting that Siddaramaiah said the opinions shared by the MLAs are their own. Earlier Congress leader Zameer Ahmad demanded Siddaramaiah to be projected as the chief ministerial candidate in the upcoming polls.Hitnal earlier said citizens of the state want to see Siddaramaiah back at the helm. He said Zameer Ahmad’s statement was backed by the people of the state. “People of the state want Siddaramaiah as their CM which is why Zameer Ahmad made the statement. It is the opinion of the people of Karnataka,” Hitnal said. He also said that Siddaramaiah would have tackled the Covid-19 situation better than incumbent chief minister BS Yediyurappa.“It is not simply my opinion. It is the opinion of the auto driver, the poor, daily wage worker and shopkeepers. As far as people’s opinion is concerned, there is 100 to 200% guarantee that Siddaramaiah will become the next chief minister for sure,” he further added.Karnataka Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit which last week held a series of meetings with senior leaders and cabinet ministers to discuss the internal feuds in the state unit said that DK Shivakumar is surrounded by backstabbers. Karnataka minister KS Eshwarappa said that the fight between the cadres has the potential to hurt Congress. “The fight for the chief minister’s post within the Congress with (either faction) dreaming of either Siddaramaiah or DK Shivakumar in the CM's chair can create more problems for Congress in future for sure. DK Shivakumar must not forget that backstabbers are behind him,” Eshwarappa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/dk-shivakumar-s-word-is-final-cong-leader-amid-murmurs-of-feud-over-cm-face-101624357965084.html

A 24-year-old woman was found dead in Kollam on Monday. Another woman allegedly died after she set herself afire on Tuesday in Thiruvananthapuram. In both cases, husbands of the women have been arrested. The 24-year-old woman’s parents said she was continuously harassed over the car gifted to her at her wedding. She purportedly sent to her parents’ photos of her injury marks and scars allegedly inflicted by her husband. The parents alleged she was being harassed with demands for a luxury car and was told that the one gifted to her was worth just ₹10 lakh. They added they also gifted their daughter over 100 sovereigns of gold and one-acre land.“He (son-in-law) did not like the car I gifted and always used to argue with my daughter over this. When he came here last time, he sought ₹10 lakh which I refused. His torture aggravated after this,” said the Kollam woman’s father.Also Read | 5 killed in Kerala, police investigate victims’ pastThe parents of the Thiruvananthapuram woman, too, alleged she was being harassed for dowry.

22-06-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana DGP seeks premature repatriation to Intelligence Bureau||Haryana director general of police Manoj Yadava on Tuesday sought premature repatriation to the Intelligence Bureau (IB), citing career consideration and family requirements. The state government will now have to send a proposal to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for selecting Yadava’s replacement. In a communication to additional chief secretary, home, the DGP said that he would like to return to the IB as additional director and should be relieved for rejoining the bureau. Of course, the repatriation request will need the approval of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Also read: Vij seeks new DGP, stokes controversy“For the past 28 months, I have discharged my duties to the best of my ability as DGP in the service of citizens of Haryana. Now the IB beckons and I wish to go back to GoI due to career & family requirements. I have made a request to the Haryana govt to permit me to go back,” Yadava tweeted. A hardcore IB officer, Yadava is of the 1988 IPS batch and had joined as the state police chief in February 2019 for two years. Yadava, who remained posted as additional director in the Intelligence Bureau for several years was among the three IPS officers recommended by a committee of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for appointment as the state police chief. The officer had returned to his parent cadre after a 15-year tenure with the IB. The state government in January 2021 extended his tenure till further orders since he has more than four years to retire. Vij vs Khattar over police chiefWhile state home minister Anil Vij stoked a controversy by asking the additional chief secretary, home, to send a panel of officers to the UPSC to be considered as replacement for the incumbent director general of police, the chief minister firmly backed Yadava’s extended tenure. Putting an end to the row over the tenure of the state police chief, Khattar had said there was no plan to replace him. “We are not removing him as DGP. After completion of two years, which is a minimum stipulation prescribed by the Supreme Court, the DGP has already been given an extension to continue till further orders. This means that Yadava can continue as head of police force till his retirement or when we decide to replace him. There is no decision to replace him. On the other hand, he (Yadava) may like to go for a central assignment as he has been empanelled for holding a DG rank post at the Centre. That’s for him to decide,” Khattar had said. Options before Haryana government Meanwhile, the state government has a couple of choices once Yadava’s repatriation is approved. “The state government can ask Yadava to continue as DGP till his successor is selected or they can appoint a caretaker DGP after taking the concurrence of the Supreme Court,” said an official. Officers in the reckoning The state government will send a proposal to the UPSC containing the names of the officers who are eligible for empanelment. As of now, 1988-batch officer PK Agrawal, 1989-batch officers Mohammad Akil and RC Mishra, and 1990-batch officers Shatrujeet Kapoor and Desh Raj Singh would make it to the list of IPS officers proposed for empanelment as DGP. The UPSC will select three names and send it back to the state government for selecting the next DGP. The UPSC while shortlisting three officers will take into consideration the length of service, the service record and range of experience for heading the police force while recommending the panel. The criterion was set by the Supreme Court. The apex court in its July 3, 2018 order had said that its directions regarding the appointment of DGP should be considered by the UPSC to mean “that persons are to be empanelled, as far as practicable, from among the people within the zone of consideration who have got clear two years of service. Merit and seniority should be given due weightage”. The apex court in March 2019 clarified that recommendation for appointment to the post of director general of police by the UPSC and preparation of panel should be purely on the basis of merit from officers who have a minimum residual tenure of six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-dgp-seeks-premature-repatriation-to-intelligence-bureau-101624353639525.html

Special Judge SC Jadhav on Monday granted bail to the accused on a bond of ₹25,000 and several other conditions, according to news agency PTI.The man's lawyer Sunil Pandey said that his client is suffering from the "Peter Pan Syndrome" or when grown men and women avoid the personal and professional responsibilities of adulthood. "The victim's family knew about their relationship. But, her family didn't like their relationship due to the boy's illness and poor background and also had a grudge against his family members," Pandey told the court, according to PTI.Pandey said the girl knew what she was doing and got into the relationship with his client voluntarily. However, special public prosecutor Veena Shelar opposed the plea and denied all the allegations made by the applicant. The prosecution contended that there is prima-facie sufficient material on record to show the involvement of the applicant in the commission of the offence.The prosecutor said that there is no material on record about the illness of the accused applicant and that if the accused is released on bail, he may tamper with the evidence in the case.However, the court granted bail to the accused after hearing the submissions, saying his detention will serve no purpose as the probe into the matter is completed and nothing has to be recovered from him.The court noted that the victim's statement "prima facie shows she herself left her parents' house and joined the company the accused". It also observed that the facts of the case indicate the girl had sufficient knowledge and capacity to know the full import of what she was doing and voluntarily joined the applicant.According to Health Line, an American website and provider of health information, some adults find emotional and financial responsibilities challenging well into adulthood. "Peter Pan Syndrome,” the current name for this pattern of behavior, was first used by Dr Dan Kiley in his 1983 book, “Peter Pan Syndrome: Men Who Have Never Grown Up.” "Peter Pan Syndrome" isn’t a recognised mental health condition by the World Health Organization and is not listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, experts agree this pattern of behavior can have an impact on someone’s relationships and quality of life, Health Line saysThe Peter Pan Syndrome is named after Peter Pan, the character in the play by Scottish novelist and playwright JM Barrie.

22-06-2021||Delhi||Reinventing old-world glamour||Vibrant, freewheeling, bohemian – patchwork lehengas are back in fashion! Also known as pieced work lehengas, the origin of patchwork lehengas can be traced back in history, especially in the Indian subcontinent. The rangdaar karigari, patchwork with a burst of colours, the chatta-pattithe or the eclectic mix match of different fabrics and borders has been a major heritage influence for years. Brides are once again acing patchwork lehengas with grace this wedding season. “The patchwork lehengas are as much a breath of fresh air and at the same time a nostalgic ode to the yesteryear’s fashion. With Indian bridal market saturated with tonal ensembles, these patchwork lehengas bring in the much needed flamboyance and definitely make the bride stand out,” says fashion designer Sanya Dhir of Diva’ni. Brides are on the lookout for newer, never seen before options with weddings becoming more personal. There is definitely a trend of looking back and celebrating our roots and dressing up in full bloom heritage glory. And this trend is here to stay. Patchwork lehengas do compliment this trend. Fashion designer Nidhi J Jain, says, “Patchwork and gota patti lehenga are apt for the quirky bride. Worn with traditional nose rings and matha patti, they revive old world glam.” Patch work has been a part of Indian tradition since ages. It can be a fearless dose of colours, so don’t set boundaries with patchwork. Fashion designer Karishma Deepa Sondhi, says, “Embroideries such as chikankari, phulkari, and Gujarat’s mirror work look stunning on the patches. Gota, kundan and zardozi patches also look eye-catching. Cholis of different colours and silhouettes can be teamed with patchwork lehengas.” Patchwork lehengas tend to have a unique individual character, sometimes with no two outfits being exactly the same. “These kinds of lehengas are more like beautiful collages and pieces of art. We adore brides who go for such creations. Over the years we have had capsule collections in which the ensembles have been made using various vintage fabrics as well as left over cuttings (katran). As a practice we save all cuttings from the production floor to be used as patches in future outfits. This is our way to reduce the impact on the environment and create recycled sustainable fashion,” says fashion designer Rimple Narula. If you wonder what jewellery suits patchwork lehengas best, here are a few suggestions. “Patchwork lehengas are maximalist designs, so the jewellery should match up to the look. Very minimalist jewellery might end up being lost with the overall look, whereas statement necklaces, earrings, mathapattis, pasas can definitely add to it. Opt for jadau, navratnas and heritage pieces to celebrate the grandeur that the patchwork lehengas bring along with them.” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/reinventing-old-world-glamour-101624345900649.html
22-06-2021||Delhi||Delightful delicious dips for the wholesome meal||There is something deeply satisfying and refreshing about seasonal foods. Nothing matches the aroma, flavours and colours of freshly picked seasonal produce. The wait to taste them is worth it in the end. If you love to gorge on cherries, watermelon, muskmelon, plum, litchi, java plum, khubani and other fruits, seasonal dips are for you. Prepared with seasonal fruits, veggies and herbs, they pair beautifully with a variety of snacks. “The perfect season for any dip to be savoured is when the fruit and veggie are in perfect ripeness. In the right season, the herbs and aromatics are also available at the same time,” says chef Suvir Saran. Seasonal dips are all about the excitement for a limited period ingredient. They bring refreshing and new flavours for the palate. Some of the dips that are worth a try are jamun piri piri, cherry orange sauce, litchi sambal, watermelon curry paste, khubani sage gel, smoked plum dip and much more. “Jamun chutney is prepared with the puree of fresh jamun blended with seasonings. This purple beauty is a great accompaniment to your meal. Watermelon rind chutney (tarbooj ke chilke ki chutney) is also very refreshing. Recently, I made watermelon flesh puree and served it with falafel and fritters,” says chef Reetu Uday Kugaji. Wondering how to go about the pairings? Watermelon rind dip can be served with hot momos, dosas and idlis. Alu Bukharay Ki Chutney can be drizzled on dahi bhalla, papri chaat or served with hot samosas. One can consume jamun ki chutney with methi ke pakore, pyaaz ke pakore or any kind of fritters. “Mango pineapple salsa prepared with mango, pineapple, fresh red chili, jalapeño, mint, and lemon pairs well with burgers, tacos, chips and sandwiches,” says culinary expert Sameer Uttam Singh. Dips can be preserved if made in the right way. “Dips are super versatile. They can be air dried and can be preserved as spices. And they do wonders when added to beverages. Dips should be stored at the right temperature (1-4 degree) for better shelf life,” says chef Nishant Choubey. And dips can be health, too. Being seasonal, they contain vital nutrients and minerals. Jamun is a miracle fruit for diabetic people. Plum is a great antioxidant, good for the bones and gives relief from constipation. “Depending on how much salt or sweetener has been used in the preparation, dips and chutneys can be the super heroes of the culinary world. They pack many good nutrients alongside good calories that are rich in fiber,” says Saran. So get creative, mix and match, grind to perfection and delight your guests with some delicious seasonal dips that’ll make snacking a lot more fun. Recipe Watermelon Dip Preparation Time: 5 min Serves: 4 Ingredients: Watermelon puree- 12 tbsp Red wine vinegar- 1 tbsp Extra Virgin Olive Oil- 3 tbsp Honey – 1 tbsp Lightly toasted and freshly ground black pepper corn- a pinch Sea Salt- to taste Method: Blend / whisk all the ingredients until well-combined. You may increase or decrease the seasoning as per your preference. Store in an airtight glass bottle/mason jar and refrigerate. Ensure that you shake the bottle thoroughly to mix the dip well.

But we are certain that those were not Covid vaccines,” said a police officer privy to the investigation.The officer said the main accused, Mahendra Singh, has destroyed his mobile phone and other evidence about what was administered in the name of vaccines. “We have just found the broken screen of Singh’s mobile. We are now looking for other evidence like the vaccination vials and bottles which were reported to be opened during one of the camps.” He added none of the 390 members of the society reported any side effects after getting the purported Covid shots.Also Read | Slow start to next phase, but uptick likely: Delhi officials“The civic body (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) has denied providing any vaccination to the arrested accused. We believe that if the bottles had the actual vaccine, it was procured by Manish Tripathi, who is the sixth accused and is still absconding.”Singh allegedly approached the managing body representing three buildings at a residential complex in Kandivli (West) and offered to set up a vaccination camp.On May 30, the 390 were administered the vaccines without getting registered on the centralised Co-win portal as per the rules. After seven to eight days, the residents started getting messages about their vaccination certificates. To their surprise, the certificates showed they were vaccinated at two private hospitals and the corporation-run NESCO Jumbo Centre (Goregaon) which does not hold vaccination camps for societies.The society members got suspicious about the camp after they got certificates from different hospitals rather than the one the vaccines were supposedly procured from and reported the matter to the police.Police have so far arrested five people including Singh and they are believed to have confessed to having organised such camps in nine other societies.They registered a third First Information Report on Monday in connection with the vaccination scam. On the basis of a complaint lodged by the firm, police have booked six people. Police said 206 employees of the firm and their family members were administered alleged fake vaccines by the six by charging them ₹2,84,696.

They also questioned why chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s pictures were put up instead, when it was the Centre providing the vaccines.BJP workers in Balasore, Rayagada, Koraput, Angul and Keonjhar districts tore up posters at various vaccination centres. In Balasore town, they forcibly cut the ribbon and inaugurated the vaccination drive at Gandhi Smruti Bhawan. They also argued with government officials at the centre and put up a stand-alone photograph of the PM at the site.Union minister and BJP leader Pratap Sarangi said, “When the Centre has been carrying out the world’s largest free vaccination drive, the state government is trying to politicise the programme by placing the chief minister’s photo at the vaccination centres. The state is trying to hijack welfare schemes sponsored by the Centre.” A local BJP leader in Rayagada alleged that the CM’s photo was also printed on the vaccination slips provided to the beneficiaries for the second dose. Ruling BJD MLA Debi Prasad Mishra asked whether the state has no role in organising the vaccination programme even if the Centre is sending the doses. “They want to create a controversy out of nothing for political mileage. Covid vaccine should not be dubbed as Modi vaccine, Nitish vaccine, Stalin vaccine, or Naveen vaccine,” he said.Meanwhile, on Monday, the state had set a target of vaccinating around 300,000 people, its highest single day target so far since January 16 when the inoculation drive started.

Negative wastage is when no vaccine vials are damaged, rather, the extra doses in each vial are utilised.“Due to efficient and effective management of Covid-19 vaccination, Odisha has maintained a negative wastage of 3%, which is one of the best in the country.

He was delivering the first Shaibal Gupta Memorial Lecture on the topic “under the thumb of history”, organised by the Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI) and the Centre for Economic Survey and Public Finance (CEPPF) A Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at the Massachussets Institute of Technology, Banerjee discussed the two leading views of history and political institutions – one, that institutions are mainly products of historical logic and, second, that accidents, leaders, and decisions have a significant impact. “Shaibal Gupta felt proud of talking about the long history of Bihar. I am also close to Shaibal’s interest. History and culture do have an impact and studies have also shown it. It is the institutional framework that persists such as the persistence of extractive institutions set-up during the colonial period and the impacts of zamindari systems even decades after its abolishment,” he added.

Mandated representation of women in PRIs has affected political decisions, short-medium term outcomes and impact. If you look back, a lot has been done, though a lot more needs to done,” he said, adding that beyond policies, even small accidents or natural calamities have long-term impacts. He concluded by saying that in the end, the choice facing the field of political economy is very simple. “It can embrace grand theories that will offer us the satisfaction of strong and simple answers. We need to be eclectic in choosing indicators in what the political constraints may be and make the best economic analysis and use the best data possible to improve the efficiency of government programs for the welfare of the people,” he added.

He asked district magistrates to arrange for the manpower needed to operate and maintain the oxygen plants.A total of 533 oxygen plants were sanctioned during the second Covid-19 wave, which was at its peak in April and May. However, of these, only 102 plants have been set up and made functional till now.The scarcity of medical oxygen during the second wave is reflected in a "mock drill" conducted by a hospital in Agra on April 26, which saw the hospital allegedly stopping its oxygen supply for five minutes, resulting in deaths of five patients. However, it was later given a clean chit by a probe committee.Also Read | Clean chit to Agra hospital :Probe on, says admn; parties gear up for protestOn Monday, Uttar Pradesh recorded 213 new Covid-19 cases, 478 fresh recoveries and 46 more deaths due to the viral disease, according to a bulletin issued by the state health department.

22-06-2021||Mumbai||Toddler son keeps waiting by the door for her return||Three-year-old Atharva is used to not seeing his mother during the day, but things become hard in the evening as the toddler waits for the doorbell to ring, and his mother Archana Shinde, who worked as a police constable in the local arms division of the Mumbai police, to walk in.The 26-year-old died of Covid-19 related complications on April 1.Shinde’s husband, Hemant, who is posted in a Maoist-affected district of Chhattisgarh as a jawan with the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), said that evenings get progressively worse as Atharva realises that his mother has not returned. By dinnertime, he is inconsolable.“Atharva is very young and does not understand that his mother is not coming back anymore. He still feels that she will return in the evening, and he waits by the door expecting her to ring the bell. At dinnertime, he goes looking for Archana around the house and cries when he does not find her,” said 28-year-old Hemant who will return to Bijapur once his leave gets over in June-end.“All this happened so suddenly. I feel bad for my son. No one can replace the love and affection that Archana gave our child. Not even I,” he said.Shinde, Hemant and Atharva lived in a single bedroom home with Hemant’s parents and older brother’s family in Kamothe, Navi Mumbai, a suburb to the north of Mumbai. It was a matter of great pride that between the two of them one served the country, the other the city. Even during the lockdown and in the midst of the raging pandemic, the couple continued to work.During the day, as Shinde travelled 35 km to the Armed Police Headquarters in Naigaon, Atharva was looked after by his grandparents.Mid-February, Shinde’s health suddenly deteriorated.She was admitted to a hospital in Navi Mumbai for a heart ailment. Hemant took leave and returned to Mumbai, but Shinde’s recovery was slow. She returned home almost a month later, but soon started showing symptoms of Covid-19 infection.“Soon after she returned home Archana tested positive for the virus. But things were so bad during the second wave of Covid-19 that the same hospital that she was discharged from did not have a bed for her. We rushed her to the MGM hospital in Kamothe [in Navi Mumbai], but after six days she breathed her last,” Hemant said.Shinde was the 100th police personnel from Mumbai force to succumb to the virus. A total of 120 personnel from the city police have died of Covid-19 so far.In all, Shinde spent close to 45 days under some form of medical care.The emergency depleted all of the young couple’s savings that was set aside for buying a home; now Hemant has a debt of around ₹13 lakh, borrowed from friends and relatives, to pay off. “My older brother is a cab driver and looks after our family. I don’t know how I will be able to repay these loans. We don’t even have any ancestral money. My father is a farmer and had a very small patch of land for farming.”All his hopes are pinned on government aid after former home minister Anil Deshmukh announced last year that the kin of police personnel who contracted the virus and died would be compensated.“In nearly 10 years of service, I have been involved in close encounters in Jammu and Kashmir and in Bijapur. But the dark future ahead for me and my son truly scares me,” Hemant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/toddler-son-keeps-waiting-by-the-door-for-her-return-101624314599914.html
22-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: An uncommon man||He’s one of our city’s most uncommon men. This afternoon, he is sitting on the pavement, giving the final touches to what seems to be a self-made chabuk, or whip.A dhaba owner describes him as a goat herder. This isn’t completely surprising because the neighbourhood, Hazrat Nizamuddin basti, is full of these animals. “He takes people’s goats to the (nearby) Panj Peeran graveyard, where they feed on wild grass and bushes.”There is no easy way to confirm this with the man himself. He can’t hear or speak, the locals say, and neither is he known to communicate by writing. But every Basti shopkeeper this reporter talked to asserts that this man is the most extraordinary figure in this 14th century urban village.Curiously, nobody seems to know his name. He is often seen on a lane teeming with beggars, though he always sits alone, and never asks for alms from passersby. He carries a red comb in his shirt pocket. The eatery owners give him meals and chai for free. At night, he sleeps on the street.A grocer conjectures that the man’s name might be tattooed on his arm. On being queried through a series of gestures, the man smiles and shakes his head, tapping his chin on to his right shoulder, implying that the tattoo—if it ever existed—was on his missing limb.Later investigations paint him as an artist—particularly skilled with tiles. Some of his works are immortalised in the area’s public spaces. The pedestrian roundabout outside the shrine of Hazrat Inayat Khan’s dargah is decorated with his tile arrangements. So are a few benches in a park, as well as the spaces in a municipality-run clinic and an anganwadi.At long last, during the course of these enquiries, an official with Aga Khan Trust for Culture, which has carried out many urban renewal projects in the basti, identifies the man as Ompal—“We got to work with him for a few years. He did some beautiful tile works for us. He prefers to work alone, and doesn’t like being supervised. He’s very moody but polite.”You may celebrate the artist by viewing his aforementioned works, or by meeting him in the basti. If he is not with the goats in the graveyard, he’ll be somewhere near poet Ghalib’s tomb. And usually standing out from the crowd, in his hat (though not on the day this photo was taken).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-an-uncommon-man-101624313646410.html
22-06-2021||Delhi||Slow start to next phase, but uptick likely: Officials||As the country switched to a new phase of vaccinations, with the Centre procuring and distributing shots for those aged between 18 and 45, several government-run centres in the Capital began walk-ins for the bracket on a trial basis on Monday.So far, only those aged above 45 were allowed to walk in and get a shot at any government vaccination centre after 3pm.“Half the vaccination slots for 18 to 45-year-olds at all government centres are to be reserved for walk-ins. Although we have started it at some centres, we are yet to get clear guidelines from the [Delhi] government. Once that arrives, we will start walk-ins across all centres,” said a senior district official who asked not to be named.Meanwhile, some vaccination centres in the city that only inoculated the older age group on Monday opened up their slots for all adults in the city.Among them was the central government-run Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. “The vaccination drive for the 18-45 group began today [Monday], but we are not allowing walk-ins for this age group yet. Vaccines that were already available at the hospital are being used,” said Smriti Tiwari, a spokesperson of the hospital.Also read | Fewest new Covid-19 cases in Delhi since April 30, 2020The central All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), however, continued to vaccinate only the elder age groups, as senior officials said the facility was awaiting doses.“It should start in a couple of days as soon as we receive supply,” said the senior official.Senior district officials also said they expect a sharp uptick in vaccination numbers in the city. “Doses will continue to be administered in two separate lots — for those under the age of 45 and those above —till state government supplies last. Once those run out, all vaccines available to the state will be available for all age groups,” said an east district official.The new vaccine drive by the Centre saw over 8.5 million people across the country receiving jabs on Monday.Currently, Delhi administers over 84,000 shots a day, nearly 67% of which is given to those aged below 45, shows Delhi government data.Meanwhile, several civil defence volunteers across different vaccination centres in Delhi including those in Trilokpuri, New Friends Colony, Tilak Nagar, Ashok Nagar, and Mayur Vihar also said they expected more jabs to be administered to young adults in the coming days.Narender Taank, nodal vaccination officer, Sarvodya Bal Vidyalay No.2 Tilak Nagar, said, “There is a lot of enthusiasm among younger people. While we have received some official directions regarding vaccinations in the 18+ category only today [Monday], people have been visiting the centre for the past week,” said Taank.A few Delhi government schools also started walk-in vaccinations for the younger age group on Monday.Gopal Singh, 47, a resident of New Ashok Nagar, had been struggling to get registered to get his 20-year-old daughter vaccinated. On Monday, the businessman visited the Government Boys Senior Secondary School in New Ashok Nagar for help.“I had to get my wife, daughter, and nephew vaccinated. Upon visiting the centre, the volunteers helped with the registration and we got our doses. The process was very smooth,” he said.Meanwhile, in a video briefing on Monday, Atishi, the Aam Aadmi Party’s Kalkaji MLA, said, “When the Centre promised that the free vaccination drive for all above the age of 18 would begin, we expected to receive a lot of vaccines on June 21. But, we have not received a single extra dose. What kind of vaccination programme is this?”(With inputs from Kainat Sarfaraz and Sadia Akhtar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/slow-start-to-next-phase-but-uptick-likely-officials-101624312478094.html
22-06-2021||Delhi||Winding queues become common outside metro stations across Delhi||Long queues outside Metro stations, especially during peak hours, have become a common sight ever since the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) resumed operations on June 7. The passenger load has almost doubled in the past fortnight, Metro officials said.While further relaxation in lockdown norms has come as a relief to people, it has only aggravated the problem for Metro users as queues are just getting longer.On Monday evening, commuters at Rajiv Chowk, Janpath, Barakhamba, Janakpuri West and other metro stations had to wait for nearly 30 minutes outside the stations.SB Jha, who works at a private firm, uploaded a video of the long queue at Janakpuri Metro station on Monday evening. “Public is troubled at Janakpuri West metro station…why not increase service of metro on this route (sic),” tweeted Jha along with the video.A senior DMRC official said, “We are operating on 50% of the seating capacity and no standing passengers are allowed. We have increased the frequency of trains. Trains are now available at 2 to 5 minutes intervals during peak hours. In case the waiting time is more than 20 minutes, we are informing people about it through social media.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/winding-queues-become-common-outside-metro-stations-across-delhi-101624312292668.html
22-06-2021||Kolkata||Centre begins action against ex-chief secy||The Centre has initiated disciplinary proceedings against former West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay, now an adviser to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, that could cost him his pensionary benefits if the charges against him are proven, people familiar with the matter said.The fresh show-cause notice – he has been given 30 days to respond – was issued on June 16, nearly a fortnight after the Union home ministry threatened to initiate action against him for missing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting in the aftermath of cyclone Yaas.In a memo issued to Bandyopadhyay, the Centre said that it proposed to hold major penalty proceedings against him under Rule 8 of All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) 1969 and Rule 6 of All India Services (Death-cum-Retirement benefits) Rules, 1958. According to the rules, the Centre, which has initiated major penalty proceedings against the 1984 batch IAS officer, can withhold “pension or gratuity, or both, either in full or in part, whether permanently or for a specified period”.The controversy erupted after the chief minister and Bandyopadhyay skipped a meeting held by the PM on May 28 to review the post-cyclonic situation. The same day, the Centre ordered Bandyopadhyay to report to North Block by May 31 for his next assignment. The CM requested the PM to withdraw the order but when the Centre reiterated its transfer order, Bandyopadhyay opted for retirement rather than avail the three-month extension granted to him. He was appointed the CM’s chief advisor on a three-year term.TMC leader Saugata Roy said, “The letter shows how inhuman the Modi government is. Alapan lost his brother and mother recently...The Centre cannot take any action against him under service conduct rules...He can always move the court...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/centre-begins-action-against-ex-chief-secy-101624309838323.html
22-06-2021||Chandigarh||SAD (Sanyukt) doesn’t rule out possibility of tie-up with AAP||Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) president Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa on Monday did not rule out the possibility of an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ahead of the 2022 Punjab assembly elections. “We will think about it (tie-up) when the right time comes. We can’t say anything now. One things is sure that we will never ally with the Congress, BJP or the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD),” said Dhindsa after paying obeisance at the Golden Temple along with party patron Ranjit Singh Brahmpura and other leaders. They left the Golden Temple minutes before AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the shrine. There were speculations about the two parties entering an alliance in the holy city on Monday. Earlier, they paid obeisance at the sanctum sanctorum and did an ardas (prayer) for the party at the Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of Sikhs. They also paid tributes to the farmers who lost their lives while protesting against three agriculture laws. “We were here to offer prayers for the farmers protesting against the Centre’s black laws, our party and the Sikh Panth,” said Dhindsa. The party, he said, was ready to contest the assembly polls from all 117 seats. “We are also ready to fight the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) elections, but the Centre and the state government seem to be complicit in letting the polls take place.”Lashing out at chief minister Amarinder Singh, Dhindsa said, “He took a pledge by holding Gutka Sahib in his hands to send those behind the sacrilege and the subsequent police firing incidents behind the bars. Nothing happened in four-and-a-half years.”He said their party’s main agenda was to implement the historic promises made by the Akali Dal as per the Anandpur Sahib resolution, including securing more powers for the states, giving Chandigarh and all Punjabi speaking areas to Punjab.SAD (Sanyukt) spokesperson Karnail Singh Peer Mohammad said, “Our alliance with AAP will definitely strengthen both the parties. Even people of Punjab want both the parties to fight the assembly polls jointly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sad-sanyukt-doesn-t-rule-out-possibility-of-tie-up-with-aap-101624305937489.html
22-06-2021||Chandigarh||Power demand up in Punjab, Haryana as paddy sowing picks pace||Sowing of paddy in Punjab and neighbouring Haryana has pushed the demand for power in the two states. The maximum demand in Punjab on Monday was recorded at 12,406 (megawatt) MW in the afternoon hours while it was 9,750 MW in Haryana. In Punjab, two units of the Rupnagar thermal plant and three units of the Lehra Mohabatt plant are generating power. Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) officials said the third unit of the Lehra Mohabatt plant could not be operated during the night as engineers agitating for their demands refused to do extra hours. The unit was started on Monday morning. In Rupnagar, shortage of staff is creating a hurdle in operating the additional units. The state has maximum gross generation of 5,150 MW. The government-run thermal units are generating over 1,000 MW and the private plants are generating over 2,800 MW. Besides this, solar units are supplying about 500 MW power during daytime while hydro generation is around 800 MW. In the middle of this, the state drew a maximum scheduled power of over 7150 MW from the northern grid.The private-owned both units of the Rajpura thermal plant, two units of the Talwandi Sabo plant, and one unit of the GVK Goindwal plant are generating power. Another unit of GVK was started in the afternoon. In Haryana, the power demand crossed 9,700 MW, an increase of more than 900 MW from Sunday’s maximum demand of 8,839 MW. On Monday, both thermal units at Yamunanagar and 2 units of the Panipat thermal plants were generating power. One unit of the 1,200 MW Khedar thermal plant is facing shutdown due to a major turbine problem and the other unit is shut on account of no demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/power-demand-up-in-punjab-haryana-as-paddy-sowing-picks-pace-101624305880988.html

22-06-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder in Delhi to talk to bosses as rift widens in Punjab Congress||As the rift in the ruling Congress in Punjab worsens after former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu’s latest outburst against chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, the party high command has stepped up its consultation efforts with the state leaders to put an end to the infighting.While Amarinder reached Delhi for a meeting with the three-member central committee set up to resolve the rift on Tuesday morning, former Congress president and Lok Sabha member Rahul Gandhi also started meetings with party MPs, ministers and MLAs from the state. Amarinder has been called by the panel comprising Rajya Sabha member Mallikarjun Kharge, former Delhi MP Jai Prakash Agarwal and general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat for further discussion to work out an acceptable formula. The revamp of the party’s organizational set-up will also figure in their talks. “The Congress president has sought additional information after the report was submitted,” one of the committee members said. This will be the panel’s second interaction with the two-time chief minister this month. The meeting was fixed before Sidhu, who was targeting him on social media, spoke out after remaining quiet for about two weeks. The CM may meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi but there is no confirmation so far. Rahul, who had spoken to several legislators for direct feedback earlier this month, has called more than a dozen ministers, MPs and MLAs for one-to-one meetings. They include cabinet ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Charanjit Singh Channi, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, Razia Sultana, BB Ashu, MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla and MLAs Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon, Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Sangat Singh Gilzian, Inderbir Singh Bolaria, Pargat Singh, Raj Kumar Verka and Kuljit Singh Nagra. Most of them have been critical of the chief minister in recent weeks. Amritsar MP Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Amritsar West MLA Raj Kumar Verka and two others reached the national capital and met Rahul. The remaining leaders, including Randhawa, Bajwa, Sarkaria, Dhillon and Gilzian, will meet him on Tuesday. Rahul is likely to have a one-to-one meeting with Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar thereafter. The squabble between Amarinder and Sidhu has left the party leaders worried about its impact on the party’s prospects next year’s state polls. After their meeting with Rahul, both Aujla and Verka said that Sidhu should not have spoken to media about party matters. “The tone and language of his remarks do not behove a senior leader like him. This affects the morale of party workers,” Aujla said. Rawat said no one should give statements or talk through the media on these issues when the high command is already seized of the matter. The dissenters have also started distancing themselves from the former minister. “This fight is not about individuals or positions anyone, but about key issues such as justice in sacrilege cases, action against drug cartels and cable and sand mafia and scrapping of power purchase agreements. This is our priority. We are not concerned with Capt versus Sidhu or what he (former minister) gets or does not get,” said two cabinet ministers who are slated to meet Rahul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-in-delhi-to-talk-to-bosses-as-rift-widens-in-punjab-congress-101624305878494.html
22-06-2021||Chandigarh||Six crests of ‘Himalayan monal’ recovered in Chamba, four held||The Dalhousie police in Chamba have recovered six plumes suspected to be that of threatened bird Himalayan monal and arrested four persons, including a woman. Dalhousie DSP Vishal Verma said a police team led by Constable Vipan Kumar had set up a naka at Lahru near Chowari town as a routine exercise on Sunday. “They stopped a car coming from Chamba side for checking. The occupants in the car were jittery after seeing the police which raised the suspicions of them being involved in some illegal act,” he added. Upon checking, the police found six plumes and some feathers in their possession.The accused have been identified as Hans Raj, Anil Kumar and Han Raj from Salooni area of the district while the woman Sajo Devi belongs to Kullu. He said the accused have been booked under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act and being quizzed to trace the source where they procured the plumes.Meanwhile, divisional forest officer Kamal Bharti said the plumes have been sent to forensic lab to ascertain to which bird they belong.The monal, which belongs to the pheasant family, is poached for its colourful plumes. It is the national bird of Nepal, where it is known as the ‘danphe’, and the state bird of Uttarakhand. It was also the state bird of Himachal Pradesh until 2007. Its colourful crest is used to decorate caps.Though hunting the monal (lophophorus impejanus) was banned in Himachal in 1982, there has been little check on its poaching and its plumes are smuggled in the market.Wearing a cap with a monal crest is a tradition in upper reaches of Himachal. Such caps are also gifted on auspicious occasions, especially marriages.The state forest department imposed a complete ban on wearing such caps this year.Offence would be punishable with seven year imprisonment or ₹10,000 fine or both.Though the bird is one of the least concerned species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s list of endangered species, the monal is under threat in this part of the Himalayas due to large-scale poaching.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-crests-of-himalayan-monal-recovered-in-chamba-four-held-101624305278549.html

22-06-2021||Chandigarh||Capt vs Sidhu: Poster war erupts in Patiala amid Cong infighting||The ongoing squabbling in the Punjab Congress has turned into a poster war in Patiala and other Punjab cities, with supporters of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and party MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu trying to outdo each other by projecting their leaders as taller than the other. Patiala, the hometown of both Amarinder and Sidhu, is dotted with posters and hoardings projecting the CM as the “tallest Congress leader” in Punjab, while the supporters of the MLA projected him as “next generation leader”. The posters hailing the CM titled as ‘Punjab da ik hi Captain’ with hashtag ‘Captain for 2022’. They project Amarinder as the Congress’ face for the 2022 assembly polls. Similar posters are put up in Ludhiana, Amritsar and other major cities saying, ‘There is only one Captain” or “Our slogan Captain again’.On the other hand, the supporters of the cricketer-turned-politician projected Sidhu as Amarinder’s replacement in the Punjab Congress. ‘Saara Punjab Sidhu de naal (entire Punjab stands with Sidhu) read posters put up across the Patiala assembly segment, which is represented by the CM. They further read “Kisan di awaaz. Punjab mangda hai Guru di beadbi da hisab (Sidhu is the voice of farmers and Punjab demands answers for the sacrilege incidents). Some posters read “Punjab Da Captain Sidhu, 2022 da hovega Sidhu sirtaaj and Fateh kar ke banawange sarkar”. Such posters have been put up in the Amritsar (East) constituency where banners of “Sidhu Missing’ had surfaced earlier. Sidhu, who represents the Amritsar (East) segment in the state assembly, is camping at his ancestral home in Patiala since January. Due to Sidhu’s repeated outbursts against him, the CM has accused the former local bodies minister of hobnobbing with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and challenged him to contest from the Patiala assembly seat. Even Amarinder’s wife and MP Preneet Kaur had advised the Sidhu couple to concentrate on the welfare of people of their constituency in Amritsar in Covid-19 time.“The posters put up by Sidhu’s supporters indicate that he has decided to take the CM head on. Otherwise, no leader would dare to challenge Amarinder by putting up posters in Patiala,” said a local Congress leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-vs-sidhu-poster-war-erupts-in-patiala-amid-cong-infighting-101624305158962.html
22-06-2021||Lucknow||On second Uttar Pradesh visit in 20 days, top BJP man meets RSS leaders||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, who is on his second visit to Uttar Pradesh in 20 days, spent considerable time meeting Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) leaders at the Sangh office in Lucknow’s Nirala Nagar on Monday.The development came amid the buzz that the meeting was on collecting feedback from the Sangh about addressing “internal strife” in the ruling party, barely nine months before the assembly elections. The party’s national vice president and UP in-charge Radha Mohan Singh, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal (all core committee members) accompanied Santhosh during this crucial closed-door meeting.Later, Santosh also visited chief minister Yogi Adityanath for another round of confabulations that stretched till late in the evening. The BJP, party leaders said on condition of anonymity, is now planning a series of high-profile joining of leaders from other parties. For instance, former Congress leader Jitin Prasada recently joined the party in Delhi. He has since arrived in UP amid the buzz that he would be given an important assignment, ostensibly to keep the nearly 10 per cent Brahmin voters in UP happy.Four nominations for the state’s legislative council are opening up in July. Jitin Prasada could be among the party’s pick though a final decision on whether to make him an MLC or capitalise on his appeal in the Shahjahanpur-Lakhimpur Kheri belt by making him contest the 2022 UP assembly polls from there hasn’t been made yet. After falling behind the Samajwadi Party (SP) in the first leg of the three-tier rural polls, the party now also wants to make an impression in the zila panchayat chairpersons’ elections scheduled on July 3. The BJP is expecting a straight contest from the SP. The BJP frontline leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief JP Nadda, are expected to begin touring the state from July onwards and these high-profile visits too were subject of discussion, party leaders said. Before going into the meeting with Adityanath, BL Santhosh again tweeted in the chief minister’s praise, basing it on a tweet by the party’s UP unit that said due to Yogi’s leadership, Samsung moved its display manufacturing unit from China to Noida. “Congratulations CM @myogiadityanath and (industry minister) @satishmahanaup,” Santhosh tweeted. This was his third tweet in praise of Adityanath over the last 20 days, indicating that the party would back him to lead the party in the assembly polls. Before arriving here, BL Santhosh, a senior RSS leader currently essaying a crucial role in the BJP, had been part of a meeting featuring top party leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in New Delhi. Days before Santhosh’s second visit, both the government and the party began addressing some long-pending issues, an exercise understood to have been undertaken on the key BJP leader’s nudge. The government, after seeking details of vacancies in state corporations and boards, has only just accommodated Dalit and backward cadres after revamping the State SC/ST Commission as well as the State Commission for Backward Classes. The process is expected to continue with more cadres likely to be placated in the election year, BJP leaders said.The party’s state unit also made long-pending announcements, naming leaders to head party’s various wings, revamping its IT, social media and media panels, appointing two state-level functionaries. The moves included the much talked about appointment of former IAS officer-turned-BJP MLC AK Sharma, who has worked with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as vice-president of the UP BJP.Sharma belongs to Mau in the Purvanchal belt of east UP.Before Sharma’s appointment, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh was summoned to Delhi for a quick consultation with party chief JP Nadda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/on-second-up-visit-in-20-days-top-bjp-man-meets-rss-leaders-101624305097549.html
22-06-2021||Chandigarh||AAP’s CM face in Punjab will be a Sikh: Kejriwal||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said their chief ministerial candidate for the assembly elections in Punjab to be held early next year will be from the Sikh community and a resident of the state.On the sidelines of the induction of former inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh at Circuit House in Amritsar, Kejriwal said, “Punjab is fed up of its current political leadership and is looking for a new brand of politics. Discussions are underway within the party to choose the CM candidate. Punjab is the only state which gets a Sikh CM. I feel that this is a right of the Sikhs which should be upheld.”On Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu raising a banner of revolt against the Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh, the AAP leader said, “Sidhu sahib is a senior Congress leader. I respect him very much. We should not indulge in loose talk about such a leader.”About the speculations of his meeting with Sidhu, Kejriwal said, “When something happens, you will be informed first of all.”‘Ex-IG struggled to get justice for people’Accompanied by AAP Punjab president Bhagwant Mann, state affairs in-charge Jarnail Singh, co-incharge Raghav Chadha, leader of opposition in Punjab assembly Harpal Singh Cheema and all party MLAs from the state, the Delhi CM welcomed Kunwar Vijay Pratap into the party.“He was a dedicated police officer who struggled to get justice for the people of Punjab in the Bargari sacrilege case. The entire Punjab is watching how the masterminds of sacrilege and the police firing incidents are roaming freely. When he was unable to do anything within the system, he resigned. It is not easy task,” said Kejriwal.Once voted to power in the state, the AAP government will put the Bargari sacrilege culprits behind the bars and justice will be given to the people.“People of Punjab are tired of the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and now want change. They had given chance to all the parties, but nothing changed as they were only after power and indulged in corruption,” he said.Kunwar Vijay said, “If Guru Granth Sahib could not get justice in Punjab, then we can imagine condition of the common man. Only a political revolution can bring change in the society.”Mann said, “People hoped after Kunwar Vijay’s appointment as SIT head, the sacrilege culprits would definitely be punished. But that didn’t happen as the ruling party is working to save the guilty.”Later, Kejriwal along with the party leaders paid obeisance at the Golden Temple and Durgiana Temple in the city. Earlier, he was shown black flags by SAD workers when he was on the way from the Sri Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport to Circuit House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aaps-cm-face-in-punjab-will-be-a-sikh-kejriwal-101624305041402.html

He added that the future of the 962 guest faculty assistant professors, who have been working on paltry salaries for years, seems to be bleak.While demanding a better future for these teachers under the ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar’ programme of the government, he shared that many of these professors have already crossed the eligibility age for new government job recruitment and some of them are even nearing their retirement age. Earlier, the full salary of these professors used to be paid out of the Parent-Teacher Association fund collected from the students. A few years back, the government started paying 50% of the amount in the form of grant-in-aid. He further added that the PTA fund in most government colleges is already exhausted due to which the guest faculty staff have not got their salaries for months.Jaswinder Singh, general secretary, Ludhiana, along with other representatives, urged the chief minister and finance minister to pay their salaries from the government treasury.They said that paying the whole salary from the treasury won’t put any major economic burden on the budget. By doing this, not only will the guest faculty professors and their families will be able to make ends meet, but the students will also be relieved from the burden of contributing to the PTA fund. The association also demanded that their jobs be saved on priority during the new recruitment drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/guest-faculty-in-ludhiana-colleges-for-more-benefits-101624304916981.html

The PSPCL chief must hold a meeting with us to resolve our issues otherwise we will continue our protest. In the past year, businessmen have already faced huge losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic and now these heavy penalties will force many of them to shut down their units.”The protests will be held at the Janta Nagar sub-division on June 28, at Estate sub-division on July 5, Focal Point sub-division on July 12, Model Town sub-division on July 19, CMC sub-division on July 26, City West sub-division on August 2, Aggar Nagar sub-division on August 9, Sundar Nagar subdivision on August 16 and City Centre sub-division on August 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-bizmen-to-hold-protests-outside-9-sub-division-offices-of-pspcl-101624304618120.html

The matter came to fore when a passenger was found travelling in the Shaheed Express without a ticket.

In the web series, charge of the genocide is being levelled against a Sikh character which is highly condemnable and fabricated.”Kaur said the legal notice sent by ’84 riots witness Bibi Nirpreet Kaur to Ajay G Rai, producer of the web series, and Sunil Ryan, head and president of Disney+Hotstar, is also supported by the SGPC.She said, “Through this web series, work is being done to sprinkle salt on the wounds of Sikhs and hurt their sentiments. Such films also affect communal harmony in society. Therefore, the government should enact strict information technology (IT) rules to curb such sensitive and objectionable trends.”She demanded inclusion of Sikh representatives in the censor board so that controversial scenes related to their faith could be removed in any film.Kaur warned Grahan producer and Disney+Hotstar head of legal action if any objectionable material is released.She strongly condemned the construction of a replica model of Golden Temple in a park near Punjabi Bagh in Delhi.‘Twitter must stop hate-filled posts against Sikhs’ The SGPC president said that about two months ago on April 7, 2021, the SGPC had written a letter to Twitter chief executive officer Jack Dorsey about the hate-filled tweets against Sikhs in India and abroad. But the SGPC has neither received any response from Twitter nor any action.“The threats to repeat the 1984 riots on social media platforms are common which spoil the atmosphere and create resentment in the minds of Sikhs. But no action was ever taken against those who spread hatred against the Sikhs. Such hate propaganda has increased by many folds after the farm agitation was launched against three agriculture legislations passed last year and many Sikh organisations including the SGPC supported the same”, she said.“We all know about this certain lobby and how it works in an organised and vicious way. There has never been any legal action against those indulging in hate-filled propaganda against Sikhs and the utterly communal and anti-Sikh elements multiplied their efforts after the farm agitation,” said Kaur.She added, “Now, under the new IT rules, Twitter has lost its legal shield in India. We can lodge a police complaint against the platform for allowing hate-filled messages against Sikhs. But we do not want to single out Twitter as other social media platforms are also not doing anything to remove the hate content against Sikhs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ban-grahan-web-series-on-1984-riots-demands-sgpc-101624304443620.html

It administered jabs to 93,224 beneficiaries.As many as 14,956 shots were given in Ludhiana district, followed by 12,969 in Jalandhar and 10,260 in Hoshiarpur. Mansa (535), Fazilka (986) and Sri Muktsar Sahib (1,171) were among the districts where the drive got a poor response despite ample availability.The data procured from CoWIN website revealed that neighbouring Haryana administered over 4.7 lakh jabs on the day whereas Himachal inoculated 98,000 people and Uttrakhand over one lakh.According to senior government officials involved in the drive, the state has enough stock of vaccines (3 lakh at present), but there was low response on the first day because they are carrying out targeted vaccination of a few categories in the initial days.Punjab would get 7 lakh more jabs in the coming days from the allotted quota of 14 lakh as per the plans sent by the Centre to the states.Principal health secretary Hussan Lal said the lukewarm response could be because at present the strategy of the department is to first give jabs to traders, shopkeepers, hotel industry staff, teachers, and other such categories that could be immediately affected by the unlocking process.“The pace of vaccination is expected to rise in the next couple of days,” he said.Till now, Punjab has crossed its one-lakh-jabs-a-day target only once on May 26 when 1,00,654 vaccines were administered.The state has vaccinated 55,17,168 people out of which 8,66,907 have received two doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-starts-slow-on-day-1-of-free-vax-drive-administers-93-224-jabs-101624304442660.html

But the bail application was withdrawn after the court of chief judicial magistrate had sought a report from the jail superintendent regarding the number of cases pending against the accused. Later, Pardeep and Nishan moved bail applications separately. As Sukhjinder, Shakti, Baljit, and Ranjit are already named as accused in three other sacrilege-related cases, they have not moved fresh bail applications.Vinod Monga, counsel for the dera followers, argued that the SIT has failed to produce any evidence against Nishan and Pardeep so far. “They should be released on bail as they are innocent,” he added.

He could have supported AAP for any other reason but by joining the party on the issues of sacrilege and police firing he is also doing politics like others. We have nothing to do with any politician, we just want justice. I am feeling deceived and broken today,” he rued.“The chargesheets filed in Kotkapura firing case by the SIT led by the former IG were quashed by the high court with specific comments on his political motives, which he has proven right by joining AAP,” he said.Gurjeet’s father Sadhu Singh said, “I have never expected justice from politicians for my son. Former IG has joined AAP. I am pained that everyone is playing politics on this. Now only God will do justice.”On April 9, the HC bench of justice Rajbir Sehrawat had quashed the Kunwar-led SIT’s chargesheets filed in Kotkapura firing case questioning the impartiality of the former IG. The court also directed the state government to reconstitute a new SIT without him. Upset over the HC verdict, Kunwar opted for voluntary retirement which was accepted on April 15.“Seeing this conduct of Kunwar, one may say that he is indulging in political theatrics to fulfil his own purpose of creating greener political pastures for himself post-retirement so as to enter the political field as several officers have done after demitting office,” the court had stated in the order.The newly constituted SIT led by ADGP LK Yadav is investigating the Kotkapura firing case now and the probe team will question former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal on Tuesday at his MLA flat in Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-firing-victims-kin-sad-over-ex-ig-s-move-to-politics-101624304437557.html

The national target is 33%.Citing a recent case where over 1,000 trees were chopped off on the Faridkot sugar mill premises, Jaskirat Singh from Naroa Punjab Manch said that people have realised the value of oxygen amid the pandemic. But, despite that, a large number of trees are being chopped off in different parts of the state either in the name of development or just to sell timber.“There is no bigger crime than chopping off trees as we are putting our lives at stake. There are laws to stop it in forest areas, but no proper set of rules have been floated to save greenery in non-forest areas,” Singh said.Gurpreet Singh Chandbaja, convener of Naroa Punjab Manch and founder of Bhai Ghanayia Cancer Roko Sewa Society, said that many doctors, lawyers, engineers, businessmen etc are supporting this movement.“We are also trying to rope in environmentalists like Balbir Singh Seechewal and Baba Sewa Singh from Khadoor Sahib, so that this can become a mass public movement. We will also approach political parties, heads of religious organisations etc and try to involve as many residents as possible. Petitions have also been filed with the National Green Tribunal (NGT).

22-06-2021||Chandigarh||Yoga gets stamp of approval from Ludhiana’s postal department||With coronavirus pandemic putting a crimp in people’s fitness regimes, the postal department on Monday encouraged people to take up yoga to stay in shape while confined to their homes through a unique cancellation stamp. The inked stamp, which shows a yoga pose, was used on around 10,000 articles, including ordinary mail, registered post and speed post, at the postal department’s head office on Ferozepur Road to commemorate the International Day of Yoga. For the last week, the Ludhiana postal department has been using a rubber stamp promoting yoga, which reads ‘Be with yoga, be at home’ on all articles booked for delivery. They had also been playing a video of different yoga postures and their benefits at the office to encourage customers to adopt the ancient Indian practice, which has made its mark globally, on an LED device installed at the entrance of the office. A hoarding advertising the same was also installed. Ludhiana city division superintendent of post offices Kulwant Singh said, “Around 400 employees of the Ludhiana city division participated in virtual yoga sessions. All Covid protocols were followed.”The move was a hit among customers. A customer, Prabjot Singh, said, “While at the post office to dispatch a speed post, I was hooked to a video on yoga as I waited for my turn in the queue. The clerk handling the counter also informed me that the envelope will be stamped with a pictorial cancellation stamp encouraging people to practice yoga at home. It is an impressive initiative.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/yoga-gets-stamp-of-approval-from-ludhiana-s-postal-department-101624304259146.html
22-06-2021||Lucknow||Party will contest UP polls under Yogi’s leadership, says new state BJP vice-president AK Sharma||In yet another endorsement of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, the party’s new state BJP vice-president AK Sharma has said the party will go into next year’s state assembly polls with Yogi Adityanath at the helm of affairs. In his letter to UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, he has also said that the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to be as high as in 2013-2014, when the BJP had unseated the decade old Congress-led UPA government at the Centre after sweeping UP.“In my view, people of UP love Modiji just as much as they did in 2013-14 and this great leader’s name and patronage is enough to win elections,” Sharma said in the missive. The letter is significant as some of Yogi Adityanath’s ministers have been sending out conflicting signals. The state’s labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya, for instance, had visited the UP BJP office on Monday. Later, while admitting that the party would go into the 2022 UP polls under Adityanath’s leadership, he added that after elections the party high command would decide on who would be party’s face in the state.The BJP leaders quickly explained that the minister was merely reiterating a standard protocol of parties choosing their leader after elections in a meeting of newly elected lawmakers who often act on the wishes of the party’s high command.Sharma’s letter was aimed at quelling any further doubts on the subject, party leaders said. “In the 2022 UP polls to be held under your and chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s stewardship, the BJP would win even more seats than before,” Sharma said in his missive, the timing of which is now being seen as yet another attempt to put speculation to rest about friction over leadership issues. The letter was sent on Sunday on the eve of BJP general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh’s arrival but shared by the new UP BJP functionary on Monday, soon after a crucial meeting between BJP and RSS leaders and shortly before Santhosh and other leaders of the core committee entered into a meeting with Adityanath. A former IAS officer-turned-BJP MLC, Sharma’s role in UP has been a subject of intense speculation. Although the buzz about him being made a minister in the Yogi Adityanath government appeared to have subsided after his sudden appointment as one of the 17 vice presidents of UP BJP, the spotlight continued to be on him. Through most of Monday, media cameras were busy searching for Sharma at the state BJP office and though the former bureaucrat wasn’t seen, his letter made news. Recalling his roots in the backward Mau’s Kanjha Khurd village and early studies in Mau, Ballia and Prayagraj and his association with PM Modi from 2001 to 2021, he said he had watched Modi’s glorious rise on the global stage from up close and said PM’s popularity remained undiminished. He also said he would do whatever was in his hands to help the party.“He was recently in Delhi meeting Nishad Party chief Sanjay Nishad who has since firmed up his alliance with the BJP. He also met a Brahmin body in Delhi,” a party leader said.Sharma has adopted a community health centre in Ranipur and a primary health centre in Suggichauri, both in his home district of Mau. The step was in keeping with the party’s direction to all ministers, lawmakers and party functionaries to adopt health centres in the state. He has also undertaken the work of revamping the bus station at Mau which is in a dilapidated state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/party-will-contest-up-assembly-polls-under-yogi-s-leadership-says-newly-appointed-state-bjp-vice-president-ak-sharma-101624304199678.html

As part of a reconciliatation exercise, deaths that took place at hospitals (mostly private) earlier but could not be added to the toll are now being uploaded to the tally of various districts in UP, said officials.Sample this: No fresh death took place in Lucknow on Monday, but the backlog deaths kept the figure at 12. So far, Lucknow has reported 2,569 deaths since the outbreak of the pandemic. A similar exercise is being undertaken in Agra and Prayagraj. The backlog entries will take another week as death audit is in progress, said a senior health department official. “Several deaths that took place at different hospitals are now being added after the death audit. The process will take a few days,” said Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar, chief medical officer, Lucknow. Majority of the backlog deaths are those that happened soon after the patient was admitted and before any test or proper examination of symptoms could be done. These fatalities, if found to be due to Covid in the death audit, are being added to the state data, said officials. As per the data released by the district medical and health officials in Prayagraj, there were no Covid related deaths in the district between June 14 and 20, 2021. However, as per the state-level data released from Lucknow, 15 deaths were entered in the database for Prayagraj during this week, including a maximum 11 deaths on June 20, one death each on June 19 and 17, besides another two deaths on June 14, said officials. Dr AK Tiwari, Covid nodal officer in Prayagraj, said he had no idea regarding the deaths shown in the state-level data chart released from Lucknow during the past week, but confirmed that no deaths took place in Prayagraj between June 14 and 20. “It is possible that these are deaths of people belonging to Prayagraj who died in other districts earlier and details of which had not been entered into the database by those districts as part of reconciliation process. However, I do not have any exact information regarding this,” he added. In Agra, the death toll due to Covid now stands at 451. In the beginning of June, there was sharp increase in the toll as the backlog of death figures, primarily in April, was added. “We have already updated the list with backlog deaths as and when information came in the first half of June. We are at the end of the process as only random cases remain to be listed now. Only four to five deaths have taken place in the last fortnight,” stated Dr RC Pandey, chief medical officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/backlog-effect-covid-death-toll-rises-in-three-up-districts-101624303837058.html

With the state government announcing relaxations in the Covid Curfew guidelines, night curfew will now be effective from 9pm to 7am.Though only a few people turned up at malls, they welcomed the move, saying “it’s like heading back to normal.” “We are here just to get the feel of being alive and make small purchases. It’s been nearly two months since we last visited a mall,” said Nitin Gupta, a college-goer. Swati Bajpai, another visitor to a mall in Gomti Nagar, said: “One cannot imagine life without malls. I am glad that these establishments have re-opened. I request people to follow strict Covid protocols in order to minimise the risk of getting infected.” “As we are re-opening after a long time, we are busy re-stocking things and making arrangements. On the first day, we witnessed lower footfall. But, we expect it to increase in days to come,” said an official with the mall. District magistrate Abhishek Prakash also inspected the mall to ensure that Covid protocols were being followed. “It was found that Covid protocols were followed. The Covid help desk was in place, the place was sanitised and social distancing was being followed,” said the DM. He also directed the mall management not to give entry to people without mask and to maintain the details of the visitors. In the lockdown last year, malls remained closed for around 75 days following Covid-19 outbreak. Similarly, restaurants too resumed services at 50% capacity. “It’s a big relief to us as we suffered huge losses in the last two months,” said a restaurateur. The day also brought relief to the traders as the district administration allowed relaxations in night curfew. Initially, the Covid Curfew was from 7pm to 6am whereas now the shops are allowed to open till 9pm. “It is a big relief to us. People generally have a tendency to shop during the evening hours. There was very little business earlier due to the Covid curfew starting at 7pm. Now, as there is a two-hour relaxation in the night curfew, people have a longer time to shop,” said Suresh Chablani, convener of Akhil Bharatiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal, Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lucknows-malls-restaurants-re-open-to-limited-crowds-101624303538677.html
22-06-2021||Chandigarh||2 cases of women missing with kids send Ludhiana cops into tizzy||Four women have gone missing with their kids in the last 35 days, sending cops into a tizzy. While two cases have been cracked, the unresolved cases are being probed on priority as it is suspected that they may have fallen prey to human trafficking. Initially, the cops thought the women had left with their children because of family issues, but the human trafficking wing of the police was roped in after they could not be traced. The open cases include that of a 30-year-old woman who had gone missing with her two daughters and son on May 12. The victim, Zeenat, 30, of Shreen Enclave, Jassiyan, had gone to drop her children aged 13, 11 and 9 to a tuition centre but none of them returned. A case had been registered at the Haibowal police station on the complaint of her husband, who suspected that his family had been kidnapped, after searching for them for three days.Station house officer Neeraj Chaudhary said it was learnt that the there was some problem in the family. However, the woman had not gone to any of her relatives’ place and nobody could account for her whereabouts. The second case involves a 32-year-old woman Pooja and her seven-year-old son Manish, who had gone missing on June 8 from Machhiwara Road, Kohara. Police suspect that the woman had eloped with one of her tenants. ASI Dilbagh Singh said, “Though the woman had left home willingly, but we are trying to trace her to make sure she and her child haven fallen afoul to a human trafficking gang.” 27 missing persons cases in 38 days In a worrisome trend, 27 missing persons cases have been registered in the last 38 days. Around 3,000 people have gone missing in the district in the last 10 years.  A police official, who did not wish to be named, said, “While every missing person case is sensitive, in cases involving women and children there remains a possibility that they could have fallen in the clutches of a human-trafficking gang. These gangs force vulnerable women and kids into the flesh trade or make them work in houses and factories as bonded labour. Thus, the police takes these cases very seriously.” Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said, “We have launched a mobile phone application ‘Gumshuda’ to trace missing children and persons. We have initiated a ‘reunion drive’ in the city to find the missing children.” Cases cracked In one of the cases, where a 27-year-old woman and her seven-year-old daughter had disappeared on May 28, the duo were found at the woman’s first husband’s house. She had solemnised her second marriage without legally divorcing her first husband and wanted to reunite with him. In another case, a 32-year-old woman who had gone missing with her seven-year-old son on May 1 retuned on her own accord. She said she had left home, following some family issues. The FIR had been cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2-cases-of-women-missing-with-kids-send-ludhiana-cops-into-tizzy-101624303357396.html

The train has 1,140 seats. Meanwhile, in the afternoon Chandigarh-New Delhi Shatabdi Express, only 172 of the 750 seats were occupied.“Being a Monday, there were more passengers in the morning as usual. As the service has just resumed, the afternoon and evening trains will also see high occupancy in the coming days,” said JP Singh, Chandigarh railway station superintendent. The trains had been suspended due to low occupancy during the second wave of Covid-19. Now, the trains are allowed to move with full occupancy, though wearing of masks is mandatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/all-shatabdi-trains-resume-between-chandigarh-and-delhi-101624303298091.html
22-06-2021||Lucknow||AISA claims FYUP ‘anti-student’, demands immediate rollback||All India Students Association (AISA) opposed Lucknow University’s implementation of the exclusionary New Education Policy alleging that it is anti-student. Lucknow University has planned to implement the four-year undergraduate programme (FYUP) for all the undergraduate courses.“The New Education Policy-2020 has been rejected by the student community as it has proved to be anti-student and anti-academic, said Shivendra Tripathi, LU unit convenor, All India Students Association (AISA).“The infrastructure of Lucknow University is already in shambles. A news report of July 2020 states that six out of 43 departments in the century-old university are operating with a single or no faculty. One-third of the total teaching posts out of 517 are vacant,” claims AISA activist.“At present, at varsity, the teacher-student ratio is 1:39/1:60 at UG and PG level against the 1:20 laid down by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Contrary to this, the university has no proper plan to deal with the current crisis of infrastructure and the introduction of FYUP will worsen the already existing crisis,” he said.The vice-chancellor’s interview of boasting the FYUP as the idea to open the minds of the students by exposing them to a wide range of subjects through classroom teaching, projects and practical, vocational training, co-curricular activities and internship seem impractical, illusionary and just as one more ‘Jumla’ to the aspiring student community, they said.The four-year undergraduate programme is not student-oriented but anti-student as it adds a financial burden on students coming from economically weaker sections of society. Multiple entry/exit in higher education essentially means that only students with good financial condition will be able to complete their FYUP whereas the poorer students will have to settle for a diploma, AISA activist claimed.“The much-touted multiple entry/exit programme celebrated as a paradigm shift by NEP is nothing but a promotion of graded inequality. Multiple entries and exit point will create confusion and discrimination,” he said.“It will create further social division and discrimination in society. Thus the proposed four-year undergraduate programme systematically and legitimately forces students from marginalized communities to exit the system, allowing the most privileged students to continue to have a perfect monopoly over all its resources. The current FYUP of the NEP is a disaster, and as we have seen in the past, the students and teacher community of Delhi University have resisted and rejected FYUP and compelled the DU administration to revoke the flawed FYUP,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/aisa-claims-fyup-anti-student-demands-immediate-rollback-101624303296936.html
22-06-2021||Lucknow||Amid buzz over two Apna Dals’ patch-up, Krishna Patel says no one spoke to her about it||There is a buzz about the possibility of the Apna Dal (Sonelal) reuniting with Apna Dal before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, people familiar with the matter said.While Mirzapur MP Anupriya Patel heads the Apna Dal (S), her mother Krishna Patel is president of the Apna Dal.Former Union minister Anupriya has demanded an MLC seat for Krishna Patel and she is said to have conveyed her message to the BJP leadership, a senior leader of Apna Dal (S) said.Apna Dal (S) is an ally of the ruling BJP at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh.Asked about the speculated reunification bid, Apna Dal president Krishna Patel said, “No one spoke to me in this regard. This is baseless.” When asked what her stand will be if Apna Dal (S) appeals her to come together, she refused to comment on it but then added, “Time is big, not the person.” On the other hand, a senior leader of Apna Dal (S) said, “If Krishna Patel comes to the Apna Dal (S) fold and is made MLC, it will send a positive message that the entire party and the family are united. The move will leave no chance for the rival parties to create confusion among the public that there is a rift in the family.”The move will benefit all the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) candidates during the assembly elections, the leader said, adding that if Apna Dal (S) and Apna Dal united, they would be in a very strong position on 125 assembly seats in UP. These include 40 seats in eastern UP districts and Varanasi is among them.Apna Dal (S) national spokesperson Rajesh Patel said, “Krishna Patelji is the wife of our mentor and party founder Dr Sonelal Patelji and the mother of our national president Anupriya Patelji. Our entire party respects her a lot. Therefore, if Mataji decides to come with our leader, then the whole party will welcome her step in a grand manner.”On the other hand, Apna Dal state unit president Rajvan Singh Patel said, “Apna Dal led by party president Krishna Patel is strong, while there is only a perception that Anupriya’s party is strong.”“Anupriya didn’t speak to our party president in this regard,” he claimed.The core constituency of the Apna Dal (S) comprises the Kurmi or Patel voters who account for over 9% of electors in UP. The community plays a decisive role in 126 assembly constituencies, according to an Apna Dal leader.The Kurmi community accounts for over 15% of the votes in over 50 assembly constituencies, the leader added.Anupriya Patel was expelled from the Apna Dal in 2015. She formed the Apna Dal (S) in 2017. She was elected MP from Mirzapur in 2019 as Apna Dal (S) candidate. In 2014, she was elected from the same seat on the Apna Dal ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/amid-buzz-over-two-apna-dals-patch-up-krishna-patel-says-no-one-spoke-to-her-about-it-101624303237432.html
22-06-2021||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Highly transmittable Delta strain found in 61% PGIMER samples||The highly transmittable mutant of coronavirus, Delta strain, was found highly active during the second wave of the pandemic in Chandigarh, as it was detected in 61% of the samples sent by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) for genome sequencing.To study the change in the circulating strain and to check the prevalence of mutant strains in Chandigarh residents during the second wave, the PGIMER had sent 25 stored samples of Covid-19 patients for genome sequencing to the central government’s epidemiology unit — National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), New Delhi. Genome sequencing attempts to draw out the complete genetics of the viruses.The samples were of patients who were tested positive from May 5 to 24 — a period that saw the second wave peaking in Chandigarh with 12,758 cases and 191 deaths. The 25 samples were selected randomly and included those of a few critical patients, two children, and five patients who had already died. As many as 23 were of Chandigarh residents.The genome sequencing results received on Sunday revealed that 61% of them were positive for the Delta strain and 30% for the UK or Alpha strain. However, the UK strain was found in samples of 80% of the deceased patients (four out of five). Meanwhile, no case of the Delta plus variant has been reported in Chandigarh so far.“In two samples, sequencing could not be performed due to low content of genomic material. The Delta strain, which is highly transmittable, was the main circulating strain in Chandigarh residents,” said professor Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER.The B.1.617.2, known as Delta variant, is the sub-lineage of a double mutant of coronavirus (B.1.617), which was first detected in India earlier this year. WHO has categorised it as a variant of concern and said that it can significantly increase the transmissibility of viruses. The Delta plus variant is its mutated version.The UK or Alpha variant (also known as B.1.1.7) was first detected in Britain, and has spread to more than 50 countries with more than 2 lakh cases identified. It is believed to be 70% more transmittable and dangerous than Covid-19.Earlier in May, 39% of the 23 samples sent by the PGIMER were found positive for the UK strain while double mutant (B.1.617) was confirmed in 22% samples. The institute will send 50 more samples for genome sequencing this week. “These will include samples of severely ill patients and also of those who have died due to the infection,” said virologist Mini P Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid19highly-transmittable-delta-strain-found-in-61-pgimer-samples-101624303177740.html

Following the state government sanctioning an amount of ₹9.87 crore, a multi-level parking facility is all set to get constructed at the district courts now, inform officials.Uttar Pradesh Project Corporation Limited (UPPCL) has been assigned the task of executing this project. This parking will be constructed on the land where the earlier office of the district judge was located, they added.“Now that the government has entrusted UPPCL with the task of constructing this parking facility and even the land has been finalised, we would soon start the construction work,” said project manager UPPCL, RK Singh.The design is being finalized, he added.The government had sanctioned the first instalment of over ₹1.97 crore in February 2021. Out of this, an amount of over ₹78.12 lakh was also released while the remaining around ₹1.19 crore was released on June 17.Following the release of the amount, now the work for this much-needed facility would speed up. Once the parking is built, the commuters going from Mumfordganj towards Vikas Bhawan and Civil Lines will not have to face unnecessary traffic jams. Moreover, the pressure of traffic at Stanley road would also ease out. Presently, Mumfordganj and New Katra residents are forced to use Stanley road because the road in front of the district collectorate witnesses traffic jam, officials shared.The facility will be coming at a place which faces the problem of regular traffic jam and if the vehicle somehow manages to move, it is always at an extremely slow pace owing to the haphazardly parked vehicles, officials said.The situation stays the same on all the working days of the district court, as this area houses several important administrative offices of the district administration.Besides the district court, the area has the office of the district magistrate, officials of the district administration, Vikas Bhawan, the SSP office, chambers of the lawyers of the district court, etc. Be it lawyers or their clients or, for that matter, people coming for their work at any of the offices of the district administration, the road caters to thousands of commuters daily.In the given scenario, the demand for a dedicated multilevel parking facility was raised by several organisations from time to time.Accepting the demand, a project for a three-level parking facility has been sanctioned by the state government. The upcoming parking would have a basement and two floors above it. The government has approved a budget of ₹9.87 crore for the construction of this multi-level parking, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-now-rs-9-87-crore-multi-level-parking-facility-to-come-up-near-district-court-101624303061970.html

According to the India meteorological department (IMD), the monsoon system has become subdued in the region and is expected to stay this way for another week at least. Overall, the rain has been above normal this month, with 116.8mm recorded till June 21 as compared to the 73.6mm normal (average of the past 30 years from June 1-21). Even monsoon is 59% surplus in the city so far (the season comprises June, July, August and September, according to the IMD). However, with no rain expected in the coming days, this surplus is set to drop as the normal date of monsoon onset (June 26) is approaching fast.“The significant weather conditions and low pressure areas that had sped up the system have dissipated now,” said IMD scientist Shivinder Singh. “Westerly winds are blowing right now, which have subdued the monsoon system in this region. Easterly winds are required to blow for the monsoon system to get active again, which seems unlikely in the coming days.”According to the IMD models, the forecast wind patterns are not favourable for the advancement of monsoon into the rest of Punjab and Haryana as of now. Some rain can be expected close to the normal period for monsoon declaration towards June end, said Singh.Meanwhile, the temperature and humidity are expected to stay high during the week. “Maximum temperature is likely to cross 40°C and no relief can be expected from the high humidity,” said Singh. “Due to these conditions, localised drizzles can be expected, but their intensity will not be like the monsoon showers.”On Monday, the city’s maximum temperature went up from Sunday’s 35.6°C to 36°C, a notch below normal. Minimum temperature went up from 25.6°C to 26.4°C, a degree above normal. In the next three days, the mercury is expected to oscillate between 26°C and 38°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/monsoon-subdued-rain-unlikely-in-chandigarh-this-week-101624303059724.html

The drones own weight should be in accordance with the standards set by directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA).“The study on drones transporting the vaccines, conducted in association with the ICMR, has been done. The ICMR has been informed about the parameters finalised for this. Transportation of vaccines could begin if these parameters are followed,” said an IIT-K spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/soon-drones-could-be-used-to-transport-vaccines-to-challenging-places-101624302757845.html
22-06-2021||Lucknow||Yogi takes a re-look into BJP 2017 manifesto promises, wants to keep them all||Months before he completes his first term as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath wants expeditious implementation of the promises made in the BJP’s manifesto for 2017 UP assembly elections.Yogi reviewed the progress of implementation of the promises made in the Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra-2017 at a high-level meeting here on Monday.As major opposition parties continue to mount attacks on the BJP government ahead of 2022 UP assembly elections, saying most of the poll promises remain only on paper, Yogi plans to come out with details about the progress made in this regard.“Yes, chief minister reviewed the promises made in the Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra-2017. We will come out with details soon. About 99 percent of the promises made in Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra-2017 have been already fulfilled,” said an official spokesman.The BJP’s Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra-2017 incorporated vision for the new government and had about 150 promises. A copy of the Sankalp Patra poll manifesto was circulated to senior officers heading different departments and an exercise to identify different promises to different departments was made soon after installation of Yogi led BJP government in Uttar Pradesh.“About 150 promises made in the Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra were concerned with the government departments. Most of the promises assigned for implementation to different departments have been fulfilled. Some departments have, however, not updated their information on government portal. The departments have been now asked to update the information on the portal to enable constant monitoring as chief minister wants 100 percent implementation,” said a senior officer.Farm loan waiver was one of the major promises made in the Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra-2017.An announcement on the issue was made at the first meeting of state cabinet that chief minister presided over here on April 4, 2017.The state government announced waiver of crop loan of up to ₹1 lakh of the state’s small and marginal farmers. About 92.5 percent of state’s farmers fall in small and marginal category, it claimed.Other major promises made therein included setting up of anti-land mafia task force in every district, payment of dues to sugarcane growers in 14 days, 24x7 power supply to every household, development of UP as a ‘food processing state’, setting up of food processing park in state’s six regions, administrative reforms to check corruption, judicial reforms, setting up of 10 international level universities, free Wi-Fi in all colleges and universities etc.Major opposition parties, however, have consistently blamed the BJP government for not keeping the poll promises. “The BJP government has wasted 4.5 years of the state. It has not fulfilled the promises made in 2017 assembly elections. Most of the promises have remained on paper. As the elections 2022 assembly elections are coming close, the BJP government is making attempts to mislead the people on the issue. If the government claims of fulfilling the promises made to the people it should come out with the details and truth will come out automatically,” said Samajwadi Party spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary.The BJP has strongly countered the opposition’s accusations. “A lot has been done in every sphere in Uttar Pradesh. There has been an improvement on the fronts of power supply and infrastructure development etc. The opposition should see that the number of women in the police stations has gone up. The opposition should know the truth instead of criticizing the government,” said Vijay Pathak, vice president, BJP Uttar Pradesh.“We can’t say anything about implementation of poll promises until the government comes out with details on the issue. Any claims and counter claims may be a matter of perception. UP’s economic growth rate, however, has come down in the past four years,” said AK Singh, former director, Giri Institute of Development Studies, Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-takes-a-re-look-into-bjp-2017-manifesto-promises-wants-to-keep-them-all-101624302521811.html

It claimed that the tribal students who studied in the ashram school will be deprived of education due to this action.The centre teaches around 40 children. The centre said that the corporation demolished a portion of the school in the midst of monsoon without giving it an alternate location. Due to this, water seeps into the ground floor structure and this would make it difficult for the students to attend school.Priyesh Sable, director, MCDWW, said, “We have been running this school for more than two decades. With the increase in the number of students at the ashram school, we decided to include another floor. We approached the TMC with a request letter and, on its assurance, initiated construction work for the additional floor. However, due to the lockdown, our paperwork was not completed. When we asked TMC, the officials told us to continue with the construction during the weekends. We did the same but the officials turned up at the school amidst heavy rains last week and pulled down the under-construction portion.”The ashram school was for tribal children and those from backward classes. Some preferred staying within the premises itself as their houses were far away. “Due to the recent lockdown imposed and the heavy rains, the students had gone to their respective homes. If they come back, we do not have a proper space for them to sit and impart education,” added Sable.The ashram school was for students between three years and eight years, and had computer systems and provisions to stay as well.“As a part of the protocol to demolish illegal structures or encroachments, this demolition act was taken by the ward officials. No officer can give oral assurance to any resident prior to the completion of the paperwork and other requirements. We shall look into the matter. However, the concerned structure was demolished as it had not got permissions,” said a senior TMC officer on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/education-centre-at-thane-razed-tribal-students-to-face-hassles-101624302516888.html

Those arrested are Gurdeep Singh of Shimlapuri, Kulwinder Kumar of Jalandhar, Hardeep Singh of Hoshiarpur, Vijay Kumar of Una (Himachal Pradesh), Satnam Singh of Jalandhar and Himanshu Heer of Basti Jodhewal. Two unlicenced pistols, ammunition, sharp-edged weapons, vehicles used to commit the robbery and ₹36,000 were seized from them. Joint commissioner of police (JCP, rural) Sachin Gupta said, “The gang has carried out a series of robberies and snatchings across Punjab. Kulwinder had purchased the two pistols for ₹11,000 and ₹9,000 from Uttar Pradesh. They were planning another robbery under the overbridge when they were arrested.” Before committing the robbery, Gurdeep had carried out a reconnaissance of the petrol pump and relayed the information to Kulwinder, who came to Ludhiana with Hardeep and Vijay on their scooters. They had assembled at Gurdeep’s house and hatched the plan. A day before the robbery, Gurdeep had taken all his accomplices to the filling station, Gupta said. On June 11, the bike-borne accused turned up at the filling station posing as customers and overpowered the staff.The accused had met in Hoshiarpur Jail where they were serving time for different crimes. After getting bail, they carried out a spree of robberies and snatchings, the JCP said. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 2) Jaskiranjit Singh Teja said the accused have confessed to carrying out 10 snatchings and robberies in the last year.All of them are history-sheeters and have multiple cases already registered against them.

The local police have now written to the forest department, seeking measures to stop people from entering the lake. According to the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) officials, the two youth who drowned on Monday have been identified as Tejas Chorge and Dhruv Kule, both aged 17. Officials said that the duo had been to the lake along with their friends Himanshu Wagh, Soham Karandikar, Deep Mhatre, Aryan Kalgutkar and Atharva Avate in the morning. The group entered the lake for a swim, and at 10.05am, Chorge and Kule were caught by the current and drowned. Their friends immediately raised an alarm, after which authorities from Vartak Nagar police station as well as TMC, regional disaster management cell (RDMC), Thane disaster response force and the Wagle Estate unit of Thane Fire Brigade rushed to the spot and undertook a search and rescue operation in the lake. “Chorge’s body was found in the lake around 12.45pm, while at 6.30pm, Kule’s was recovered,” a civic official said. The police have registered an accidental death report. On Sunday, two persons – Prasad Pavaskar, 16, and Juber Sayyed 20 – had drowned in the lake. The police said despite repeated efforts, picnickers continue to enter the lake – which is forbidden. “The picnickers enter the dense forest area – which makes it difficult for the authorities to track them – and then enter the lake. So providing timely help becomes difficult as the spot is far off and not easily reachable. On Monday, we wrote to the forest department, asking them to put up signboards warning visitors against entering the forest and the lake,” inspector Santosh Ghatekar, Vartak Nagar police station said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-more-revellers-drown-in-thane-s-yeoor-lake-101624302336887.html

He said the deceased was part of a gold escort gang from Palakkad, and they reportedly came to Kozhikode international airport to receive smuggled gold from Dubai in the early hours of Monday. But the customs authorities seized 2.50 kg of gold, concealed in a coffee-making machine and arrested the carrier Mohammad Shafeek. The police officer said another team members from Kannur, who were experts in looting the smuggled gold, chased the Palakkad team under the impression that they were carrying the gold. Both these gangs were unaware that the carrier got arrested, and a chase ensued. One of the vehicles involved in the chase met with an accident, and all occupants killed on the spot. Police said gold was supposed to be delivered to one Charal Faizal, another history-sheeter involved in many smuggling cases. “We have identified one of the vehicles involved in the race and detained six persons. We are looking for another vehicle. Statements of the detained are incoherent, and customs also sought details,” said the senior officer. Among four international airports in the state, Kozhikode is the hub for gold smuggling activities. On Sunday, customs authorities had seized gold worth ₹3.5 crores and Monday, gold worth ₹2.50 crore impounded. Among south Indian states, Kerala topped in gold smuggling -- 600 kgs seized last year. “High demand perks up smuggling activities. It is a highly lucrative business. One kg of smuggled gold saves at least ₹5 to 7 lakh in duties. Usually, 10 per cent is given to carriers and ground handlers get another 10 per cent. Rest is profit,” a jewellery owner, who did not want to identify, said, adding, in Kerala, at least 40 per cent of the current gold in the market is smuggled. After busting a major gang last year, in which many kingpins were deported from Gulf countries. There is no let-up in gold smuggling, lamented customs officials. After the seizure of 30 kg, gold from one of the consignments came to the UAE consulate in the state capital last year. Customs and the directorate of revenue intelligence arrested more than 30 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-killed-in-kerala-police-investigate-victims-past-101624302277814.html
22-06-2021||Other||Maharashtra govt scared of probe into Vaze’s reinstatement, transfers of police: CBI||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has contended that the issues pertaining to the reinstatement of assistant police inspector (API) Sachin Vaze and the report of former state intelligence commissioner Rashmi Shukla, which are included in its first information report (FIR) are relevant and in line with the directions of the April 5 Bombay high court (HC) order. CBI was arguing against the petition filed by the Maharashtra government for the removal of two unnumbered paragraphs from the FIR filed by the central agency on April 21 against ex-home minister Anil Deshmukh in corruption allegations. CBI also said that the state was scared of the investigation initiated by the Central agency over Vaze’s reinstatement and the issue of undue political influence during appointments and transfer of police officers raised by Shukla and hence filed the petition. “This is an issue of corruption and on this issue, observation of this court would be relevant to find out the purpose and intent of HC order and what were the submissions,” argued additional solicitor general Anil Singh on behalf of CBI. He further added CBI referred to the paragraphs of the HC order which stated that the issues of corruption, as pointed out by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, against Deshmukh were serious and the allegations needed to be investigated thoroughly. CBI submitted that the HC order, while ordering the preliminary inquiry, also implied investigation into Vaze’s appointment and Deshmukh’s influence in getting him reinstated, and hence, the two issues were included in the FIR. CBI concluded its arguments on Monday stating that in the light of the above submissions, the state was in contempt of the Supreme Court (SC) and HC order by refusing CBI access to the documents pertaining to Vaze’s reinstatement and the allegations made by Shukla. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar, while hearing the petition filed by the state, was informed by its counsel, senior advocate Rafiq Dada, that the constitutional court which ordered the preliminary probe on April 5 had not looked into the issue of Vaze’s reinstatement or the issue of transfer or postings, though it was raised in the other public interest litigation (PIL) that were filed along with of Singh’s. The court had observed in its order that the issue of transfer or postings was to be dealt by another forum, and hence, the state was justified in seeking removal of parts of the FIR filed by CBI. Dada reiterated that the April 5 order was only pertaining to advocate Jaishri Patil’s complaint to Malabar Hill police, but as the CBI was seeking beyond what was mandated by the court, the state had no option but to approach HC. However, Singh submitted that there was a need to understand the purpose and intent of the HC order. The issues relating to why Vaze was reinstated after 15 years, why he was given special posting and why he was in contact with the home minister needed investigation. He added that CBI sought to investigate the issues because while dealing with the issue of corruption the two could not be segregated as they were part of the order. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who took over the arguments for CBI, submitted that the petition by the state was intended to dilute the mandate issued by a coordinate bench in PIL which was also upheld by SC. Mehta submitted that the state did not want the CBI to investigate two questions: how Sachin Vaze was reinstated after 15 years and if there was undue influence over posting of officers. He stressed that as Vaze’s name was all over the petitions filed by Singh and Patil, the HC order had to be read in that context, and Vaze’s reinstatement had to be investigated. Mehta added that the state had filed a special leave petition in the Apex court against the April 5 order of HC, but it was turned down, and hence, the state was now seeking removal of the two paragraphs from the FIR only. In light of this, Mehta submitted that the state was in contempt of SC and HC’s directions and concluded arguments for CBI. Dada sought to dispute the concluding remarks of CBI which was allowed by the bench. The state will respond on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-govt-scared-of-probe-into-vaze-s-reinstatement-transfers-of-police-cbi-101624302276994.html

She and Bhosale’s son Amit had been questioned by ED officials earlier in the same case. ED officials on Monday said that the seized assets are equivalent to the foreign securities/properties held by the Bhosales in contravention of Fema. The seized assets are in the form of equity shares and preference shares held in a firm which owns three five-star hotels in Pune, Nagpur and Goa. Further, equity shares held in ABIL (Avinash Bhosale Infrastructure Private Limited) and ₹1.15 crore in various bank accounts held by the family have also been seized. The Central anti-money laundering agency’s investigation against the Bhosales began in September 2017 after ED had received reliable inputs that the family have acquired an immovable property in Dubai in contravention of Fema. ED’s further probe revealed that the Bhosales acquired foreign securities of a Dubai company, which held the property (around ₹40.34 crore). To acquire the property, the Bhosales remitted the funds through the liberalised remittance scheme in their bank accounts held outside India. The funds were remitted in different categories: to purchase equity shares in the Dubai-based firm, family maintenances, savings received from an NRI for family maintenance etc. However, the remitted funds were utilised to purchase the immovable property and the shares of the company were allotted against the remitted funds. “It was declared that the company is engaged in real estate business activity. However, investigation revealed that it did not have any business activity and did not generate any income whatsoever,” ED stated.Bhosale is also facing a Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in connection to a Pune land. In this case, ED officials had conducted raids at Bhosale’s offices and residence in Pune as well as few other places, in February.Bhosale was previously fined ₹1.83 crore by ED for alleged Fema contravention in the year 2015. The builder was fined on three counts: for opening a bank account abroad without the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) permission, maintaining the bank account even after returning to India and using its international credit card abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ed-seizes-40-34-crore-assets-of-pune-bizman-avinash-bhosale-101624302158114.html

Mane was arrested by NIA on April 23, and on May 13, he was remanded in judicial custody. He has been lodged in Taloja prison since then.Four days after arresting Shelar and Jadhav, NIA had moved an application seeking Mane’s custody again for questioning him with the duo. Special judge Prashant Sitre on Monday allowed the plea. The judge extended Shelar and Jadhav’s NIA custody also on the same grounds.On February 25, a Mahindra Scorpio was found abandoned near Antilia with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note addressed to the Ambanis. A case was registered at Gamdevi police station following the recovery of the SUV.Vaze was originally in charge of the investigation but removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who had reported the SUV stolen on February 17.On March 5, Hiran was found dead in a creek near Mumbra, with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth.

The first post-mortem was conducted in Kolkata. On Friday, the Supreme Court had remanded back a plea from his father, Bhupinder Singh, a retired police inspector, for conducting the second autopsy of Bhullar. The father had sought that Bhullar’s autopsy be conducted again, to the know the exact details and nature of the injuries caused to him. The high court had dismissed the plea, against which he had moved the apex court. The father claims that Bhullar was killed in a fake encounter. According to him, this was substantiated from the injuries that were noticed on his son’s body. During the hearing on Monday, the bench of justice Avneesh Jhingan asked the petitioner’s counsel whether the injuries visible on the body find mention in the post-mortem report conduced in Kolkata. The lawyer, however, said that the report was not with him and the father was informed by the doctors that the cause of death was fire-arm injury. The Punjab government, on the other hand, said that the state police was not involved in any alleged encounter and all the action was of the West Bengal authorities. The court noted that the previous post-mortem report was not on record and that there was no substantial ground to order a second autopsy; it was also observed that the West Bengal police have not been made party to the plea. The court stated that it was ignoring the technicalities in view of the fact that body had been lying at the petitioner’s place for nine days and directed the PGIMER to constitute a board and conduct a second post-mortem expeditiously. As the PGIMER counsel said that it would be carried on Tuesday morning, the court disposed of the matter and directed that the post-mortem report be given to Punjab police as well as the petitioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-nod-to-second-post-mortem-of-gangster-bhullar-at-pgimer-101624301738870.html
22-06-2021||Bangalore||Despite warning from Congress, leaders indulge in war of words over CM face||Bengaluru Despite warnings from the high command on not to give statements or projections on Congress’s next chief ministerial candidate, at least two Congress legislators--Zameer Ahmed Khan and Raghavendra Hitnal--on Monday said that the entire state wants Siddaramaiah to become the next chief minister, widening the growing cracks within the party.Amid the growing crisis, DK Shivakumar, the president of the state unit, on Monday met Randeep Singh Surjewala, the general secretary in-charge of Karnataka in Delhi. Soon after, Surjewala issued a statement warning any legislator from projecting the chief ministerial candidate in the state. “I have noted with concern that certain individuals in the Congress party have recently become prone to issuing statements about leadership in the state or leadership postCongress Government formation. I take this opportunity to forewarn them to avoid such comments completely. Central Congress leadership & MLA’s will decide the issue at an appropriate time,” Surjewala said in a statement on MondayThe widening rift between Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah has added to the challenges of the of the principal opposition in Karnataka who have continue to fight among themselves and are yet to capitalise on the growing dissent within the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government headed by BS Yediyurappa. Repeated statements by the likes of Khan have irked Shivakumar, who also is also an aspirant for the top job in the state. “The chief minister’s post is not empty nor is there an election for it,” Shivakumar said on Monday. He reiterated his earlier statement that there would be no “personality worship but only party worship”, taking a dig at Siddaramaiah and his followers like Khan. With likes of Khan rallying behind Siddaramaiah, Shivakumar too found support in senior Congress leader and former state party president G Parameshwara. “I want to tell our leaders that first we have to bring our party to power,” Parameshwara said on Monday. He added that when it comes to the party, Shivakumar as president is supreme. Legislators and other leaders in the Congress have tried to identify with either camp, giving rise to more infighting within the party.“I have said that it was my opinion and the people of the state want Siddaramaiah to be CM,” Khan said on Monday. “Why Should DK Shivakumar have a problem when it is the state’s people who want this,” he added. Khan, who has identified with Siddaramaiah’s camp, further said that the people of the state did not want Shivakumar. Siddaramaiah, who continues to consolidate his position within the Congress, on Monday said that he never made such a statement to this effect. “I never said I will become chief minister. It is their personal opinion, made out of admiration,” Siddaramaiah said, defending the likes of Khan. Denying any factionalism within the Congress, he added that this was their personal opinion and not that of the party. The BJP took a dig at the Congress party president and the recent developments surrounding the chief minsiterial candidate issue.In a Twitter post in Kannada, the state unit of the BJP said, “Talking about internal issues of the BJP, @DkShivakumar is silent on the leadership struggle within his own party. @Siddaramaiah is pushing that he is the next CM through his followers but a weak president is unable to do anything,”The BJP added that the statements that there will be only party worship and not personality worship shows that it does not have the courage and unable to take action against Khan who has been proposing Siddaramaiah’s name. The growing friction within the Congress is rapidly denting its chances to capitalise on the discord within the BJP government and its legislators, many of whom have openly asked to replace 78-year-old Yediyurappa. Despite warning from BJP national general secretary in-charge of Karnataka, Arun Singh, several BJP legislators continue to strategize against Yediyurappa, people aware of the developments said. The BJP has tried to quell the dissent but a cloud of uncertainty looms over Yediyurappa and his remaining two year tenure as the chief minister. Yediyurappa has remained firm that he will continue in his post for the remainder of the two years, but the resistance to this possibility has been growing within the party legislators who have levelled serious charges of corruption and dynasty politics against the chief minister and his family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/despite-warning-from-congress-leaders-indulge-in-war-of-words-over-cm-face-101624301737511.html
22-06-2021||Mumbai||Following Maharashtra CM’s appeal, Maratha outfits put agitation on hold||In response to the appeal by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray last week, Maratha outfits have put their ongoing silent protest on hold for four weeks. The decision was taken, expressing satisfaction over the steps taken by the state government in relation to the six major demands put forth by the Maratha outfits.After beginning the fresh phase of the silent protest on Thursday in Kolhapur, the state government invited Maratha outfits led by Rajya Sabha MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati for discussion over their demands on Friday. A group of ministers led by CM Thackeray admitted to comply with their demands in a time-bound manner and appealed to call off the protest till then. The Maratha outfits and their conveners held a deliberation over the course of action on Monday at Nashik and decided to put the protest on hold.“The government has been complying with our demands and has asked for 21 days. The steps taken by the government are satisfactory, and their compliance is on the right path. After deliberation among the outfits under Maratha Kranti Morcha, we have decided to give the government time four weeks. The agitation has not been called off and will never end, but has been put on hold. We will continue without meetings in various parts of the state,” said Sambhajiraje.Maratha outfits had started state-wide meetings and protests under the leadership of the MP after the Supreme Court on May 5 quashed 12% and 13% quota given to Marathas in education and jobs under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018. The outfits had announced to hold agitations in all 36 districts demanding restoration of the reservation. The demands included review petition in the SC against its order, revival of SARTHI institute formed to ensure educational and social well-being of the Maratha youth, hostel for the community youth in every district, financial allocation of ₹1000 crore Annasaheb Patil Backward Financial Development Corporation which finances Maratha youth for entrepreneurial ventures among others.“The state is filing a review petition on Thursday. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar held a meeting on Saturday for revival of SARTHI and assured sizable allocation. The appointment of 2185 eligible candidates is expected to be completed over next couple of weeks. Similarly, compliance on other demands is on track. Keeping this in mind, we have decided to put the protest on hold, so even we will get time to coordinate with the government. Some of our convenors were not ready to stop the protest, but they were convinced by others,” said Virendra Pawar, one of the conveners of Maratha Kranti Morcha.Before the meeting, the outfits held a protest at Maratha Vidyaprasarak Mandal premises in Nashik. Local MLAs, MPs and ministers, former ministers attended it. Food and civil supplies minister and OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal said they are not against reservation to Marathas. “Both Marathas and OBCs are in crisis after the recent court orders. The protests by OBCs are not against Maratha community, but a few people are trying create such picture, which is unfortunate,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/following-maharashtra-cm-s-appeal-maratha-outfits-put-agitation-on-hold-101624301736847.html
22-06-2021||Bangalore||With high Covid-19 positivity rate, curbs remain in Mysuru||Even as restrictions in most districts in Karnataka including Bengaluru were further relaxed from Monday, Mysuru, which has a Test Positivity Rate (TPR) higher than 10%, however, continues to be under lockdown.On Monday, Mysuru reported 546 new Covid-19 cases taking the active infections in the district to 6,892. The district also reported 22 Covid related deaths, which is the second highest in the state. The district has reported 2,035 deaths so far.According to the city administration, the numbers in the districts have come down over the last month, but not as fast as the rest of the state. Experts and health officials give multiple reasons to explain the peculiar situation in the district.A senior health department official said that the government has pulled up the district administration from the problems in testing and containment in the district. From testing around 6,000 people every day during April, the number of average tests conducted came down to 4,000 tests in May. “Throughout the state testing was ramped up, while in Mysuru it was lacking. This has been taken up with the concerned officials and now the testing has increased,” the official said.Talking about the tracing and tracking in the state, a newly appointed official in the district, who didn’t want to be named said that the tracing strategy in Mysuru needs to be revamped. “We are tracing less than 4 primary contacts as of last week. The healthcare workers are facing problems because people are not sharing details with them, but we are not ramping up the process. We want to increase tracing to up to 8-10 contacts and ensuring containment zones are created,” he added.As several violations were reported among those patients isolating themselves at home, the district admiration is mulling over shifting patients to Covid care centres.While the government has pulled Mysuru administration for its failure in the testing, tracing and containment, district administration claims the presence of a new mutant could be the reason for the higher caseload in the state.In its attempt to understand the situation in samples collected from Covid-19 patients has been sent for genome sequencing in Nimhans in Bengaluru. While the authorities expect that this will throw some light into whether any particular variant is resulting in the higher caseload in the state.According to a senior district health department official, there is a strong suspicion that the Delta variant is behind the spread in the state. The number of cases where the family members are getting infected soon after a person from the family testing positive is looked at as a sign of the possibility of the variant causing the problems.“We can’t be certain about this. Only after the results from the labs are available, we can say which variant is causing the problem. At the same, the medical professionals in Mysuru have been pointing at symptoms like an increase in Covid cases among non-diabetic patients, which could be a cause for concern,” the official added.While Mysuru is struggling to keep its number under control, on Monday, the Karnataka government relaxed the norms in six more districts. As per the order, in these districts, hotels and restaurants are allowed to open with 50% capacity and shops to stay open till 5 pm, among other relaxations.“After considering the weekly moving average positivity rate of districts as of June 26 and also taking into account consistent declining trend of the case positivity rate in certain districts, hereby includes places Udupi, Bengaluru Rural, Shivamogga, Ballari, Chitradurga and Vijayapura districts under Category I districts. Consequently, all additional activities permitted for Category I districts until 5 am 05-07-2021 will be applicable for the aforementioned districts also,” read a government order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/with-high-positivity-rate-curbs-remain-in-mysuru-101624301676872.html

The vaccine remains our strongest weapon to fight COVID-19. Congratulations to those who got vaccinated and kudos to all the front-line warriors working hard to ensure so many citizens got the vaccine. Well done India!,” Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India said in a post on Twitter. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa also took on to Twitter to laud the feat. “India clocked a record of over 8 million inoculations and Karnataka’s Lasika Maha Abhiyana accomplished over 1million jabs today. Big applause to all our frontline workers who ensured this success. Let us work together to make India and Karnataka free from Covid-19,” he wrote.The nation-wide vaccination drive comes on the same day when the BS Yediyurappa government eased Covid-19 pandemic-induced restrictions across most districts, including Bengaluru, after almost six weeks of lockdown-like curbs in the state.Sudhakar added that Bengaluru Urban district administered 41,999 doses while Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike administered 1,72,713 doses till 9.30 pm on Monday which was the highest in the country.The combined total of Bengaluru Urban and BBMP rose to 2,14,709 doses of vaccines administered, which the state government said was the “highest in the country”.According to the Karnataka health department there were 696,648 doses administered to people aged between 18-44 on Monday till 7.30 pm, of which the second dose accounted for 4,933.Belagavi district recorded 73,923 doses while the mineral-rich district of Ballari registered 54,532 doses.

As of today, 40% of the state’s adult population has been vaccinated,” Sudhakar said.He added that the state will be able to vaccinate the entire adult population well before the target of December 31, 2021.“We have a stock of about 1.5 million doses of Covishield and 6,00,000-7,00,000 doses of Covaxin in the state. More than 10.8 million doses have been administered so far in 13,000 vaccination centres across the state.

22-06-2021||Mumbai||Can old Maharashtra allies Shiv Sena, BJP unite again?||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s public bashing of ally Congress, two weeks after the one-on-one meeting between him and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a sensational letter by Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik demanding reunion with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have led to speculation over the old allies coming together again. Senior leaders from both the parties have said it is unlikely to happen anytime soon and the statements and developments could be part of political game-plan by Sena to keep its allies in check.Thackeray met Modi in Delhi in a one-on-one meeting two weeks ago keeping deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and public works minister Ashok Chavan waiting outside. It sparked off speculations over the two old allies coming together in state politics. Thackeray’s speech delivered on the foundation day of his party on Saturday, fuelled these speculations as he openly snubbed Congress, Sena’s junior partner in ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi coalition led by him. He gave an earful to the Congress for its announcement to go solo in forthcoming elections. A day later, his party MLA Sarnaik’s letter, in which he urged his party chief to forge the alliance with BJP once again to avoid action against party leaders and their families, surfaced on social media. The legislator is facing an inquiry by the Enforcement Directorate. This escalated the talks over the re-union of the parties that were in alliance over three decades before snapping ties in 2019.“There are theories being floated by the BJP that the Sena will agree to the re-union to avoid action by the central agencies against its leaders. But our party will not succumb to the pressure as such threats are not new to us. In fact, our party leadership is using the situation to keep the two ruling parties under check, especially after they started talking about going solo and sharing of CM’s post. The party leadership wants to send out a clear message to the allies to not take the Sena for granted,” said a Sena leader. The leader said there was nothing wrong in Thackeray meeting Modi, if NCP chief Sharad Pawar could meet Amit Shah in Ahmedabad secretly. “The way things stand today, both Thackeray and Pawar are on good terms, which is important for the stability of this government. However, what will happen after some time can’t be said now. The fact is that the BJP leadership would love to see the Sena back in the NDA,” said the leader. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday said the alliance in Maharashtra is an ideal one in the entire country and the three ruling parties are together. “The government will complete its term even if the people who lost power tried to topple it. They will not succeed in creating a rift between us. Whatever Pratap Sarnaik has said was his own stand, but party chief Uddhav Thackeray’s decision (to form the government with the Congress and NCP) was taken after deliberating with other leaders,” he said.Raut said no discussion was held on the alliance in the forthcoming elections. He said though every party has right to expand their base, it is the responsibility of all three parties to ensure the government completes its term. Raut said the three ruling parties are committed to rule according to the common doctrine of common minimum program chalked out during formation of the government.Sena MP and former union minister Arvind Sawant said that though the two parties and its leaders share good relations, they do not treat the opposition as enemies, and it does not mean Sena-BJP will come together. Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “Sena workers and even leaders are grossly upset with the BJP over the treatment their party has received over last few years. They do not approve of the attempts by the BJP to destabilise MVA government. In such a situation, it would be embarrassing if the Sena joined hands with BJP,” he said.The BJP leaders were divided over their reaction to the leaked letter written by Sarnaik. A few leaders like Somaiya and Nitesh Rane said that the MLA wrote the letter after he realised about his potential arrest. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil has reacted very cautiously. “Not only Sarnaik, there are many other MLAs and MPs from Shiv Sena who want the two parties should come together. However, the final decision about the alliance is taken by our party leaders Amit Shah and JP Nadda. Even if any such offer comes across by any party, our leaders will take a call on it. It is not possible for me to comment on any such alliance in the near future,” he said.Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said the state government was intact and it will complete its term under the leadership of Thackeray. “Even Thackeraysaheb has clarified that there would be no alliance with the BJP. We will continue to be part of the MVA for five years as we had joined the alliance with the sole intention of keeping the BJP out of the power. After all attempts to topple the government failed, the BJP is now using central agencies to destabilise the government. It is unfortunate that the BJP which benefitted for widening its base because of Sena and its founder Bal Thackeray three decades ago, is after his son and CM Uddhav Thackeray. Sarnaik’s letter clearly points at the harassment he, his family and other Shiv Sena MLAs have been facing by the central agencies. It has not remained secret anymore that the ruling parties have been using these agencies for political reasons,” he said.It was Patole’s remarks that the Congress will go solo in future elections that prompted Thackeray to react angrily. Patole said that if Shiv Sena and NCP are talking of joining hands for the forthcoming elections, he complimented them and urges them to come together at the earliest. “Every party has right to expand its base, so has it to these two parties and Congress as well. If the NCP is finding fault with our desire to going solo, it must remember that it has quit Prithviraj Chavan government a few months ahead its term in 2014,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/can-old-maharashtra-allies-shiv-sena-bjp-unite-again-101624301557475.html
22-06-2021||Bangalore||Chaos, confusion hit B’luru after curbs eased||Bengaluru: The capital city was buzzing with activity on Monday after the government announced new relaxations in lockdown rules, which allows all shops to remain open till 5 pm and public transport to ply. Bengaluru, which was under lockdown for more than 50 days, found some trouble adjusting, especially with public transport. At Bengaluru’s Kemepgowda bus terminal (Majestic bus stand) chaos prevailed as enough buses were not available. With number of buses reduced and government’s diktat allowing only 50% seating in buses, people had to wait for long to get a bus. This eventually resulted in the social distancing norms being violated. By 10 am, passengers were seen rushing towards buses and crowding around the door in a bid to enter. Even though policemen were deployed at the bus terminal they were not able to control the crowd, beyond a point. “I have been waiting for more than an hour to get a bus. I have not been able to visit my doctor due to the lockdown. I thought I will do it today (Monday). There are no lines here and people are running towards the buses that are coming. If the government is reopening bus services why have they started only a handful of them? It doesn’t help anyone,” Raghavendra Shettar, a resident of Malleswaram said. BMTC in a statement said it operated 3,154 buses on Monday. The official said since the corporation is only allowing those who have received the first dose of the vaccine, the number of services has been reduced. “In the morning, there was some rush at Majestic bus stand because many trains had arrived at city railways station. By afternoon, the situation was under control. But we will be adding more buses,” said a BTMC spokesperson. Meanwhile, as many as 17,988 riders used the Namma Metro in the first four hours from 7 am to 11 am on Monday. Though many stations had no passengers for the first few trips, however, the numbers picked up gradually. Officials said that it may take more than a week to see the numbers reach the 1,00,000 mark. BMRCL in a statement said it has allowed the purchase of tickets using cash transactions, which was earlier barred to avoid physical contact. Also on Monday, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited Managing Director Rakesh Singh and senior officials also travelled by metro to collect feedback from the passengers. Many restaurants and hotel in the city too re-opened on Monday after the government allowed to them operate at 50% capacity, but many complained of lack of customers. Similarly, several hoteliers said they are struggling to keep the operations running as several staff left Bengaluru during the lockdown. “During the lockdown, only the kitchen was running. So, many cleaners and suppliers had left for their hometowns. They are expected to return only next month,” said Akhil Shetty, who owns two hotels in Malleshwaram. Hotels, clubs and restaurants without air conditioning have opened for service but without liquor supply until 5 pm with 50 % seating, while gyms began functioning at half capacity and parks opened from 5 am to 6 pm for walking and jogging. Those facilities that continue to remain shut are swimming pools, places of worship, political events, educational institutions, shopping malls, pubs and amusement parks. Despite the relaxations, some restrictions, such as curfew will be in place between 7 pm and 5 am on weekdays while during weekends curfew will be enforced from 7 pm on Friday to 5 am on Monday throughout the state. Mysuru, where the positivity rate is high, will remain under a strict lockdown until July 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/chaos-confusion-hit-b-luru-after-curbs-eased-101624301556910.html
22-06-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC grants protection from arrest to Rana Ayyub for four weeks||The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday granted transit anticipatory bail for four weeks to journalist Rana Ayyub who has been booked by Loni police in Ghaziabad of Uttar Pradesh for circulating a video which allegedly aimed at creating communal disharmony, through her Twitter handle. She had allegedly forwarded the video without verifying veracity of the video. Ayyub’s counsel, while seeking transit bail, informed the bench that the journalist had deleted the video after the first information report (FIR) was registered and also stated that she had received treatment for a spinal problem on June 11, hence she should be granted temporary protection to enable her to approach appropriate court to seek reliefs against the FIR. The court while granting the relief directed her release on furnishing a PR bond of ₹25,000 with sureties in the event of arrest. The single bench of justice Prakash Naik was informed by senior advocate Mihir Desai that his client was a Mumbai resident and had been awarded for her integrity by the President of India. He further submitted that the FIR was filed based on her sharing a video which had been posted by someone else. Desai said Ayyub had just shared the video and that she deleted the video after it was clarified that the allegations made about the incident in the video were not correct, though some media reports kept reporting that the incident was a communal one. Additional public prosecutor for the state said as the application was not based on merits of the case, it was not opposing the application. After hearing the submissions, the court accepted Ayyub’s request and granted her protection from arrest for four weeks to enable her to approach the appropriate court. The court, however, warned Desai that it would not entertain any application seeking protection beyond the said four weeks and that Ayyub should take recourse to legal remedies available to her within the given time and disposed of the application.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-grants-protection-from-arrest-to-rana-ayyub-for-four-weeks-101624301437416.html
22-06-2021||Other||Mumbai traffic cops recover ₹17 lakh pending fines||The latest approach of the Mumbai traffic police to send their personnel to the doorstep of violators for the recovery of pending e-challan dues seems to be working, as the force has managed to collect fines worth ₹17 lakh in a week. Police officers said that on June 19, Borivli and Mankhurd police stations recovered sums of about ₹5 lakh, marking the highest per day collection. “We have started the drive by sending police personnel door to door for the past one week,” said additional commissioner of police (traffic) Pravin Padwal. He said there was a backlog of 2.9 million unpaid fines imposed as e-challans for various traffic violations, totalling to ₹315 crore, for which the traffic police had set up a separate call centre to recover the dues from motorists. According to traffic police, teams of constables have been asked to visit the addresses of violators who have not paid e-challans of more than ₹5,000. Kishore Shinde, police inspector in-charge of Mankhurd traffic chowkie, said that despite being understaffed, they have deployed three constables for verification of addresses of traffic violators and visiting the houses of these violators wearing body camera. “We sort out addresses and issue a notice to pay up the fine amount. There are several addresses where the vehicle owners have moved out or have meddled with the number plates to mislead the traffic officers and cameras,” said Shinde. In a week, Mankhurd traffic officers have visited at least 38 houses and delivered the notices. “We have collected fines over ₹2 lakh and intend to collect more as many violators have asked us to allow them to pay the fine in installments,” added Shinde. Officers urge violators to pay the fines as they would later be liable for prosecution and may have to pay a higher amount as the traffic charges interest on the unpaid dues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-traffic-cops-recover-17-lakh-pending-fines-101624301436847.html
22-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to resume vaccination drive for 18+ from Tuesday||Even as the Covid-19 vaccination drive opened for all above 18 years across the country from Monday, it will resume from Tuesday in Maharashtra . The state health minister Rajesh Tope said they are approving vaccinations for all adults in order to speed up the drive in the state. He also urged the state’s youth to get vaccinated at the earliest.From June 19, the state government extended the free vaccination drive by covering the 30-45 age group. It had decided not to start the drive for the 18-30 age group, owing to the shortage of vaccine doses.“Today [Monday], the state health department has taken an important decision. Till Monday, only those who are 30 years and above were allowed to get inoculated in Maharashtra, but to give a boost to the vaccination drive we have approved vaccination for all adults,” the health minister said.“I want to urge the youths of Maharashtra to go to the nearest centre and get vaccinated as they are allowed to take it,” he added.Currently, the state has a stock of around 1,500,000 doses.Earlier, officials said that they have decided to resume the vaccination drive for the 18-45 age group in two phases to overcome the shortage issues.“We decided to resume the vaccination drive for the 18-45 age group, but in two phases. In the first phase, we have started inoculating beneficiaries who are 30 years and above, and later, we will start covering all those above 18 years in the second phase. It will begin only after the state government will start getting sufficient stock of doses from the Centre,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.On Sunday, Tope told HT that inadequate stock of doses is likely to create a mess if all above 18 years are allowed to get vaccinated in the state, considering which they had put it on hold. “We have decided not to start the drive for all above 18 years as we are not getting adequate stock to cover all adults. It is likely to create a mess if we go ahead without having sufficient stock. Hence, the state will continue to cover all the beneficiaries that are of 30 years and above. The decision for 18 years and above will be taken later.” Tope had said.Meanwhile, on Monday, the state covered 378,945 vaccine beneficiaries. The last time it had crossed 300,000 beneficiaries was on June 5.The state government had started its drive for beneficiaries in the 18-45 age group on May 1 after it was allowed by the Centre. However, it was suspended on May 12, owing to the unavailability of vaccine doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-resume-vaccination-drive-for-18-from-tuesday-101624301256887.html

The slots will be opened at 6pm daily. Vaccination for citizens aged above 45 years will be done only on Tuesdays and Saturdays. The rest of the days will be focussed on those aged between 30 and 45 to ensure that the working population gets a fair chance to get vaccinated.“As part of the new regulations on CoWIN, registration is mandatory for vaccination. Walk-in vaccination will be allowed for 50% beneficiaries if they have online registration. We have now started vaccination for those between 30 and 45 years on all days except Tuesdays and Saturdays. This is to ensure that vaccination is completed for as many people as possible before the probable third wave hits the city,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy commissioner, TMC.TMC has managed to complete vaccination for around 250,000 residents aged above 45. Around 410,000 beneficiaries have received both doses so far.“From among the five lakh (approx.) residents in the city aged above 45 years, 44.11% above 60 years are remaining to be vaccinated. Similarly, 58.24% of the beneficiaries in the 45 years to 60 years age group remain to be jabbed,” said Dr Khushboo Tawri, medical officer, TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-civic-body-regularises-opening-of-vaccination-slots-on-cowin-101624301137478.html
22-06-2021||Other||Prayagraj civic body steps up vigil at Phaphamau ghat, cremates 11 more bodies||: The Prayagraj Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to intensify the monitoring process of bodies buried close to water near Phaphamau ghat and cremate the same before they get swept off by the river water causing pollution. The threat to these bodies getting exposed has increased since rains have forced various barrages in Uttarakhand and UP to release water causing a rise in the level of the Ganga. A total of 11 bodies were cremated by the PMC on Monday. With this, 41 bodies have been cremated by the team led by zonal officer of PMC, Neeraj Kumar Singh since June 4. The level of water of river Ganga at Phaphmau ghat was 76.67 meters on Sunday (4pm) which rose by 3 cm on Monday and the level of water was recorded at 76.70 meters. Likewise, 3,75,423 cusecs of water was released from Haridwar barrage on June 19 and 1,93,263 cusecs on June 20. Similarly, 10,722 cusecs of water was released from Kanpur barrage on June 19 and 15.156 cusecs on June 20. Neeraj Kumar Singh said, “Monitoring has been increased on the ghat after the information about the rise in the water level of Ganga and the release of lakhs of cusecs of water from various reservoirs”. Hundreds of bodies are buried on the sandy banks of the Ganga between the two sides of the river (city and Phaphamau side). Local boatmen inform that there are many poor families of the rural areas of Prayagraj and neighbouring districts who, because of weaker economic condition, prefer to bury the bodies. Earlier, this was done on the Phaphamau side of the river but when the district administration started to cremate the bodies of corona positive patients at the Phaphamau ghat, the villagers started burying the bodies at city side of the river—a practice which has now come to a halt in recent weeks following the district administration posting a team near the ghat and increasing its vigil. “The Phaphamau side is far from the active current of the river and the soil is less sandy because of which the body gets decomposed in shorter time. Moreover, as the bodies don’t get exposed by the current of the river, there is far less chances of dogs and jackals getting hold of the corpse”, said Gadhru, a local boatman.

The Covid-19 positivity rate in Mumbai is 3.79% and oxygen bed occupancy is 23.56%, which qualifies the city for level-1 restrictions which entails large-scale easing of restrictions. As per the Maharashtra government’s Break The Chain order defining levels of restrictions, level-1 restrictions are possible if positivity rate is less than 5% and the oxygen bed occupancy is less than 25%; level-3 restrictions are applicable if positivity rate is between 5% and 10%, and/or oxygen bed occupancy is over 40%. The order issued by BMC on Monday stated, “Considering Mumbai’s population density, also considering a large number of people travel in crowded local trains, and due to predictions regarding the third wave made by Maharashtra Covid task force, BMC has decided to keep in force its level-3 status.” This decision has come into force from Monday and will remain in force till June 27. Local governments have the authority to opt for the status of a higher level of restrictions based on caseload, bed availability and overall situation within the jurisdiction. BMC received the state disaster management department’s nod for extending its level-3 status on June 18.Under level-3 restrictions essential shops and establishments can remain open till 4pm on all days; non-essential shops and establishments can remain open till 4pm on weekdays; restaurants are allowed to operate dine-in facilities with 50% capacity till 4pm on weekdays, and can allow take away and home deliveries after; use of local trains is restricted to medical and essential services; gyms, salons and spas can operate at 50% capacity till 4pm.As of June 20, 9,024 of the total 10,930 oxygen beds in Mumbai are vacant, 1,216 of 2,633 ICU beds are vacant, and 542 out of 1,450 ventilator beds are vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-extends-level-3-restrictions-in-city-till-june-27-101624301076782.html
22-06-2021||Mumbai||In a first, Maharashtra’s fourth sero survey to include kids above 6 years||Maharashtra health department started the fourth serological survey in six districts — Beed, Parbhani, Nanded, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, and Sangli — to gauge the prevalence of Covid-19 in the general population, from Monday. With an increase in the number of Covid cases among children in the second wave, children above the age of six years will be included in the survey for the first time.Serological survey examines how many people in a population have been infected with Covid-19 and recovered from it. It is undertaken to gauge the prevalence of the virus in a particular area. The blood serum of a group of individuals is tested using an antibody test, also known as a serology test. Public health officials said a total of 3,000 participants will be included in the survey including 1,680 adults, 720 aged between six and 18, and 600 healthcare workers (HCW).“We will take 400 samples from each district. Of this, 100 will be from HCWs and 120 samples will be from children between the age group of six and 18 years. The result is expected in a month,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer. He further said that samples of children will be collected in two age groups — six-nine years and 10-18 years. A total of 40 samples will be taken from each district from six-nine age group and 80 samples will be collected from the second age group. “Through the results of the sero survey, we would be able to understand the prevalence of the virus among the general population including children and HCWs. With the mutation of Sars-CoV-2, it is imperative to understand to what extent it has been transmitted among the crowd,” said Dr Archana Patil, Maharashtra director of health service. “Also, such surveys show the seropositivity levels within a population which helps in predicting the pandemic’s future trends,” she added.In the national first sero survey, young adults above 18 years had participated. While in the second and third rounds, samples were collected from children in the age bracket of 10 years and above. But considering the spike in Covid-19 cases among children below 10 years in the second wave, the age limit for sample collection has been reduced to six years. “It is a good decision to conduct the sero survey among children as young as six years. It would give us a better perspective of the actual scene of infection prevalence among young children,” said Dr Bakul Parekh, former president of Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) and part of the paediatric Covid task force.“The sero survey will be very useful in making educated decisions about reopening of schools. A seroprevalence similar to adults would help allay fears of the third wave largely affecting children, and would help model transmission dynamics when it comes to children. It would definitely help inform policy and is a welcome move,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, pulmonologist from Hinduja Hospital.Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is also planning to conduct a separate sero survey among children between the age group of 0 and 18 years. Data from the civic body shows that in April, 4,351 children aged between 0 and 9 years contracted Covid-19 in Mumbai. The number plunged to 3,139 in May as the overall cases reported a decline. Similarly, in April, 12,277 Covid patients were from the 10-19 age group which decreased to 3,139 the next month. Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean, BYL Nair Hospital, said, “We have witnessed a huge rise in Covid-19 cases among children in the second wave. Though mortality rate has remained under control, we need to know the actual figure of transmission among children as many may have remained asymptomatic.”The fourth sero survey will be coordinated by Indian Council of Medical Research -National AIDS Research Institute (ICMR-NARI), Pune with Dr Sampada Bangar and Dr Seema Sahay as nodal and co-nodal officers. This sero survey is a part of the nation-wide community-based 4th sero survey for Covid-19 initiated by the Central government. A total of 28,000 samples will be collected across 70 districts in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/in-a-first-maharashtra-s-fourth-sero-survey-to-include-kids-above-6-years-101624301016815.html

The accused, Rohit Gupteswar Yadav, 27, was arrested after a joint raid by the medical officer of the Panvel Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Kharghar police. Yadav was previously arrested by Shivaji Nagar police two years ago and was currently out on bail, said Kharghar police. “A city advocate had filed a complaint regarding the accused who was practicing without a degree on June 17. Accordingly on June 19, we informed PMC and the raid was conducted on June 19 as the accused on duty to monitor patients at night,” a police officer said. Dr Bhaktaraj Bhoite, medical officer, PMC, and his team sent a decoy to the hospital pretending to be a patient. After Yadav examined him and prescribed medicines, the team inquired about his degree and arrested him under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Maharashtra Medical Practitioners Act. It was found that the accused was working with the hospital since two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/man-practices-as-doctor-without-medical-degree-arrested-101624300956775.html
22-06-2021||Mumbai||CM Uddhav Thackeray takes stock of Covid health infra||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray took a review meeting of the health department, instructing the authorities to beef up health infrastructure to tackle the impending third wave. The state recorded 6,270 new Covid-19 cases and 94 deaths on Monday. Mumbai recorded 518 cases and seven deaths.Thackeray asked the authorities to chalk out a long-term plan to beef up the health infrastructure as well as ensure adequate liquid oxygen supply. “Due to the Covid-19, we had raised several temporary health units. I have asked the authorities to plan which needs to be made permanent and which health services to be given priority,” said Thackeray. “The health department should have a time-bound programme to increase various health facilities. We should also have a separate budget for increasing primary health facilities and their repairs and focus on getting the right health professionals,” he added.The CM also asked officials to ensure production of 3,000 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen so that patients are not inconvenienced in the third wave.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, attributed high rate of deaths in rural areas to lack of medical facilities. “Covid-19 provides an excellent opportunity for the government to beef up medical infrastructure across the state. We have excellent facilities in metros like Mumbai and Pune, but rural areas suffer from pathetic healthcare facilities. Many of the Covid-19 deaths could have been avoided if we had good local medical care facilities, as these people had to travel to urban areas and precious time is wasted,” said Shaikh.On Monday, 154,835 tests were conducted and 13,758 patients recovered. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 124,398. Death toll has now reached 118,313.There are currently 124,398 active patients across the state, of which Mumbai tops with 18,529 patients followed by Pune with 16,827 active patients.In terms of fatalities, Pune leads with 16,297 deaths followed by Mumbai with 15,305 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cm-uddhav-thackeray-takes-stock-of-covid-health-infra-101624300896733.html

22-06-2021||Mumbai||No Mumbai local for general public till pandemic over, says Vijay Wadettiwar||State minister Vijay Wadettiwar on Monday said the general public will not be allowed to travel in Mumbai suburban trains till the Covid-19 pandemic is over. “Mumbai locals will not be started (for general public) till Covid-19 is over,” said Wadettiwar. Reacting to the minister’s statement, passenger associations have warned of protests. “If such a scenario comes then there will be protests by passengers all over Mumbai. Local trains should be immediately resumed for the general public,” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad. He said they do not believe in Wadettiwar’s statement and said only chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will take the decision. Railway authorities refused to comment on the statement and added decisions communicated by the state government will be followed. “We get an official letter from the state government whenever there is any addition or change for operation of local trains. The official notification of the state government will be implemented,” said a senior railway official who did not wanted to be named.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, called it an impractical decision. “Covid-19 will remain for at least two more years and you cannot keep the commuters away for so long,” said Shaikh.Mumbai suburban railway network is the largest public transport system in Mumbai that used to ferry over 7 million commuters daily before local train services were stopped for general public. Presently, more than 2 million passengers travel by local trains every day. Currently, only people working in essential services, passengers travelling for medical purposes are allowed to commute by local trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-mumbai-local-for-general-public-till-pandemic-over-says-vijay-wadettiwar-101624300837959.html
22-06-2021||Mumbai||Despite state nod, BMC to not start vaccination for all aged above 18 on Tuesday||While the state government has allowed vaccination for all citizens aged above 18 from Tuesday, citizens in Mumbai will have to wait as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said it will not restart the vaccination for the 18+ age group yet in civic-run centres. BMC officials said they are planning to restart vaccination for all aged above 18 from Wednesday or Thursday.On Monday, 108,148 vaccine doses were administered at 380 vaccination centres across the city, making it the highest doses administered in a day, according to BMC data. So far, 4,570,915 citizens have been vaccinated in the city.On Tuesday, vaccination will be conducted for only those above the age of 30 at civic- and state-run vaccination centres. However, private hospitals are permitted to vaccinate anyone above the age of 18 years. BMC had on Friday announced that it would start vaccination of the 30 to 44 age group from Saturday, following which it designated 10 centres for the same. However, now the number of centres will be increased further to ensure there is no crowding at the centres.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “We want to ensure there is no crowding at vaccination centres, and hence we are not restarting from Tuesday itself. We will chalk out proper plan to ensure there is no crowding and restart vaccination for all above 18 from Wednesday or Thursday.”Kakani added, “Vaccination for all above 18 will be done on basis of 50:50 ratio, wherein 50% will be done via online booking and 50% will be done on walk-in basis.” BMC had suspended vaccination for the 18-44 age group on May 12 owing to shortage of vaccine. However, the Central government has announced that it would supply 75% of the vaccine requirement. The supply of vaccine has been better in June as compared to May, said BMC officials. As of today, the BMC has stock of around 200,000 vaccines, which will last for around 5-6 days, said civic officials.Further, the civic body has also decided to vaccinate on priority “potential superspreaders” or those who are in touch with multiple people daily, in order to control the spread of Covid-19 amid the threat of a third wave.This category includes autorickshaw and taxi drivers, hawkers, delivery executives, restaurant staff, daily wage workers among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/despite-state-nod-bmc-to-not-start-vaccination-for-all-aged-above-18-on-tuesday-101624300776841.html
22-06-2021||Lucknow||Mahoba first UP district with zero active Covid-19 cases, says Yogi Adityanath||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday announced that Mahoba had become the first among the 75 Uttar Pradesh districts with zero active Covid cases (in the second wave of the pandemic).He said if the district did not report any new case during the week, it would be rewarded. The chief minister also announced that religious places would open during the weekend closure in the state but would not allow more than five persons inside at a time.“The achievement of Mahoba is motivational for all the other districts in the state. Mahoba did not report any active Covid cases today. All the active cases that were there have recovered. The credit for this goes to the public representatives in the district, health workers, frontline workers, monitoring committees, local administration, and the residents of the district. The state government will reward the district if it does not report any new case during the week,” the chief minister said at a high-level Covid-19 review meeting.He asked the district authorities to continue aggressive testing, adding that they should not lower their guard.Eighteen districts did not report any new infection cases on Sunday while 52 districts reported fresh cases in single digit, he added.“In the past 24 hours, 213 fresh cases of Covid-19 were reported from across the state. During the same period, a total of 478 patients recovered. The Covid recovery rate is now 98.5% in the state while the positivity rate is a mere 0.1%. Currently, the state has a total of 4,163 active cases of which 2,542 are in home isolation. So far (since March last year) a total of 16.78 lakh people recovered from Covid,” he said.With Covid cases declining steadily in UP but rising fast in some other states, there was a need to be alert all the time, he said.“So, step up vigil at the railway stations, bus stations, airports and test all those who enter the state from these points,” he said to the officials concerned.He also said it was necessary to keep the industrial units running, give free movement to workers and labourers. The police should be sensitive in dealing with people and must not allow crowds to gather anywhere, he added.He said that under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the “mahabhiyan” (mega campaign) of vaccination began on Monday as the central government would supply vaccines free of cost to inoculate the 18+ age group also.“The state now has 7661 vaccination centres and we need to further increase vaccination centres across the state. Make people aware of the merits of getting vaccinated so that the maximum number of people could be inoculated as soon as possible. So far, the state has administered 2.56 crore vaccine doses and the state aims to give 10 lakh jabs each day from July 1,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mahoba-first-up-district-with-zero-active-covid-19-cases-says-yogi-101624299937231.html
22-06-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh govt gets details ready as PM may review Ayodhya development projects||As Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to review development projects of Ayodhya on June 25, the state government is getting ready with all the details to be presented before the Prime Minister. The Yogi Adityanath government has hired an international consultant, LEA Associates South Asia Private Limited, India, for preparing a blueprint and a vision document for the overall development of Ayodhya. It has handed over a list of 27 projects that will be implemented as part of the development plan.Larsen and Toubro and Kukreja Architects are assisting the international consultant, said Deepak Kumar, chairman of the UP Housing and Development Board, Uttar Pradesh government. “Out of the 27 projects, detailed project reports of 10 projects will be prepared soon,” said Kumar. In a bid to connect Ayodhya with the rest of the country, the Modi government has already approved ₹100-crore modernisation plan of the Ayodhya railway station. Construction activity is going on at rapid pace to complete this project.In addition, Ayodhya will have an international airport.After the Centre sanctioned ₹250 crore for construction of the Ayodhya airport, the Uttar Pradesh government has approved ₹321 crore to purchase additional land for the Ayodhya airport. The state government has approved ₹1001.77 crore to purchase 555.66 acres of additional land for the construction of the airport, said the state government in a statement. Also, a budgetary provision of ₹101 crore has been proposed for the development work at the airport in the state’s budget for 2021-22.The Union government on October 4, 2018, had selected the Ayodhya airstrip for the Ayodhya-Hindon air route under the Regional Connectivity Scheme. Earlier, on November 6, 2018, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced the development of the airstrip at Ayodhya for large aircraft such as A 320 and Boeing 737 and the construction of a suitable runway and terminal building.The state government is also planning to set up Ayodhya Teertha Development Board to regulate all development activities in Ayodhya, said a senior official of the state government. It is also planning a new township to decongest Ayodhya.According to government officials, the new township will come up on 500 acres of land at Shahnawazpur on the Lucknow-Gorakhpur highway. The Uttar Pradesh Awas Vikas Parishad (UP Housing Board), a state government body, will implement the project. “The new Ayodhya will come up on 500 acres of land. In phase one, development work will be carried out on 180 acres,” an official said. The CM is also likely to apprise PM Modi about this proposed new township. Besides, a provision of ₹300 crore has been made for the construction of an approach road to the Ram Janmabhoomi temple in Ayodhya.Also, a provision of ₹100 crore has been made for the development and beautification of tourism facilities in Ayodhya.A member of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust is also likely to be present at this virtual meeting.

22-06-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Pedal power to wheel Pune towards health and sustainability||The next municipal elections are coming up in early 2022. I look forward to the manifestos and different visions for our city that the main protagonists will come up with. We hope they will respond to the public’s urgent needs to heal from the Covid-19 impacts, and improve the city’s natural environment. From the public’s point of view, surely, traffic and transport deserve to be an election issue. As the city opens up, the same old congestion, air pollution and lack of road safety are returning, but we must do better. We would do well to generate some report cards and expectations related to walking, cycling, shared transport and the public bus service, to feed into the election manifestos. Let’s focus on the cycle first, which is the most elegant, clean, sustainable mobility mode, usable by most people. It is also highly appropriate in Covid-19 times to keep us healthy and to maintain safe distance. The Cycle Plan In December 2017, Pune became the first city in India to have a city-wide Comprehensive Bicycle Master Plan, passed by the General Body. Full marks for the plan. But, what marks should be given for implementation? It would be an achievement to be proud of at a global scale, provided Pune does comprehensive implementation! NMT Cell The first provision of the Cycle Plan is that the city government should have adequate and dedicated staff to implement the plan. Initially, a Bicycle Department was created. After some months, the Road Department was awarded the responsibility of implementing the Cycle Plan through a Non-motorised Transport Cell. This is appropriate since cycling infrastructure has to be part of road design. The expectation from the Road Department is that it will be a proactive lead agency to implement the cycle plan. It must coordinate with other departments and agencies like Traffic Police, PMPML and MahaMetro to ensure cycles are given space and connectivity with other mobility modes. For this, the Road Department must have adequate resources, including staff qualified in non-motorised transport planning and design. Cycle infrastructure The most critical provision in the Cycle Plan is the creation of a safe, connected, comfortable and attractive cycle-track network of over 800 km. However, over the last three-and-a-half years, only about 25km of cycle tracks have been made. Over 800 cycle parking locations were also identified. The PMC and Traffic Police did well to put up signage for cycle parking. However, both cycle tracks and cycle parking need to be protected for cyclists’ use. Monitoring and enforcement Participatory monitoring and assessment of the cycle tracks is a provision in the Cycle Plan. Since the city government did not organise any participatory assessment, local NGO Save Pune Traffic Movement (SPTM) went ahead and conducted a survey. SPTM’s study shows that in the early mornings, most cyclists prefer to use the road. Later in the day, as traffic increases, more cyclists use the cycle tracks at JM road, FC road, Ganeshkhind road and parts of Karve road. One reason cyclists ride on the carriageway is the huge number of bollards placed on the cycle tracks to prevent motorised vehicles. The cure seems worse than the disease here! Cyclists prefer that bollards be placed only at critical locations. Neither the municipal corporation nor the traffic police have implemented the Cycle Plan provision for cycle wardens and CCTVs to monitor cycle tracks and challan the offending motorcyclists. Bicycle share Public Bicycle Share system (PBS) is a term for a service that provides cycles to commuters without them having to own and maintain cycles. Often people mistake the Bicycle Share Scheme with the Cycle Plan.The Cycle Plan made a policy provision for multiple options of how the PBS may be run – as a government-owned system, a partially-supported or privately-run system with government regulation. In all cases, the city government has to create an inviting and facilitating environment for PBS to operate. In Pune, four private companies set up PBS services in 2017-18 with several thousand public bicycles. For a few months, it was a joy to see the yellow, green, orange and blue coloured public bicycles in many parts of the city. Unfortunately, they vanished with equal speed. The PBS was run by private companies and no taxpayers funds were used in 2017-18. The PMC needs to revive the public bicycle share system in Pune, with a different model.Ranjit Gadgil, from Parisar says, “The dockless system introduced by private companies gave Pune the experience of PBS. The downside is that they could and did pull out when the financials didn’t work out for them due to complex global financing. PBS has worked where cities themselves invested money and planning effort, such as Paris, London, New York etc. We can learn from the free pilot we got - what worked, what didn’t”.Pune could be a cycling city again. Will our elected representatives give us a city-wide bicycle tracks network, cycle parking, public bicycle share and the required administrative, regulatory and public engagement mechanisms in place? The election promise I would most like to see is, “We will make Pune a cycling-friendly city where cycling is safe, comfortable, convenient, attractive and enjoyable”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-pedal-power-to-wheel-the-city-towards-health-and-sustainability-101624298137983.html

22-06-2021||Pune||Six ultra-runners from Pune on “Run Wari” from Alandi to Pandharpur||PUNE There will be no warkaris walking with the palkhi on the annual pilgrimage to Pandharpur this year. However, six ultra-runners will attempt a “spiritual run”, calling it the “Run Wari”, covering a distance of 240km in 42 hours, from Alandi to Pandharpur.The brainchild of Bhushan Tarak and Swaminathan Srinivasan, this is their way of paying obeisance to the tens of thousands of warkaris who walk the distance each year on Ashadi Ekadashi.“The Run Wari is an attempt to do a spiritual journey from Alandi to Pandharpur. It has been a burning desire for Swaminathan and I for the last four years to do this. We will be joined by ultra-runners Janardhan Kattul,Chandrakant Patil, Ajit Gore,Sathosh Kokare and Rajendra Shelke,” said Bhushan Tarak. The runners will begin this Thursday, June 24.“There is no ban on running but they cannot give it a shape of a function or an event,” said Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of police, Pune, adding that the runners should follow all Covid norms. The six runners have been practicing for the last three years, building endurance on runs of 100km and 160 kms in various ultra-events like the Tata Ultra and Pune Ultra.“We have always regretted not being able to participate in the traditional palkhi wari due to other constraints and thus this is our way of expressing our devotion,” added Tarak, “This human effort is also a unique blend of bhakti (warkari devotion) and shakti (physical running), which epitomises the true spirit, essence and pride of Maharashtra.”The runners state that this is not a commercial event or an act to gain any official record, but more a personal effort. “It is an individual effort to collectively represent the bhakti and devotion of all warkaris and pray to the Almighty to get us through this Corona. The run is self-sponsored and not under the banner of any official organisation,” said Tarak.The runners will leave Alandi at 6pm and proceed via Saswad, Jejuri, Lonand, Phaltan, Malshiras to reach Pandharpur on June 26 at around 11 am.

22-06-2021||Delhi||Centre has not given any free vaccines for 18-45 group so far: Sisodia||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday said the Delhi government has so far not received any free vaccine for the 18-45 age group from the central government. He also accused the Union government of spending public money on advertising its renewed pan-India vaccination drive, instead of using the money to procure more vaccine doses.“Now they are claiming to inoculate all citizens for free from June 21st onwards. Upon inquiring about this free vaccination drive, it was confirmed that not a single dose of free vaccine has been distributed in Delhi so far (for the 18-45 group). Only 15 lakh doses of vaccines have been earmarked for Delhi for the month of July, which is not enough to vaccinate all of Delhi. If we receive doses at this pace, then instead of three months, it will take approximately 15-16 more months to vaccinate everyone in Delhi,” said Sisodia, addressing a digital press conference on Monday.According to Delhi government records, while the Central government has provided at least 5 million vaccine doses to the Capital for free since January, these were earmarked for those aged 45 years and above. For the 18-45 category, the Delhi government procured on its own at least 1.43 million doses since April this year.Also read | Sisodia inspects pace of construction at 4 new Delhi govt schoolsThe Delhi government has estimated that it needs 23 million doses more to inoculate all adult residents of the city. So far, Delhi has vaccinated 6,521,959, of which 4,942,267 received the first dose and 1,579,692 got both the doses.Sisodia also criticised the Centre for spending public money on advertisements and said the vaccination drive being run by the Centre may be the largest in the world, but it is going to be the “longest” and the “most mismanaged” programmes across the globe.“Several newspapers across the nation today (Monday) published long one-pager advertisements on the central government’s largest vaccination drive. State governments such as Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka also published similar advertisements in newspapers thanking the central government’s vaccination drive. The Centre needs to understand that our people need vaccines, not long advertisements. Instead of spending this much money on advertisements, if the Centre had spent it on procuring vaccines from abroad, our Covid-19 crisis could have been managed better,” Sisodia said.The new vaccine drive by the Centre saw 7.5 milion people across the country receiving jabs on Monday.The deputy chief minister alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government also put pressure on Delhi government officers to advertise the vaccine drive. “It (the Centre) has been putting pressure on our officials to publish these advertisements. The central government-led vaccination drive may be the world’s largest drive, but it is definitely India’s longest vaccination drive. It is also the most mismanaged, derailed and messed up drive. The Centre has completely botched the whole vaccination drive in the nation,” he said.Sisodia said Delhi needs about 29.4 million doses, of which 9.2 million are required for those in 18-45 age group and 5.7 million for people in 45+ age category. “When chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that Delhi needed 2.94 crore vaccines to inoculate citizens within three months, why did we receive only 5.7 million vaccines in total so far? All the central government has done is sell vaccines to other countries for its image management. After that, it told all the state governments to float global tenders and purchase vaccines from abroad, while also fixing the vaccine quota for every state. After we criticised the move, the Centre finally changed the policy, and now it is not even giving sufficient doses to states,” he said.Sisodia further pointed out that vaccination is key to returning to normal. “Vaccination is the only way to defeat the Covid-19 crisis in India. Many countries across the world prioritised vaccinating their citizens first, and with pride announced that citizens can roam about mask-free, because most of them are vaccinated. Whether it was purchasing vaccines from other nations or investing funds in vaccine manufacturing, several nations proved that vaccinating their citizens on a priority basis is significant to defeating the virus. I appeal to the Central government to provide 23 million vaccines for Delhi and I assure the Central government officials that if we receive adequate number of doses, we will release advertisements thanking Modi ji in all newspapers,” Sisodia said.Meanwhile, Delhi BJP said the Centre has already announced the schedule of vaccine distribution according to which the entire country will get enough vaccines to administer both doses by mid December 2020.“There is no mess up in the vaccination programme... It will be better if the Delhi government, instead of creating further confusion, adheres to the Centre’s given time table. Sisodia should know that USA has to vaccinate less then 30 crore people, while India has to vaccinate 130 crore citizens. Both USA and India have vaccinated some 28 crore people, so that means Indian plan is going well,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/centre-has-not-given-any-free-vaccines-for-18-45-group-so-far-sisodia-101624298019915.html
22-06-2021||Delhi||Row over UGC directive to put up banners thanking PM for vaccines||As the Centre took over the sourcing and supplying Covid-19 vaccines from Monday, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked all universities and colleges across the country to put up posters thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the free jabs, drawing criticism from a section of teachers who termed it as “politicisation” of the vaccination drive.In an email sent to universities and colleges on Sunday, the commission said, “The Government of India is starting free vaccination for 18 years and above age group from tomorrow, i.e. 21st June 2021. In this regard Universities and Colleges are requested to kindly display these hoardings/banners in their institutions. The approved design (creatives) of hoardings/banners in Hindi and English, as provided by the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, are attached for your ready reference.”The approved design for banners, shared by the UGC in the email, carried the message “Thank you PM Modi” both in English and Hindi. Several colleges in the Delhi University (DU) on Monday confirmed receiving the email from the commission.Despite several attempts, UGC secretary Rajnish Jain did not answer calls. He also did not respond to text messages.On June 7, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Centre would be in charge of sourcing and supplying vaccines. It would, he added, buy 75% of locally available vaccines, with the remainder being reserved for private hospitals. And it would bear the cost of the entire 75%, he added.A principal of a north campus DU college, who asked not to be named, said, “We have received these sample posters to create vaccine awareness among the youth. The UGC had also sent an email to ensure educational institutions complied with the order.”DU put up the banners outside the South Campus on Monday and tweeted photos on its official handle. DU Registrar Vikas Gupta, however, said they had voluntarily decided to put up the posters to create awareness among students and denied receiving any email from the UGC.“The banners were put up to create awareness among the students. There were no directions from the UGC regarding this,” Gupta said.Jamia Millia Islamia registrar Nazim Husain Al-Jafri confirmed receiving directions from the UGC. “We will get the posters and banners printed by tomorrow and install them at different places on the university campus,” he said.A section of teachers said it was a purely “political move”. Rajesh Jha, an associate professor at DU and former member of the university’s executive council, said, “At a time when the educational institutions have been struggling managing their finances, there is no money to renew our journals and get our laboratory equipment, the UGC is asking colleges to put up posters. What is the need for it? Universities and colleges are not meant for propagating the political agenda of the government.”Abha Dev Habib, member of the DU teachers’ association (DUTA), said, “For the past 6-7 years educational institutions have been used for propagating government agendas. This is nothing but another such propaganda. There has been no announcement of gratuities for those who lost their lives to Covid, or scholarships for students considering the hardships they have faced amid the pandemic. But the government is trying to whitewash all the suffering people have witnessed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/row-over-ugc-directive-to-put-up-banners-thanking-pm-for-vaccines-101624298019350.html
22-06-2021||Delhi||Weekly markets seek further relaxations in curbs, say current rules ‘impossible’||Weekly market associations have sought further relaxations in curbs as part of Unlock measures, contending that it was “impossible” to operate under the present restrictions, which allow only one authorised weekly market per day, per zone to operate. The associations said that meant only 5% of markets could open and even those few found it difficult to run out of schools owing to space constraints.There are around 2,7000 weekly markets across the city, said the association heads, and, currently, not a single one of them is functional.As per the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) orders issued on June 13, only one weekly market (with a limit of 50% of vendors who were allowed during pre-Covid times) per day, per zone was allowed under all three municipal corporations, subject to Covid-19 protocols. “The weekly markets can be allowed to function at suitable nearby grounds, school grounds, where SOP/ guidelines of DDMA can be strictly implemented,” states the guidelines.Ramesh Kumar, head of the South Delhi Weekly Market Association, said it was impossible for markets to operate with the current riders. “Only 5% of markets can operate due to the cap on the number of markets. However, even those 5% cannot function as the government wants us to operate out of government school premises and not our usual areas. None of the markets is in business because of this,” said Kumar.He said government schools weren’t big enough to accommodate markets and implementation of physical distancing would become a challenge. “We request the government to relax these riders and allow us to operate from our regular spots. The government can impose necessary guidelines and we will have no objection,” said Kumar.Sunil Kumar, head of Delhi Pradesh Weekly Market Association, said none of the weekly markets has reopened. “The government wants us to put up our stalls in parks and schools. No one will allow us to set up our markets in parks and schools are not big enough to accommodate markets. No market has been able to reopen due to these curbs,” said Sunil Kumar.He said shopkeepers and vendors are in distress due to the curbs and sought that the government allow them to operate from their usual sites. “We have our designated places and customers will also come to these sites. The government needs to understand that people will not visit schools in distant places. We will not be able to put up our stalls in such places,” said Sunil Kumar.Anil Bakshi, general secretary, Delhi Pradesh Weekly Market Welfare Association, said he has written to government representatives, including the chief minister, seeking a meeting to resolve the stalemate but to no avail. “Lakhs of families are in dire straits due to these restrictions. Nearly 4-5 lakh people are dependent on these 2,700 markets and they are struggling to survive,” said Bakshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/weekly-markets-seek-further-relaxations-in-curbs-say-current-rules-impossible-101624298018726.html

22-06-2021||Delhi||Four of extortion gang held after shoot-out in Najafgarh||Four men, suspected to be members of Delhi-based crime syndicate “Nandu-Jyoti Baba gang”, were arrested after a shoot-out with the police in Kharkari village near Najafgarh on Sunday night, the police said, while on their way to allegedly kill a businessman who refused to give in to their extortion demands. Three of the gang were shot in their legs and police recovered four pistols and ten live cartridges from their possession.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav said the four men, who have several cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion and robbery against them, were on two motorcycles and they shot at the police when asked to stop and surrender. Police identified them as Vinay Karan, Robin Baliyan, Sumit Poonia and Deepu Dagar.Police said they are members Nandu-Jyoti Baba gang, whose leader Nandu alias Kapil Sangwan is presently absconding while Jyoti Baba is running the gang from jail. The two men are accused of murder, extortion, robbery and other heinous crimes, police said.“There was a rise in incidents of extortion by the Nandu-Baba gang, so special cell teams were working to gather information about them. We received information that the gang members would be coming to Delhi to murder a businessman of Malikpur village, who had refused to yield to their extortion demands,” said Yadav.He said police team laid a trap on the road leading to Ujwa Village form Kharkhari Village, Delhi. “ After waiting for a few minutes, our informant pointed out two motorcycles with four men on them, who were coming from Kharkhari Village and heading towards Ujwa. The informant told us that they were coming to Delhi to murder a businessman of Malikpur village on the directions of the gang kingpin. Our team asked the riders to stop, but they tried to speed away. In their hurry. one of the motorcycle riders lost control of the vehicle while the other abandoned the motorcycle on the roadside and tried to flee on foot. The police team chased them and they fired at the police -- it was a close shave for our two head constables. The police team warned them and returned the fire,” Yadav said, adding that the four men were then arrested.During interrogation, Karan admitted to providing arms, ammunitions and shelter to members of Nandu-Jyoti Baba gang. He allegedly said he also worked as a driver with an app-based cab service and has around 40 criminal cases against him. Police said the second suspect, Robin Baliyan, was assigned to shoot dead the Malikpur businessman. The other two men were also part of the gang, Yadav said, adding that the suspects were in touch with their leaders, who are jailed in different cases.Police said the gang had threatened traders of different Delhi villages such as Bijwasan, Samaspur, NanakPiau and Dinpur.

22-06-2021||Delhi||Fewest new Covid-19 cases in Delhi since April 30, 2020||The Capital on Monday added just 89 new cases of Covid-19, the lowest spike in over 400 days, as the test positivity rate fell to the lowest ever since the pandemic broke out in Delhi in March last year, in clear signs of recovery for the city after a punishing fourth wave between April and May that infected millions and left thousands dead.Monday’s infection spike is the lowest since April 30 last year, when the city added 76 cases, during the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Capital, before even the first wave, which began around mid-May.To be sure, at that time, the state was conducting significantly fewer tests to check for the infection than it is right now, and was averaging just around 2,700 tests per day. In comparison, an average of over 72,000 people were tested each day for Covid-19 in the seven-days ending Monday.The fourth wave of the pandemic has now seen a steady drop for eight consecutive weeks in the city. The seven-day average of new infections – which denotes a region’s Covid-19 curve –touched a peak of 25,294 new cases a day on April 23, but fell to 159 cases a day in the past week, a drop of over 99% from the peak, showed state government data.The number of active cases also continued to fall, as the city’s caseload continued to reduce, and dropped below the 2,000-mark for the first time since March 10 this year. At the peak of the fourth wave of infections on April 28, 99,752 people in the Capital were battling the viral infection. On Monday, there were 1996 active cases in the city.Experts believe that Delhi might have reached an “endemic level” of the infection. “Such a low level of infection is only possible when endemic levels have been reached. Delhi, along with states such as Maharashtra and Punjab that saw the explosion of cases initially have reached the endemic levels and the entire country is likely to follow soon, probably by mid-July,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.Also read | Over 8 million shots on Day 1 of new driveMonday’s 89 cases came on the back of 57,128 fresh Covid-19 tests, at a test positivity rate of 0.16%, the lowest ever in the national capital. The positivity rate is a crucial metric to understand the spread of an infection in a region. Experts, including the World Health Organization recommend a number below 5% for two weeks before an infection can be considered under control.In Delhi, the test positivity rate has been below this threshold for 32 days, and below 1% for 22 days.The state government also added 11 more deaths of the infections to the city’s toll, taking the number of Covid-19 fatalities to 24,925.He, however, advised caution. “A third wave might happen only if a new variant emerges that is more transmissible than the delta variant or completely escapes the immunity. We should be alert, follow masking and social distancing, and monitor for variants. But the government should change the vaccination strategy now to protect against deaths. Mass vaccination should have happened in January and February to prevent the second wave, now the natural infection has already done what the vaccination had to do. So, now the focus should be comorbid and pregnant people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fewest-new-covid-19-cases-in-capital-since-april-30-2020-101624297956694.html
22-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Shoe godown gutted in Peeragarhi, four workers missing||Four people are suspected to have been trapped inside a large shoe godown in Udyog Nagar near Peeragarhi in outer Delhi that went up in fire on Monday, officials of the fire and police departments said. There were at least 10 people inside the building when the blaze started. While six of them were rescued, four are still missing.More than 100 fire fighters and 35 fire tenders worked for nearly eight hours to douse the flames. However, the cooling and search operations were on.The owner of the godown and the family members of the missing people told the police and fire officials that they were not able to contact the workers on their mobile phones. Initially, their cellphones were working as the calls were going through but nobody was responding. Later, the phones went unreachable. Of the four missing persons, two are brothers, fire officials said, quoting the information shared by the family members.“It was a major category fire and a tough operation for our men because inflammable materials such as shoes and packing materials were stored in huge quantity in the godown. As far as casualties are concerned, we have not found any bodies so far. But at least four people are feared to be trapped inside. Until our search operation is complete, we cannot say they are dead or alive,” said Delhi Fire Services chief Atul Garg.According to Garg, the fire was reported to the control room at 8.22am. Initially, 24 fire tenders were sent. Later, 11 more were rushed to the spot considering the intensity of the blaze.He said nobody informed the firefighters about 10 workers who used to sleep in the godown. “Initially, nobody told us about the people who were inside. We would have begun the rescue operation had we been told about the missing persons in the beginning. By the time we were informed, the fire had engulfed the entire godown. We did not rescue anyone from the building till evening,” said Garg.Deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh said the godown is owned by Pankaj Garg who runs a company named Apeksha International. “Initially, 10 people were reported trapped inside the godown. Four of them who were on the ground floor rushed out of the building. Later, two more persons came out themselves. Four are still reported to be inside. The search operation is on. Two ambulances were called to the spot,” said DCP Singh.Locals said that of the six men who survived, two jumped off the first floor of the godown. Fire and police officials said that the godown is spread in nearly 1,000 square metres and consists of two buildings, each having a basement, ground and first floor. The entire premises has a tin ceiling and was packed with shoes, slippers, and packaging materials such as boxes and adhesives.“The presence of such inflammable items in huge quantity helped the fire spread quickly. Since the entire godown and materials are gutted, there is strong heat and smoke that is delaying our search operation. If there are human bodies inside, it’s very difficult to find them in the heap of burnt material. The tin roof collapsed while cracks have developed in the buildings and have now been declared dangerous by the municipal authority,” said Garg, who himself was leading the fire fighting and search operation.HT tried to contact the company’s owner and its representative on the phone numbers mentioned on the internet. A person who responded to the call identified himself as the owner’s brother-in-law but refused to comment on the matter.Police said that a case was being registered. The exact trigger of the fire was not known till late evening.Garg said that the godown did not have any fire fighting arrangement and its owner had not sought a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department. “We have learnt that another fire had taken place in the godown in the past. The exact date and year is not known yet. Since the godown did not have an NOC or fire fighting arrangement, we will write a letter to the local administration for taking action against the owner,” the fire chief added.The search operation in the godown was suspected late in the evening and is expected to resume Tuesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-shoe-godown-gutted-in-peeragarhi-four-workers-missing-101624297897908.html
22-06-2021||Delhi||Thieves cut wall and floor of bank in east Delhi, steal ₹55 lakh cash||Unidentified thieves cut through a wall and floor of the Union Bank of India’s branch in east Delhi’s Vishwas Nagar, broke open the iron vault and stole around ₹55 lakh cash on Sunday. The break-in was found on Monday morning when the bank employees reached the building and reported the matter to the police control room around 10.30am, the police said.Since the suspects disabled the CCTV cameras of the bank, it was not immediately clear how many of them entered the bank and for how long they remained inside to execute the heist. Besides a portion of the vault which was broken with the help of gas cutters, the thieves did not touch any lockers and nearly ₹50 lakh cash that was kept in another portion of the vault, senior police officers said.Investigators suspect that the thieves may have run out of gas, forcing them to leave the lockers intact.“The stolen money was cash collection and transactions of Friday and Saturday. We have registered a case of trespass and theft against unknown persons at the Farsh Bazar police station. Prime facie, it appears that the thieves conducted a detailed reconnaissance of the bank and planned everything meticulously. We have got certain clues in the case. Several teams are working on them,” said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram.Police said the heist took place on Sunday, when the bank was shut for the weekend holiday. They said the thieves first entered a vacant under-construction building adjacent to the bank after breaking its lock.“The suspects drilled a hole in the bank’s wall through the adjacent under-construction building. They entered the ground floor of the bank and drilled their way into the basement through the floor. Once inside the basement, the thieves cut open the vault, took out the cash and fled using the same route through which they entered the premises,” said a senior police officer, who asked not to be named.DCP Sathiyasundaram said the theft came to light when the bank’s employees reached the bank and informed the police. The local police along with crime scene inspection team and forensic experts reached the spot and collected evidence. The entire building has been cordoned off and the forensic teams have collected fingerprints and other evidence from the scene, the DCP said.Investigators said the role of an insider could not be ruled out. They have prepared the list of all employees as well as security guards and are ascertaining their whereabouts when the heist took place. The CCTV cameras installed around the bank are also being scanned to find if any suspicious activities were captured on the day of the crime or in the last couple of weeks, when the suspects may have carried out the reconnaissance.The investigators are also preparing a list of criminals who were previously involved or arrested for similar crimes.A similar bank heist took place in outer Delhi’s Mundka in December 2017. The thieves entered the bank by drilling a hole in its wall through an adjacent vacant building. They took away nearly ₹27 lakh cash and jewellery worth several lakhs of rupees after cutting open a safe and some lockers.Investigators are trying to find out if the same set of thieves, who committed the Mundka bank theft, are involved in this crime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thieves-cut-wall-and-floor-of-bank-in-east-delhi-steal-55-lakh-cash-101624297897306.html

Schools in the national capital are shut in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.Sisodia, who is also the education minister, visited government schools in Kondli, Kalyanpuri, IP Extension and Preet Vihar, and inquired about the construction of classrooms and academic blocks. “Keeping in mind the security and safety of children, we are not calling students back to school anytime soon. We are, however, ensuring that the construction work for new and improved classrooms is done at a fast pace so that when children return to schools, they are welcomed with new and colourful classrooms with the best facilities,” he said in a statement issued by the government on Monday.Also read | Fewest new Covid-19 cases in Delhi since April 30, 2020After the inspection, Sisodia also issued guidelines to officials in charge and directed them to ensure that classrooms are equipped with state-of-the-art facilities. “The schools and classrooms should be designed keeping in mind the psyche of children. We should design schools in a way that they are interactive so that when students return to schools and look at their colourful classes, they are motivated to learn and engage,” the statement added.According to the statement, the construction work at Kondli school, where 20 new classrooms are being constructed at present, will be finished by the end of this month.“Similarly, 97% of construction work is complete in Kalyanpuri school, with 20 new classrooms in the process of being constructed.

22-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Private schools say they don’t have surplus funds||Several private schools in the Capital have contested the contention that some institutions hold surplus funds between ₹1 crore and ₹48 crore, arguing that they are instead short of cash reserves and running in deficit.In an affidavit, filed in Supreme Court on June 15, the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education (DoE) named 35 private schools that it said have between ₹1 crore and ₹48 crore surplus funds. Among these are four branches of the Delhi Public School (DPS) — in Vasant Kunj, Rohini, RK Puram, and Dwarka. The document said these schools have surplus funds of ₹48 crore, ₹34 crore, ₹11 crore, and ₹23 crore, respectively.Members of the DPS Society, which runs the institutions, contested this.“We have no idea how they came up with these figures. The DPS Society has conducted a statutory audit with the help of a major chartered accountancy firm, and as of March 31, 2020, there was ₹38 crore in DPS Vasant Kunj’s account. When we deduct the amounts for gratuity, leave encashment, salary buffer requirement, and funds for ongoing projects, the school has a deficit of ₹34 crore,” said a member of the DPS Society who asked not to be named.Similarly, the official said, that DPS Rohini and Dwarka branches have deficits of ₹26 crore and ₹34 crore respectively. “DPS RK Puram has three branches, including a senior school and two junior wings. The government has not allowed us to increase fees in the last five years in any of these schools. Despite that, we have to pay salaries to our employees in accordance with the 7th Pay Commission. Besides, if we need to start any infrastructure project in the school, we have to use funds from our savings,” the official added.A senior DoE official, requesting anonymity, said, “If the schools are claiming that they do not have any surplus in their accounts, they can prove that in the court. It’s all on record. The government has gone through their accounts before submitting the data. This is up to the Supreme Court to decide now.”The Action Committee of Unaided Private Recognised Schools, which represents over 1,000 private schools in Delhi, said if a school has surplus funds, these are allocated for a variety of expenditure, including paying employees’ gratuity funds, encashing leave, corporation taxes, for disasters, exigencies, to pay pending arrears to employees in accordance with the 7th Pay Commission, apart from maintaining a four-to-six month salary buffer, as mandated in the Delhi School Education Act of 1973.The Delhi high court on May 31 set aside two orders issued by the Delhi government last year prohibiting private schools from collecting annual charges and development fee during the Covid-19 lockdown, and held that schools may collect these charges for the last academic year retrospectively, on a monthly basis, but only after a 15% reduction in lieu of unutilised facilities (such as water and electricity) in the lockdown period.DoE later challenged the single-bench decision, but the court refused to stay the order, after which the Delhi government on June 15 filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court against the ruling.The education department in its affidavit said that tuition fees cover the standard cost of running the institution, including salary, dearness allowance provisions, bonuses, etc, and other terminal benefits concerning academic activities.However, schools were still levying annual charges, which cover expenditure not included in tuition fees such as expenses on sports equipment, cultural and co-curricular programmes distinct from other activities of the school, despite no such expenses made during the lockdown period.“...The learned single judge has failed to examine that in most cases, the expenditure on salary and establishment is only 40-50% of the total fees charged by the school. However, in some cases, it is 70%, which means each and every school has sufficient funds in hand after charging tuition fees to meet its expenses,” DoE said in its affidavit submitted with the SLP.Officials at New Green Field School in Saket, which the government affidavit said has ₹2 crore surplus funds, said their institute has been in the red since 2019.“Just tuition fees are not sufficient to cover teachers’ salaries. As per an audit, as on March 31, 2020, we had a deficit of ₹2 crore. We have no idea how the government termed it a surplus amount,” said Ashwani Kumar, manager of the school.SK Bhattacharya, president of the action committee of private schools, said, “Schools are on the verge of shutting down due to the Covid-19 situation, with many not able to meet even the essential salary expenditure. Many schools can only meet salary demands by using the annual charges and development funds. Moreover, the DoE has not allowed any fee increase since 2016-17, which has made the situation more dismal for numerous schools.”Advocate Kamal Gupta, who represents the private schools’ body, argued: “The Delhi School Education Act and the judgments of the Supreme Court and high court repeatedly held that capital expenditure can be incurred from fees received by the schools. However, DoE has continuously disallowed such capital expenditure, apart from disallowing the statutory funds maintained or required to pay gratuity to the staff, the contingency reserve for payment of salaries, and depreciation reserve fund mandated by the Supreme Court, and is coining a surplus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-private-schools-say-they-don-t-have-surplus-funds-101624297836697.html

Spotlighting the highly transmissible strain, Fauci said the Delta variant is more easily transmitted than the original Covid-19 variant. The variant is becoming the globally dominant version of the disease, the World Health Organization’s chief scientist said on Friday."The transmissibility is unquestionably greater in the Delta variant than the original variant of Covid-19," Fauci said. The variant is associated with increased disease severity," he added. The Delta variant contributed to a severe outbreak of Covid-19 in India during April and May that overwhelmed health services in the country and killed hundreds of thousands. The variant, experts say, drove the deadly second wave in the country unleashing a crisis with daily cases being clocked at more than 400,000, crematoriums running out of space and wood to cremate bodies, and collapse of health infrastructure across states.Turning the focus on US' artillery to fight the disease, the World Health Organization's chief scientist said that the vaccines widely available in the nation are effective against the Delta variant. The Delta variant is becoming the globally dominant version of the disease, Fauci said. "The vaccines authorized in the United States, including the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, are effective against the new variant of Covid-19. We have the tools, so let's use them and crush the outbreak," Fauci said.The White House on Tuesday said the US may need additional few weeks to meet the target of vaccinating 70% of adults. Earlier, the Biden administration had set the target of July 4 - the Independence Day - to vaccinate 70% of adults in the US. White House Covid-19 senior adviser Jeffrey Zients said he expects 70% of adults over 27 years old will have had at least one shot by July 4.More than 150 million people in the United States, or more than 45% of the population, have been fully vaccinated, according to federal data last updated on Monday.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday pointed towards the reluctance among younger American adults for getting vaccine doses, as they are turning to Covid-19 vaccines at a slower rate than older adults. This is likely to hamper the Covid-19 vaccination coverage trajectory in the United States. If the reluctance continues in the pace of vaccination till the month of August, the vaccine coverage among younger adults will not reach the level seen in older adults, the CDC pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-covid-19-variant-found-in-india-greatest-threat-to-us-pandemic-response-says-fauci-101624383753587.html

The 24-year-old Vismaya, an Ayurveda medical student, allegedly died by suicide in the bathroom of her husband's house at Sasthamkotta district in south Kerala on Monday.The woman's family has alleged torture and harassment by her husband S Kiran Kumar, an assistant motor vehicles inspector, over dowry. A day after the woman was found dead, the police arrested Kumar and charged him under section 304B of the Indian Penal Code (dowry death). Kumar was taken into custody last night on the basis of her family's complaint.Vismaya was beaten, dragged and stamped on her face: FamilyHighlighting repeated torture from Kumar's family, Vismaya's kin alleged that their daughter was beaten, mistreated and tortured in her in-law's house.A day before the incident, Vismaya sent an SOS to her family in a series of WhatsApp messages over the alleged harassment she was suffering from Kumar over dowry.Vismaya shared photos of the wounds and marks of beatings on her body which she suffered during the recent severe physical torture from Kumar, the relatives alleged.Vismaya, in the WhatsApp chat, said that her husband did not like the car gifted by her father as dowry and used to thrash her over that. Vismaya said she was dragged by her hair and stamped on the face over dowry. The harassment was especially over the car by Kumar who used to verbally abuse Vismaya's father, saying that he deserved more dowry according to his stature but got only very little.How much dowry was Kumar givenVismaya's father Thrivikraman Nair claimed that their family had given 100 sovereigns of gold and over one-acre land, besides a car worth ₹10 lakh car as dowry to Kumar during their wedding in 2020, reported PTI.Nair added that Kumar had assaulted his daughter in front of him as well over the dowry demand."But he did not like the car and wanted ₹10 lakh as cash instead. As I said it was not possible, he used to torture my daughter. He had beaten Vismaya in front of us after coming to our home at midnight last January, he said.What is the family sayingNair has alleged that his daughter would never die by suicide and it was a case of murder by Kumar's family.What happens to Kumar and his family nowShortly after the incident was reported, the State Transport Department suspended Kumar from service. Kumar was taken into police custody on Monday night and was arrested the next morning over charges of dowry death.Other legal measures will also be taken against Kumar after getting the post-mortem report, he said. Now, Kumar would be produced before the court and his custody will be sought later as more investigation is required. The role of his relatives in the incident would also be probed, police said.The state police chief Loknath Behera has said that the incident has shaken the conscience of people in Kerala. He assured of stringent legal action against those allegedly involved in the incidents that led to the woman's death.Behera said inspector general of police Harshitha Attalluri will head the investigation, involving all senior police officials. "It is a very sad incident which has affected the conscience of Kerala. Such incidents are very rare in our society, which is a tolerant and advanced society," he said.(If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialists.

But more than half — 477 — worked in the special agent division, which is responsible for protecting the president and vice president, as well as the families of these leaders and other government officials.CREW noted that the Trump administration took actions that risked exposure to Secret Service workers, but it could not verify a direct connection to possible infections because the identities of those infected remains private.After President Donald Trump contracted Covid-19, he took a drive in his presidential vehicle as Secret Service personnel drove and protected him. The former president also held multiple large rallies and events, including the announcement of Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court, despite restrictions on public gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/almost-900-secret-service-employees-were-infected-with-covid19-101624378031739.html

standards, Finland should be deluged by people wanting to relocate, but in fact it faces an acute workforce shortage."It's now widely acknowledged that we need a spectacular number of people to come to the country," recruiter Saku Tihverainen from agency Talented Solutions told AFP.Workers are needed "to help cover the cost of the greying generation", the recruiter explained.While many Western countries are battling weak population growth, few are feeling the effects as sharply as Finland.With 39.2 over-65s per 100 working-age people, it is second only to Japan in the extent of its ageing population, according to the UN, which forecasts that by 2030 the "old age dependency ratio" will rise to 47.5.The government has warned that the nation of 5.5 million needs to practically double immigration levels to 20,000-30,000 a year to maintain public services and plug a looming pensions deficit.Finland might seem like an attractive destination on paper, scoring high in international comparisons for quality of life, freedom and gender equality, with little corruption, crime and pollution.But anti-immigrant sentiment and a reluctance to employ outsiders are also widespread in Western Europe's most homogenous society, and the opposition far-right Finns Party regularly draws substantial support during elections.Also Read | India ranks 139 out of 149 countries in World Happiness Report | Here's list of 20 happiest nations- Tipping point -After years of inertia, businesses and government "are now at the tipping point and are recognising the problem" posed by a greying population, said Charles Mathies, a research fellow at the Academy of Finland.Mathies is one of the experts consulted by the government's "Talent Boost" programme, now in its fourth year, which aims to make the country more attractive internationally, in part through local recruitment schemes.Those targeted include health workers from Spain, metalworkers from Slovakia, and IT and maritime experts from Russia, India and Southeast Asia.But previous such efforts have petered out.In 2013, five of the eight Spanish nurses recruited to the western town of Vaasa left after a few months, citing Finland's exorbitant prices, cold weather and notoriously complex language.Finland has nonetheless seen net immigration for much of the last decade, with around 15,000 more people arriving than leaving in 2019.But many of those quitting the country are higher-educated people, official statistics show.Faced with the OECD's largest skilled worker shortage, some Finnish startups are creating a joint careers site to better bag overseas talent."As you can imagine, this is a slow burner," Shaun Rudden from food delivery firm Wolt said in an email, adding that "We try to make the relocation process as painless as possible."- Systemic problem -Startups "have told me that they can get anyone in the world to come and work for them in Helsinki, as long as he or she is single," the capital's mayor, Jan Vapaavuori, said to AFP.But "their spouses still have huge problems getting a decent job."Many foreigners complain of a widespread reluctance to recognise overseas experience or qualifications, as well as prejudice against non-Finnish applicants.Ahmed (who requested his name be changed for professional reasons) is a 42-year-old Brit with many years' experience in building digital products for multinational, household-name companies.Yet six months of networking and applying for jobs in Helsinki, where he was trying to move for family reasons, proved fruitless."One recruiter even refused to shake my hand, that was a standout moment," he told AFP."There was never a shortage of jobs going, just a shortage of mindset," said Ahmed, who during his search in Finland received offers from major companies in Norway, Qatar, the UK and Germany, and eventually began commuting weekly from Helsinki to Dusseldorf.Recruiter Saku Tihverainen said shortages are pushing more companies to loosen their insistence on only employing native Finnish workers."And yet, a lot of the Finnish companies and organisations are very adamant about using Finnish, and very fluent Finnish at that," he said.- Changing priorities -For Helsinki mayor Jan Vaaavuori, four years of Finland being voted the world's happiest country in a UN ranking have "not yet helped as much as we could have hoped.""If you stop someone in the street in Paris or London or Rome or New York, I still don't think most people know about us," he mused.Mayor Vapaavuori, whose four-year term ends this summer, has turned increasingly to international PR firms to help raise the city's profile.He is optimistic about Finland's ability to attract talent from Asia in future, and believes people's priorities will have changed once international mobility ramps up again post-coronavirus.Helsinki's strengths, being "safe, functional, reliable, predictable -- those values have gained in importance," he said, adding: "Actually I think our position after the pandemic is better than it was before."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-happiest-country-seeks-it-professionals-from-india-101624381902927.html

He was a coward since day one," said the PPP leader.In an interview with Axios' on HBO, Khan said: "If a woman is wearing very few clothes it will have an impact on the men unless they are robots. It's common sense.""...I said the concept of 'purdah'. Avoid temptation in society. We don't have discos here, we don't have nightclubs. It is a completely different society way of life here. So if you raise temptation in society to a point -- all these young guys have nowhere to go --- it has a consequence in the society," he also said.This comes two months after Imran Khan's comments on sexual violence drew severe backlash, where he had said that the rise in such violence in Pakistan, particularly against children, was caused due to "fahashi" (vulgarity).Official statistics in Pakistan have revealed that at least 11 rape incidents are reported in the country every day, with over 22,000 cases reported to the police in the last six years.However, only 77 of the accused have been convicted which comprises 0.3 per cent of the total figure, reported Geo News.Khan's latest controversial remarks have led to an outpouring of furious comments on social media as netizens termed his comments as "victim-blaming".Reacting to the comments, journalist Gharidah Farooqi described her reaction to the premier's words as "disgusted," "appalled" and "outraged", reported Dawn."Disgusted. Appalled. Outraged. Strongly condemnable. No, Mr PM Khan, women clothing is NOT responsible for temptation leading to rape/assault/violence. ABSOLUTELY NOT! This is victim-blaming and giving a pass to men. Don't insult victims. Don't justify rape as temptation," she tweeted.Another scribe, Shahmir Sanni, said: "What is most heinous about Imran Khan's justifications for rape, is that nearly every woman that has been raped in Pakistan has worn what he would prescribe as modest clothing. This has nothing to do with clothes, but just another man trying to escape accountability. It is sick."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-a-coward-bilawal-bhutto-slams-pak-pm-over-his-remarks-on-rape-101624375814550.html

The annual report has ranked 209 cities across five continents by measuring the comparative cost of more than 200 items, including housing, transportation, food, clothing, household goods, and entertainment. The survey used New York City, ranked 14 on the list, as the base city and currency movements were measured against the US dollar.List of top 10 expensive cities mostly features global financial hubs like Hong Kong, which was the priciest last year, Tokyo, Shanghai, Zurich and Singapore. Mercer has cited Turkmenistan’s ongoing financial crisis as the reason for Ashgabat's high cost of living. Another outlier on the list is third-ranked Beirut which climbed 42 positions up the ranking due to a severe and extensive economic depression owing to several crises, including coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and the Port of Beirut explosion in 2020.Mumbai remains India’s most expensive city at 78th rank but has dropped 18 places in this year’s ranking “due to a relatively weak Indian rupee in comparison with other cities in the ranking.” Other Indian cities on the list are New Delhi (117), Chennai (158), Bengaluru (170), and Kolkata (181).Also Read | Auckland tops Global Liveability Index 2021; Dhaka, Karachi in bottom 10.

22-06-2021||World||‘Zero tolerance for terrorism...’: India takes aim at Pakistan at UNSC debate||India on Tuesday took aim at Pakistan for impeding efforts to improve security and development in Afghanistan, with external affairs minister S Jaishankar calling for zero tolerance for cross-border terrorism and full transit rights for the war-torn country.Jaishankar didn’t name Pakistan in his statement at a UN Security Council debate on the UN assistance mission in Afghanistan, but there was little doubt which country he was referring to IN his remarks. While calling for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to end a surge in violence, including targeted attacks on women, minorities and civil society activists, Jaishankar said India will welcome any move towards a genuine political settlement in Afghanistan.“For enduring peace in Afghanistan, terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries must be dismantled immediately and terrorist supply chains disrupted. There needs to be zero tolerance for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including its cross-border one,” he said, in an apparent reference to Pakistan. “It is equally important to ensure that the territory of Afghanistan is not used by terrorist groups to threaten or attack any other country. Those providing material and financial support to terrorist entities must be held accountable,” he added.Durable peace in Afghanistan, Jaishankar said, requires “a genuine double peace” or peace within and around the country. The world community, he added, must deliver on its commitments to Afghanistan to ensure development and reconstruction. Also read: China raises new militias of Tibetan youth, deploys 1st batch in Chumbi Valley“For Afghanistan’s economic development, it is important to have unhindered access to the high seas. The international community should work towards the removal of artificial transit barriers imposed on Afghanistan and ensure full transit rights guaranteed to Afghanistan under bilateral and multilateral transit agreements without any hindrance,” he said.Pakistan has barred the movement of Indian goods through its territory to Afghanistan while allowing Afghan exports to India, despite strong objections from the government in Kabul over the years. To overcome such transit and transport-related problems, India has launched several air trade corridors between Afghan and Indian cities and developed Iran’s Chabahar port as an alternate access point to Afghanistan. New Delhi’s growing concerns over a recent surge in violence across Afghanistan, largely blamed on the Taliban, also figured in Jaishankar’s comments. He noted the UN secretary-general’s latest report on the situation in Afghanistan had made it clear the intra-Afghan talks hadn’t resulted in a reduction of violence. “On the contrary, violence has only increased, especially after May 1. The country has been witnessing targeted attacks on religious and ethnic minorities, girl students, Afghan security forces, ulemas, women occupying positions of responsibility, journalists, civil rights activists and the youth,” he said.“It is, therefore, crucial that the international community and in particular, this council, presses for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire to ensure immediate reduction in violence and protection of civilian rights,” he added. India has backed all efforts to accelerate dialogue between the Afghan government and the Taliban, but if the peace process is to be successful, it is “necessary to ensure that the negotiating parties continue to engage in good faith, eschew the path to find a military solution, and fully commit towards reaching a political solution”, Jaishankar said. “I would like to reiterate our support for an inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled peace process. Any political settlement in Afghanistan must ensure that the gains of the last two decades are protected and not reversed,” he said, adding the constitutional and democratic framework must be preserved.Jaishankar also highlighted India’s recent steps to support Afghanistan during the transition period, including more than 550 community development projects covering all 34 provinces, an MoU for building the Shahtoot Dam to provide drinking water to Kabul, and the supply of 75,000 tonnes of wheat through Chabahar port to ensure food security amid the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zero-tolerance-for-terrorism-india-takes-aim-at-pakistan-at-unsc-debate-101624374640331.html

Even as they kept their guard up against the highly transmissible Delta variant, first found in India, at least nine countries have started reporting cases of mutated Delta plus variant strain.The Delta plus variant is also called B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1 strain. Out of the details emerging about the Delta Plus variant, the most noticeable one is the fact that the new strain is resistant to the monoclonal antibodies cocktail.India on Tuesday said it has at least 22 cases of the Delta plus variant, which the government has classified as a variant of interest so far. The strain from which it has mutated from Delta has been listed as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization (WHO).The Delta Plus variant of the Covid-19 variant is found in nine countries, including India which has reported 22 cases, the central government said on Tuesday.These countries include the United States, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Switzerland, Japan, Poland, Nepal, China and Russia.Delta variant, officials said is found in 80 nations, including India"In India, 16 of the 22 cases of Delta Plus variant have been found in Ratnagiri and Jalgaon (Maharashtra) and some cases in Kerala and Madhya Pradesh", Rajesh Bhushan, Union health secretary said.As many as 21 cases of the Delta Plus Covid variant, the mutant version of the Delta variant have been found in Maharashtra, health minister Rajesh Tope informed on Monday. Tope further informed that of the 21 cases, nine were reported from Jalgaon in Ratnagiri, seven were from Mumbai and one each from Palghar, Sindhudurg and Thane.The Delta variant is considered to have driven the deadly second wave in India where the country witnessed a crisis with daily cases being clocked at more than 400,000, crematoriums running out of space and wood to cremate bodies and collapse of health infrastructure across states.Officials added that the severity and transmissibility of the Delta plus variant are not known yet."This is a variant of interest that has not yet been classified as a variant of concern. A variant of concern is in which we have understood that there are adverse consequences to humanity by an increase in transmissibility and severity. This is not known yet about the Delta plus variant," VK Paul, NITI Aayog Member (Health) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-plus-variant-traced-in-9-countries-uk-us-japan-china-on-list-101624366833126.html

Jeff Bezos along with his brother, Mark, and another person, presumably an ultra-wealthy space aficionado who won the bid for the third berth on the spaceship for a whopping $28million, will fly to space on July 20.The launch of the New Shepard booster, a launch vehicle named after Alan Shepard who made history by becoming the first American to fly to space, will be a landmark moment for US firms striving toward a new era of private commercial space travel. While Blue Origin has not divulged its pricing strategy for future trips, a Reuters report in 2018 suggested that the space company was planning to charge passengers at least $200,000 for the ride, based on a market study and other considerations.But the announcement also prompted a user called “Ric G.” to start a petition titled ‘Do not allow Jeff Bezos to return to Earth’ on change.org, a popular US-based petition website. “Billionaire's should not exist...on earth, or in space, but should they decide the latter they should stay there,” reads the opening statement. The petition, which was started two weeks ago, has received over 75,000 signatures and has become one of the top-signed petitions on the website.Also Read | Rocket trip to space with Jeff Bezos sells at auction for $28 millionThose signing the petition have their own reasons to not allow Bezos back on Earth. “Being let back into earth is a privilege— not a right. If he wants back in he’s gotta work for it,” wrote a user. “Go back whence you came, and do not return unless you're willing to PAY YOUR GODDAMN TAXES!!!” wrote another user.Earlier in June, Bezos, in an Instagram post, announced that he will travel to space along with his brother, a dream he had since was five years old. “To see the Earth from space, it changes you. It changes your relationship with this planet, with humanity. It's one Earth. I want to go on this flight because it's a thing I've wanted to do all my life. It's an adventure, it's a big deal for me,” said Bezos in the video.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-sign-petition-to-stop-bezos-from-returning-to-earth-after-space-trip-101624368858020.html

That figure has climbed by more than half since 2019, stoked by conflict, climate change and economic shocks.A recent surge in prices for staples, coupled with depreciating currencies, is compounding food insecurity in countries including Nigeria, Lebanon and Zimbabwe. Global corn prices have nearly doubled from last year, and wheat costs are up by 30%, said the agency, which was the latest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.“I am heartbroken at what we’re facing in 2021,” said David Beasley, the WFP’s executive director. “I want to emphasize just how bad it is out there.

Covid cases have sharply declined in countries with high vaccination coverage but anti-vaxxers claim that such immunity may not last very long.Melissa Floyd, a self-described "informed consent advocate" and co-host of "The Vaccine Conversation" podcast, wrote on Twitter that natural immunity from infection always lasts longer than the immunity induced by vaccines. “For the few [vaccines] that last 10-15 years, natural antibodies would have lasted a lifetime (or close to it). There has never been a pathogen where artificial immunity outperformed natural immunity,” tweeted Floyd.Disinformation campaigns to undermine public confidence in Covid vaccines have surged online and authorities have been facing an onerous task to fight vaccine hesitancy. Quoting experts, USA Today said that both infection and vaccination are protective against coronavirus and scientists are yet to arrive at a conclusion whether vaccine-induced immunity lasts longer than the natural immunity given the limited time of virus’ existence.“It is true that natural infection almost always causes better immunity than vaccines. Whereas immunity from disease often follows a single natural infection, immunity from vaccines usually occurs only after several doses,” says Children's Hospital of Philadelphia on its website. However, it highlights that the difference between vaccination and natural infection is the price paid for immunity, citing long-term effects and death due to infection.A study conducted by a team of researchers from Rockefeller University and Weill Cornell Medicine in New York found that immunity among people who contract Covid-19 remains stable up from six months to a year, and they get even better protection when vaccinated. The findings, published in Nature, offer among the first concrete clues that immunity to the Sars-Cov-2 may be long-lasting.Also Read | Immunity lasts at least a year after infection, gets stronger after jab: StudyCiting studies, virologist Sabra Klein told Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health that people who have been infected can benefit significantly from vaccination. On the question of vaccine-induced immunity and natural immunity, Klein stressed that vaccines are tested for their safety in ways that “we could never do with a natural viral infection.”“With infection, you don’t know how bad it’s going to be. By not getting vaccinated, you’re rolling the dice. You may become severely ill. You may have to be hospitalized. You may die,” Klein added.Highlighting the risk of long Covid, the virologist said that a teenage girl who got Covid didn’t have a lot of symptoms initially but now “she has all of the symptoms of long Covid”. “A year later, she is trying to maintain a somewhat normal teenage life with profound fatigue. She has never recovered fully from having Covid,” Klein was quoted as saying.“The claim that immunity from infection is always stronger than immunity from vaccines is [partly false], based on our research. While natural immunity tends to last longer than vaccine immunity, experts say it depends on the pathogen,” said USA Today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/immunity-from-infection-or-covid-19-vaccine-which-one-lasts-longer-101624366027633.html

Only about 8.6% of its eligible population -- comprising people aged 40 years or more -- is fully vaccinated.Bangladesh on Tuesday locked down seven central districts surrounding the capital Dhaka to restrict public transport and human mobility. It reported 4,636 coronavirus cases on Monday, the most in a day since mid-April, raising the caseload to 851,668. The reported death toll is 13,626.Hasina said her administration has announced stimulus steps of about $15 billion, which will help the economy grow 6.1% in the year through June 30, one of the fastest paces in the world.“We have been trying to make a balance between lives and livelihoods,” she said. “Covid-19 is a litmus test for global solidarity.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/declare-covid-19-vaccine-public-good-says-bangladesh-s-sheikh-hasina-101624365486193.html
22-06-2021||World||Long Covid may help understand other chronic diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s||There’s a lot at stake in the quest to understand so-called long Covid. It may come as a surprise to some, but lingering post-infection symptoms don’t only happen with SARS-CoV-2. And what we’re learning from studies of Covid long-haulers might eventually help us understand other diseases, from chronic fatigue syndrome to cancer to Alzheimer’s.“What we're seeing in Covid isn't really exactly new,” said epidemiologist Zihad Al-Aly, who is studying long Covid at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System. “There are a lot of other viruses that produce long-term manifestations.”Before Covid came along, many previously healthy people developed debilitating symptoms or extreme exhaustion following viral infections. Such post-viral syndromes were inherently difficult to study, said NIH director of clinical neurology Avindra Nath. Many patients wouldn’t realize there was something wrong for some time after the initial infection, since it’s normal to feel wiped out for a couple of weeks of being sick.It isn’t yet clear which viruses are likely to cause chronic symptoms or which kinds of people are most at risk from them. Often lumped together as chronic fatigue syndrome, even the numbers are hard to pin down — an Institute of Medicine estimate ranges from 800,000 to 2.5 million cases in the U.S.About 75% are thought to have been triggered by a viral or bacterial infection, according to an article in the Washington Post by two people who have lived for years with the condition. One of them, Brian Vastag, had been a science reporter for the Washington Post before his illness, which started with a sudden fever in 2012. At least now, with long Covid, researchers know which virus has caused the problem. Al-Aly says he hopes what they learn from Covid long-haulers helps them understand chronic fatigue syndrome as well. And he hopes it will help change the way the medical establishment views all post-viral syndromes. “Because we don't fully understand it yet, there's a tendency by some in the medical establishment to disregard this as all in people’s heads.”The experts say between 10% to 30% of those infected with Covid will have some lingering problems. Many people who develop very severe Covid and survive after being in the ICU suffer damage to the heart, lungs, liver and blood vessels that can cause on-going symptoms.Then there’s the separate group of relatively young people — most often people in their late 30s to early 40s and more often women than men — who initially have mild cases of Covid but then go on to develop chronic fatigue and other symptoms that can stretch on for months. Some symptoms might even be permanent.Both kinds of cases are important. People who survived Covid-19 are 59% more likely to die within the following six months than people who were never infected, according to a study led by Al-Aly, which was published in April in the journal Nature, and detailed in this Bloomberg News story.While there are a lot of unknowns here, what is known is that some people do get better on their own, says NIH’s Nath. A few improved after getting the Covid-19 vaccines, he says, though many have relapsed since then. The ones who’ve had symptoms for more than six months are the least likely to recover.Nath says that rather than ordinary fatigue, many people with long Covid suffer from an extreme form of exercise intolerance, where even moderate exertion can deplete them for days. Others have lingering gastrointestinal problems, brain fog, chronic pain, anxiety and depression.At the NIH, he’s testing people reporting these post-viral symptoms — with physiological tests as well as brain scans — and preparing to start clinical trials on drugs that might help them.There are a couple of hypotheses for what causes long Covid. One is the possibility that the virus never really disappears from the body, but finds somewhere to hide. That can happen with other viruses — herpes viruses are a well-known example. The other possibility is that the immune system becomes imbalanced and attacks the body’s own tissues.Last week, researchers published a study aimed at assessing the magnitude of the problem by analyzing electronic health records. They determined that 23% of people who had recovered from Covid-19 went to the doctor for new medical conditions.The problem with that study is that there’s no control group — we don’t know how many people generally would have sought medical treatment during this time. More people may be visiting doctors now because so many “elective” medical visits were cancelled during the height of the pandemic, and fear made people reluctant to seek medical care even signs of heart attacks and strokes.Al-Aly said that his Nature paper did use control groups – comparing people post-Covid with people who hadn’t been infected as well as people who had been sick with influenza. Those studies revealed that Covid-19 infections were much more likely than flu to be associated with health problems — even death — weeks and months later.In the past, infectious diseases were considered something separate from chronic diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. But the distinctions have been falling. Cervical cancer is triggered by a virus, and a theory connecting infections to Alzheimer’s disease is gaining traction. Post-viral syndromes fell through the crack in the middle, but that’s rightly starting to change.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Faye Flam is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist and host of the podcast 'Follow the Science.'

The UN World Heritage Committee on Monday said in a draft report that “there is no possible doubt” that the network of colourful corals off Australia's northeast coast was “facing ascertained danger".Scientists say that the coral reef ecosystem has suffered three major bleaching events since 2015 due to severe marine heatwaves. The report recommended that the world's biggest coral reef ecosystem should be added to Unesco’s list of World Heritage in Danger when the committee considers that question in July.As many as 53 sites are currently on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The latest recommendation by the UN committee comes as a setback as Australia lobbied furiously for years to stay off the endangered list. The Great Barrier Reef losing its World Heritage Site status list could potentially reduce its attraction to tourists.Australia, one of the world's largest carbon emitters per capita, has remained reluctant to commit to stronger climate action and its conservative government has cited jobs as a major reason to back the country's fossil fuel industries. It has not updated its climate goals since 2015. But the threat of losing the World Heritage Site could also impact thousands of jobs dependent on about 5 million people who visit the Great Barrier Reef each year.Also Read | Australia's new deputy PM casts shadow over 2050 net zero emissions ambitionAustralian environment minister Sussan Ley told reporters that the government has expressed “strong disappointment” and “bewilderment” at the proposal to Unesco director-general Audrey Azoulay, adding that the country will oppose the listing.“This decision was flawed. Clearly, there were politics behind it...clearly, those politics have subverted a proper process and for the World Heritage Committee to not even foreshadow this listing is, I think, appalling,” Ley said, apparently hinting at China which chairs the Unesco committee.While Ley didn’t name Beijing, a government official told news agency Reuters that China has been responsible for the committee’s stance. "We will appeal, but China is in control," Reuters quoted the unnamed government official as saying.Australia’s relation with China has deteriorated in recent years, especially after Prime Minister Scott Morrison sought an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and was successful in getting a related resolution passed at the World Health Assembly in 2020.However, environmental groups said that the recommendation was made because Australia was not doing enough to protect the reef. "There is no avenue for any government to have any input. This recommendation is reached by world-renowned scientists," Richard Leck, Head of Oceans for the World Wide Fund for Nature, Australia, told Reuters.The recommendation will now be considered by all 21 countries on the committee of which Australia is also a member. According to the convention, however, Australia will be unable to vote if the panel is unable to reach a consensus.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unesco-recommends-great-barrier-reef-be-listed-in-danger-irks-australia-101624354493692.html

That's the case for Laurel but also the team in New Zealand - they have followed the rules," Ardern told reporters in Wellington."The alternative is to have someone who followed the rules but then is denied the ability to participate."So, ultimately, I leave it to those bodies and that's the decision they have made and it's in keeping with the standard that has been set globally."Hubbard, who will be the oldest lifter at the Games, competed in men's weightlifting competitions before transitioning in 2013.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued guidelines in 2015 allowing transgender athletes to compete as women provided their testosterone levels are below 10 nanomoles per litre for at least 12 months before their first competition.Some scientists have said the guidelines do little to mitigate the biological advantages of those who have gone through puberty as males, such as bone and muscle density.Supporters of transgender inclusion argue the process of transition decreases that advantage considerably and that physical differences between athletes mean there is never a truly level playing field in sport.Australia's weightlifting federation tried to block Hubbard from competing in the women's event at the 2018 Commonwealth Games but has been supportive of her selection for Tokyo.Australian lifter Charisma Amoe-Tarrant, who will compete against Hubbard in the 87 kg division, wished Hubbard well."I have so much respect for her and ... hope we can all come together and enjoy the Olympics," the Nauru-born 22-year-old told reporters in Brisbane on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nz-pm-jacinda-ardern-backs-transgender-weightlifter-s-selection-for-tokyo-games-101624349004907.html

The daily positive rate of infections in Nepal stands at more than 24%, among the highest in the world at this time.The travel restriction was imposed after the climbing season began and there were fresh outbreaks in Nepal.Tsang, 44, who climbed Mount Everest in 25 hours and 50 minutes last month, said getting back home appeared harder than her ascent to the 8,848.86 metre (29,032 feet) peak.“I think the summit climb for me was possible and achievable,” she told Reuters at her hotel in Kathmandu. “But going back home (looks) hopeless. There is no way to go back.”Nepal officials say they have allowed two weekly flights from China, but these were not operational.The Chinese embassy in Kathmandu did not immediately respond to a Reuters email on the lack of flights."There are no flights (from Nepal) to any place in China or Hong Kong,” she said.Climbers from other countries have already returned on mainly chartered flights.China's Sun Yi Quan, 34, who climbed Everest thrice before but gave up on his fourth attempt in May due to a coronavirus outbreak at base camp, said his team of 13 climbers too had failed to get a flight back home.Kathmandu has been partially shut down since May due to the surge in Covid-19 with 622,640 infections and 8,772 deaths in he nation so far.Tashi Lakpa Sherpa, a senior official at the Seven Summit Treks company said more than 30 Chinese climbers were stranded in Kathmandu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harder-than-everest-record-breaking-female-climber-stranded-in-nepal-101624344987210.html
22-06-2021||World||Nursing home deaths in US soared by 32% last year, says govt watchdog||Deaths among Medicare patients in nursing homes soared by 32% last year, with two devastating spikes eight months apart, a government watchdog reported Tuesday in the most comprehensive look yet at the ravages of Covid-19 among its most vulnerable victims.The report from the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services found that about 4 in 10 Medicare recipients in nursing homes had or likely had Covid-19 in 2020, and that deaths overall jumped by 169,291 from the previous year, before the coronavirus appeared.“We knew this was going to be bad, but I don't think even those of us who work in this area thought it was going to be this bad,” said Harvard health policy professor David Grabowski, a nationally recognized expert on long-term care, who reviewed the report for The Associated Press.“This was not individuals who were going to die anyway,” Grabowski added. “We are talking about a really big number of excess deaths.”Investigators used a generally accepted method of estimating “excess” deaths in a group of people after a calamitous event. It did not involve examining individual death certificates of Medicare patients, but comparing overall deaths among those in nursing homes to levels recorded the previous year. The technique was used to estimate deaths in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017 and in New York City after the first coronavirus surge last spring. It does not attribute a cause of death, but is seen as a barometer of impact.Death rates were higher in every month last year when compared to 2019. The report documented two spikes with particular implications for government policy and for protecting the most vulnerable in future outbreaks of life-threatening illnesses. In April of last year, a total of 81,484 Medicare patients in nursing homes died. Then eight months later, after lockdowns and frantic efforts to expand testing — but before vaccines became widely available — nursing home patients accounted for a staggering 74,299 deaths in December.“This is happening long after it was clear that nursing homes were particularly vulnerable,” said Nancy Harrison, a deputy regional inspector general who worked on the report. “We really have to look at that. Why did they remain so vulnerable?” Federal investigators are still drilling down to try to document the chain of causes and effects.Tuesday's report was the most comprehensive yet from the government because it included statistics for the early part of last year, during the initial coronavirus surge. Medicare did not require nursing homes to report Covid-19 cases and deaths occurring before May 8, more than four months into the pandemic year.In another new finding, the report showed that cases and deaths among Asian American patients tracked with the more severe impacts seen among Blacks and Latinos. Indeed, Asian Medicare enrollees in nursing homes saw the highest increase in death rates, with 27% dying in 2020 compared to 17% the previous year. For whites, the death rate grew to 24% in 2020 from 18% in 2019, a significant increase but not as pronounced.Death rates for Hispanic and Black patients were 23% last year, up from 15% in 2019.The inspector general's office based its analysis on Medicare billing data, also including patients in Medicare Advantage plans sold by private insurers. Medicare covers the vast majority of nursing home patients, and the report included long-term residents as well as those temporarily at a facility for rehab care.Health economist Tamara Konetzka of the University of Chicago, who also reviewed the report for AP, said building an estimate from individual death certificates would have faced another set of challenges. Especially in the first wave of the pandemic, many who died would not necessarily have been tested for Covid-19, for example.“By looking at excess deaths you can get away from some of the measurement issues and say how much worse things were in 2020 than in 2019,” explained Konetzka, who has testified before Congress on the impact of Covid-19 in nursing homes.The inspector general's findings about Asians highlight a riddle for researchers, said Konetzka. The reasons for higher cases and deaths among Blacks, Hispanics and Asians may not necessarily be tied to race and ethnicity. Instead, minority patients may be clustered in homes located in communities with more severe outbreaks.The report also found that low-income nursing home patients covered by Medicare and Medicaid together were much more likely to have gotten Covid-19. The infection rate for that group reached 56%, and 26% died.Some states suffered worse impacts. By the end of December more than half of the Medicare patients in nursing homes in Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana and New Jersey had or likely had Covid-19.Across the US, the coronavirus found ideal conditions to spread among frail nursing home patients living in close quarters. Many researchers believe it's likely staffers unwittingly brought the virus in from surrounding communities.Although facilities locked down in March of last year, government efforts to help were haphazard. The industry complained of chronic shortages of protective gear, including basics like masks and gowns.The Trump administration initially delegated responsibility for testing to states before belatedly marshaling more federal resources. HHS later laid the groundwork for vaccinations under the Trump administration, and the Biden administration followed through. As vaccination rates rose, nursing home cases plummeted, allowing facilities to again permit family visits.The country can't move on yet, said deputy inspector general Harrison. “Hopefully, Covid will go away,” she said. “But once that happens, there will always be infectious diseases, and we all need to ask ourselves what we can do to protect vulnerable nursing home residents going forward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-us-nursing-home-deaths-up-32-last-year-says-govt-watchdog-101624338579679.html
22-06-2021||World||‘Yoga originated in Nepal’: KP Sharma Oli’s latest startling claim||Nepal prime minister KP Sharma Oli, whose controversial remarks last year led to friction between India and Nepal, has now claimed that yoga originated in his country, adding that India "wasn't around" when the practice of yoga started in the world."Yoga originated in Nepal, not in India. When yoga came into existence, there was no India as it was divided into various factions," Oli said while addressing a programme held at his residence on the occasion of International Yoga Day.He further said, "India that exists today wasn't there in the past. Divided into factions, India at that time was like a continent or subcontinent. Therefore, yoga originated in Nepal but we were unable to make it popular as we never gave credit to our saints who created it. We always spoke about the contributions of our professors."Beginning 2015, June 21 has been observed annually as the International Day of Yoga, following the concept's inception in 2014 at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). In his address to the UN, Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested observing June 21 as Yoga Day as this is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, and also because the day has a special significance in many parts of the world.Last year, Oli had claimed Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Rama, was actually in Nepal and hence, the deity, too, was from the country. "Although the real Ayodhya lies at Thori, a city to the west of Birgunj, India claims that Lord Rama was born there. Therefore, we too have believed that deity Sita got married to Prince Rama of India," he claimedOli had also called India out for "cultural encroachment" by "creating a fake Ayodhya."(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yoga-originated-in-nepal-kp-sharma-oli-s-latest-startling-claim-101624338203200.html
22-06-2021||World||US has 'wrong' expectation for dialogue: Kim Yo Jong||The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Tuesday that Washington had "wrong" expectations for dialogue with Pyongyang and was facing "greater disappointment", state media reported.Kim Yo Jong's comments came after US national security advisor Jake Sullivan described her brother's first reaction to Washington's recent review of its approach to the North as an "interesting signal".The Biden administration has promised a practical, calibrated approach, including diplomatic efforts, to persuade the impoverished North to give up its banned nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.In response, the North's leader Kim last week said Pyongyang must prepare for both dialogue and confrontation.Washington considered his comments as interesting, Sullivan told ABC News, adding the administration "will wait to see whether they are followed up with any kind of more direct communication to us about a potential path forward".But Kim Yo Jong -- a key adviser to her brother -- appeared to dismiss the prospects for an early resumption of negotiations.The US seemed to be seeking "comfort for itself", she said in a statement reported by Pyongyang's official KCNA news agency.It harboured expectations "the wrong way", she added, which would "plunge them into a greater disappointment".Kim's comments came with the top US diplomat in charge of North Korea negotiations on a five-day visit to Seoul, where he said Monday that Washington was ready to meet with Pyongyang "anywhere, anytime, without preconditions".Just hours before Pyongyang released Kim's statement, US envoy Sung Kim met with the South's unification minister, reiterating Washington's willingness to talk with the North.The North at the weekend admitted it was tackling a food crisis, sounding the alarm in a country with a moribund agricultural sector that has long struggled to feed itself.It is now under self-imposed isolation to protect itself against the coronavirus pandemic, and as a result trade with Beijing -- its economic lifeline -- has slowed to a trickle while all international aid work faces tight restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-wrong-expectation-for-dialogue-kim-yo-jong-101624339536179.html

The self-imposed lockdown has caused further strain on an economy already battered by decades of mismanagement and crippling US-led sanctions over the country's nuclear weapons programme.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during a political conference last week called for officials to brace for prolonged COVID-19 restrictions, indicating that the country isn't ready to open its borders anytime soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yet-to-find-a-single-case-of-covid-19-north-korea-tells-who-101624336537715.html

"Yesterday we were given hamburgers but I couldn’t eat it because there was a foul odor coming from the bread ... I really only eat popsicles and juice because that is the only food that I can trust."A 17-year-old girl from Guatemala also detained at Fort Bliss described sleeping in a large white tent with about three hundred girls, on cots stacked on top of each other.She said it was hard to sleep due to the rattling noise the tent’s metal beams made at night, according to a declaration dated April 28. She said it was cold and that dirt came into the tent.The girl said she had not been able to get information on her case and that she had struggled to get an appointment with a counselor to talk about her depression."A lot of the girls here cry a lot," she said. "A lot of them end up having to talk to someone because they have thoughts of cutting themselves."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/migrant-children-in-us-shelters-report-overcrowding-spoiled-food-depression-101624328492453.html

I expect their focus of their conversation will be to continue to discuss how we can work together to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorist groups who pose a threat to the US homeland,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Monday.Their conversation will also be about how they can work together to continue to implement humanitarian assistance, other assistance that the United States remains committed to, even as the US works to draw down its troops from Afghanistan.At the Pentagon, the Defense Department said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the military leadership "are constantly looking at the pace we're going at, and the capabilities we have, and the capabilities that we're going to need throughout to complete the withdrawal.Biden has directed the Pentagon to withdraw troops from Afghanistan by September 11 this year.The high-level meeting between Biden and Ghani will take place as the Taliban insurgents have in recent weeks captured dozens of new districts in Afghanistan and both sides are said to have suffered heavy casualties.The escalation in fighting between Afghan security forces and Taliban militants have dealt fresh blows to the US-brokered peace negotiations between Kabul and the insurgents.The US military exit from Afghanistan before September 11 stems from the February 2020 agreement Washington signed with the Taliban in return for counterterrorism guarantees and pledges the group would negotiate a political settlement to the war with the Afghan government.In April, President Biden announced that the US will withdraw all remaining troops from Afghanistan by the 20th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks, in an effort to end a deadly conflict that has cost trillions of dollars and the lives of more than 2,300 American troops.Biden has made it clear that a continued military strategy was no longer sustainable in Afghanistan."We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create ideal conditions for the withdrawal and expecting a different result," he said in a major policy speech on April 14 from the Treaty Room of the White House - where former president George W. Bush first informed the nation of US strikes on al-Qaida training camps in Afghanistan in October 2001.In response to Biden's announcement, Afghan President Ghani said his country respects his American counterpart's decision to draw down their troops by September of this year and Kabul will ensure a smooth transition.Ghani pointed out that the Afghanistan National Defence and Security Forces have been carrying out most of the operations independently since the US-Taliban agreement of February 2020 to defend the people and the country."Our forces are capable of defending Afghanistan against current threats," the Afghan president said in a statement in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-biden-looking-forward-to-meeting-aghanistan-s-ghani-white-house-101624327048670.html
22-06-2021||World||EU, UK slap new sanctions on entities, individuals related to Myanmar military coup||The European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom on Monday slapped fresh sanctions on Myanmar state-owned entities and individuals related to the February 1 coup and the subsequent violent repression of peaceful protesters.According to an EU press release, the 27-member European bloc imposed sanctions on 8 individuals, 3 economic entities and the War Veterans Organisation in relation to the military coup staged in Myanmar/Burma on February 1.The individuals targeted by sanctions include ministers and deputy ministers, as well as the attorney general, who are responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law and for serious human rights violations in the country. The four entities are either state-owned or controlled by the Myanmar Armed Forces, contributing directly or indirectly to the military's revenues or activities."By targeting the gems and timber sectors, these measures are aimed at restricting the junta's ability to profit from Myanmar's natural resources, while being crafted so as to avoid undue harm to the people of Myanmar," said the EU in the release.The EU's restrictive measures, which now apply to a total of 43 individuals and 6 entities in Myanmar, include an asset freeze and a prohibition from making funds available to the listed individuals and entities. A travel ban is also in effect for listed persons that prevents them from entering or transiting through EU territory.On the other hand, the UK imposed additional measures on the Myanmar Timber Enterprise and Myanmar Pearl Enterprise, two state-owned entities in Myanmar's extractive sector. These asset freezes will be enforced with immediate effect, and target the junta's ability to profit from pearl and timber, two high-value natural commodities that generate millions in revenue for the military regime.The measures announced today will target the Myanmar regime's economic interest with new designations against the State Administration Council (SAC), the junta's ruling body, who continue to undermine democracy and brutally suppress Myanmar's civilians.In a statement, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the move sends a clear message to the junta that the UK will not allow financial support that props up the military regime following the coup."Alongside our allies, we are placing sanctions on companies linked to Myanmar's military junta, targeting the finances of this illegitimate regime. The military has continued its subversion of democracy and brutal killing of civilians. We will continue to hold the Junta to account and sanction those responsible until democracy is restored," Raab said.He further said that the UK will also strengthen their Overseas Business Risk guidance to reiterate the message that UK businesses must undertake enhanced supply chain due diligence and should not enter into trading relationships that benefit the Myanmar military.This comes after the G7 leaders on Sunday strongly condemned the military coup in Myanmar and the subsequent violence committed by the security forces on civilians. The group called for the immediate release of those detained arbitrarily including civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-uk-slap-new-sanctions-on-entities-individuals-related-to-myanmar-military-coup-101624325197980.html

The report also noted that 26,425 grave violations were committed against children last year, including attacks on schools and hospitals.“More than 19,300 children affected by war last year were victims of grave violations such as killing, maiming or rape. Girls and boys have a right to life and health, free from violence and despair. We must protect them at all costs,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a tweet on Tuesday.More than 19,300 children affected by war last year were victims of grave violations such as killing, maiming or rape.Girls and boys have a right to life and health, free from violence and despair. We must protect them at all costs.https://t.co/c7u0ACXvV9 pic.twitter.com/ZJYKDLNoxuIn its report, the global body also said that the recruitment and use of children, killing and maiming were the most prevalent grave violations against children followed by denial of humanitarian access and abduction. While crimes of abduction grew by 90% in 2020, incidents of rape and other forms of sexual violence increased by 70%, the report also said.“The wars of adults have taken away the childhood of millions of boys and girls again in 2020. This is completely devastating for them, but also for the entire communities they live in, and destroys chances for a sustainable peace,” CAAC special representative Virginia Gamba said. “We can’t erase the past, but we can collectively work at re-building the future of these children, our own future; by putting the willpower, the efforts and the resources to end and prevent grave violations against children, and by supporting their sustainable reintegration and building a future free from conflict for all,” Gamba further added.Also read | UN rights chief seeks Xinjiang visit this year, says HK trials key testAccording to the report, one in four children affected by grave violations were girls, the report said. Girls were most affected by rape and other forms of sexual violence with 98% of incidents of sexual violence perpetrated against girls. “If boys and girls experience conflict differently and require interventions to better address their specific needs, what the data also showed is that conflict doesn’t differentiate based on gender,” Gamba said.The report also noted that the Covid-19 pandemic further complicated the UN’s efforts to reach out to children in situations of armed conflict. “The pandemic increased the vulnerability of children to abduction, recruitment and use, sexual violence and attacks on schools and hospitals, while isolation and measures put in place to combat the pandemic also complicated the work of United Nations child protection monitors and experts,” the report noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/grave-violations-against-children-remained-alarmingly-high-in-2020-over-19-000-children-affected-un-report-101624323865426.html

As a result, the GDP growth is estimated to have contracted by 1.5 per cent in FY20.During the period, half of the working population saw either job or income losses, with informal and low-skilled workers employed in elementary occupations facing the strongest contraction in employment.Pakistan's economy has been growing slowly over the past two decades. The annual per capita growth has averaged only two per cent, less than half of the South Asia average, partly due to inconsistent macroeconomic policies and an under-reliance on investment and exports to drive economic growth, reported the Pakistani daily.The sectors in Pakistan that employ the poorest, such as agriculture, are expected to remain weak, and therefore poverty is likely to remain high, said the WB. The current account deficit is also projected to narrow to 0.8 per cent of GDP in FY21, as a wider trade deficit is offset by stronger remittances inflows.The public debt will remain elevated in the medium term, as well Pakistan's exposure to debt-related shocks, the WB concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poverty-in-pakistan-rose-to-5-4-in-2020-estimates-world-bank-101624322264469.html
22-06-2021||World||Denver: 3 killed in suburb shooting, including officer, suspect||A gunman is believed to have shot and killed an officer and another person in a shopping district in a Denver suburb Monday before being fatally shot by police, authorities said.An officer responded to a call at 1:15 p.m. about a suspicious incident near the library in the city of Arvada, and about 15 minutes later, a 911 call came in about shots fired and the officer hit, Deputy Chief Ed Brady said at a news conference.Another person believed to have been shot by the gunman was taken to a hospital and died, police said. The attacker also was shot and killed.Authorities didn't immediately describe the circumstances of the shooting but said no one else is believed to have been involved. No identities have been released yet.Earlier, police said there were two suspects.The shooting occurred in Olde Town Arvada, the city’s downtown district with shops, restaurants, breweries and other businesses. It’s listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is about 7 miles (10 kilometers) northwest of downtown Denver.It comes three months after a gunman opened fire and killed 10 people, including a police officer, at a supermarket in Boulder, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Arvada.The Arvada officer’s death, just the third in Police Department history, was especially painful after the mass shooting in nearby Boulder, Arvada Mayor Marc Williams said. Arvada police helped respond and investigate that attack, he said.“This is by far the saddest day for our Police Department,” Williams said. Police vehicles lined up for a procession planned to honor the officer who was killed, and some residents lined a street with flags.The mayor said he was in his car in the area shortly before 2 p.m. “when literally I saw 11 police cars with their flashing lights and sirens on race past me. I knew something serious had happened. I didn’t know how serious.”Arvada resident Brady Turner said he was pulling into the Army and Navy store in the area when he noticed police cars driving in behind him and a person on a stretcher being put into an ambulance in between the parking lot and the store. He said he took off in his car.“I just got out of there,” Turner said.About five minutes later, he heard gunshots near the library about a block away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denver-3-killed-in-suburb-shooting-including-officer-suspect-101624319492464.html

It doesn’t function as well," Foster said. “Their immune systems don’t recognize bacteria as easily. They sometimes get sick.”Foster said understanding what happens to the squid in space could help solve health problems that astronauts face.“There are aspects of the immune system that just don’t work properly under long-duration spaceflights," she said. "If humans want to spend time on the moon or Mars, we have to solve health problems to get them there safely.”The Kewalo Marine Laboratory breeds the squid for research projects around the world. The tiny animals are plentiful in Hawaiian waters and are about 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) long as adults.The squid will come back to Earth in July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-sends-squid-from-hawaii-into-space-for-research-101624306398735.html

She said 107 people had been arrested under the law, including 57 formally charged, and that the first trials were due this week."This will be an important test of independence for Hong Kong’s judiciary in its willingness to uphold Hong Kong’s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in accordance with the Basic Law," she said.Government officials in Beijing and Hong Kong say the national security law is needed to avert threats to national security, and that the rights and freedoms of ordinary Hong Kong people are being be protected."The High Commissioner is advised to stop making erroneous remarks against China, and refrain from interfering in China’s sovereignty and judicial independence," Liu said.Critics say the law is being used to crush dissent in the global financial hub, an assertion Beijing rejects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-chief-seeks-xinjiang-visit-this-year-says-hk-trials-key-test-101624306006401.html
22-06-2021||World||Covid rebounds in US South as many junk vaccine||Covid-19 transmission is accelerating in several poorly vaccinated states, primarily in the South, and more young people are turning up at hospitals. The data present the clearest sign of a rebound in the US in months.In Missouri, Arkansas and Utah, the seven-day average of hospital admissions with confirmed Covid-19 has increased more than 30% in the past two weeks, according to the US Department of Health & Human Services. In Mississippi, the hospitalization rate is up 5% in the period.The jump in hospitalization is particularly jarring among 18- to 29-year-olds in the outlier states.The US has made extraordinary progress in its vaccine push, giving at least one jab to more than 53% of the population. But all the states with mounting transmission trail the national average, and Mississippi has given a single jab to just 35%. Young people are less likely to be vaccinated than older groups.In Arkansas, Missouri and Utah, reported Covid-19 cases mirror the concerning trends in hospitalizations. In other places -- namely, Mississippi -- they don’t. Testing has dropped off significantly, with the seven-day average nationwide plummeting 55% in the past three months, which makes case counts a less reliable indicator.Most Covid-19 projections expect subdued transmission during the summer, thanks in part to the seasonal nature of the virus. But the so-called Sun Belt surge last year showed that many Southern states can remain vulnerable as hot summer days drive people indoors in search of air-conditioning.Even for the worst-afflicted states, the situation is nowhere near as alarming as what residents survived as recently as February; absolute numbers of hospitalizations remain far lower. But the signs of an uptick come amid a jump in cases in the UK attributed to the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-rebounds-in-us-south-as-many-junk-vaccine-101624305551469.html

Amazon said on Monday it was reviewing the draft rules and had no immediate comment, while Walmart's Flipkart did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.Under the stricter proposals, e-commerce companies should not hold flash sales in India. These are hugely popular during festive season, but have faced anger among offline sellers who say they cannot compete with the deep discounts online.E-commerce firms must also ensure that none of their "related parties and associated enterprises" are listed as sellers on their shopping websites, and no related entity should sell goods to an online seller operating on the same platform.The changes could impact business structures used by Flipkart and Amazon in the fast growing Indian e-commerce market, industry sources and lawyers said.A Reuters investigation http://reut.rs/2OCOT2W in February showed Amazon had given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers for years. Amazon holds an indirect stake in two of the top sellers on its website, but says it does not give any preferential treatment.Foreign e-commerce players must not make direct sales to consumers, and can only operate a marketplace for sellers.Amazon and Flipkart are also regulated under India's foreign investment rules for e-commerce, and it was not clear if the proposed consumer ministry rules will supersede them or not.The proposal, which is applicable to both Indian and foreign players, is open for public consultation until July 6, the Indian government statement said.The rules also call on companies to make suggestions of alternative products before customers make purchases "to ensure a fair opportunity for domestic goods.""This proposal basically changes the way e-commerce is structured.

As part of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, eligible families can receive as much as $3,600 for each child under the age of 6. The tax credit will be $3,000 annually per child between the ages of 6 and 17.The payments are to be made monthly, a first for the program. People can register for the program even if they did not fully file their taxes.The program is slated to expire after one year, though Biden has proposed extending it through 2025 with the ultimate goal of making it permanent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-launches-public-push-for-child-tax-credit-101624304719498.html

He can now either resign or trigger a snap election.The motion of no confidence was filed on Thursday by the far-right Sweden Democrats, after the Left Party, which has been propping up the government, said it was planning such a motion itself in protest against a government plan to ease rent controls. The conservative Moderate Party and the Christian Democrats were quick to back the motion, which was passed by 181 MPs in the 349-seat parliament.Critics have described the constellation as an “unholy alliance” of parties at opposite ends of the political spectrum.After 11 unsuccessful no-confidence votes in modern Swedish political history, Lofven, who has previously distinguished himself by his ability to survive political crises, becomes the first head of government to be ousted in this way.Lofven, leader of the Social Democrats and PM since 2014, has a week to either announce a snap election or resign, leaving it up to the speaker of parliament, Andreas Norlen, to open negotiations with the parties to find a new prime minister.Speaking after the vote, Lofven said he had a week to speak with other parties and to evaluate his options. He added that his focus would remain doing “what is best for Sweden”. Should he leave it up to Norlen to find a new PM, many analysts feel there is a chance Lofven could be chosen again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/noconfidence-vote-brings-down-sweden-s-govt-101624303982225.html

Seen by experts as highly transmissible, the variant was first identified in India.Dongguan launched its citywide testing programme following two cases reported since Friday. City authorities told residents not to leave, except for essential reasons.Even then, those leaving must show negative test results within 48 hours of departure. Entrances on highways to other cities were closed, while shuttle buses between airports in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and a check-in terminal in Dongguan, were halted.

Why it's a problem||Indicating reluctance towards getting inoculated, younger American adults are turning to Covid-19 vaccines at a slower rate than older adults, in what could hamper the Covid-19 vaccination coverage trajectory in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday. If the reluctance continues in the pace of vaccination till the month of August, the vaccine coverage among younger adults will not reach the level seen in older adults, the CDC pointed out.In a bid to avoid another Covid-19 related crisis that increases the burden on health infrastructure, CDC said more work is needed to increase vaccination rates among younger adults.About 45% of the US population has been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Over 53% of Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine. But US demand for shots has slumped, to the disappointment of public health experts.According to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, of the 57% of American adults who received at least one vaccine dose by May 22, coverage was highest among people 65 or older and lowest among people aged 18 to 29.The vaccination data used by CDC spans from December 14, 2020, to May 22, 2021.The report points out that younger Americans also are more likely to be reluctant to get vaccinated because of concerns over vaccine safety and effectiveness. This has stemmed from data of household surveys conducted from March to May 2021.Among the sections reporting the lowest rates of vaccination are lower-income, non-Hispanic Black adults aged 18–39 with lower levels of education who lacked health insurance and live outside of major cities, CDC said.Nearly one in four adults aged 18-39 said they would probably or definitely not get vaccinated during the survey period, the report said.Vaccine hesitancy is global problem nations have encountered but the health experts and scientists have underlined how crucial vaccines are in the race against time with mutating viruses.The vaccination drive in America began in December last year and early efforts were focused on specific high-risk groups, such as healthcare workers and older adults. This was later expanded to all American adults aged 18 and older, beginning April 19.Offering workplace vaccination programs, paid leave for vaccination and mobile, walk-in clinics with flexible hours could help improve vaccination rates among younger adults, the CDC reported.Covid-19 deaths in the US have dipped below 300 a day for the first time since the early days of the disaster in March 2020, while the drive to put shots in arms approached another encouraging milestone Monday: 150 million Americans fully vaccinated.The coronavirus was the third leading cause of death in the US in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But now, as the outbreak loosens its grip, it has fallen down the list of the biggest killers.CDC data suggests that more Americans are dying every day from accidents, chronic lower respiratory diseases, strokes or Alzheimer’s disease than from Covid-19.With inputs from Agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-young-adults-are-less-likely-to-take-covid-19-vaccine-cdc-explains-why-101624296096612.html
22-06-2021||World||Senior Qatari diplomat says Indian officials engaged in talks with Taliban||A senior Qatari diplomat, involved in the Afghan peace process, said on Monday that Indian officials were engaged in talks with the Taliban, confirming a development first reported by Hindustan Times. Mutlaq bin Majed al-Qahtani, who is the Special Envoy of Qatar’s foreign minister for counter-terrorism and conflict resolution, told the webinar that he believed the Indian side was engaging with the Taliban as the group is seen as a “key component” in any future government in Afghanistan.HT had first reported on June 8 that India has opened channels of communication with Afghan Taliban factions and leaders, including Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, against the backdrop of the rapid drawdown of US forces from Afghanistan. The move marked a significant shift from New Delhi’s position of not engaging with the Taliban in any way.Al-Qahtani, who was participating in a virtual discussion organised by the Arab Center Washington DC on the theme “Looking towards peace in Afghanistan after the US-NATO withdrawal”, made the remarks while answering a question from an Indian journalist on Qatar’s perception of India’s role in the Afghan peace process.“I understand that there has been a quiet visit by Indian officials...to speak with the Talibans. Why? Because not everybody is believing that the Taliban will dominate and take over, because Taliban is a key component of, or should be or is going to be a key component of the future of Afghanistan,” Al-Qahtani said during a webinar, without giving details.“So, I see the reason behind having a dialogue or talks or reaching out to all parties in Afghanistan but it’s important to keep in mind that we are in a critical stage at this time, and I think if any meeting is going to take place, it should be for a major or main reason, which is to encourage the parties to solve their differences by peaceful means,” he added.Al-Qahtani said it was a “golden opportunity” for all stakeholders to take advantage of efforts to usher in peace in Afghanistan. He further said, “Otherwise, nobody is going to recognise – at least as far as Qatar is concerned we are not going to recognise any group or any system or any people who are going to take a country by force.”Also read: As FATF begins plenary meeting, reports emerge of surge in Taliban fund-raising in PakistanNoting that Afghanistan “should not become a place for a proxy [war] among any countries”, he said it was in the interest of both India and Pakistan to have a more stable Afghanistan.“We understand Pakistan is a neighbouring country, India is a country that...as far as we know, invested a lot economically in Afghanistan and they want Afghanistan to be more peaceful and stable,” he added.The Indian outreach is largely being led by security officials and has been limited to Taliban factions and leaders perceived as being outside the sphere of influence of Pakistan and Iran. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the first contacts with Mullah Baradar were established in Qatar, where the Taliban has a political office.External affairs minister S Jaishankar made three transit halts in Doha, Qatar, during his recent visits to Kuwait and Kenya. During the first halt on June 9, Jaishankar met Qatari National Security Adviser Mohamed Bin Ahmed Al Mesned, shortly before al-Qahtani held separate meetings with US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban negotiators the same day.During another transit halt on June 15, Jaishankar met Qatari foreign minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani and minister of state for defence Khalid bin Mohammad Al Attiya. He also held talks with US special envoy Khalilzad and exchanged perspectives on Afghanistan and the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senior-qatari-diplomat-says-indian-officials-engaged-in-talks-with-taliban-101624300537514.html

New Delhi’s response was delivered by Pawan Badhe, first secretary in India’s permanent mission in Geneva.Badhe said it was regrettable that Pakistan again “misused” the UN Human Rights Council to make “unfounded and irresponsible allegations” against India. “The scourge of terrorism is the gravest violation of human rights and must be dealt with in strongest terms in all its forms and manifestations. Pakistan, as its state policy, continues to provide pensions to dreaded and listed terrorists and hosts them on its territory,” he said.“It is high time that Pakistan is held accountable for aiding and abetting terrorism,” he added.Islamabad has been making allegations against New Delhi at the UN Human Rights Council only to distract the body’s attention from the “deplorable human rights situation in Pakistan”, Badhe said.“The plight of minorities in Pakistan is evident from their shrinking size. ‘Forced conversions’ have become a daily phenomenon in Pakistan. We have seen reports of minor girls belonging to religious minorities being abducted, raped, forcibly converted and married. More than 1,000 girls, belonging to religious minorities, are forcibly converted in Pakistan every year,” he said.The systematic persecution of minorities, including Christians, Ahmadiyas, Sikhs and Hindus, through blasphemy laws, forced conversions and marriages and extra-judicial killings has become a regular phenomenon in Pakistan, he added.The religious sites of minorities in Pakistan had also been attacked and vandalised, Badhe said.“Pakistan has also become the land of enforced disappearances, extra-judicial killings and arbitrary detentions of political activists, students, journalists, human rights defenders and minorities,” he said in his response. “Pakistan has the dubious distinction of being listed as one of the most dangerous countries for practice of journalism. Journalists are threatened, intimidated, taken off air, kidnapped and in some cases killed, mainly to silence critics of the establishment, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hold-pak-accountable-says-india-in-rebuttal-to-pak-s-barbs-at-unhrc-meet-101624386281888.html

In many ways, it’s a challenge, a problem quite independent of the Quad,” he said, referring to the grouping that also includes Australia, Japan and the US.With “close up deployments” continuing on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the two “big issues” between New Delhi and Beijing are “whether China would live up to the written commitments it has made about both countries not deploying a large armed force at the border”, and “whether we can build this relationship on the basis of mutual sensitivity, mutual respect and mutual interest”, he said.The Quad, on the other hand, brings together four countries with a common agenda that includes maritime security, connectivity and vaccines. “They have their own agenda, what I would say a set of convergence, a world view. They meet and they talk about a whole lot of things,” he said.Asked about the G7’s approach towards China – which includes cooperation on issues such as climate change, competition in trade and disagreement on matters such as human rights – Jaishankar said India shares the G7’s views on the importance of resilient and reliable supply chains. Also read: ‘Zero tolerance for terrorism...’ - India takes aim at Pakistan at UNSC debate“We feel we can also contribute to it by expanding our own manufacturing capabilities and one of the big initiatives of the Modi government is something called the PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme which is designed to attract more manufacturing into India,” he said. On issues such as open societies and democratic freedoms, there is “much stronger convergence” between India and the G7. “It is a far more issue-based relationship that we are seeing in world politics,” he remarked.Replying to a question on India’s possible participation in the G7’s Build Back Better World or B3W initiative that is aimed at countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Jaishankar said the country has a history of its own connectivity and infrastructure projects in 62 countries.“But what we share with the G7 is that today, it is important to have broad principles that such projects should be viable [and] transparent, they should not contribute to debt, they should be environmentally friendly,” he said. “So it is an area where we do feel that there is a lot of convergence with the G7 and we are looking forward to working with them. But as I said we have a substantial portfolio of projects we have already done in the last few years and which I expect to see us continue to do more in the coming years,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-qatar-economic-forum-jaishankar-highlights-two-big-issues-between-india-and-china-101624386160662.html
22-06-2021||India||Stalin urges 9 CMs to oppose new draft Indian Ports Bill 2021||Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Tuesday wrote to his counterparts in nine coastal states asking them to object to the draft Indian Ports Bill. He wrote to the chief ministers of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Puducherry saying that the bill dilutes the power of states.“You will agree that the present system has led to the good development of minor ports, under the states,” Stalin said in his letter. “This move of the Central government to bring a new bill will have long term adverse implications on the management of minor ports since the state governments will not have any major role anymore if the bill is passed,” he stated in his letter.The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways has framed a new draft to modify the current management model of minor ports and a meeting of the Maritime State Development Council (MSDC) has been called with the state ministers on June 24 to discuss this bill.Stalin added that as per the existing Indian Ports Act, 1908, the powers to plan, develop, regulate and control the minor ports vests with the concerned state governments. However, the new draft bill proposes to change this and transfer many of these powers to the MSDC, which has so far been only an advisory body, he said. Stalin said that they have already taken this up with the Union ministry and they would ‘strongly oppose such steps to reduce the autonomous role of states in the regulation and management of minor ports.’“I propose that all the coastal states and Union territories should express their objection to this new draft Indian Ports Bill 2021 and take joint action to prevent any move to dilute the powers already vested with the states,” he said, requesting all states to communicate along similar similar lines during the MSDC meeting on June 24th.On June 8, Stalin wrote to chief ministers in 12 states - Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana and West Bengal- urging them to write to the Union finance minister and the Reserve Bank of India on the need for a moratorium on loan repayment for MSMEs and small businesses. He urged them to come together once again as the states’ collective effort in asking for vaccines to be procured centrally and distributed free of cost to states. The move led the Union government to revise its position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-urges-9-cms-to-oppose-new-draft-indian-ports-bill-2021-101624385920694.html

In her complaint, the 61-year-old animal rights activist, now popularly known as Sudevi Dasi, mentioned a trespassing incident in October 2020 when the accused fought with the workers and brandished firearms. She has alleged a repeat of such an incident in December last year.“When I intervened to save one of the workers, I was hurled with abuses and given life threats by the accused. They demanded extortion money or otherwise they would assault us regularly," she claimed.Dasi said that the accused created a similar episode on May 25 even after she complained about the matter to the Mathura senior superintendent of police twice in January this year. She has alleged that they assaulted workers and broke down the CCTV cameras installed on the cow shelter premises.Superintendent of police (city) Martand Prakash Singh told news agency PTI that an FIR has been lodged and the matter is further being probed. According to officials, the FIR has been lodged under Indian Penal Code sections 147 (rioting), 452 (trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt)."The local police circle officer and the sub-divisional magistrate have also been to the Radha Surabhi Gaushala on Kaunai Road in Govardhan area of Mathura where she lives and works to review the situation," PTI quoted Singh as saying.The accused in the FIR have been identified as Girdharilal Sharma, Sanjay Sharma, Kanha Sharma, Preeti Sharma, apart from six to seven unidentified persons.Dasi, who first came to India as a tourist in 1978, has been engaged in social service and has been working for animals in the Braj area in western UP for the last four decades. The Padma Shri awardee is a “gau rakshak” who tends to hundreds of cows at ‘Radha Surabhi Gaushala’ that are homeless, abandoned, sick, blind and badly injured. In 2019, the German national threatened to return her Padma Shri over denial of visa extension and then external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj had to step in to resolve the matter.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gau-rakshak-german-woman-living-in-up-alleges-extortion-threat-to-life-101624378993593.html

22-06-2021||India||CDS says new reforms face hurdles but services in agreement on theaterisation||As the government sharpens its focus on laying the groundwork for theatre commands in the backdrop of purported internal resistance, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Tuesday said new reforms face some hurdles but the three services were in agreement on taking theaterisation forward. His remarks came during an interview to a news channel.“These hurdles are also necessary as they make us realise that more discussions are required (to iron out the details of the plan). We are taking the theaterisation plan forward with more discussions,” Rawat told India Today TV.He said the processes for the creation of theatre commands were progressing in line with the prescribed timelines for bringing about jointness among the three services.The government expects Rawat, who took charge as India’s first CDS on January 1, 2020, to bring about jointness among the three services in a three-year time frame (by January 2023). One of the means to achieve this is through the setting up of integrated theatre commands for the best use of military resources to fight future battles.The CDS’s comments came a day after HT reported that while the army and the navy are in favour of theatre commands, the air force has issues over the division of its air assets, the nomenclature of commands, the leadership of theatre commands and dilution of powers of chiefs.Rawat said the armed forces - after several rounds of discussions - have done a lot of work on what kind of joint structures should be set up. “If we operate together and utilise the strengths of the three services, the synergised effort will not be the sum of three; but 1+1+1 (the three services) will equal 111,” he said, emphasising the need for integration.Experts highlighted the need for all stakeholders to cooperate to take the theaterisation forward.“There was no consensus on the appointment of the CDS for 20 years. Ultimately, the government had to decide. Similarly, when it comes to theaterisation, it is for India’s defence and security. No service should feel that they will have an upper hand or become subordinate to another service. We should all be mature enough to take India’s long-term interests into account,” said Lieutenant General DB Shekatkar (retd).Several military reforms are being implemented by the government to make the armed forces more effective on the recommendations of the Shekatkar committee report. The committee is among the several panels that recommended the appointment of CDS and the creation of theatre commands.On Tuesday, Rawat held a meeting with the vice chiefs of the three services and senior officials from the defence, finance and home ministries to discuss all aspects related to setting up theatre commands before the proposal is sent to the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) for approval, officials familiar with the developments said.A lack of consensus on the military’s theaterisation model emerged earlier this month during a key meeting of top government officials who reviewed a draft cabinet note on the new joint structures.This led to the government setting up an expert committee last week to carry out consultations on the long-awaited military reform, as reported by HT on June 18. The panel has members of the armed forces, defence ministry and other ministries involved in the planning and implementation aspects of theaterisation.“More discussions will take place to give a push to reach an agreement on the theaterisation plan,” said one of the officials cited above.Theaterisation refers to placing specific units of the army, the navy and the air force under a theatre commander. Such commands are to be led by an officer from any of the three services, depending on the roles assigned to them.The key points discussed during the meeting in South Block in early June included the executing authority for theatre commands, the geographies they will control, command and control structures, budgeting and placing some paramilitary forces under the commands. Some of these issues involve the finance and home ministries.HT reported in February that India was set to begin a formal roll-out of its long-awaited theaterisation plan, with the Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command likely to be launched by May. Deliberations on the proposal are likely to take more time as all stakeholders have to be brought on board and the previous timelines may have to be revised, as previously reported by HT.Apart from the Air Defence and Maritime Theatre Commands, India is expected to have three other integrated commands to secure its western, northern and eastern fronts. In addition, a logistics command is in the works to avoid duplication of efforts and resources.The operational control of all the theatre commands will eventually come under CDS, with the service chiefs being responsible for raising, training and sustaining their forces.Rawat wears three hats — he is the permanent chairman of chiefs of staff committee (COSC), heads the department of military affairs (DMA), and is also the single-point military adviser to the defence minister.The CDS will have operational control over all the integrated commands when they are fully functional - this will be in his role as the CDS, and not as permanent chairman, COSC. This will require some restructuring in the DMA.The restructuring could involve the chief of integrated defence staff to COSC, or CISC, being appointed as the secretary of DMA in due course to allow the CDS to focus on the theatre commands, senior officials earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cds-gen-rawat-says-new-reforms-face-hurdles-but-services-in-agreement-on-theaterisation-101624377700947.html

The meeting, organised under the banner of 'Rashtra Manch,' by TMC leader Yashwant Sinha comes amid speculations that the opposition is planning to form an alliance against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Rashtra Manch is a political action group formed in 2018 that targeted the BJP-led government's policies. Sinha is the convenor of the group. The meeting lasted for more than two hours, said Sinha, adding, "many issues were discussed during the meeting."Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) leader Nilotpal Basu, who was also part of the meeting, refused to call it a "political meeting" and said it was just an "interaction among like-minded people." "Issues like Covid management, 'attack' on institutions and unemployment were discussed at the meeting," he informed while speaking to the media after the meeting.Notably, no Congress leader participated in the meeting. On this, Majeed Memon, a senior leader of Pawar's NCP, said there "was no political exclusion." "This meeting was called by Rashtra Manch chief Yashwant Sinha and convened with the help of all founding members and workers of Rashtra Manch. This is being said that Sharad Pawar Sahab is taking a big political step and Congress has been boycotted. This is incorrect." ANI quoted Memon as saying."We have invited the leaders who subscribe to the ideology of Rashtra Manch in which leaders of all political parties could come. There is no political discrimination. I personally invited Congress members," he also said.He further asserted that "the perception that there is going to be a big opposition group excluding Congress is wrong."Meanwhile, Ghanshyam Tiwari of SP, said, "summary of today's meeting is that there is a need for preparation of an alternate vision in the country, that is strong to address issues related to the common man."The closely watched meeting by the political experts, also saw the attendance of SP's Ghanshyam Tiwari, RLD president Jayant Chaudhary, Sushil Gupta from AAP, Binoy Viswam from the CPI. National Conference (NC) leader and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah, former Congress leader Sanjay Jha and former Janata Dal (United) leader Pavan Verma were also there.Other prominent personalities who arrived at Pawar's residence to attend the meeting were Javed Akhtar and KC Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-a-political-meeting-leaders-from-opposition-parties-gather-at-pawar-101624375289706.html

22-06-2021||India||Delta Plus variant: Health ministry alerts Maharashtra, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh||The Union health ministry on Tuesday alerted Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh governments on the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 after certain districts reported the presence of the virus in some of the samples tested from these states. It advised the authorities to strictly enforce the Covid-19 protocols and intensify containment measures in the districts where the variant has been found.“In India, 16 of the 22 cases of Delta Plus variant have been found in Ratnagiri and Jalgaon (Maharashtra) and some cases in Kerala and Madhya Pradesh,” Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said during the daily Covid-19 press briefing. The health ministry has advised the chief secretaries of these states to take up immediate containment measures in the districts and clusters on a priority basis. The health ministry’s advisory comes after Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequencing Consortia (INSACOG) found Delta Plus variant in genome sequenced samples from Ratnagiri and Jalgaon Districts of Maharashtra; Palakkad and Pathanamthitta Districts of Kerala; and Bhopal and Shivpuri districts of Madhya Pradesh.The health ministry also said that India is among the nine countries where the Delta Plus variant has been detected. It said that the variant has been detected in the US, UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Japan, Poland, Nepal, China and Russia. The health ministry said based on data received from the INSACOG so far it found that the Delta Plus variants have three main characteristics -- increased transmissibility, stronger binding to receptors of lung cells, potential reduction in monoclonal antibody response.“The states’ chief secretaries have been advised to take up immediate containment measures in the districts and clusters (as identified by INSACOG) including preventing crowds and intermingling of people, conduct widespread testing, prompt tracing as well as vaccine coverage on a priority basis,” the health ministry said in a press release.“They were also advised to ensure that adequate samples of positive persons are promptly sent to the designated laboratories of INSACOG so that clinical epidemiological correlations can be made for further guidance to be provided to the states,” the release further added.The health ministry on Tuesday said that the variant has not yet been categorised as ‘variant of concern’ but it is currently accorded the ‘variant of interest’ status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-plus-variant-health-ministry-alerts-maharashtra-kerala-madhya-pradesh-101624374443286.html

She was 96.A recipient of many awards and honours including the Padma Shri in 2017, Ponnammal performed across the world and trained singers like KS Chitra and Omanakutty Amma during her eight-decade-long career. Her last public performance was in 2019 in Thiruvananthapuram. Some of her best renditions include compositions of Irayamman Thampi and KC Kesava Pillai.She sang at the Navaratra Mandapam in Sree Padmanabha Swami temple in Thiruvananthapuram in 2006 with the help from erstwhile Travancore royal family that was once custodian of the temple, breaking a 300-year-old tradition that barred women from performing at its Navratri celebrations.“Ponnammal teacher was the last word in Carnatic music. Her passion for music was unparalleled,” said noted Carnatic vocalist Dr Omanakutty Amma. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan also condoled her death, describing her as the “symbol of a great tradition of music.”Ponnammal started learning music in 1932 when she was just eight and was the first female student in 1940 to enrol at Thiruvananthapuram’s Swathi Thirunal College of Music that opened a year earlier. It was then known as The Music Academy.The young singer, born in a Tamil Brahmin family in Parassala, a small town along Kerala-Tamil Nadu border in 1924, passed out of the academy with distinction in ‘Gana Bhushanam’ and ‘Gana Praveena’ courses. She later trained under some of the legends of Carnatic music like Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and Papanasam Sivan.Ponnammal started her career as a music teacher in Cotton Hills Girls High School in Thiruvananthapuram and later joined Swathi Thirunal College of Music, her alma mater, as a teacher and later rose to become its principal. Later, she became the principal of the RLV College of Music and Fine Arts in Tripunithura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/renowned-carnatic-vocalist-parassala-b-ponnammal-dies-at-96-101624371220154.html
22-06-2021||India||China raises new militias of Tibetan youth, deploys 1st batch in Chumbi Valley||New Delhi: China’s military has raised new militias comprising Tibetan youths in the strategic Chumbi Valley in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) as part of enhanced efforts to recruit more Tibetans amid the standoff with India on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), people familiar with the developments said on condition of anonymity citing intelligence reports.Since last year, Indian security agencies have gathered information on the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) holding recruitment drives across TAR to rope in more locals. However, these are the first reports about the raising of new Tibetan militias in the eastern segment of the LAC, the people said.At least two batches of Tibetans have been recruited for the militias; each batch comprises about 100 youths. One batch has completed its training with the PLA and has been deployed at different locations across Chumbi Valley, including Yadong, Cheema, Rinchengang or Renqinggang, PB Thang and Phari, the people said. The second batch is being trained at a PLA facility in Phari, the people said, citing intelligence reports and communications intercepts from different security agencies. The militias currently operate without uniforms or ranks, the people added.“The militias are being raised with the aim of being deployed mostly in local border areas to exploit their knowledge of the local terrain, language, demography and weather conditions,” one of the people cited above said. The militias are separate from the Special Tibetan Army Unit recently created by the PLA. Hindustan Times had first reported on the PLA’s efforts to raise its first formation comprising soldiers of Tibetan ethnicity on April 17.Indian security agencies are keeping a close watch on the development in view of the strategic location of Chumbi Valley, a 100-km protuberance of Chinese territory located between Bhutan in the east and Sikkim in the west. The valley’s location has long resulted in concerns that it could be used to launch operations to snap strategic communications links in the Siliguri Corridor. The security agencies have also learnt that Tibetans recruited into the PLA’s Special Tibetan Army Unit are taken to Buddhist monks for their blessings after completing their training.“There are no records of such a practice of taking Tibetan recruits to Tibetan monks for their blessings. This is likely a new strategy by the PLA to get some religious mileage from the newly-recruited Tibetan troops,” the person cited above said. HT had earlier reported that PLA officials from Lhasa visited Rudok town in Ngari Prefecture in the far west of TAR in the third week of February to recruit Tibetans soldiers. The officials also travelled to Zanda or Tsamda County, a border region of TAR, to select Tibetan recruits from several PLA camps for induction into the special unit. According to China’s official statistics from 2010, there were 2.1 million Han service personnel, compared to 4,300 Tibetans. More recent figures aren’t readily available.These developments have come against the backdrop of the border standoff that began in May last year and a rapid build-up of infrastructure on the Chinese side along the LAC, including airports, helipads, missile facilities and air sites. The disengagement process along the LAC has also stalled after a limited drawdown of troops, armoured formations and artillery on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February.An expert on Tibet, who declined to be named, said the PLA’s efforts appeared to be aimed at roping in more unemployed Tibetan youths and also countering India’s Special Frontier Force, a secretive unit comprising Tibetans that was used in operations near Pangong Lake last year.“Most Chinese troops are from the plains and can’t perform well at high altitudes. The Chinese also realise it is best for them to recruit young Tibetans who are unemployed. It is not just about targeting India but also about gaining the sympathy of unemployed young men,” the expert said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-raises-new-militias-of-tibetan-youth-deploys-1st-batch-in-chumbi-valley-101624371160233.html

Therefore, a large number of countries are interested in taking the technology and using it,” he told ANI.India on Monday launched the universal Covid-19 vaccination programme in which it will provide free vaccines to all states and Union territories for those under 18-45 category. This comes after the Centre kickstarted the revised Covid-19 immunisation policy on June 1 wherein it is procuring and supplying 75 per cent of total vaccine supplies for free to the states and Union territories.A statement issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday stated that more than 21.4 million vaccine doses are still available with the states and Union territories to be administered. Moreover, over 33,80,590 doses are in the pipeline and will be received by the states and UTs within the next three days.India on Tuesday recorded the lowest daily case count with 42,640 cases in the last 24 hours. This was the first time in over three months that the daily caseload was less than 50,000. The active case count has also declined to less than seven lakh after 79 days with 6,62,521 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/result-of-coordinated-planning-centre-on-india-s-highest-single-day-vaccination-101624369447973.html

Referring to the issue as a “personal family matter”, he told ANI, “If we start looking into the personal lives of others, it can be problematic for many people belonging to many parties.”His remarks come after the Bharatiya Janata Party's lawmaker Sanghamitra Maurya made an appeal to Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla to take action against Nusrat Jahan. “TMC MP Nusrat Jahan in her bio (in Lok Sabha) mentioned that she is married and her husband’s name is Nikhil Jain. She took oath as Nusrat Jahan Ruhi Jain. Now she is saying that her marriage is invalid,” Maurya, the BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh’s Badaun, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Ghosh defended Jahan earlier as well by saying that the issue of her marriage is personal and has got no connection with either politics or the party. Taking to Twitter on June 10, he said that BJP’s Amit Malviya should not comment on the matter as it won’t be good for the ruling dispensation if a debate starts. Ghosh said that the TMC is busy working for the people.“TMC MP Nusrat Jahan Ruhi Jain’s personal life, who she is married to or who she is living in with, should not be anyone’s concern. But she is an elected representative and is on record in the Parliament that she is married to Nikhil Jain. Did she lie on the floor of the House?” Malviya tweeted.Jahan, who is TMC’s Basirhat MP, released a statement on June 9 saying her marriage to businessman Nikhil Jain in 2019 was invalid as an interfaith marriage requires validation under the Special Marriage Act in India, which did not happen. “As per the court of law, it is not a marriage, but a relationshipor a live-in relationship. Thus, the question of divorce does not arise. Our separation happened long back, but I did not speak about it as I intended to keep my private life to myself,” she added in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-trying-to-politicise-nusrat-jahan-s-marriage-says-tmc-s-kunal-ghosh-101624367605083.html

22-06-2021||India||Not looking to ban flash sales, e-commerce rules not final, clarifies govt||The Centre on Tuesday said it will not seek disclosure of flash sales from e-commerce players to regulate the fraudulent sale of goods and services but will take appropriate action as per the law on consumer complaints.Discount sales that benefit maximum to consumers will continue, but not fraudulent flash sales on the e-commerce platforms, the government said, adding that the etailers need not be "anxious" about the draft rules.Ban on fraudulent flash sales, mis-selling and appointment of chief compliance officer/grievance redressal officer -- are among key amendments proposed to the Consumer Protection (e-commerce) Rules, 2020, on which the government has sought public comments by July 6."We are not going to seek disclosure of flash sales. We are with sales that benefit maximum consumers. If someone wants to complain, there should at least be a provision," said Nidhi Khare, Additional Secretary in the Consumer Affairs Ministry.She also made it clear that the ministry "will not regulate" the trade on e-commerce platforms. And the e-commerce players need not be anxious about the proposed changes in the rules."We will take action on fraudulent flash sales if we receive any complaints or CCPA (Central Consumer Protection Authority) can take Suo moto cognizance," she said while briefing the media on this issue.Further, Khare said such fraudulent flash sales are also being evaluated in western countries because many times shell companies organise flash sales without any inventory, which is against the interest of consumers and limits fair competition."This is a step taken in time. These markets are evolving, consumer preferences are evolving. We have to keep pace with the changes so that consumers are not duped," she added.The government assured that discount sales will continue. "Such competition actually helps the business overall to bring goods at better prices to consumers. We are not against that," she said.Khare is also the chief commissioner of the CCPA.She said the consumer affairs ministry’s role is to safeguard the interest of consumers and hence the draft rules. Otherwise, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is the main regulator.Among other amendments, the government has proposed registration of every e-commerce entity which intends to operate in India with the DPIIT.When asked why the proposed amendments do not specify a time frame for the appointment of compliance officer and grievance redressal officer, the official said: "I take note of this point. We can change 'as soon as possible' to 'effective from the date of the notification".Based on public comments from different stakeholders, the proposed amendments to the rules will further be modified, she said.The proposed changes to the rules were necessary as e-commerce business in India is evolving and more consumers are shopping online, Khare noted."Initially, marketplaces started on a premise that they were only platforms, where buyers and sellers come and do transactions. Now e-commerce is evolving and they have their own private labels.“It is because of this evolving situation, we thought we need to further strengthen. That's why we brought new features to protect consumers and encourage fair trade practices," she explained.Asked why there is no regulation on cheap discount sales offered in offline markets, Khare said: "That is not true. Today, you have features of product liability for stores and anybody can sue them. Consumers can file if their rights are infringed. So, many cases are filed in consumer courts".The Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 were first notified in July last year. Their violations attract penal action under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-looking-to-ban-flash-sales-e-commerce-rules-not-final-clarifies-govt-101624366261758.html

"Their silence definitely hurts... My father Ram Vilas Paswan and I stood by BJP like a rock, but they're not there when I expected them in such difficult times," Chirag Paswan told PTI.Chirag Paswan also said that the relations with the Bharatiya Janata Party "cannot remain one-sided". "But if you are cornered, pushed and forced to make a decision, then the party will consider all probabilities... The LJP will have to make a decision about its political future based on who stood by it and who did not," Chirag Paswan was quoted as saying by the news agency.Chirag Paswan, the son of party founder Ram Vilas Paswan, said it was not "appropriate" for the BJP to keep quiet while the JD(U) worked to "engineer" a split in the LJP. The BJP, on its part, insists that the LJP crisis is an internal matter of the regional party.Also read | Chirag and Tejashwi: A tale of two Bihar GenNext leadersThe LJP leader also once again alleged that Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal(United) or JD(U) played a "visible" role in splitting his party and has had a history of doing so. Kumar, he said, never wanted a Dalit leader to gain in stature and tried to weaken his father.Chirag Paswan was removed recently as the party chief by a faction of the LJP headed by Hajipur MP Paras, prompting Paswan’s loyalists to respond by stripping five rebel parliamentarians of the LJP’s primary membership. The party, which has six MPs but no MLAs, plunged into a crisis after the five lawmakers, including Chirag's cousin, rebelled against Paswan’s leadership and chose Paras as the new leader of the parliamentary party.Paswan has said he will take out a “Ashirvad Yatra” in Hajipur on July 5 to mark the birth anniversary of his father, who died in October last year. “The march taken out from Hajipur will continue for two months, during which party members will cover all 38 districts, and it will culminate at Patna in the form of a grand rally,” Paswan said after the Sunday meeting of the LJP's national executive in New Delhi.Also read | LJP warring factions move Election Commission staking claim over partyThe two-time MP also asserted that 90 per cent of the national executive members were with him and attended the meeting. “Uncle (Paras) has acted against the party’s constitution along with rest of the MPs and hence the party suspended them all,” he said.Paras has been recognised as the LJP parliamentary party leader in the Lok Sabha. Paswan met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla last Saturday and urged him to reconsider his decision to recognise Paras as the parliamentary party leader, saying it was against the party’s constitution. He also said that the party will consider taking the legal route if his demand was not considered by the Lok Sabha Speaker.On his part, Paras dismissed the meeting as an assembly of a “rented crowd” and said it held no legitimacy. He said the Election Commission will now decide on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/-bjp-s-silence-definitely-hurts-says-chirag-paswan-amid-ljp-feud-101624363618232.html

Delta plus, formed by mutation in the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, is currently a "variant of interest", and hasn’t been classified as a "variant of concern" by the Union health ministry yet, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said during a press briefing.In India, 16 of the 22 cases of Delta plus variant have been found in Ratnagiri and Jalgaon in Maharashtra and some in Kerala and Madhya Pradesh, Bhushan also said. He added that the Delta plus variant has been found in the US, the UK, Portugal, Switzerland, Japan, Poland, Nepal, China and Russia besides India.Speaking on the overall situation, the government said that it is improving but stressed people must continue to follow Covid-19-appropriate behaviour. It said there has been an almost 90 per cent decline in India's daily Covid-19 cases as compared to the highest peak reported on May 7.The country registered less than 50,000 new coronavirus infections, the lowest in 91 days, taking the total tally of cases to 29,977,861, while active cases fell below 700,000 after 79 days, the Union health ministry's data on Tuesday showed. A total of 42,640 Covid-19 cases were reported in a day and the death toll climbed to 3,89,302 with 1167 daily fatalities, the lowest in 68 days.NITI Aayog VK Paul, who was also part of the conference, said that India achieved a "historic milestone" of administering more than 8.8 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine in a single day on June 21. Out of this nearly 64 per cent of the jabs were given in rural areas, Paul highlighted.Of the total doses, 36.32 per cent were administered in urban areas and 63.68 per cent in rural areas, he informed. Madhya Pradesh administered the maximum number of doses on June 21, followed by Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Assam, Paul also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/22-cases-of-delta-plus-covid-19-variant-found-in-india-govt-101624363197441.html

Visuals shared by news agency ANI showed Communist Party of India leader Vinoy Biswam, Trinamool Congress leader Yashwant Sinha, Bollywood lyricist Javed Akhtar, Rashtriya Lok Dal President Jayant Chaudhary and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah reach the NCP supremo’s residence for the meeting.Leaders from the Aam Aadmi Party and eminent personalities like Pawan Verma, Justice AP Singh, KTS Tulsi and Karan Thapar will also attend the meeting.“It is a platform of all secular, democratic Left forces against the most hated government which has failed. The country needs a change. The people are up for a change,” Viswam was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The Shiv Sena, which is the NCP’s partner in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, said that it is not a ‘meeting of all opposition parties’. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said that it is a meeting with Rashtra Manch leaders.“As per my information and from whatever conversation I had with Pawar saheb, there is a meeting of Rashtra Manch leaders today with Pawar saheb.

22-06-2021||India||'Pleasant departure from past': PM Modi praises Centre-state cooperation amid pandemic||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday praised the cooperation between the Centre and states amid the coronavirus pandemic saying that they were able to borrow significantly more in 2020-21 and raise an extra ₹1.06 lakh crore. PM Modi said, in a blog on LinkedIn, 23 states availed of additional borrowings of ₹1.06 lakh crore out of a potential ₹2.14 lakh crore."This significant increase in the availability of resources was made possible by an approach of Centre-State bhagidari. When we formulated our economic response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we wanted to ensure that our solutions do not follow a ‘one size fits all’ model," PM Modi wrote in the blog "Reforms by Conviction and Incentives"."For a federal country of continental dimensions, finding policy instruments at the national level to promote reforms by State Governments is indeed challenging. But, we had faith in the robustness of our federal polity and we moved ahead in the spirit of Centre-State bhagidari," he said.PM Modi said in May 2020, as part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat package, the Centre announced that state governments would be allowed enhanced borrowing for 2020-21. An extra 2 per cent of gross state domestic product (GSDP) was allowed, of which 1 per cent was made conditional on the implementation of certain economic reforms, he added.This was a nudge, which PM Modi called "rare in Indian public finance", incentivising the states to adopt progressive policies to avail additional funds. "The results of this exercise are not only encouraging but also run contrary to the notion that there are limited takers for sound economic policies," he added.Also read | As Bengal battle persists, lessons from Vajpayee-era on Centre-state tensionsThe reforms were linked to "improving the Ease of Living to the public and particularly the poor, the vulnerable, and the middle class. Secondly, they also promoted fiscal sustainability". A financial incentive of .25 per cent was attached to each reform.PM Modi wrote that the four reforms to which additional borrowings were linked had two characteristics. Each of the reforms was linked to "improving the Ease of Living to the public and particularly the poor, the vulnerable, and the middle class. Secondly, they also promoted fiscal sustainability", he said.The first reform under the One Nation One Ration Card policy required state governments to ensure that all ration cards under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) were linked with the Aadhaar numbers of all family members and that all fair price shops had electronic point of sale devices. "The main benefit from this is that migrant workers can draw their food ration from anywhere in the country," he said."The second reform, aimed at improving ease of doing business, required states to ensure that renewal of business-related licences under 7 Acts is made automatic, online and non-discretionary on mere payment of fees," he wrote.Also read | Navigating Centre-state fiscal ties"The third reform required states to notify floor rates of property tax and of water & sewerage charges, in consonance with stamp duty guideline values for property transactions and current costs respectively, in urban areas. This would enable a better quality of services to the urban poor and middle class, support better infrastructure and stimulate growth," he wrote.The fourth reform was the introduction of Direct Benefit Transfer or DBT in lieu of free electricity supply to farmers.This was a pleasant departure from the past and the Centre and states came together to roll out public-friendly reforms in a short span of time amidst the pandemic. "This was made possible due to our approach of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas. Officials who have been working on these reforms suggest that without this incentive of additional funds, the enactment of these policies would have taken years. India has seen a model of ‘reforms by stealth and compulsion’. This is a new model of ‘reforms by conviction and incentives’," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-praises-centre-state-cooperation-amid-covid-19-pandemic-101624360470786.html

Stalin wrote to his counterparts in Gujarat, Goa, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and the Union Territory of Puducherry seeking their support in opposition to the bill.Stalin said that the bill will have adverse implications on the management of the minor ports and also reduce the state government’s autonomy in the port’s regulation and management. The Tamil Nadu chief minister argued that under the current system ports have seen good development.“Further to this, many powers currently exercised by state governments would be taken over by the Union government. Therefore, I propose that all the coastal states and Union territories should express their objection to this new draft Indian Ports Bill 2021 and take joint action to prevent any move to dilute the powers already vested with the states,” Stalin said in his letter."You will agree that the present system has led to the good development of minor ports, under the states. This move of the Central Government to bring a new Bill will have long-term adverse implications on the management of minor ports, since the state governments will not have any major role anymore if the Bill is passed. I propose that all the coastal states and union territories should express their objection to this new draft Indian Ports Bill 2021 and take joint action to prevent any move to dilute the powers already vested with the states,” he further added.The Union ministry of ports, shipping and waterways framed the bill which modifies the management model of minor ports. The bill proposes to confer to MSDC the powers to plan, develop, regulate and control minor ports which according to the existing Indian Ports Act, 1908, lie with the state governments. The MSDC, which so far acted as an advisory body, will take control of the development of minor ports.The ports and shipping ministry will hold a meeting with the Maritime State Development Council (MSDC) and state ministers on Thursday to discuss the bill.Stalin said that the state government will pass resolutions against the Centre’s farm laws and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the budget session of the state assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-says-centre-s-ports-bill-reduces-states-autonomy-asks-9-cms-to-oppose-101624357412362.html
22-06-2021||India||UK liaison officer at Indian navy facility that monitors threats in Indian Ocean||The UK on Tuesday posted a liaison officer at a key Indian Navy centre that tracks shipping and monitors threats such as maritime terrorism and piracy in regional waters, joining countries such as the US, Australia, France and Japan that have a presence at the facility. Lieutenant Commander Stephen Smith will be based full-time at the Information Fusion Centre-Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR) in Gurugram, serving as the UK’s international liaison officer (ILO). He will work directly with India’s armed forces and liaison officers from partner nations to enhance maritime domain awareness in the region. Smith’s induction will build on the commitment by the UK and Indian prime ministers to boost cooperation with the launch of the 2030 Roadmap in May, the British high commission said in a statement. Also Read | EU, UK slap new sanctions on entities, individuals related to Myanmar coupThe move comes weeks after the UK’s largest warship, the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, and its strike task group embarked upon its maiden voyage that will bring it to the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. Speaking about the deployment of the British liaison officer at the information fusion centre, Admiral Tony Radakin, the UK’s chief of naval staff, said he was “excited at the opportunities this position brings us for closer UK-India collaboration and information sharing”. He added, “Coming as a natural outgrowth of the strong partnership between the Royal Navy and Indian Navy, this is a significant step up in our shared maritime domain awareness effort, and boldly underlines UK and Indian desires to work together in the Indian Ocean Region and wider Indo-Pacific.” Acting British high commissioner Jan Thompson said the UK is committed to becoming the “European country with the broadest, most integrated presence in the Indo-Pacific in support of trade, shared security and values”. The posting of the British officer at the Indian Navy centre is “another tangible step to enhance our joint capability to tackle shared challenges”, she said. The international liaison officers act as contacts between their countries and the Indian Navy for sharing information on the movement of merchant vessels and maritime threats. The US, Australia, France and Japan had earlier posted liaison officers at the IFC-IOR that was established in December 2018. The three main objectives of the IFC-IOR are confidence and capacity building among partner nations to ensure swift and accurate exchange of information on maritime security, extensive linkages to ensure comprehensive maritime domain awareness of the region, and use of hi-tech and analytic tools for maritime traffic analysis to predict emerging threats and trends. The Indian Navy took the initiative of launching the IFC-IOR because more than 75% of the global maritime trade and 50% of daily global oil consumption passes through the region, and the presence of threats such as maritime terrorism, piracy, human and contraband trafficking and illegal and unregulated fishing. The UK has contributed more than £20 million to tackle piracy in the western Indian Ocean region, and Britain’s white shipping agreement with India enables information-sharing across the region. Gavin Thompson, the defence adviser at the British high commission, described the IFC-IOR as an “excellent platform to enable closer engagement and ensure greater sharing of information on vessels of interest”. “The UK and Indian armed forces already enjoy high levels of interoperability, which will be on full display during the upcoming visit of the UK’s carrier strike group, led by one of our largest aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth. The appointment of the UK liaison officer forms part of our enhanced maritime partnership to bolster security in the Indian Ocean,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-liaison-officer-at-indian-navy-facility-that-monitors-threats-in-indian-ocean-101624357779719.html

Puri said Delhi has more than 11 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines, yet only 76,259 people were inoculated."On a day India vaccinated more than 84 lakh people, Delhi administered only 76,259 out of more than 11 lakh doses available. Why?" the civil aviation minister said on Twitter.On a day India vaccinated more than 84 lakh people, Delhi administered only 76,259 out of more than 11 lakh doses available. Why?Instead of focusing on health & welfare of people of Delhi, Kejriwal Ji is busy in Punjab searching for a Sikh CM face for his party.He said the Delhi chief minister busy in preparing for Punjab elections. "Instead of focusing on health & welfare of people of Delhi, Kejriwal Ji is busy in Punjab searching for a Sikh CM face for his party," said Puri. The Delhi chief minister was in Amritsar on Monday where he said that AAP's chief ministerial face for next year's Punjab Assembly election will be from the Sikh community. "One thing I can tell you is that the entire Punjab will be proud of him," Kejriwal said.Puri's tweet came in response to accusations from Kejriwal's deputy Manish Sisodia that the Centre is exporting Covid-19 vaccines at a time when thousands of Indians are dying.On Monday, Sisodia alleged that the Modi government is spending money on advertisements instead of vaccinating the people of the country. The central government is pressurising Delhi government officials to publish advertisements thanking its vaccination drive, he further in an online briefing."Instead of spending money on vaccinating citizens, the BJP is only interested in spending on advertisements on vaccines," Sisodia said. He also took a dig at the Centre, saying billboards thanking Modi will be displayed all over Delhi if it is provided 2.30 crore doses.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor hit back, accusing the AAP government of creating confusion over the ongoing vaccination drive."Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal demanded freedom to buy vaccines which the central government allowed, but failing to buy vaccines in the international market, he demanded that the Centre should procure vaccines for the states," Kapoor said."It's very clear that it is the Arvind Kejriwal government that created all the confusion over vaccination drive after failing to get any vaccines on its own," he added.India administered 86,16,373 Covid-19 vaccine doses on Monday, the first day of the free vaccination drive for adults. This is the highest-ever single day vaccination in the world so far.Madhya Pradesh administered 16,73,858 vaccine doses, the highest ever among states in the country in a single day so far.On the historic feat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated those who got vaccinated and lauded all frontline warriors."Today's record-breaking vaccination numbers are gladdening.

22-06-2021||India||Is Covid wave 2 over? Positivity rate below 5% for 15 days, but experts say end still far||India has crossed the important milestone of a Covid positivity rate of less than 5 per cent for 15 consecutive days, conforming to the WHO’s recommended requirement for a region to reopen, but experts are wary of declaring the devastating second wave over. With 42,640 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, the lowest in 91 days, and a positivity rate of 3.21 per cent, it would seem the present phase of the Covid-19 crisis is over and it is a good time to lift restrictions. This optimistic picture, however, must be edged with abundant caution, said several scientists, citing the emergence of new variants, the still high absolute number of cases, the many districts where positivity rate remains over 5 per cent and concerns over reliability of data. “With the current positivity rate at less than 5 per cent, India’s Covid-19 second wave is on the wane as quickly as it rushed to its peak, but the end of it may yet be far away as more transmissible new variants such as Delta plus variant are emerging,” said Naga Suresh Veerapu, associate professor at the School of Natural Sciences (SoNS), Shiv Nadar University, Delhi NCR. The Delta plus variant has been formed due to a mutation in the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant, first identified in India and considered one of the drivers of the second wave in the country and also in several others including the UK. The test positivity rate or TPR -- the percentage of all coronavirus tests performed that turn out to be positive -- is an important metric through which the public health system keeps tabs on the level of Covid transmission. The WHO recommends that test positivity should remain at 5 per cent or lower for 14 days before countries or regions reopen. In February this year, the country was celebrating the end of the first wave and conveniently ignored an imminent second wave, Veerapu said. “The Delta variant that emerged in March spread across the different parts of India, then cases surged to the peak yielding a second wave. The second wave conjoined with the first when the latter was at 1 per cent positivity rate,” he told PTI. Public policy expert Chandrakant Lahariya added that while cases are on the decline, the absolute number of cases are still very high. “While the national level test positivity rate has come down, there are still many districts where TPR is above 5 per cent,” the Delhi-based physician-epidemiologist and health systems expert told PTI. “Therefore, before saying that the second wave is over, I would like to wait for the TPR to come down below 5 per cent everywhere and sustain for two weeks or longer,” he said. Scientist Gautam Menon agreed with Lahariya, noting that some states such as Kerala are still seeing positivity rates over 5 per cent. He added that it is unclear whether this reflects just better testing than other states or if the situation is still to improve there. Positivity rate was 10.84 per cent in Kerala on Sunday. According to Health Ministry data on Monday, India’s total tally of Covid-19 cases is 2,99,35,221 (2.99 crore/29.9 million) while active cases reduced to 7,02,887. On Tuesday, the numbers improved further with active cases falling below 7 lakh after 79 days. The death toll climbed to 3,89,302 with 1,167 daily fatalities, the lowest in 68 days. The second wave of the pandemic overwhelmed the healthcare system of the country, leaving hospitals struggling to cope with the surge in cases and critical drugs and oxygen in short supply. Infections have now slowed down and restrictions have been relaxed in most states. Agreeing that the drop in India’s cases has been quite dramatic, Menon noted, “From all we know, this is a genuine decline, both in urban and rural India.” “There is no strict definition of a ‘wave’, let alone of how and when it might be ending, but this is a good time as any to consider opening up, although with caution,” Menon, professor, Departments of Physics and Biology, Ashoka University in Haryana, told PTI. The experts also believe test positivity rates provide valuable information only if testing is broadly accessible across all regions. “Test positivity, when these tests are carried out on a random sample of the population and in sufficient quantity, is likely the best metric to dictate opening up, although we must be careful about local pockets where the level of infections have been lower than average and where the disease could still take off,” said Menon. “What we need to remember is that for a country the size of India, we need to have enough attention on the local level,” Lahariya added. He explained that Covid-19 is not just any other respiratory illness and decision-making parameters cannot be simple. “We know that there are new variants which are more transmissible. We know that human behaviour determines the spread of this virus. Therefore, it is not very relevant if we declare whether the second wave is over or not,” the public policy expert explained. “Key is, are we prepared to respond to the rise in cases? That's where the attention has to be,” Lahariya said. Widespread concerns about the accuracy of data, relating to both deaths and cases, also need to be factored in, said Menon. Though anecdotally, decline in cases appears to be true, media and other reports “suggest that deaths have been severely undercounted, sometimes by a factor of 10”. “I hope these reports will spur states to be transparent with their numbers,” he said. Lahariya said India has sub-optimally performing mechanisms for medical certification of causes of deaths (MCCD). Even before the pandemic, the causes of deaths used to be certified in only one-fourth of registered deaths. “Therefore, it is not unthinkable that even in some cases of Covid-19 deaths; deaths have not been certified correctly,” the scientist added. Veerapu said asymptomatic people and some with mild symptoms may not even turn up for testing, therefore leading to the underestimation of cases. However, he said the waning second wave provides enough opportunities to minimise the spread of the disease. “We should ramp up the vaccination drive, consolidate the health infrastructure to minimise the impact of the much anticipated third wave, and hone the public health strategies to prevent, control and respond to the third wave,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-covid-wave-2-over-positivity-rate-below-5-for-15-days-but-experts-say-end-still-far-101624347073287.html

He demanded a commission to look into “what went wrong” in the government’s strategy and emphasised that a Covid-19 compensation fund must be created to help families who lost their bread-earners. Releasing a white paper on Covid-19 prepared by the Congress’ research department, Gandhi also said that “vaccination should be done on war footing”, because inoculating 60% or 70% of the population is not sufficient. “There are two types of Covid-19 deaths. Deaths that are needless in the sense those could have been saved. The other type of death is when there is high comorbidity. In the second wave, 90% deaths were needless because oxygen was not available,” Gandhi said. Also Read | India administers record 8.6mn doses on Day 1 of universal Covid vaccine drive“The PM’s tears can’t wipe off the tears of the victims. People know that oxygen could have saved their near and dear ones. But the PM didn’t take the issue seriously. He had to fight elections,” Gandhi added. India administered over 8 million vaccine doses on Monday, after the modified vaccination rules were withdrawn in favour of a centralised vaccination campaign, in which the government administered free vaccine to all. The Congress leader maintained “good work has happened yesterday [Monday]” but cautioned that vaccination has to be a process and not “a series of events”. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala added that during former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s regime, 120 million children were administered pulse polio vaccine on a single day in 2012. Reacting to the Centre’s plea in the Supreme Court that it doesn’t have money to compensate for Covid-19 deaths, Gandhi said the government must announce a compensation package for the poor. “The Centre is making ₹4 lakh crore through cess on petrol and diesel. It has taken money from the people. They can give any name they want but a compensation plan is required,” Gandhi said. An economic assistance process is also a significant part of the white paper published on Tuesday. The Congress leader said that aim of the white paper is to provide the government with suggestions so that it can be ready when the third wave of the pandemic comes. “The government should not repeat the mistakes it did in the first and second waves. It should be ready with infrastructure to tackle the third wave,” Gandhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/90-covid-deaths-in-second-wave-could-have-been-avoided-rahul-gandhi-101624347159152.html

The state blamed logistical issues rather than the actual shortage of oxygen for the deaths.“The doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, officials, and bureaucrats have worked tirelessly and with full dedication during the entire pandemic and more particularly during the second wave. Subjecting them to a judicial inquiry would be highly unjust and would have the effect of demoralising the entire workforce. Medical personnel and bureaucrats should not be subjected to such treatment in the name of PIL (public interest litigation),” advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court on Monday.Pangam said burdening the administration and the health care system with a judicial inquiry will be counterproductive, especially in the backdrop of a possible third Covid-19 wave and its preparations. “No purpose will be served by ordering such an inquiry.”Also Read | Cab fare in Goa can be more than airfare, Bombay high court told by govtOn the issue of compensation to the families who have lost their kin to Covid-19, the government argued the high court should not adjudicate on the matter as it is pending before the Supreme Court.The government on Monday also told the high court that an inquiry committee formed on the oxygen supply issue, which was to submit its report in May, has not even met even once as the panel members contracted Covid.Petitioners, including the South Goa Advocates Association, have sought better Covid management in the state and probe under the Commission of Inquiry Act.

Moreover, CCTV cameras should be installed in all Covid centres so that the patients’ relatives can see how their near and dear ones are being treated,” he added.The state chief secretary, health secretary and collectors of Mayurbhanj and Bolangir have been made respondents in the petition.Gouranga Mohapatra, state convenor of Jana Swasthya Abhiyan, a health NGO in Odisha, said that during the second wave, there has been gross mismanagement in Covid hospitals of the state. “First of all, there are not enough doctors to treat Covid patients in the state. The Covid-designated private hospitals, though funded by the state government, have not been up to the mark. The government just kept on issuing new guidelines and SOPs without ensuring strict observance. This led to a rise in number of deaths,” said Mohapatra.Mayurbhanj district collector Vineet Bhardwaj, who, along with other officials and a team of doctors, visited the hospital after the incident, said Covid hospitals in the district are running smoothly and the complaints of the patients and attendants have been redressed. “Such incidents should not be generalised.

"The aim of this white paper on Covid-19 is not finger-pointing at the government but to help the nation prepare for the third wave of infection. The whole country knows that a third wave will strike," Gandhi said in a virtual press conference as he released the report.Rahul Gandhi, who has been a vocal critic of the Centre over its handling of the pandemic, also asked the government to create a financial assistance fund and demanded that a commission should be formed to loop into the lapses in tackling Covid-19 in the country. "The government must not view states as BJP states vs opposition states. Very important that bias should not come in," Gandhi added.Gandhi said that there are two types of Covid-19 death. "One is needless death or those who could have been saved. In the second wave, 90% of the deaths were needless," he stated.Commenting on India administering record 8.6 million Covid-19 doses on Day 1 of universal Covid vaccine drive, Gandhi said, "Good work has happened yesterday.

His meet with Abhishek Banerjee sparks buzz||Former President Pranab Mukherjee's son and Congress leader Abhijit held a meeting with Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee's nephew Abhishek on Monday evening, Hindustan Times' sister publication HT Bangla reported. The meeting was held at Abhishek Banerjee's Camac Street office.Both the sides did not reveal any details about the discussions that took place in the long meeting. But the development has given rise to fresh speculation about Abhijit Mukherjee joining the TMC. The news follows the departure of Jitin Prasad from the Congress party.Earlier this month, Mukherjee, the former MP from Jangipur, had made it clear that he is not leaving the Congress unlike his friend Jitin Prasada."I remain in the Congress and reports that I am joining Trinamool or any other party are not correct," Mukherjeehad told news agency PTI.He had said that the rumours probably arose after some of his father's former Congress colleagues "who are now in Trinamool" had come to have tea with him. "They included MP Khalilur Rahman from Jangipur, MP Abu Taher Khan from Murshidabad and TMC ministers Akhrruzzaman and Sabina Yesmin.""But, I have known them for long, as they were close to my father... to speculate that just because friends came to meet me, I will join TMC, is stretching it too far," Mukherjee had said.Mukherjee, an engineer-turned politician, won twice from Jangipur constituency.Pranab Mukherjee had won from Jangipur twice in 2004 and 2009, before becoming President of India. He started several projects in the area, including a branch of the Aligarh Muslim University in the district, an Army cantonment and a management college.Abhijit Mukherjee said he had also been involved with some of these projects as an MP, and most of his interactions with state leaders are based on these developments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-abhijit-mukherjee-join-tmc-his-meet-with-abhishek-banerjee-sparks-buzz-101624342689915.html

BJP MP Sanghmitra Maurya has written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla demanding that the matter be referred to the ethics committee of the House.Sanghmitra Maurya, who represents Uttar Pradesh Badaun in the Lok Sabha, in her letter to Birla, attached Nusrat Jahan's profile where she has mentioned Nikhil Jain as her husband. "An appropriate action be intimated under relevant rules of Lok Sabha procedure and/ or the matter be referred to Committee on Ethics for detailed investigation for her illegal and ethical conduct," Maurya said in the letter to the Speaker on June 19, according to news agency ANI."Her media statement regarding her marital status controvert her oath for Lok Sabha membership wherein she took oath as Nusrat Jahan Ruhi Jain. This effectively renders her membership as non-est in law," Maurya added.Also read | Nusrat Jahan cradles baby bump in first pics since pregnancy revealThe BJP leader also said that Bashirhat MP Nusrat Jahan said her name was Nusrat Jahan Ruhi Jain and was also dressed as a newly-wed person while taking oath on June 25, 2019. "In fact, when she was attacked by a section of Islamists for marrying a non-Muslim, sporting sindoor, MPs across party lines defended her. Her reception, as per media reports, was attended by CM Mamata Banerjee," the BJP MP wrote.Maurya told ANI that Nusrat Jahan is entitled to her personal life and nobody should encroach upon it. "She deliberately provided false information to Lok Sabha Secretariat thereby indulging in unethical, illegal and immoral conduct. She cheated her electorate by giving false information and this brings bad name to parliament and its members," Maurya alleged.Maurya is not the first BJP leader to raise questions about the marital status of actor-turned-politician Nusrat Jahan after the Trinamool leader said that her marriage with Nikhil Jain was null and void as it was held in a foreign country and it had not been registered under Indian laws.Also read | Nusrat Jahan case has no link with politics, party busy to serve people: TMCEarlier this month, BJP's Amit Malviya asked whether she lied to Parliament when she took the oath as Nusrat Jahan Ruhi Jain.

West Bengal BJP vice president Jay Prakash Majumdar also accused Nusrat Jahan of making "contradictory" remarks pertaining to her marital status and said the law should take its own course.Nusrat Jahan issued a statement earlier in June saying her marriage with Nikhil Jain is not legal, valid and tenable and there is no question of divorce. "Since it was an inter-faith marriage, it requires validation under the Special Marriage Act in India, which did not happen. As per the court of law, it is not a marriage, but a relationship or a live-in relationship.

The revised universal Covid-19 immunisation policy kicked in on June 1, wherein the Centre is procuring and supplying 75% of the total vaccine supplies being produced in India for free to states for immunising all adults. The Centre then launched the universal vaccination programme against Covid-19 from Monday to provide states with free vaccines for the 18-45 category, a move that is expected to help scale up daily vaccination numbers.In all, close to 300 million vaccine doses have been administered across the country since the national Covid-19 immunisation drive began in the country on January 16, 2021. “This was a huge number for a single day, and even though this may not be possible to sustain daily in June because of the limited vaccine supplies, it looks likes about 5 million vaccine doses should be administered in a day,” said a senior government official aware of the developments, on condition of anonymity.

The Centre has so far distributed close to 300 million vaccine doses to states, of which nearly 270 million doses have been consumed. At least 20 million doses are still available with states to be administered, and close to 3.3 million doses are in the pipeline that will be distributed to states in the next three days, according to the Union health ministry. The government is expecting to get around 200-250 million doses per month by August as vaccine manufactures such as Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech are in the process of scaling up their vaccine production capacity. India’s vaccine drive began for healthcare workers, and was later expanded to include all frontline workers on February 2, and then, everyone over the age of 60 years and people over the age of 45 with co-morbidities, on March 1. On April 1, it was expanded to include everyone over the age of 45. Then, in response to demand from states and people, the drive was opened up further, to everyone over the age of 18 years, although states were told they would have to pay for the vaccines of those between the ages of 18 and 45. Private hospitals were also allowed to offer vaccinations at capped prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-administers-record-8-6mn-doses-on-day-1-of-universal-covid-vaccine-drive-101624340258924.html

The statistics show the pressure being faced by these supporters of terrorists who provide them with logistical support, cash and shelter.These OGWs have also been involved in bank robberies and killing of civilians, the police said. Most of them have been working for Pakistan-based terror groups, like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which send their operatives to create mayhem in the valley.The police released these details on Monday, after the killing of three LeT commanders, including one of the most wanted terrorists Mudasir Pandit, in Sopore. These terrorists were part of the group involved in several terror-related cases, said the police.The two aides of Pandit - Pakistan national and LeT commander Abdullah alias Asrar and Khurshid Mir - who were also killed, had more than two dozen cases registered against them.They were involved in killing of two municipal councillors and one police personnel at the municipal office in Sopore in March this year and attack on fruit merchants at Dangerpora in September, 2019, according to the police. Four civilians were injured in the 2019 attack.These attacks, which came after the Centre's move to strip Jammu and Kashmir of its special status in August 2019, stuck fears in the hearts of apple traders. The Union territory's administration had to step in and provide security to the traders, and help them in selling their produce.There were 18 cases registered against Pandit alone, who was the Lashkar commander since June 2019. He was involved in the killing of nine security forces personnel and three local body (panchayat) members. Pandit also used to threaten and intimidate people, the Jammu and Kashmir Police said.Among the other two terrorists, four FIRs were registered against Asrar, a resident of Pakistan. He was involved in two attacks on security forces and killings of three cops, the police said. He had been a commander of the LeT since 2018.Khurshid Mir, the third terrorist eliminated on Monday, carried out two grenade attacks and was involved in the killing of five civilians. There were six FIRs registered against him, according to the police.Director General of Police J&K, Dilbagh Singh said on Monday that the operation wasn't only a big success but an important one. He also said that a "good number" of foreign militants are present in the valley, but are "lying low" and "keeping a distance".General Officer Commanding (GoC) of the Army's Kilo Force Major General H S Sahi said this was the second such instance in the valley in recent times where local militants were found to be accompanied by Pakistani ultras."This is a big network nexus that exists, which is a cause of concern. This nexus needs to be broken and destroyed so that there is no hurdle in the peace and development of Jammu and Kashmir," Major General Sahi said.The joint operation was launched by the army, Jammu and Kashmir Police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) after the attack on police in Sopore on June 12, in which two policemen and two civilians were killed.The Jammu and Kashmir Police further said that taking into account Monday's gunbattle, as many as 53 terrorists have been killed so far this year. Out of these, 45 were local and two foreigners. The police also said that 112 terrorists and Over Ground Workers (OGWs) have been arrested in the first six months of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-sopore-encounter-focus-back-to-ogws-police-say-76-arrested-this-year-101624337244780.html
22-06-2021||India||Prashant Kishor weighs in amid Sharad Pawar's plans to unite oppn||Prashant Kishor has ruled out the possibility of a third or fourth front defeating the Bharatiya Janata Party in the next Lok Sabha elections amid speculation that a national coalition will be formed by opposition parties against the BJP. Prashant Kishor said that he does not think that such a front will be able to challenge the BJP. "I don’t believe that any third or fourth front can defeat Narendra Modi so why would I be part of any such coalition. Just because 15 persons are meeting, you cannot call it a 15-party meeting," the election strategist said.Prashant Kishor was referring to the meeting called by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar of a number of opposition leaders, excluding the Congress, and civil society members at his house in Delhi on Tuesday to initiate discussions about bringing together outfits against the BJP. His comments also came after he met Sharad Pawar for the second time in a month.“I had lunch with him when I was in Mumbai recently and so today, he called me and asked me to come over for tea. It was just chit-chat and a routine meeting," he said. He also rejected speculation that he was taking on the NCP as a client. “There is no question of Pawar Sahab becoming my client because I have left this space [election strategy]as I announced on May 2,’’ said Kishor.Also read | NCP chief Pawar, TMC’s Yashwant Sinha to host Rashtra Manch meet in DelhiTuesday's meeting, to be held under the banner of Rashtra Manch, an anti-BJP platform set up in 2018, comes amid a growing rift between the Congress and its alliance partner Shiv Sena and NCP in Maharashtra over whether to fight upcoming polls together or separately.NCP spokesperson and minister in the Maharashtra government Nawab Malik said in a series of tweets that the meeting has been called to discuss the current scenario in the country and it will be attended by National Conference leader and former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Farooq Abdullah, Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Yashwant Sinha, Sanjay Singh from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and D Raja from CPI among others.Also read | Uddhav Thackeray will be chief minister for 5 years: Shiv Sena“A discussion on the current political situation and primary discussion on how to bring all the opposition parties together is likely to be discussed in the meeting to be held on Tuesday. The exercise is the first step towards the announcement made by the NCP chief that he will be working to unite the opposition parties in the country,” Malik said.Pavan Verma, Sanjay Singh, KTS Tulsi, Majeed Memon, Vandana Chavan, Ghanshyam Tiwari, Karan Thapar, Javed Akhtar, Ashutosh, SY Qureshi, Arun Kumar, KC Singh, Sanjay Jha, Sudheendra Kulkarni, Colin Gonsalves and Pritish Nandy will also attend the meeting at 4pm.Kirit Somaiya, the BJP's leader in Maharashtra, said there will be no match for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership even if all opposition parties unite against him. Sharad Pawar, he said, is building castles in the air about uniting the opposition against the BJP-led central government. "At a time when Maharashtra is going out of control, the NCP, Congress, and Shiv Sena are cursing one another, Sharad Pawar ji is having 'Mungeri Lal Ke Haseen Sapney (a pipedream)'," Somaiya said on Monday, according to news agency ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-kishor-weighs-in-amid-sharad-pawar-s-plans-to-unite-oppn-101624336847662.html
22-06-2021||India||Consolidation of minority votes, farm protests worry Sangh ahead of elections||The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is concerned about the impact the coalescence of the minority vote, which is believed to have contributed to the Trinamool Congress (TMC)’s win in West Bengal, and the continuing protests by a section of farmers against the new farm laws will have on the upcoming state elections, people aware of the matter said.The Sangh, ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s ideological fount, distances itself from electoral politics. But its cadre plays a key role in drumming up support for the BJP. Elections are due in 2022 in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Goa, Punjab, and Gujarat.Sangh has denied holding meetings on the elections particularly in Uttar Pradesh. But people aware of the matter said there is a concern that “regional considerations in politics could override national concerns.”“The inability of the Congress government in Punjab to control the farm agitation is an example of parties opting for narrow considerations above national issues. There is also a concern about religious polarisation and the impact that it can have. In West Bengal for instance, BJP supporters and those sympathetic to the Sangh are being targeted,” said a functionary.Also Read | Yogi to lead BJP in 2022 UP polls, says AK SharmaThe consolidation of about 30% Muslim votes and the transfer of votes from the Left and the Congress is believed to have helped TMC to sweep back to power by winning 213 of the 292 seats. The BJP, which won 77 seats, has been complaining about violence against its cadre in the state since the election results were announced on May 2.The issue of post-poll violence was also raised by the Sangh, which has blamed the “radicalised” elements for the attacks. Response by the state governments to protests against central laws such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) that fast tracks citizenship to persecuted minorities from the neighbourhood is also cited as a reason for concern. “There is a clear difference in how the state governments have handled agitations. While the Congress government in Punjab has not yet managed to get the farmers to call off the agitation though their concerns have been addressed by the government, the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh dealt with the anti-CAA protests swiftly,” the functionary quoted above said.The Uttar Pradesh administration attached the properties of those who allegedly damaged public property during protests against the CAA as part of the measures it took to control them.Retaining Uttar Pradesh, where the construction of the Ram Temple is underway, is also critical for the BJP and the Sangh. “The Sangh does not want a change in government to create impediments in the construction of the temple, which has been its long-pending dream,” said the functionary quoted above.In Punjab, the Sangh has been concerned by the resurgence of the separatist movement, which it believes has used the farm agitation to get a foothold in the state. The issue of religious conversion by missionaries, particularly in the border areas of the state, is another issue that has been flagged by the Sangh.Gujarat-based political analyst Hari Desai said the Sangh’s concerns are not only Muslim consolidation but the inability to consolidate the Hindu votes. “TMC did not win only because of the Muslim votes; a sizeable percentage of the Hindus voted for them too. The Sangh recognises this and therefore, you see them aggressively pushing ahead in states such as Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consolidation-of-minority-votes-farm-protests-worry-sangh-ahead-of-elections-101624336241383.html

22-06-2021||India||Narada case: Supreme Court to hear Mamata’s petition against CBI today||The Supreme Court will on Tuesday take up a petition by West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, contending that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has made “false allegations” about her sitting in protest outside CBI’s Kolkata office after the arrest of two Trinamool Congress (TMC) ministers and another prominent MLA on May 17 in connection with the 2016 Narada sting tapes. A former party leader was also arrested the same day.The petition, which will be considered by a bench of justices Hemant Gupta and Aniruddha Bose, claimed that CBI has also tried to mislead the courts by accusing her of trying to pressure the trial judge for granting bail to her ministers and MLAs in its endeavour to get the case transferred from the trial court.The CM did not deny that she had visited the CBI office in Kolkata on May 17 after the arrest of three TMC MLAs, Madan Mitra, Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim as well as former party leader Sovan Chatterjee. The petition claimed she went there not as a CM but “as a citizen and as a person acquainted with some of accused persons and family of the accused persons”.Also Read | Centre begins action against ex-chief secy in Bengal“There is no evidence of the petitioner holding a dharna or gherao or siege outside the CBI office and are thus false allegations. The petitioner at no point made a forcible entry at the office of the CBI, rather, she cleared a three-tier system of central paramilitary security, as applicable to all persons entering the CBI office premises...when she was present at the CBI office, she abided by all directions issued by officers of the CBI,” stated her petition, filed through advocate Astha Sharma.Banerjee has also alleged that the CBI arrested the MLAs without informing the local police station prior to the arrest, and without even informing the Speaker of the West Bengal Assembly and after obtaining sanction “in a manner contrary to law.” The plea added the CBI had no material evidence or documentary proof, photographs or videos to substantiate the bald and vague allegations against her.The CM has filed the petition to assail the June 9 order of the Calcutta high court, which had refused to accept her affidavit on record while hearing the CBI’s plea for transferring the case from the trial court to itself. The agency has accused the CM and other TMC leaders of carrying out protests after arrests of the MLAS to pressure the trial court and influence the bail hearing.The MLAs arrests were followed by a series of dramatic events in which the trial court granted them bail soon after their arrests on May 17. It was, however, stayed by a division bench of the Calcutta high court within hours after the CBI filed a petition for transferring the case. Two days later, the two judges on the division bench differed with each other, resulting in a house arrest order for the MLAs till the time a larger bench could decide the matter.The CBI’s petition was then referred to a five-judge bench, which on June 9 refused to take on record affidavits by Banerjee, state law minister Moloy Ghatak and the West Bengal government, on the ground that the arguments in the case were substantially over and that they could not be allowed file their affidavits to fill the lacuna to support the accused.Contesting this order, Banerjee has attacked the high court as well. “The high court is perpetuating the illegality by imposing different standards for parties in the same case, in an arbitrary manner, and in utter disregard to the principles of equity and natural justice,” said her plea, adding the order was in disregard to the principles of natural justice.The CM’s petition further pointed out that the CBI was able to not only get an urgent listing from the high court but also a stay of the bail order on May 17 merely on the basis of an e-mail, without any notice to the concerned parties and to her despite the fact that serious allegations were levelled against her conduct.The plea also said that the arguments in the case were far from over and were ongoing even as of June 18. “The impugned order thereby attempts to foist the impression that the petitioner filed her affidavit at a belated stage, which prima facie is erroneous,” it said.Banerjee’s plea will be heard along with petitions filed by Ghatak and the state government against the June 9 order of the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narada-case-sc-to-hear-mamata-banerjee-s-petition-against-cbi-today-101624335698749.html

Also, according to reports, the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) is likely to meet on Tuesday to review the phase 3 data.The reported development comes amid a controversy over data from the third stage trials of Covaxin which Bharat Biotech earlier said it would make public in June, only to announce later that the data would, in fact, be made public in July, a delay of about a month from the originally announced timeline.Also Read | Covaxin phase 3 trial results to be out in July: Bharat BiotechCovaxin is among three vaccines being used in the nationwide drive against Covid-19.

A third vaccine, Russia's Sputnik V, was granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) in April.The vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease began on January 16. However, since the beginning, doubts have been raised on Covaxin's efficacy as the vaccine was granted EUA without the completion of its third stage trials. Interim data released by Bharat Biotech in April showed that the shot was 78% effective against symptomatic disease and 100% against serious illness.Last week, Bharat Biotech refuted rumours it had submitted phase 3 data to the World Health Organization's (WHO) for the global health body's approval, calling such reports "incorrect and lacking any evidence."

The government's compensation is only a small help, but the Modi government is not ready to even do that.

This is mainly because of the westerly wind pattern which is weakening the monsoon flow. In fact, monsoon rains may start reducing over the west coast gradually mainly because no low pressure system or depression is developing over Bay of Bengal.

According to news agency ANI, 16,73,858 vaccine doses were administered to eligible beneficiaries yesterday.Announcing the ‘Vaccination Mahaabhiyan’ on Sunday, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had set a target of vaccinating 10 lakh people in a day. The officials said they surpassed the target, accounting for 20 per cent of all inoculations conducted against the coronavirus disease in the country on Monday."Madhya Pradesh has topped other states in terms of vaccination. Thanks to all," Chouhan said, lauding the achievement. He added that the state government aims to inoculate as many people as possible in quick time to ward off a possible third wave and its campaign would continue.Chouhan launched the campaign in Datia, saying that vaccination is the only way to defeat the virus. He added that chances of anyone getting infected after inoculation were rare, and symptoms, in such a scenario, would be very mild and recovery really fast.The Madhya Pradesh government had set up 7,000 centres to administer vaccine doses to people. These centres were manned by 35,000 staff members. The officials said that the chief minister had ensured over 19 lakh vaccine doses were made available in the state.The government came up with innovative ideas like offering discount coupons, recharging mobile phones and a lucjy draw, to encourage people to take the jabs.Officials also said that a three-day vaccination campaign will start from July 1 to motivate people to get themselves vaccinated against Covid-19.India, meanwhile, vaccinated a record 8.5 million people on Monday, the start of the new phase of its vaccine drive - more in a single day than any country other than China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-inoculates-record-1-67-million-people-against-covid-19-in-one-day-101624329561760.html

It included cross-deck helicopter landings, complex tactical evolutions at sea, live firing, a night-time joint patrol and a naval parade in the high seas off the coast of Somalia," the EU said.The Indian Navy has been providing escort to the World Food Programme-chartered vessels, coordinated by the EUNAVFOR Somalia."The EU and India intend to strengthen their operational cooperation at sea, including joint naval exercises and port calls, and to protect the sea-lanes of communication. They also intend to boost maritime domain awareness in the Indo-Pacific through mutual coordination and exchanges," the EU said."The EU and India reaffirm their interest to enhance their cooperation in the field of maritime security in the Indo-Pacific region," it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eu-india-committed-to-free-open-inclusive-and-rules-based-indopacific-101624329196174.html

As I said it was not possible, he used to torture my daughter. He had beaten Vismaya in front of us after coming to our home during midnight last January," an emotional Nair told a TV channel.He said his daughter would not have taken this drastic step and suspected that Kumar might have murdered her.Based on the media reports, the state Women's Commission registered a case into the incident on its own and sought a report from the police in this regard.A police officer said investigation is going on and any further action would be taken after getting the post- mortem report."The post-mortem will be done at the government medical college, Thiruvananthapuram and any action will be taken after getting the report," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-woman-found-hanging-in-husband-s-house-dowry-harassment-suspected-101624329125148.html

Royte, however, did not mention the number of children.On the occasion of Father's Day on Sunday, Royte announced that he would reward a man or woman having the highest number of offspring within his Aizawl East-2 assembly constituency with a cash incentive of ₹1 lakh. The person will also get a certificate and a trophy, the minister said in a statement.Royte said that the infertility rate and the decreasing growth rate of the Mizo population has become a serious concern."Mizoram is far below the optimum number of people to attain development in various fields because of the gradual decline in its population. Low population is a serious issue and hurdle for small communities or tribes like Mizos to survive and progress," Royte said, according to news agency PTI.He further said that some churches and influential civil society organisations like the Young Mizo Association are advocating a baby boom policy to encourage population growth.This declaration came at a time when several states are advocating a population control policy.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has recently announced that his government will gradually implement a two-child policy for availing benefits under certain schemes funded by the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mizoram-minister-announces-cash-reward-for-having-maximum-number-of-children-101624327499889.html

According to a report by HT’s sister publication Livehindustan, Delta plus, also known as ‘AY.1’ variant or B.1.617.2.1, is considered to be the most dangerous variant of Covid-19.Three states - Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh - are reporting cases of the delta plus variant in the country.Maharashtra:State health minister Rajesh Tope said on Monday that the state has reported 21 cases of the Delta plus variant. Of these, nine were from Jalgaon, seven from Mumbai and one each from Sindhudurg , Thane and Palgarh districts.Tope said the Maharashtra government has taken a decision with regard to genome sequencing and has started the process of taking 100 samples from each district, adding the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research’s (CSIR) Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) is being involved in this process. “Since May 15, 7,500 samples have been taken in which about 21 cases of delta plus have been found,” he said.Also Read| Maharashtra reports 20 Delta+ Covid variant cases: OfficialsTope also added the vaccination status and travel history of the patients are being ascertained.Kerala:Kerala government officials told news agency PTI on Monday that presence of the Delta plus variant has been found in samples collected from Palakkad and Pathanamth districts.

There is nothing to talk about. I took his blessings on the auspicious occasion of Father's Day," said Siddipet district collector Venkatrama Reddy.At an event on Sunday, Reddy was seen touching the feet of Rao, who was in Siddipet to inaugurate a newly-constructed Collectorate building.Reacting to the incident, Telangana Congress spokesperson Sravan Dasoju said the collector should not have touched Rao's feet, adding that IAS officers in the state had become "slaves and puppets". Dasoju said, " IAS officers in Telangana should not forget they are custodians of the Constitution. If the CM is like your father, you should have gone to his house to touch his feet. What message does this convey to the public?"Echoing this, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson K Krishna Sagar Rao said, "If these IAS officers have such respect towards the chief minister, they should have touched his feet privately. Such acts deteriorate the integrity, independence and professionalism of IAS officers."The BJP also took the opportunity to question Rao to slam his handling of the Covid-19 crisis in Telangana. "On the one hand, the chief minister did not announce a lockdown until forced by the high court but on the other hand he lifted the lockdown restrictions in one go, thus putting its outcome to a complete waste," said Krishna Sagar Rao.(with inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ias-officer-touches-telangana-cm-s-feet-calls-him-father-figure-after-act-triggers-furore-101624319022739.html

The squabble between Singh and Sidhu has left the party leaders worried about its impact on the party’s prospects next year's state polls.Amarinder Singh reached Delhi on Monday to meet a three-member central committee of the Congress party headed by Mallikarjun Kharge today. The meeting is scheduled to take place at 11am. The chief minister is also expected to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi but there is no confirmation so far.Also Read: Poster war erupts in Patiala amid Cong infightingBoth the chief minister and Sidhu have been at loggerheads for quite some time and have gone public against each other. Sidhu's rebellion against Singh started after his exit from the state cabinet in 2019 over change in his portfolio. But the bitterness mounted in May after the government suffered a legal setback in a 2015 police firing case.In his latest attack, Sidhu told Hindustan Times in an interview that the Punjab chief minister lies every day. "He said things about my meetings (with AAP). Has he proved it? What nonsense he is talking about? Talk about issues. Why is he showing his back to issues such beadbi, loan waiver and white paper? What have you done about drugs? Give your report card."Some leaders opposed to Singh have started distancing themselves from Sidhu after his public attack. “This fight is not about individuals or positions anyone, but about key issues such as justice in sacrilege cases, action against drug cartels and cable and sand mafia and scrapping of power purchase agreements. This is our priority. We are not concerned with Capt versus Sidhu or what he (former minister) gets or does not get,” said two cabinet ministers.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has also stepped in to resolve the crisis. He met Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla and Fatehgarh Sahib MLA Kuljit Singh Nagra on Monday and is expected to meet more leaders on Tuesday.The Kharge-headed AICC panel, with Harish Rawat and former MP JP Aggarwal as its members, has already submitted its report to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, suggesting the election should be held under the charge of Singh, and Sidhu may be suitably accommodated.The party leadership wants a united Congress ahead of assembly elections. Some Congress leaders were worried that the continued squabbling may damage the Congress in assembly polls next year, an election it is otherwise expected to win on account of a weakened opposition and widespread farm protests.Punjab is crucial for Congress as it is one of the few states where the party is in power and the outcome will have an impact on the party's prospects outside the state also.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-singh-vs-navjot-sidhu-battle-reaches-delhi-cm-to-meet-congress-panel-today-101624320937275.html

According to his party leader Nawab Malik, Pawar will work towards uniting all the opposition parties in the country."Prominent political leaders and eminent persons from different sections of the society will attend the meeting at Pawar's residence in Delhi on Tuesday to discuss the current scenario in the country," said Malik.Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kirit Somaiya, however, said that Pawar is harbouring a mere pipedream about uniting opposition parties against the BJP-led central government."At a time when Maharashtra is going out of control, NCP, Congress, and Shiv Sena are cursing one another, Sharad Pawar ji is having 'Mungeri Lal ke haseen sapney (a pipedream)'," Somaiya said on Monday."He is trying to get the Opposition together at a time Shiv Sena is showing them the chappal, and there is a rampant mismanagement of Covid in the state," he added.Also Watch: Sena responds to rift rumours in MVAThe BJP leader further said there will be no match for PM Narendra Modi's leadership even if the entire Opposition unites against him.Similar sentiments were echoed by political strategist Prashant Kishor who met Pawar in Delhi on Monday, the second meeting between the two leaders in 10 days. Kishor said he won't attend the 4pm discussion."I don’t believe that any third or fourth front can defeat Narendra Modi so why would I be part of any such coalition.

They use it to strengthen their own bodies and for their patients as well,” he said.The PM quoted Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar who had advised to seek the root of the disease, find the reason of the illness and then ensure its treatment. “This is what yoga does. Today, medical science also focuses on healing apart from treatment and yoga helps in the healing process,” he said.He also referred to yoga as a means of finding solutions. “We are the biggest source of energy, but we do not realise this energy because of the many divisions that exist…at times, the lives of people exist in silos. The shift from silos to union is yoga, the realisation of oneness is yoga,” he said.Addressing the nation, PM Modi also announced the launch of M-Yoga application, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO).The app, which will be available in many languages, will show videos on yoga training based on a common protocol.This will help us in making the ‘’One World, One Health’’ motto successful, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yoga-a-ray-of-hope-as-world-fights-covid-pm-modi-101624315662664.html

There are complaints that the charges demanded by the motor cabs are at times higher than the flight tickets. Some amount of regulation is absolutely necessary. Grant of interim relief, would virtually amount to grant of final relief at the interim stage,” the Advocate General told the Court.The bench of justices MS Sonak and MS Jawalkar declined a stay on the government order, ruling that “no case is made out for grant of any interim relief, save and except to observe that the compliances can be without prejudice.”The high court has also been hearing petitions filed by the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa which complained that the state government hadn’t taken steps to comply with the directions of the high court in a 2016 petition filed by them. The government subsequently had hurriedly rolled out a taxi scheme ordering that taxis will not have their licenses renewed if they do not install the meters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cab-fare-in-goa-can-be-more-than-airfare-bombay-high-court-told-by-govt-101624303841944.html
22-06-2021||India||Govt proposes stricter rules for e-commerce firms, new draft rules provide for greater liability, transparency in flash sales||New Delhi: The Union government has sought to bring substantive changes in the way e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon and Flipkart, operate, seeking public views Monday on a draft to amend the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules 2020. The draft proposes greater scrutiny of flash sales, enhanced liability of e-commerce sites, data protection for consumers and stronger grievance redressal. The draft rules, framed under the Consumer Protection Act 2020, the flagship consumer-rights law, will apply to “all models of e-commerce, including marketplace and inventory models of e-commerce”. The new draft proposes introduces an updated definition of what constitutes an e-commerce entity, cross-selling, which refers to sale of additional goods related to a purchase already made, and fall-back liability, which essentially increases the liability of e-commerce platforms. The draft rules, which will be open to public comments until July 6, defines an e-commerce entity as any person who “owns, operates or manages digital or electronic facility or platform for electronic commerce” and any “related party”, as defined under the Companies Act, 2013, but “does not include a seller offering his goods or services for sale on a marketplace e-commerce entity”. This enhances the liability of e-commerce companies for goods and services delivered on their platforms. The draft rules outlaws flash sales – instant, unannounced sales that usually accompany discounts – that are manipulated to give advantage or preferential treatment to a particular seller or a group of sellers. Clause 16 of the draft reads: “No e-commerce entity shall organize a flash sale of goods or services offered on its platform.” This clause is qualified by the definition of flash sales in the draft, which states: “’Flash sale’ means a sale organized by an e-commerce entity at significantly reduced prices, high discounts or any other such promotions or attractive offers for a predetermined period of time on selective goods and services or otherwise with an intent to draw large number of consumers provided such sales are organised by fraudulently intercepting the ordinary course of business using technological means with an intent to enable only a specified seller or group of sellers managed by such entity to sell goods or services on its platform.” “Conventional flash sales are not banned. The proposed amendments aim to bring transparency. The government has received widespread complaints of cheating and unfair trade practices on e-commerce platforms,” a senior official said. Cross-selling, which involves additional offers for other goods once a particular item has been purchased, should have “adequate disclosures” for buyers. The draft rules also seek to protect consumer data by prohibiting e-commerce firms from making “available any information pertaining to the consumer to any person other than the consumer without the express and affirmative consent of such consumer”. The draft rules also provide for a chief compliance officer. They also stipulate new obligations on e-commerce sites to share cyber-security incidents promptly with appropriate authorities. A mail to Amazon India’s corporate communications, seeking its views on the draft rules, went unanswered till the time of going to press. The government had radically overhauled the Consumer Protection Act 1986 by passing an amendment to it in 2020 to keep pace with a changing marketplace. According to a March report by financial technology firm FIS, the covid-19 pandemic has given a major boost for the country’s e-commerce market, which it said, was expected to grow 84% to reach $ 111 billion by 2024. “The key thing always is to ensure fair competition. But frequently shifting the goalposts don’t do much good. I view the new stipulations on flash sales, for instance, as part of an old mindset that deny consumers the benefit of low pricings,” said Pradeep Mehta, a consumer rights expert who was consulted by the NDA government while drafting the Consumer Protection (Amendment) Bill 2019. In July 2020, the government had notified new e-commerce rules, known as the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, as part of its amended Consumer Protection Act. As more and more Indians shop online, instances of complaints raised through the national consumer helpline (1800-11-4000) have also jumped. According to data from the consumer affairs ministry, during the April 2020-February 2021 period, consumers logged 188,262 disputes or claims related to e-commerce transactions. At 22%, this share was highest among five segments, including banking, telecom, electronic products and consumer durables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-proposes-stricter-rules-for-e-commerce-firms-new-draft-rules-provide-for-greater-liability-transparency-in-flash-sales-101624302156826.html

They also said that they can connect to videoconferencing to us. However, we are not satisfied with their response and preparing to send them another notice under section 41 of CrPC,” said Atul Kumar Sonkar, circle office of Loni, before the new summons were issued.HT has seen a copy of the summons, which cites Section 41a. The first notice was sent citing Section 160 of the criminal procedure code, which allows the police the ability to question any person who they believe may be aware of facts related to a complaint. Section 41a is to summon a party who is named in a complaint, which gives cops more authority to demand their presence.The complaint against Twitter and several journalists was lodged at Loni Border police station on June 15. The people named were booked for “promoting enmity between religions” by posting and promoting the video even as conflicting narratives of the attack emerged.The video showed a 72-year-old Muslim man being beaten up and his attackers chopping his beard. The Ghaziabad police have said the incident was not communal but a personal dispute of the victim with the suspects but the victim’s family has alleged a religion angle.Also read | Loni case: Twitter responds to UP police notice, says available for questioningIn this connection, the Ghaziabad police have already arrested local politician Ummed Pehalwan who they say, allegedly, manipulated the video for political gains.The Bombay High Court on Monday granted four weeks transit anticipatory bail to journalist Rana Ayyub, who was one of the people named. “She has been able to procure the transit anticipatory bail but the case stands, and she will have to reply if we send notices in connection with the case. In near future, we are preparing to send notices to the suspects in the case,” Sonkar added.Twitter separately said that after receiving a legal request from India’s ‘law enforcement agencies’, it restricted 50 tweets concerning the Ghaziabad incident to users in India.The news came to light after Twitter made the disclosure to the Lumen database to which it routinely discloses instances of when it has taken down content.Twitter did not respond to requests for a comment.While most of these tweets include the videos or the images of the beard chopping incident, there are also tweets where people were sharing the video of the victim seen narrating the purported attack.Pavan Duggal, a senior supreme court advocate and a cyber law expert, said that while Twitter has not complied with the new IT rules, restricting these 50 tweets is a sign of acceptance in its capacity as an intermediary under section 79 of the new IT law.“Twitter might use it to show a post facto compliance to the new IT rules’” he added.Prsanath Sugathan, another senior advocate and internet rights expert told HT, “sharing of a true incident without any hate messaging or call for violence will not fall under content that could be taken down as per the reasonable restrictions under Art.19(2).He added that there is also a question of whether these users were informed of the take down orders issued by the government. “They were to at least be allowed a chance to challenge it”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghaziabad-assault-video-police-sends-fresh-summons-to-twitter-executives-101624300477283.html
22-06-2021||India||Yogi to lead BJP in 2022 UP polls, says AK Sharma||The Bharatiya Janata Party will go into next year’s assembly elections with chief minister Yogi Adityanath at the helm of affairs, AK Sharma, the party’s newly-appointed vice president in Uttar Pradesh, said in a letter to UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh. The letter, sent on Sunday, was released to the media on Monday before the visiting BJP general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh and other leaders of the party’s core committee entered a meeting with Adityanath.“In the 2022 UP polls to be held under your and chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s stewardship, the BJP would win even more seats than before,” Sharma, a retired IAS officer close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said in the letter that is seen as an attempt to stamp out speculation about friction within the party on leadership issues.Like when UP labour minister Swami Prasad Maurya spoke about fighting the 2022 elections under Adityanath’s leadership on Monday but added that the party leadership will decide on the chief minister after the election. BJP leaders rushed to explain that the minister was merely reiterating the formal procedure of newly-elected lawmakers selecting their leader after the elections.AK Sharma letter also underscored PM Modi’s continuing popularity among people in the state. “In my view, people of UP love Modiji just as much as they did in 2013-14 and this great leader’s name and patronage is enough to win elections.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-to-lead-bjp-in-2022-up-polls-says-ak-sharma-101624300476711.html
22-06-2021||India||UP Covid toll may be more than official number: Report||A report published by Suarav Das in the news website Article 14 shows that Uttar Pradesh’s Covid-19 tally could be a huge underestimate. The report’s findings are based on a comparison of the official Covid-19 tally in 24 districts of the state between July 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021, with the total excess deaths reported in the Civil Registration System (CRS) during the same period. The data on deaths was obtained through a Right To Information (RTI) application.Uttar Pradesh government, however, countered the report saying that all the Covid and non-Covid deaths in the state are being registered in a transparent manner. “The government is registering all the Covid and non-Covid deaths, the data is being regularly updated, the registration of death data is transparent in the state. The non- Covid as well as Covid deaths are being registered in all the 75 districts, the local authorities as well as birth and death registration cell has been directed to register all the births and deaths in the respective districts. The correct birth and death data is important for the welfare and development schemes,” said spokesperson and MSME minister Siddharth Nath Singh.Excess death or mortality is a generalised term that refers to the total number of deaths from all causes during a crisis that is above and beyond what would have been expected under regular conditions. During the Covid-19 outbreak, this data is being used to count the number of deaths that would not have occurred had the pandemic not taken place. Information on CRS statistics for the pandemic’s period has been obtained by various news organisations to estimate the degree of undercounting of Covid-19 related mortality in official death tolls by various states. Before the latest Article 14 findings, similar estimates have been published for Andhra Pradesh (Scroll), Assam (Scroll), Karnataka (The News Minute), Madhya Pradesh (Scroll), and Tamil Nadu (The Hindu).According to the data compiled by How India Lives, the official Covid-19 deaths reported in the 24 districts , Agra, Aligarh, Amethi, Ballia, Balrampur, Bareilly, Basti, Firozabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Ghaziabad, Ghazipur, Jhansi, Kanpur Dehat, Kanpur Nagar, Kheri, Lucknow, Mathura, Meerut, Moradabad, Pilibhit, Pratapgarh, Rampur, Sonbhadra and Unnao , for which Article 14 has managed to get the numbers, between July 1, 2020 and March, 31, 2021 were 4,068. The total number of deaths recorded in the CRS in these districts, according to a Right to Information reply obtained by Article 14 was 375,000. CRS shows only 178,000 deaths in these districts between July, 1 2019 and March 31, 2020. This gives an excess of 197,000 deaths in the pandemic year. While all the extra deaths cannot be ascribed to Covid-19 , this does provide a proxy of the extra mortality which could have been caused by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-covid-toll-may-be-more-than-official-number-report-101624300416732.html

The meeting will also take stock of the Congress’s Covid-19 outreach initiatives and the road forward, people aware of the developments said.This is the first meeting involving AICC general secretaries, all state in-charges and PCC presidents with Gandhi after the recent assembly elections, in which the Congress failed to win Kerala, West Bengal and Assam.“The meeting will discuss the current political situation that includes the spiraling petrol prices that has put people in great difficulties apart from contributing to rising prices. The vaccination situation and possibilities of another surge and other issues would be discussed,” said a senior leader, who did not wish to be named.Also read | Pawar to host meeting of civil society, Opposition leadersThe leader added that discussions might also veer on the aftermath of the recent assembly elections in four states and one Union Territory.Another leader said the meeting will also discuss the Congress’s Covid-19 outreach programme—launched to help people access ambulances, drugs and oxygen during the second wave. The general secretaries and the state leadership were involved in the programme and the meeting might evaluate the same in the light of any future possibilities of surge in Covid-19 cases.Apart from AICC general secretaries, state in-charges and state unit presidents will also attend the meeting through videoconferencing, the leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-calls-meeting-to-discuss-poll-results-covid19-101624300357418.html

The meeting will be held on Tuesday morning at the Srinagar residence of National Conference president and former chief minister Farooq Abdullah.Fourteen leaders including former chief ministers and deputy chief ministers have been invited for the meeting, besides heads of the mainstream political parties.The all-party meeting will be PM Modi’s first interaction with political parties of Jammu and Kashmir since August 5, 2019, when the central government abrogated the state’s special status and bifurcated it into Union Territories. The PAGD, a conglomerate of six political parties, was formed a year later, in October 2020, to fight for the restoration of Kashmir’s status pre-August 5, 2019.The PDP has already authorised party president Mehbooba Mufti to take the decision on the invitation from Delhi while National Conference president and former chief minister Farooq Abdullah has convened a meeting of senior party leaders from Jammu on Wednesday. In the consultations that Farooq Abdullah has held so far, the majority view is that the NC should participate in the all party meeting and put across its stand, particularly on the revocation of Article 370 and the state’s autonomy.Besides Farooq Abdullah, the National Conference will be represented by two of the parliament members - Mohammad Akbar Lone and Hasnain Masoodi. Tarigami has also been invited as the general secretary of the CPI(M).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-gupkar-alliance-to-discuss-centre-s-meeting-invite-today-101624300356705.html
22-06-2021||India||2 labs move HC over fake testing charges at Kumbh||Two labs accused of conducting fake tests during the Mahakumbh approached the Uttarakhand high court on Monday to quash an FIR against them even as a police special investigation team (SIT) issued notices to the two facilities and the Noida-based private agency that bagged the contract for Covid testing during the holy event.The developments came four days after police booked Delhi-based Lalchandani Labs, Hisar-based Nalwa labs and Noida-based Max Corporate Services for allegedly conducting 100,000 fake rapid antigen tests during the Kumbh mela in April.Max Corporate Services – not related to the Max Healthcare Group – has already approached the high court against the FIR. HT has seen copies of all three petitions.Lalchandani Labs told the high court that it signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Max on March 10 and conducted only 12,000 rapid tests between April 1 and 26.Also read | At Kumbh, some not tested, others not given results“The labs conducted tests at nominal ₹206 per test and total bill for these tests was around ₹24.74 lakh and not crores of rupees reported by media. So there is not an iota of truth in the allegation that crores of rupees have been embezzled by the lab. The petitioners are becoming victims of a media trial”, said Vikas Bahuguna, counsel for Lalchandani Labs.Separately, Nalwa labs also filed a petition in the high court to quash the FIR and sought interim protection. The Hisar-based facility claimed that it signed a MoU with Max on March 10 but neither received any payments nor sent any technicians to conduct tests at the Kumbh.“Max Corporate Services never asked or requested to provide any technical support nor any of our technicians were called for any training,” said Parikshit Saini, counsel for Nalwa Labs. “We are a reputed firm with a 40-year history,” he added. On April 27, after allegations of fake testing surfaced, Nalwa cancelled its MoU, he claimed.But Max rejected the allegations and said it was only a service provider, not an accredited lab to conduct tests. “Max entered into contracts with two labs, which were responsible for sample collection, testing, data feeding and report generation. Our job was facilitation and coordination. We have paid ₹15 lakhs to a partner of Nalwa labs. Nalwa signed an MoU, gave authorization letter, had representatives working on site and uploaded the data from their account. We have sufficient documents to prove our case,” said a representative from Max Corporate Services.The Kumbh mela was curtailed this year but devotees thronged Haridwar for months despite experts saying the crowds and rampant violation of Covid protocol could spark a surge in infections. Roughly 9.1 million pilgrims took the holy dip in the Ganga from January 14 to April 27. The bulk of this -- at least six million people -- congregated in April, coinciding with the worst surge in the second wave of the pandemic.Allegations of fake testing surfaced last week after a Faridkot resident complained to the authorities that he received a message for collecting his Covid report despite never having been tested. The complaint triggered a probe that unearthed roughly 100,000 fake rapid antigen tests.Real-time data checking through the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal revealed fake entries on basis of mobile numbers and addresses of people who were never tested. On contacting such people, many people said they had not even visited Haridwar in April.On Thursday, the three labs were booked for negligence, spreading disease, cheating and criminal conspiracy, and under sections of the 2005 disaster management act and the 1897 epidemic diseases act.There are three separate probes looking into the allegations. One by the district administration, one by the Kumbh mela administration and a third by the police SIT.chief investigating officer of the district probe committee, Saurabh Geharwar, asked the directors of Max, Lalchandani Labs and Nalwa Labs to appear in person on June 24 for questioning. The SIT also served separate notices to the three firms to present ICMR registration, agreement letter, tender and related documents in three days. “Notice serving process is being done by SIT and all aspects are being investigated. SIT is carrying parallel investigation with every angle being probed,” said senior superintendent of police, D Senthil Aboodai Krishan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-labs-move-hc-over-fake-testing-charges-at-kumbh-101624300296798.html
22-06-2021||India||States seek more vaccines to keep new drive’s momentum||Monday’s record of 8.5 million vaccine doses administered till 10 pm will be difficult to sustain beyond a few days, several states admitted , if they do not receive more doses from the Union government, and at regular intervals, which, in turn, will depend on vaccine supplies.Based on current capacity and import details available, it is unlikely that India will have access to the 72 million doses it needs over the next nine days of June and the 248 million doses it needs in July to keep up this pace.Three states West Bengal, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh , all ruled by non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments, did not start the free-vaccines-for-all drive citing shortage of vaccines. But it was clear that both the Union government and other state governments wanted to make a success of Day 1 of the new phase of the vaccine drive.Starting Monday, the Union government will acquire and allocate vaccine doses to the states, for free. These will total around 75% of the vaccines available in India, with the remainder going to private hospitals which will continue to offer jabs for a price. Between May 1 and June 21, the states were responsible for procuring vaccines and vaccinating those in the 18-45 age group.BJP ruled states such as Haryana, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh claimed to have met the vaccination targets and said they have been assured by the Central government that there will be no shortage of vaccines to sustain inoculation of high numbers of people per day. That may be difficult given the overall supply situation.The 8.27 million shots administered is the highest ever in India, and only China has administered more vaccines in a day. Till Monday night, India had fully vaccinated 50.59 million people and partially vaccinated 182.49 million others.Most vaccine manufacturers have assured an increased supply only from August. The peak in supply may happen sometime in October.Also read | Over 8 million shots on Day 1 of new driveA senior official of the West Bengal health department said the state did not start vaccination for all from Monday and continued to only vaccinate priority groups.“We will continue to vaccinate the priority groups first. We don’t have enough vaccines. If we start universal vaccination, there will be a mismatch and the priority groups won’t get the vaccines. Unless we complete vaccinating the target groups we won’t be able to vaccinate others,” said Ajoy Chakraborty, director of health services.On Monday, the state had 1.6 million doses; it has, to date, vaccinated 4.35 million people fully and 10.64 million, partially. “We will get around a million more doses by the end of this month. The consignments are scheduled to arrive on June 24, June 26 and June 27. In July we expect to get an estimated 7 million doses. Private hospitals will get around 2 million doses,” he added.The Maharashtra government, too, decided not to start vaccinating everyone. It continued to vaccinate those over the age of 30, a drive it started on June 19, and which it will continue till it starts getting adequate stock of vaccines from the Centre, said state health minister Rajesh Tope. “We have decided not to start the drive for all above 18 years as we are not getting adequate stock. Thus, the state will continue to cover all the beneficiaries that are 30 years and above,” Tope said. The state started Monday with a stock of 1.5 million doses.Andhra Pradesh, which administered 1.3 million doses on Sunday, was left with 1.28 lakh doses on Monday. “We are expecting a supply of additional doses in a day or two. Only when we get additional supply, we can start vaccination for all,” said G Devanandam, the officer in charge of Covid-19 vaccine distribution in Andhra Pradesh.Madhya Pradesh education minister Vishwas Sarang said the state has enough doses for next three days and will receive more doses by the end of the week. “We had a stock of 1.9 million doses on Monday and this will last three days. We don’t expect any shortage of vaccines.”Officials in Assam said the state has set itself a target of administering 300,000 doses daily from Monday as part of an enhanced immunisation drive and aims to continue it for a month and vaccinate 9 million people in 30 days. Assam had a daily vaccination average of around 50,000 doses and had crossed 100,000 doses in a day only twice (both in last week). To be sure, it wasn’t immediately clear whether the state would receive 9 million vaccine doses from the Union government in the next month. Delhi, for instance, has been allocated only 1.5 million doses for the month of July.Till Sunday, Assam administered 5.35 million doses to its target population of 23.13 million people above 18 years (nearly 65% of the state’s entire population) who are eligible to get vaccinated. On Monday, 2184 vaccination centres were in operation. Assam had a stock of 7,28,000 doses of vaccine on Monday.“The Monday stock will last for two days if we continue administering 300,000 doses daily. We are expecting to get fresh stock of vaccines by Monday evening and it should help continue our drive,” said Munindra Nath Ngatey, director, (health services-family welfare).Bihar, where chief minister Nitish Kumar has directed officials to complete vaccination to all eligible people by year-end, is expected to receive 4.9 million doses by June-end. “We don’t expect a shortage of vaccines to meet the CM’s target of vaccinating all by the end of December,” said a senior officer of the Bihar Health Society.Goa has around 1.30 lakh vaccine doses in stock which will last around six days at the current rate of vaccination. In Rajasthan, an official said the state has around a million doses which could last till Tuesday evening and the next lot of 500,000 doses is expected by June 24, meaning the inoculation drive will resume by June 26. Rajasthan has till date vaccinated over 21.1 million, which includes over 17.5 million with the first dose and 3.5 million with both doses . Officials in Tripura and Haryana said that they have vaccines to continue with the vaccination- for-all drive.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the state met its target of vaccinating 0.6 million people on Monday and expressed confidence that it would vaccinate a million a day in July. “We have been assured of enough supply of vaccines to increase vaccinations,” a state health department official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-seek-more-vaccines-to-keep-new-drive-s-momentum-101624300237437.html
22-06-2021||India||Pawar to host meeting of civil society, Opposition leaders today||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar will host a meeting of Opposition leaders and civil society members at his house in Delhi on Tuesday to initiate discussions about bringing together outfits against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), his party said.The announcement of the meeting -- under the banner of Rashtra Manch, an anti-BJP platform set up in 2018 -- came hours after Pawar met political strategist Prashant Kishor in Delhi over tea, the second meeting of the two in 10 days.NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik said that Tuesday’s meeting was called to hold a primary discussion on uniting opposition parties.“A discussion on the current political situation and primary discussion on how to bring all the opposition parties together is likely to be discussed in the meeting to be held on Tuesday. The exercise is the first step towards the announcement made by the NCP chief that he will be working to unite the opposition parties in the country,” Malik said.Also read | Sonia calls meeting to discuss poll results, Covid-19Kishor sought to play down the meeting and said he won’t be attending the 4pm discussion, where no senior leader of the Congress was called.”I don’t believe that any third or fourth front can defeat Narendra Modi so why would I be part of any such coalition. Just because 15 persons are meeting, you cannot call it a fifteen-party meeting,’’ said Kishor.He also rejected speculation that he was taking on the NCP as a client. “There is no question of Pawar Sahab becoming my client because I have left this space [election strategy]as I announced on May 2,’’ said Kishor. “I had lunch with him when I was in Mumbai recently and so today, he called me and asked me to come over for tea. It was just chit-chat and a routine meeting.’’Malik said those invited for Tuesday’s meeting included Yashwant Sinha, Pavan Verma, Sanjay Singh, D Raja, Farooq Abdullah, KTS Tulsi, Majeed Memon , Vandana Chavan , Ghanshyam Tiwari , Karan Thapar, Javed Akhtar , Ashutosh, SY Qureshi, Arun Kumar, KC Singh, Sanjay Jha, Sudheendra Kulkarni, Colin Gonsalves and Pritish Nandy.The meeting comes amid a growing rift between the Congress and its alliance partner Shiv Sena and NCP in Maharashtra. The parties have differed over whether to fight upcoming polls in alliance or separately.Sinha, a member of Trinamool Congress, later tweeted that Pawar was hosting a meeting of the Rashtra Manch, a political action group floated by Sinha in 2018. “We shall have a meeting of the Rashtra Manch tomorrow at 4pm. Sri Sharad Pawar has kindly agreed to host the meeting at his place,” he said.“We haven’t met for 15 months,’’ said Sinha, ”So when our member told Pawar Saheb, he kindly invited us to have the meeting at his house. That’s all there is to it,” he addedOn Pawar’s meeting with Kishor, Malik said, “Being a strategist he (Kishor) knows the current political situation and what may happen in the coming days, which he is believed to have shared with the NCP chief. At present, Pawar saheb has only one agenda of making an alliance of opposition parties against BJP before him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pawar-to-host-meeting-of-civil-society-opposition-leaders-101624300236832.html
22-06-2021||India||LS secretariat adds all major Indian languages in course for lawmakers||A course on select languages organized by the Lok Sabha secretariat for lawmakers and their families has expanded to include almost all major Indian languages including Sanskrit, following suggestions from MPs that their own mother tongues be included.A parliamentary bulletin issued on June 10 said Tamil, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Telugu and Odiya and as many foreign languages would be taught online. The month-long programme planned by the Lok Sabha secretariat is aimed at providing basic understanding of the language that may come in handy when inter-parliamentary delegations visit different countries.Two officials directly familiar with the matter said many lawmakers called up the Lok Sabha secretariat to request inclusion of other Indian languages. “The issue reached the Lok Sabha Speaker’s office. It was decided to accommodate all the requests,” said one official who asked not to be named.Now, with 21 Indian and six foreign languages, the online programme starting Tuesday, will be the biggest in the history of Parliament. It has also been thrown open to MLAs across the country and parliament officials.The courses are aimed at giving some understanding of the language to the lawmakers and officials as this may come in handy when inter-parliamentary delegations visit different countries. But with inclusion of so many languages, the officials are not sure if all courses will see high attendance. The courses would be conducted by faculty from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Delhi University and Jamia Millia Islamia. This is the first such training programme in the recent history of parliament.“(Courses in) All Indian Languages under the Eighth Schedule of Indian Constitution will be organized as part of the programme”, said the revised notice. Classes in Gujarati, Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Sanskrit, Assamese, Kashmiri, Sindhi, Urdu, Santhali, Nepali, Meitei (Manipuri), Bodo, Dogri, Konkani, Maithili and Punjabi will be taught.The foreign language courses offered are French, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. The officials cited in the first instance said Mandarin has been deliberately left out as a consequence of the recent developments in Ladakh Theatre where the armies of the two countries continue to face off. A senior Opposition MP who asked not to be named said it should have been included as “it is the most important language for 21st century from geostrategic and other perspectives. For Indians, Chinese has more value that learning Portuguese or even Spanish.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lssecretariat-adds-all-major-indian-languages-in-course-for-lawmakers-101624300176814.html
22-06-2021||India||Study: Delta variant more transmissible than others||The number of secondary infections caused by a person infected by the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of the Sars-Cov-2 increases by 97% as opposed to the virus seen first in Wuhan, a study in the United Kingdom has found. It has concluded that this variant seen first in India is far more transmissible than any other variant.The study, published in the European journal for infectious diseases, Eurosurveillance, assessed the data uploaded by 64 countries to the global Sars-CoV-2 genome sequencing database GISAID. It found that the effective reproductive number increased by 29% for the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) first reported from the UK, 25% for the Beta variant (B.1.351) reported from South Africa, and 38% for the Gamma (P.1) variant reported first from Brazil.Of the six variants of interest, the researchers found two to show statistically significant increases in the effective reproductive number – the Kappa variant (B.1.617.1) by 48% and Eta variant (B.1.525) by 29%.But what does a 97% increase mean? “It means if the previous virus was transmitting from one person to two, the Delta variant would transmit to four people,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.He added that the effective reproductive number is based on two factors – the R0 (R-nought) or a fixed reproductive number for each virus, and population immunity. “I don’t quite understand how they calculated effective reproduction number independent of population immunity, but what they have shown is a collective upward trend of the variants across the 64 countries,” John said.The researchers found a “clear competitive advantage” of the Delta variant as compared to the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants. The effective reproduction number of the Delta variant increased by 55% as compared to Alpha, 60% in comparison with Beta, and 34% in comparison with the Gamma variant.This was consistent with the finding of a 42% increase in the secondary attack rate (the probability of an infection occurring in a specified unit, such as household or among close contacts) of the Delta variant as per epidemiological investigations in the UK.Physicians from India have also repeatedly pointed out that the secondary attack rate was much higher during the second wave of the pandemic in April-May when almost all members of a household got the infection if one person was infected -- something that did not happen previously.The researchers have said that to control the pandemic, given the rapid spread of the Delta variant in many countries, stricter curbs will have to be imposed and for longer periods. The spread will also stretch the healthcare systems, as was seen in India during the height of the second wave where people struggled to find beds in hospitals.Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, said the study is consistent with “what has already happened”. “A huge, fast second wave. This is the same as what we said in our pre-print study: that the Delta variant is up to 50% more [transmissible] than the Alpha variant, and the Alpha variant is more [transmissible] than the non-variants,” he said.The number of infections is much lower in India right now, but the Centre has asked the states and Union territories not to let their guard down.The UK researchers have said that higher transmissibility also means that the threshold for herd immunity will go up, leading to an increase in vaccination coverage targets.Dr John said population immunity in India is already significantly high after the huge second wave of infections in April-May. “I estimate that the population-level immunity is already at 80% in India. Now, vaccination should be targeted towards people with comorbidities and pregnant women to prevent deaths. Vaccination in children must also be introduced so that schools can re-open safely,” he said.However, the researchers have left a warning note. “The convergent evolution of mutations thought to be associated with higher transmissibility or immune escape highlights the fact that variants will probably continue to emerge under selective pressures. The emergence of new variants threatens the effectiveness of vaccines and require constant evaluation of available diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccination strategies as the Covid-19 pandemic continues,” the study concludes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-delta-variant-more-transmissible-than-others-101624300116730.html

On Saturday, the state government filed a review petition and also asked for the order to be stayed.But the bench, headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal, refused to recall the order.”The way the state was proceeding in the matter, which required immediate action, did not inspire confidence,” observed the bench, also comprising justices IP Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talukdar.Also read | Centre initiates disciplinary proceedings against Alapan BandyopadhyayHours after the order, NHRC set up a seven-member panel to look into complaints of post poll violence. The committee will be led by Rajiv Jain, the former Intelligence Bureau chief who assumed charge as NHRC member on June 2, a statement by the human rights body said.The panel will examine all complaints of post-poll violence received by NHRC, Bengal state legal services authority, visit affected areas and submit a report to the high court on present situation and steps to be taken to restore confidence.“The committee shall also point out the persons, prima-facie, responsible for crime and the officers who maintained calculated silence on the issue,” said the statement.In court, the bench heard out the state government but wasn't convinced. The bench, which told the state government that it could give its action-taken report on the complaints received by the NHRC, made a pointed reference to complaints of police inaction and observed that the conduct of the state did not inspire confidence of the court.The court also pointed out how the NHRC had received 541 complaints in contrast to the state’s human rights commission, which hasn’t received a single one. “After hearing learned counsels for the parties, we do not find any case is made out for recalling, modification or stay of the order passed by this court on June 18, 2021,” the five-judge bench said.The NHRC committee headed by Rajiv Jain also comprises National Commission for Minorities vice chairman Atif Rasheed, National Commission for Women member Rajulben L Desai, NHRC’s (director) investigation Santosh Mehra and DIG (investigation) Manzil Saini, West Bengal Human Rights Commission registrar Pradip Kumar Panja and the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority Member Secretary Raju Mukherjee.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which mounted a campaign against the Mamata Banerjee government over the violence that allegedly targeted supporters of opposition parties after the May 2 verdict, called Monday’s ruling a “tight slap”.“Rape, murder, arson, every heinous crime took place and the state government denied it. Bengal’s politics of violence is established today. This is a tight slap on the face of the @MamataOfficial and the @AITCofficial govt,” tweeted Ritesh Tiwari, BJP state vice-president.TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh refused to comment on the ruling. “The BJP is making up stories to create disturbance because it could not win the elections,” he said.In proceedings before the high court and the Supreme Court – the top court is hearing a plea for compensation for the victims - the Bengal government has insisted that the government was able to control the violence that broke out before Banerjee was sworn-in on May 5. Victims of the post-poll violence, however, told the top court last week that they were still facing a “hostile attitude”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-to-probe-post-poll-violence-plaints-as-hc-rejects-bengal-plea-101624299576732.html
22-06-2021||India||At Kumbh, some not tested, others not given results||When an ambulance rolled into an akhada in Haridwar early in April to carry out Covid tests of the Kumbh Mela pilgrims assembled there, scores of seers queued up outside with their identity proofs.Over the next few hours, the ambulance staff took down their names, phone and Aadhaar numbers, but conducted no tests. “We waited and waited while the staff had meals at our bhandara. A few hours later, they drove away without testing any of us. They never provided any reason,” recounted Govind Das, a Naga sadhu at the Panch Nirmohi Ani Akhada, one of the smaller akhadas, in Haridwar.Three testing camps were held at the akhada in the first half of April. Sita Ram, a seer, said he got tested on two occasions but neither received a text confirming the test nor any results.Many of the akhada’s members had similar complaints: Sample collectors not conducting tests, not taking down their contact details and not informing them of results. Similar allegations were levelled by members of at least two other akhadas.Together, they pointed to new allegations that, in addition to fudging data about 100,000 rapid antigen tests during the Mahakumbh in April, some labs conducted no tests at all.“We will probe whether the accused private labs carried out tests in the first place. We’ll also simultaneously probe if the tests they seemed to carry out were genuine or just an eyewash,” said Haridwar senior superintendent of police (SSP) Senthil Avoodai Krishnaraj.Roughly 9.1 million people thronged the Kumbh mela this year despite experts saying the crowds and rampant violation of Covid protocol could spark a surge in infections. Many Kumbh returnees contracted Covid and infected others in various states, said authorities. At the time, the mela administration said it was taking all possible precautions by conducting rapid tests and holding on-site testing camps.But allegations of fake testing surfaced last week after a Faridkot resident complained to the authorities that he received a message for collecting his Covid report despite never having been tested. The complaint triggered a probe that unearthed roughly 100,000 fake rapid antigen tests. Three firms – a Delhi-based lab, a Hisar-based lab and a Noida-based private agency – have been booked.“Testing camps were held at this akhada three times during the Kumbh Mela. Only once did they even bother to take the phone numbers of the saints they tested. If they were not going to tell us our results, we don’t know why they even kept visiting us,” said Rajender Das, president of the Panch Nirmohi Ani Akhada.At the Nirvaani Ani Akhada, which has 1,000 members, Chittaranjan Das said that two camps over a week were held in April and around 300 seers gave their swab samples, but to no avail . “The testing staff wouldn’t even ask for our phone numbers. They said they would give us our results in a day or two,” said Chittaranjan.When the results didn’t arrive, the seers confronted the sample collectors when they returned a week later. “This time they assured us that the results would surely be given the next day. The results never came,” Chittaranjan added.But other members said after the altercation, the lab staff took away two seers with them. “The seer arguing with them was told to being Covid-positive. Another saint who had shaved his head earlier in the day was also taken away on the pretext that he had come in contact with the ‘infected’ man,” said Ram Vijay, a member.The two men were sent back to the akhada less than a week later, Vijay added. For Covid patients and their contacts, two-week isolation is mandatory.At the Sri Panchayati Niranjani Akhada, which is among the biggest akhadas, seers received their results either within a couple of hours or two days.But some still reported problems. Jagat Bharti, a member, said he received a result at a camp organised by the akhada but got no results when he was tested outside. Mahant Ravinder Puri, secretary of this akhada, said one camp where 50 seers were tested here yielded no results despite a follow up. “Since we were worried about the results, we got all these 50 seers tested again at a private lab outside,” said Puri.Harbeer Singh, additional mela officer, said, “I had nothing to do with the testing process and was mainly involved with coordinating with the akhadas”.Haridwar SSP said that the SIT will visit the akhadas as part of their probe to know if the tests carried out on them were authentic.“We are carrying out the probe in a planned way. The tests that were carried out have a trail that can be used to ascertain their authenticity. We are still probing if there was malafide in the testing process, or negligence, or they were bonafide. If crime was committed, it will be caught,” said Krishnaraj.He said that the probe, which began with two private labs, will soon extend to all other labs. Shambhu Kumar Jha, the chief medical officer (CMO) of Haridwar, was unavailable for comment despite repeated phone calls, text messages and visits to his office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-kumbh-some-not-tested-others-not-given-results-101624299397639.html
22-06-2021||India||Duflo, Rajan, Subramanian, Dreze, Narayan in TN’s new economic advisory panel||Tamil Nadu has constituted what is already being dubbed as a “dream team” of economists to advise chief minister MK Stalin.Governor Banwarilal Purohit made this announcement during his address at the first meeting of the 16th legislative assembly of the state on Monday. Named the “Economic Advisory Council to the Chief Minister” , the economists who will help chart a rapid and inclusive economic growth plan for Tamil Nadu are Nobel laureate Esther Duflo, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, former chief economic adviser to the Indian government Arvind Subramanian, development economist Jean Dreze, and former Union finance secretary S Narayan.The five-member team was put together by finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan, who was an investment banker in the US and Singapore before he entered politics. “The chief minister was keen that we must get the best minds in the world to help us. Our priority is that growth should be inclusive,” said Rajan.“Both Professor Rajan and Dr Subramanian are Tamilians. Professor Duflo has been working with Tamil Nadu through J-PAL,” he added. Duflo and her spouse Abhijit Baneerjee with whom she shares the Nobel prize are co-founders of Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) that frames policies for poverty alleviation that are informed by scientific evidence. Narayan, also a Tamilian, is the author of “The Dravidian Years- Politics and Welfare in Tamil Nadu”.“Based on the recommendations of this Council, the government will revitalise the state’s economy and ensure that the benefits of economic growth reach all segments of society,” the governor said. “In recent years, we have seen a slowdown in Tamil Nadu’s economic growth rate. This government will make all out efforts to reverse this trend and usher in a period of rapid economic growth taking full advantage of the available limited window of the demographic dividend.”Later in the day, the government said in an order that the additional chief secretary of the finance department, S Krishnan will act as the convener of the council. The order said that the fiscal situation of the state is precarious .“In this context, the government requires expert advice from the best economists available globally, who are familiar with Tamil Nadu, its economy, society and polity, as also the trends in the Indian and global economy,” the order said.A white paper detailing the true state of the state’s finances will be released in July, so that the people of Tamil Nadu are fully informed, the Governor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/duflo-rajan-subramanian-dreze-narayan-in-tamil-nadu-s-new-economic-advisory-panel-101624299336728.html
22-06-2021||India||SC questions Centre on ex-gratia payouts||The Supreme Court on Monday lamented the absence of uniform guidelines on payment of ex-gratia to the families of those who have died of Covid-19, and questioned the Union government whether there was a conscious decision taken by the Prime Minister-headed National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) against framing of the compensation scheme.The bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah observed that the ad-hoc ex-gratia payments being made by the state governments were a cause of “heartburn” among the citizens since different states paid different amounts.“Where is the decision against payment of ex-gratia? Was it a conscious decision or was it not considered at all during the first and second wave of the pandemic? We cannot see any document regarding the fact that the national authority, under the honorable Prime Minister, had considered this and then a decision was taken,” the bench asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre.Also read | Over 8 million shots on Day 1 of new driveThe question came in the wake of the Union government’s affidavit stating that the ex-gratia amount of ₹4 lakh (ex-gratia is mandated under the disaster management law) cannot be paid to the families of those who have died of Covid-19 as it is beyond fiscal affordability, and the finances of central and state governments are under severe strain. The Centre maintained such payouts may have the “unfortunate consequences” of affecting the pandemic response because the central and state governments were already under severe financial burden due to reduction in tax revenues and increase in health expenses on account of the pandemic.As the bench set out to examine the affidavit on Monday, it failed to find any document in support of the Centre’s stand on not having framed a scheme for ex-gratia payments under NDMA.Senior advocate SB Upadhyay and advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, appearing for the two public interest litigations (PILs), complained that financial constraint could never be a ground to shy away from constitutional and legal obligations that the Union government has under NDMA.Mehta, on his part, tried to draw a distinction between Covid-19 and any other disaster such as floods and earthquakes. While it is mandatory under Section 12 of NDMA to frame guidelines prescribing ex-gratia as part of ‘Minimum Standards of Relief’, the S-G submitted to the court that “the peculiar and unprecedented situation” created by Covid-19 would require a situational interpretation. He said that the law will have to be interpreted like such a scheme on ex-gratia was only recommendatory and not mandatory.“Ex-gratia may not be insisted upon when the government was spending huge amounts on securing food security, hospital infrastructure, medical equipment, vaccine coverage, which equally are means for mitigating or preventing the pandemic...It is not the case of the government that we do not have money. But our focus is on managing the disaster through a multipronged approach,” said Mehta.He also read from the report of the Finance Commission for 2021-26, which allocated funds under Disaster Risk Management, to make the point that ex-gratia of ₹4 lakh for every person who loses life due to Covid-19 will alone mop up the entire allocations under state disaster relief funds.But the court told the S-G that a decision on ex-gratia under Section 12 was nonetheless essential. “The recommendations by Finance Commission cannot override statutory requirement under NDMA,” it remarked.Meanwhile, the petitioners contended that the scheme framed under Section 12 by the Union home ministry (MHA) in its letter of March 14, 2020, consciously dropped ₹4 lakh ex-gratia from the list of relief. This letter was issued at a time when the first wave of the pandemic was yet to set in.The court failed to find any document issued after March 2020 where ex-gratia payments to Covid-19 deceased was considered. Even the April 2015 MHA letter announcing the ₹4 lakh ex-gratia payout was meant to operate till 2020. The affidavit did not mention if this period was extended.The bench reserved orders on the petitions while giving the Centre three days to file written submissions on the questions raised, including whether a pan-India uniform compensation scheme for Covid-19 deaths could be fixed.Also read | Study: Delta variant more transmissible than others“Can’t there be any uniform standards for compensation? Otherwise, there will be heartburn that somebody has got, and somebody has not. If a migrant worker goes and dies elsewhere, he may be at a loss,” it told Mehta.The bench was responding to an application filed by the families of Covid-19 deceased who complained that Bihar was offering ₹4 lakh compensation from CM Relief Fund while Delhi announced ₹50,000 for Covid-19 deaths.The Centre also gave details of the ₹50-lakh insurance cover provided to nearly 2.21 million health care providers under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP). The court asked Centre to indicate if the same covered Class IV employees and crematorium workers, equally at risk for providing Covid-19 services.Referring to the government’s compulsion on registering Covid-19 deaths, the bench told Mehta that the procedure was complicated and needed to be simplified so that any person admitted with Covid-positive report was declared as a Covid-19 death.The bench said that hardships of common man must be borne by policymakers as harsh reality exists on ground. “In this country you see when morality and humanity is gone and black marketeering is happening, our priority has to be the poor, common man,” the bench said.Calling the government’s submission on financial constraints “an afterthought”, senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said, “It shows that the court is rightly asking the question: did the govt at all apply its mind to the payment of ex-gratia. Absence of even consideration of the issue is a glaring omission fully reviewable by the court. The Centre’s submission on lack of money appears to be an afterthought if mind was not applied to the issue at all. The amount needed for this would be paltry compared to the huge collection under PM-Care or several cess or taxes that have been imposed by the government.”There was no response from the government on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-questions-centre-on-ex-gratia-payouts-101624299276856.html
22-06-2021||India||Over 8 million shots on Day 1 of new drive||India vaccinated a record 8.5 million people till 10pm on Monday, the start of the new phase of its vaccine drive -- more in a single day than any country other than China -- even as questions remained over whether the country can keep vaccinating at this pace through July. If it were to, the country would need 260 million doses next month, and it isn’t clear whether it will have that many.Still, Monday’s record numbers mean the new phase of its vaccine drive is off to a good start – by end of day, over 233 million Indians had received at least one shot and more than 50 million were fully vaccinated. “Today’s record-breaking vaccination numbers are gladdening. The vaccine remains our strongest weapon to fight Covid-19. Congratulations to those who got vaccinated and kudos to all the front-line warriors working hard to ensure so many citizens got the vaccine. Well done India!” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet in the evening.The country has set its sights higher. “We will be prepared to jab close to 10 million people in a single day by August,” said Dr NK Arora, chairman, working group on Covid-19 vaccines in India.That is an ambitious target, and, again, one that will depend on supplies, but Monday’s performance shows that if supplies aren’t a constraint, Indian can vaccinate a lot of people in a day.According to the latest available information, Serum Institute of India (SII) will produce 100 million doses of Covishield in July, and perhaps more from August. And, according to media reports, Bharat Biotech will continue to produce only 20-25 million doses in July, with the capacity likely to double from August. In a statement on May 28, Union health ministry said Covaxin production was being increased from 10 million doses a month in April to 60-70 million a month by July-August. The capacity is expected to reach nearly 100 million a month by September 2021, it added.It isn’t clear how many doses of Sputnik V will be available in July, and whether local production will start in August as planned (and if so, how many doses will be produced).SII and Bharat Biotech did not respond to requests for a comment. Dr Reddy’s, which has the rights to market the first 250 million doses of Sputnik V in India, said the vaccine has only had a soft launch so far, and more arrangements were being made. “All necessary supply arrangements are being executed to ensure availability of both dose components in the right quantity and at the right time at partner hospitals. Once the pilot phase is completed, Dr Reddy’s will announce the commercial launch of Sputnik,” the company said.Also read | 'Well done India!' PM Modi tweets as India records highest Covid-19 vaccinationOn Monday, almost every state in the country vaccinated the most people ever covered in one day until now, but some warned that they may not be able to keep up the pace unless supplies were replenished.“The Centre is claiming that it will inoculate every citizen for free from today (Monday). Upon enquiring about this free vaccination drive, it was confirmed that not a single dose of free vaccine has been distributed in Delhi. On top of that, only 1.5 million doses have been earmarked for Delhi for the month of July which is not enough. If we receive doses at this pace, then instead of three months, it will take approximately 15-16 more months to vaccinate everyone in Delhi,” said deputy chief minister of Delhi, Manish Sisodia.A senior official of the West Bengal health department said the state did not start vaccination for all from Monday, and continued to vaccinate only the priority groups. “We don’t have enough vaccines. If we start universal vaccination, there would be a mismatch and the priority groups won’t get the vaccines. Unless we complete vaccinating the target groups, we won’t be able to vaccinate others,” said Ajoy Chakraborty, director of health services.Officials from some other states, particularly those ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said they do not expect shortages. “We had a stock of 19 lakh doses on Monday and it would last three days. We don’t expect any shortage of vaccinations,” said Madhya Pradesh education department minister Vishwas Sarang.Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said he was confident the state will meet a million vaccinations a day target for July. “We have been assured of enough supply of vaccines to increase vaccination pace,” a state health department official said.A Union government official said replenishments will be done periodically. “We have finite vaccine supplies at the moment, hence, will be distributed as per the laid down protocol. Having said that there is no shortage of vaccines, and supplies will be replenished to states from time to time,” said a senior central government official aware of the matter, on condition of anonymity.India’s vaccine drive began on January 16, for health care workers, expanded to include all front-line workers on February 1, and then, everyone over the age of 60 years and people over the age of 45 with co-morbidities, on March 1.On April 1, it was further expanded to include everyone over the age of 45. Then, in response to demand from states and people, the drive was opened up further, to everyone over the age of 18 years, although states were told they would have to pay for the vaccines of those between the ages of 18 and 45. Private hospitals were also allowed to offer vaccinations. However, with supplies constrained, the drive faltered. The country’s Supreme Court too termed the approach “arbitrary”, forcing a rethink.On June 7, Prime Minister Modi announced that the Centre would again be in charge of sourcing and supplying vaccines. It would, he added, buy 75% of locally available vaccines, with the remainder being reserved for private hospitals. And it would bear the cost of the entire 75%, he added.The new phase of the vaccine drive comes even as cases of Covid-19 are declining in the country, with the ebbing of the second wave. However, with most states opening up and allowing movement and activities to resume, experts fear that there could be a spike in cases – unless India vaccinates more people. Till Monday evening, 24.6% of the eligible population of 940 million people had received at least one dose of the vaccine.“I am happy to see the increased pace of vaccination. Making universal adult vaccination free has helped, along with walk in registration facility for all ages. We should utilise available stocks fully without letting hospitals hold them unused. With more vaccines likely in July-August, the pace should pick up further. We now need to step up efforts to increase coverage in rural areas,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, senior public health expert, and founder, Public Health Foundation of India.To cover more people, India needs more days like Monday. Which means it needs more vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-8-million-shots-on-day-1-of-new-drive-101624299216725.html
22-06-2021||India||CBSE to form panel to check Class 12 marks complaints||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will set up a committee to redress grievances of Class 12 students over the marks awarded under the tabulation scheme, and also give them the option to sit for an offline exam to improve their scores, the board told the Supreme Court on Sunday.In an affidavit filed through its counsel Rupesh Kumar, CBSE clarified that the offline exams for such candidates will be held between August 15 and September 15, subject to the easing of the Covid-19 situation.A bench of justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari will take up the affidavit on Tuesday as some petitions that have challenged the tabulation scheme of CBSE and Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) could not be listed on Monday.Last week, the two boards submitted their tabulation formulae in court. CBSE has adopted a 30:30:40 formula to evaluate Class 12 students, where 30% weightage will be given each to the Class 10 and 11 results and 40% will be on the results of pre-boards or internal assessments held in Class 12. CISCE’s assessment scheme differs from CBSE’s as it judges students mostly on their performance in Class 11 and 12.Also read | Sisodia inspects pace of construction at 4 new Delhi govt schoolsBut both these schemes were found wanting on two fronts — lack of a proper dispute resolution mechanism, and clear dates for holding optional exams.CISCE informed the court that it would want to hold the optional exams before September 1. As regards grievance redressal, it said the scheme allows candidates to submit complaints to their respective schools, which would forward them to the board within a week.The CBSE also stated in its affidavit that all disputes regarding computation of results will be referred to a committee formed by the board. This has been made part of the assessment scheme as well. In addition, the CBSE scheme provides that any candidate who wishes to appear in the optional offline examination will have the facility of registering online. As and when conditions are conducive, the board will hold physical examination limited to the main subject papers. The marks obtained in this examination will be treated as final.But parents aren’t happy. A plea filed by a parents’ association in Uttar Pradesh has asked for the holding of offline examinations and criticised the tabulation schemes of both the boards. The parents have said that there is a scope of manipulation in CBSE’s scheme as it is left to a result committee in every school to tabulate marks and send them to the board.The court has also listed for Tuesday an application filed by three private/compartment candidates who have demanded an assessment scheme like that for regular students. CBSE has said that examinations for such candidates will be held under the assessment policy for the academic year 2019-20 that it had framed last year.These candidates coming from Odisha, Tripura and Delhi have claimed to have the support of 1,149 Class 10 and 12 compartment/private candidates across the country.The same bench will also hear another petition challenging the decision of various state boards to hold Class XII examinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-to-form-panel-to-check-class-12-marks-complaints-101624297898672.html
22-06-2021||India||Rajasthan’s red stone to adorn Central Vista revamp||After pink stone for the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, Rajasthan will now provide its famous red stone from the Barmer-Jaisalmer region for the Central Vista, local government officials said.The Lakha red granite of the state will be used in the construction of the iconic Central Vista project. The project envisages constructing a new Parliament House, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the vice president, as well as new office buildings to accommodate ministry offices.Named after Lakha village, the red granite is found on the border of Jaisalmer and Barmer districts will be utilized in the construction of flooring, walkways, and pillars in the Central Vista . The sourcing has been going on for the past two months and thus far 55,000 cubic meters of stone have been sold.Lakha red granite is coveted for its unique red shade. It has a smooth texture and waves of multi-coloured microparticles on the red make this stone very eye-catching.Bhagwan Singh Bhati, an engineer with the state’s mining department in Jaisalmer said that Lakha red granite is famous for its colour. It is also exported to many other countries, he added.A major supplier of this stone, Kamal Singh Kohra, claimed that his firm, The Kohra Lakha Red Granite, is supplying around 80% of the total demand.Singh said that so far he has supplied around 600 trucks of stone which will be used in the construction of one lakh feet area. “Before transporting, the raw stone is processed here,” he said.Another mine owner, Shaukat Ali, said Lakha is a rare and high quality stone which is found only in the region Lakha. “This reddish granite is not available anywhere else in the world.”Ali added that the same stone was used in the National War Memorial near India Gate in New Delhi; his firm supplied granite that now covers 300,000 square feet at the War Memorial, he added.“It is an export quality stone and mostly used outside India. It is in high demand outside India in countries such as UAD, Turkistan, China, and Istanbul. In view of this many local mine owners have opened their branch in these countries,” said Manoj Gujar, a mine owner in Lakha.Pink sandstone from Banshi Paharpur in Bharatpur district in Rajasthan is being used in the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. Recently, the Central government allowed the conversion of forest land into revenue land so that Rajasthan government can auction mines in Banshi Paharpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthans-red-stone-to-adorn-central-vista-revamp-101624297776624.html

22-06-2021||Today's||Effect of high temperatures, low productivity on India’s growth prospects||In the middle of the most devastating pandemic India has seen in a century, it can be hard to think of the other challenges that lie ahead of us. Lest we forget though, there is arguably no country in the world that has seen as much economic damage from the pandemic as India. Recovery will not be quick or easy, and the policy challenge over the next decade is to deliver stable growth, likely driven by the manufacturing sector. Any such growth will also have to tackle the imminent threat of the climate crisis.A new research study published in the Journal of Political Economy flags a worrying threat for India. With academic colleagues in the United States and India, I gathered over 15 years of data on the output of factories across India and data on the daily productivity and attendance of selected factory workers in different Indian cities. We combined this information with daily information on weather conditions across the country and then linked the two pieces of data using a set of rigorous statistical models.Also Read | The 1991 reforms: The right people at a tight timeWe found that high temperatures consistently hurt economic output by reducing the productivity of human labour. During hot spells, people were less productive at work and more likely to be absent. At an individual level, this is not surprising but aggregated together, we found that factories produced about two per cent less revenue for every degree rise in annual temperature. It is probably not a coincidence that previous scientific work over the last decade has found that countries consistently show lower Gross Domestic Product (GDP) output and growth in hot years. Unproductive labour may be a big part of the explanation.The biggest negative effects of temperature appeared to be on labour-intensive plants. This is a problem for India because our manufacturing competitiveness in the future will have to rely on cheap labour. As temperatures rise, and workers grow less efficient, we risk losing out on the razor-thin margins that characterise a competitive, global economy. In effect, India is staring at a “heat tax” on labour, a tax that will slowly rise over time.Is climate control the answer? Our research suggests it may not fully solve the problem. For one thing, air-conditioning substitutes the virtual heat-tax for a very real electricity bill. In large factories, this may be a worthwhile trade, but in the small-scale, informal sector, it is unlikely that air-conditioning is always feasible. Furthermore, even with climate-control, we find that temperature may still increase absenteeism. This might be because workers – or their families – are still exposed to severe heat at home.The labour-temperature relationship is a function of human physiology. Policy cannot change this. However, its implications for manufacturing output will depend on where factories are located, whether they use workers as a critical input, and how much temperatures rise.We can only speculate from here, but companies are likely to ask themselves whether it makes sense to set up shop in the searing hot summers of north India, especially when low-cost labour is made less attractive by reduced productivity. If they choose to do so, they might invest in climate control as protection, but they could also consider automation.Alternatively, moving to other places might prove to be the most competitive choice. Both robots and relocation are likely to hurt job growth and shift the geographical balance of economic prosperity within India. Combined with the fact that crop yields in the Gangetic plain are also predicted to fall sharply due to the climate crisis, it is critical that we think urgently about how to ensure climate-resilient growth in north India.So how do we deal with the costs of heat? Sadly, there are no easy answers. We need to fund research into cooling technology, from low-cost air-conditioning to wearable individual solutions. In small firms, air-conditioning could be strategically used by cooling only the most labour-intensive portions of the manufacturing floor. Finally, skilled labour adds more value than unskilled work, so technical training is essential, especially in hot parts of the country.Anant Sudarshan is South Asia director, Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/effect-of-high-temperatures-low-productivity-on-india-s-growth-prospects-101624367800033.html
22-06-2021||Today's||The 1991 reforms: The right people at a tight time||For those of us older than 50, India has been transformed beyond belief. From 1991, the Indian economy ascended from its long period of 3-3.5% annual real growth to a new normal of 6-6.5% over the next 25 years. The economy is now about five times the size it was in 1991. And poverty has fallen from an estimated 45% to not more than 15% (pre-Covid-19). However, India is still a low middle-income emerging economy and has miles to go before poverty is eliminated.Since the 1991 economic reforms were a clear break from India’s earlier economic direction ever since Independence, how did they happen?There was no ideological break as exemplified by the ascendance of Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan in the United States (US), which led to the spread of market fundamentalism globally in the 1980s. In India, it was the same Congress party, which had presided over the central planning-dominated, import-substituting licence-permit raj earlier, which ushered in the new India in 1991.Moreover, the progenitors of the 1991 reforms were a trio of self-effacing leaders, not noted ex-ante for bold policy action. But Prime Minister (PM) PV Narasimha Rao provided political leadership with great sagacity; finance minister Manmohan Singh brought in intellectual and technocratic heft, backed up by his long experience in all the highest organs of economic policymaking; and principal secretary AN Varma was the suave indispensable bureaucratic enforcer, again with long experience in economic ministries.First, the impetus for reforms came from the unfolding of a full-fledged economic, fiscal and balance of payments crisis.Second, the crisis necessitated resort to seeking rescue from the Washington twins, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, with the associated policy conditionality. There is nothing like a crisis and policy conditionality that focuses the political and bureaucratic mind.Third, there was an emerging technocratic consensus on the direction, if not details, of reforms, over the preceding decade, even though there wasn’t such a political consensus. What distinguished that period from the present was that there was a band of technocratically inclined reformist civil servants embedded in key administrative and economic positions across the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This pattern, which continued in the 1990s and 2000s, enabled the formulation, implementation, consistency and continuity of reforms across six governments. This set included both reform-minded experienced Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers and government-embedded economists, with the domain knowledge and skill to steer the reform process once political direction was given.By the early 1980s, there was an increasing perception of industrial and economic stagnation, and the need for a new direction, particularly in view of the remarkable economic success of neighbours in Asia. A succession of committees was set up and headed by noted technocrat-civil servants such as LK Jha, M Narasimham, Abid Hussain and Arjun Sengupta on areas such as deregulation, trade reform and public enterprise reform. Their reports pointed towards some hesitant liberalisation, though in homoeopathic doses.Similarly, the Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices (BICP), which hitherto acted as the czar of a whole range of administered-industrial prices, began to change tack in the 1980s, recommending some cautious price deregulation under the successive leadership of another set of modernising civil servant-technocrats: Lovraj Kumar, Yoginder Alagh and Vijay Kelkar. So, by the early 1990s, reform was in the bureaucratic air of the bhavans, if not in the prevailing political dispensation.In the political sphere, when the VP Singh government came to power in December 1989, this new non-Congress formation wanted to differentiate itself from the Congress history of licence-permit raj. Ajit Singh was appointed the new industry minister. A graduate of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and the Illinois Institute of Technology, he had worked in IBM in the US, and was instinctively critical of the stifling industrial control system. This was just the signal we needed, and we prepared A New Industrial Policy of 1990 with alacrity under the then leadership of industry secretary, AN Varma, despite a less-than-enthusiastic response from the then finance ministry under Madhu Dandavate. After Cabinet approval, Ajit Singh announced a relatively comprehensive industry policy statement in Parliament on May 31, 1990, but this was stillborn as the government fell in 1990.But this was the precursor to the eventual more radical 1991 industrial policy reform. During the same period, Montek Singh Ahluwalia had prepared a wider economic policy document (since dubbed the “M” document) within VP Singh’s Prime Minister’s Office. The contours of needed economic reforms were, therefore, already available in late 1990.PM Chandra Shekhar then took over. In late 1990, on return from the South Commission in Geneva, Manmohan Singh was appointed as his Cabinet-rank economic adviser. As Singh began to grapple with the economic crisis, he had already started thinking of structural reforms. He, therefore, asked me for the existing 1990 industrial policy document, which I had developed further. So, Singh knew that a framework on industrial policy reforms was in place, prior to his joining the new government in 1991.Rao chose to take the industry portfolio himself; he appointed Singh as finance minister and fortuitously appointed Varma as his principal secretary, both of whom had full knowledge and ownership of the proposed industrial policy reform. That the PM chose to retain the industry portfolio helped, and industrial policy reform could be formulated without new negotiations with an industry minister. Thus, the troika of industry policy reformers was fully in place.Despite lukewarm support from the ruling party, the prior technocratic preparation enabled the announcement of a reformist budget and a radical new industrial policy within five weeks of the new government coming into power on June 21, 1991.That such a significant redirection in economic policy could take place in India was, therefore, a result of various concatenating circumstances — the objective existence of a severe economic crisis; the availability of bureaucratic and technocratic talent and experience; and the fortuitous placing of key personnel at the ministerial, bureaucratic and technocratic levels: The right people in the right places at a tight time.Rakesh Mohan was the economic adviser to the Government of India in the industry ministry in 1991. He has also served as chief economic adviser, secretary, economic affairs and deputy governor, RBI.
