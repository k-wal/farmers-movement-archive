28-06-2021||Noida||Noida: Mercury soars as monsoon unlikely before mid-July||Noida: The mercury soared on Monday in Noida with weather analysts predicting dry and hot days for another week as the monsoon is delayed further.According to the weather department, there is no chance of south-west monsoon in the city till the second week of July due to a “break” in monsoon conditions in which the monsoon trough confines to the foothills of the Himalayan region.On Monday, the city sizzled with the maximum temperature crossing 41°C.“The monsoon trough is shifting towards the foothills of Himalayas therefore dry, westerly winds will keep the Indo-Gangetic plains and the central part of the country warm. Weather will remain dry for the next one week in the region and if a drizzling happens, it will be patchy and won’t make much of a difference. There is a break in monsoon conditions which happens when the monsoon trough shifts towards the foothills of Himalayas and stays there while the rest of the region receives dry winds. There is no chance of monsoon advancement before July 7 or at least the second week of July,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change.On Monday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded a maximum and minimum temperature for Noida at 41.3°C and 28.6°C, respectively, against 40.1°C and 28.9°C on Sunday. At the Safdarjung monitoring station, considered average for the National Capital Region, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 40.2°C and 27.6°C, respectively.“For next three-four days, the maximum temperature of the region will remain around 40-41°C. The south-west monsoon is not advancing yet due to several meteorological conditions, however, from July there are chances of light rains that may bring slight respite from the soaring temperatures,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.He added that there is a “weak monsoon condition prevailing”.“For now, the monsoon is weak and unable to advance further from western Uttar Pradesh, which is also unable to receive much rainfall. We are for now not in a position to tell when the monsoon may advance. For now, we know that it is not advancing any further till July 2, after that we will be in position to get a better picture,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-mercury-soars-as-monsoon-unlikely-before-midjuly-101624904833676.html
28-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh headed for chaos: HC||The Chandigarh administration has been unable to cope with the urban growth effectively and the city is headed towards chaos, the Punjab and Haryana high court has said while initiating suo motu proceedings on infrastructure issues and poor planning in the UT. Observing that a number of issues need to be monitored, the court in its order dated June 25, said that otherwise the city will not be able to regain its past glory and turn into another urban mess.The HC lamented that even though the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952, provided that there would be no urban development within 16 km of the city’s periphery, both Punjab and Haryana set up parallel townships of Mohali and Panchkula, respectively, and the area originally meant to cater to a population of 5 lakh is now housing 30-40 lakh people. Observing that so far it has been ensuring and monitoring the city’s development, the HC said: “However, since the town is a Union Territory, it suffers from futuristic long-term development plans on account of administration being headed by the bureaucracy which is posted in Chandigarh on deputation basis for short periods of around 2-3 years.” Besides the short tenure of the officials, the court also pointed to the lack of elected representatives, as the mayor holds office for just one year on rotation basis and there is a lone Member of Parliament. “Every time proposals come through, but are jammed up in technical studies on footfall viability of projects and no one is accountable for seeing or pushing through the need of the hour of the town, leading to future decay,” the court observed, citing how there is no planning for public transport system to connect neighbouring towns. The court questioned whether the infrastructure provided by the administration has grown in proportion to the growth of the city beyond Sector 30 and if the problem is on account of inadequate resources. “The town thus suffers from planned infrastructural projects coming up, though it has to host a large number of visitors, who come to the city on daily basis on account of town being the capital,” it said taking suo motu note and seeking responses from both Chandigarh and the Centre. The UT has also been told to file an affidavit regarding any addition to cycle tracks and augmentation done over the years and money spent on it. The details on the number of street lights installed in the city and the data regarding the percentage of those working have also been sought. Traffic issuesThe court said that people are commuting on a daily basis from as far as 60 km from Patiala, Nawanshahr, Kalka, Ambala and Sirhind, but no effort is being made to plan a public transport system. It questioned whether the city requires Mono Rail or Metro Rail for seamlessly connecting inflow from the adjoining towns of Kalka-Parwanoo in the north, Yamunanagar on the northeast, Ambala on the south, Patiala on the southwest, Sirhind, Fatehgarh Sahib and Kharar on the west, and Nawanshahr and Ropar on the northwest, which could help reduce the traffic on all the adjoining highways. The court also pointed to shortcomings in the construction of underpasses. The solitary underpass built in 1960s between Sectors 11 and 15 has not been replicated in any other portion of the city, the court said, adding that despite various recommendations, the city has no traffic underpass at high-density points, such as Transport Chowk and Press light point.The pedestrian underpass between Rose Garden and Sector 17, which cost ₹9 crore, is grossly underutilised with a footfall of just 200 pedestrians. Another is being proposed between PU and PGIMER without any thought for future planning, said the court. The court also wanted to know as to why the Lake Road/Uttar Marg that is blocked at the turn of Punjab Engineering College and Khuda Ali Sher not be opened to facilitate ready movement for people commuting to the Capitol Complex.Green issuesThe court also raised several questions concerning green cover and its pollution. It suggested that Rajindra Park be developed as a forest area with walkways on the pattern of the Forest Institute at Dehradun to augment the green cover of the city. It questioned what steps various departments have taken to plant fresh trees in green belts, which are being consumed by the termite. It also sought statistical data of living and dead trees and steps taken to ensure that the latter are felled in time to prevent mishaps. The court questioned whether sewage is being discharged into the nullahs, especially N-Choe, and whether any checking is being done to ensure if there is any violation of any previous order. It also sought information on dumping of construction debris in green belts and nullahs and steps being taken to challan the violators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-headed-for-chaos-hc-101624904774241.html
28-06-2021||Noida||95% saplings planted in 2020 drive survived, says Noida forest dept||Noida At least 95% of the total plantation carried out by the district forest department in 2020 survived, but 5% did not due to various reasons, said officials on Monday. The department officials made the comment after taking stock of last year’s plantation ahead of planning the drive this year, which is likely to happen in July.In July 2020, the forest department and 28 other public departments planted as many as 936,000 tree saplings of 35 indigenous tree species in a single day mass plantation drive across the district. The department planted more than 271,000 saplings out of the total 936,000, and 95% of it has survived.“At least 95% of the saplings planted in 2020 survived, but 5% did not. It is a rough estimate, and this often happens in such a mass drive. There are various reasons including weather conditions, improper plantation, and toy exceptions among others, why the 5% did not survive. We had geotagged most of our locations, and the dead plants will be replaced with new ones during the this year’s drive,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.The district is likely to see a plantation drive this year, with Gautam Budh Nagar having a target of planting 1,026,000 tree saplings. The forest department will plant as many as 325,836 saplings, said the officials.“The date for the drive this year is yet to be announced, but we expect it to be held in July. There is also a possibility that the drive will be organised for over a week this year, and not just for a day,” Srivastava added.According to the officials, the Uttar Pradesh government aims to have a total green cover of more than 15% (36,146-sq-km) of its geographical area by 2021, against the present 12.09% (29,133.5-sq-km). At present, Gautam Budh Nagar has a total of 5-sq-km of moderately dense forests (density of 70%-40%), while 15 are open forests (density of 39%-10%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/95-saplings-planted-in-2020-drive-survived-says-noida-forest-dept-101624904713621.html
28-06-2021||Noida||Jaypee gets chance to take over F-1 land||Greater Noida The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) on Monday approved a proposal that will allow the Jaypee Group to regain control of the 1,000 hectares, including the land on which the Formula-1 Buddh International Circuit, is built.On December 21, 2019, the Yeida had cancelled the land allotted to Jaypee, defaulting on payment of around ₹1,000 crore. The company went to court that asked it to deposit ₹100 crore first, which it did. Now, Yeida said it will give more time to the company to pay the dues provided it satisfied a few conditions.“The first condition is that they deposit 10% of the total dues upfront. Subsequently, they will get an opportunity to pay the remaining dues in instalments, and the total dues amount will have to be paid by 2023. We will not allow them to pay beyond 2023,” said Arvind Kumar, Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary and Yeida chairman.Earlier, the company had demanded that it should be allowed to pay dues by 2030.“We have turned down that request. If they fail to pay by 2023, then the developer will lose the land,” Kumar added.“Once we get a written communication from Yeida, we will take appropriate decisions on it,” said the Jaypee Group spokesperson.Jaypee Sports International Limited (JPSI), a subsidiary of Jaypee Group, was the company that had been allotted the land on which it developed the circuit in 2011.After the cancellation, Yeida had started the process of issuing a global tender to auction the property and recover the dues. But JPSI filed a petition before the Allahabad High Court, seeking a stay on the cancellation of allotment and the sealing on the grounds that Yeida could not provide basic services as per its promises, such as sewer connection and water supply to the property. The Allahabad HC had directed Jaypee to deposit ₹100 crore before the hearing of the case.“The Allahabad HC has continued to hear the petition pertaining to the land cancellation. But the Yeida board has decided to provide them an opportunity to get back the land. The restoration will happen only if the Jaypee pays 10% upfront, without any delay,” Kumar said.The Formula-1 circuit hosted the Indian Grand Prix (IGP) from 2011 to 2013. It was removed from the F1 calendar in 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/jaypee-gets-chance-to-take-over-f-1-land-101624904653582.html

On the vaccination front, there were 615, 273 doses administered across the state on Monday, thus bringing the total to 31,770,849 doses.State immunisation officer Dr DN Patil said it all depends on the doses received from the central government. “We have the necessary infrastructure and planning in place. Our drive depends on the number of doses supplied by the central government,” said Dr Patil.Thackeray said the state has been very aggressive in this front. “We are fully prepared to vaccinate 1,500,000 citizens daily,” said Thackeray. Meanwhile, state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte held a meeting of district collectors and municipal commissioners, asking them to work out a detailed plan to tackle a potential third wave. He stressed on the coordination between major cities with the small towns. He said that all should ensure adequate liquid-oxygen supply, along with hospital beds and medical personnel.The state has also now taken level three as its base, in terms of lockdown relaxations, and hence places like Pune, Navi Mumbai and Thane, which had opened up, were forced to roll back their relaxations from Monday in view of the Delta Plus variant of Covid-19.Meanwhile, traders at Kolhapur have given a two-day ultimatum to the state government to allow them to open their shops. Their contention is that the Covid-19 cases are higher in rural parts and the urban shopkeepers are being unnecessarily penalised for this surge.

28-06-2021||Noida||Yeida hikes land allotment rates by 5%||GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) on Monday decided to hike land allotment rates by 5% across all categories, including residential and commercial, for the financial year 2021-22, officials said. The decision was taken at the Yeida’s 68th board meeting held at its office in Greater Noida. Last year, the authority had refrained from increasing the allotment rates in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.In the meeting, the authority approved the ₹4,100 crore annual budget for the current financial year. As per the budget proposals, Yeida will spend ₹1,290 crore (about 30% of total budget) on developmental work, ₹800 crore on land acquisition, ₹540 crore on various works related to Jewar airport project, ₹300 crore on multi-modal connectivity, ₹1,000 crore on repaying debt and remaining on administrative purposes. Yeida had approved the ₹3,891 crore for the last financial year. The authority increased the land allotment rates citing the 4.5% inflation rate. “The inflation rate is 4.5%, so the board decided to approve a 5% increase in land allotment rates. The increase is nominal in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The hike in rates will be applicable to all kinds of properties, including residential, industrial, institutional and group housing,” said Arvind Kumar, chairman, Yeida. Currently, Yeida has a land allotment rate of ₹16,870 per square metres (sqm) for residential plots, ₹44,000 per sqm for commercial plots, ₹17,200 per sqm for group housing, ₹7,870 per sqm for industrial plots and ₹8,020 per sqm for IT-enabled service plots. “Now, the new allotment rates will be 5% more of the existing rates,” said Kumar. According to the officials, Yeida will spend a major chunk of its funds on developmental projects, including road construction, laying of sewage network, and drains. It will get about ₹2,870 crore revenue in 2021-22 by selling plots and collecting property dues from old allottees. “Due to the Noida International Airport project and the Eastern Peripheral Expressway connectivity, the demand for all kinds of land has increased manifold. As a result, we expect to collect ₹2,318 crore by selling plots in the current financial year and ₹553 crore revenue will be collected in lease rent, repayment and transfer charges from old allottees,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida. The authority has also relaxed the conditions for the developers, who have defaulted on payment of the group housing land. “As per the new rules, a defaulter now can pay 10%, unlike 15% earlier, of total land dues to become eligible for getting more time to pay the defaulted money against the group housing land. The builders will get the opportunity to pay their remaining amount in instalments,” said the Yeida chairman. The authority has also provided much-needed relief to around 850 industrial plot allottees of a 2013-14 scheme. “Due to litigation over the land, the authority could not provide possession to these allottees on time. Therefore, we have declared zero period of two years in which they do not need to pay any interest that is levied on plot’s cost dues. Now, these allottees do not need to pay any interest from 2018 to 2020,” said Singh, the Yeida CEO. Singh said that the UP government will take a final decision as to which model is suitable to develop the Film City project. “The board has approved a proposal to allow further study on Film City project’s economic viability. We want the best model to develop it so that it earns revenue,” he said. The authority has also decided to conduct a study on a probable mode of commute to connect proposed Film City in Sector 21 with upcoming Logistic Hub in Tappal of Aligarh along the Yamuna Expressway. “We want to conduct a study to figure out as to what mode of commute will be the best to connect these two projects. The study will be completed in the next six months,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/yeida-hikes-land-allotment-rates-by-5-101624904534476.html

28-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bizman arrested in Rs17.51-cr cheating case||The economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police has arrested a businessman, who along with his associates allegedly cheated 45 exporters from the city and other parts of the country to the tune of ₹17.51 crore. The accused, Durgaprasad Kuna, 43, is one of the directors of a Dubai-based company, which joined hands with other companies in importing onions, coconut, fruits from Indian companies by paying 30% in advance. Kuna was arrested by unit five on the complaint of the owner of a Ghatkopar-based import-export company, ASG Industries Pvt Ltd. The complainant had in 2018 sent onions, coconut, pomegranate to Agro Growth Food Stuff Trading LLC, Dubai, after receiving 30% in advance. But later the company defaulted on the payment. According to the EOW, like Agro Growith Food Stuff Trading LLC, there are two other Dubai-based companies –Badr Ahmed Juma Hussain and OPC Foodstuff Trading LLC – which have indulged in wrongful practices. The three companies have the same modus operandi and cheated 45 businessmen to the tune of USD 2399705.44 (approximately ₹17.51 crore).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bizman-arrested-in-rs17-51-cr-cheating-case-101624904533701.html
28-06-2021||Noida||Noida: No vaccination at govt centres on Tuesday||The Uttar Pradesh government has reduced the number of vaccines it sends to Gautam Budh Nagar and other districts in view of the mega vaccination drive set to start from July 1, said officials. This will reduce the daily vaccinations till at least June 30.The Gautam Budh Nagar health department announced there will be no vaccinations at government centres on Tuesday.“Due to the acute paucity of vaccines, we have suspended the vaccination drive on Tuesday. We have intimated this issue to the higher officials of the government. Once we get the vials from Lucknow, we’ll be able to restart the ongoing vaccination drive in the district,” he said. “Since we are going to take up a mega vaccination drive from July 1 when the district will aim to vaccinate 25,000 people a day, the number of vials that will be given to us will be fewer. We’ve been told that the district will be given at least 125,000 vaccine doses on June 30, to kick off the mega vaccination drive.”On Monday, many people who had booked slots at the Sector 30 district hospital were forced to wait for longer as there was a delay in vaccines reaching the centre from Lucknow.“The Co-WIN portal – on which the people book their slot – is not in our control and so we could not inform people except through notices pasted at the centre. As a result, both the hospital staff and people suffered today. But what can we do if the hospital runs out of vaccines? I came to know that many people have booked their slots for tomorrow also. We can’t help them anyway,” he said.Dr Neeraj Tyagi, the district immunization officer, said that the vaccination figures will go down in the next few days. “It is obvious. The vaccination figures in government hospitals were 16,740 on June 26 and 15,127 on June 27. On Monday it was 9,175. The Sector 30 district hospital that vaccinated 3,715 people on Saturday could vaccinate less than 2,000 on Monday,” he said.The planThe health department has divided the district into 56 clusters for the July drive, each covering 10 villages or sectors depending on whether they are in rural or urban segments.“We’ve trained 143 teams for this drive. Apart from hospitals and community and public health centres, the district health department will also have some temporary vaccination booths in this drive,” said district magistrate Suhas L Y. “Bisrakh block will have as many as 24 clusters, under which 70 vaccination teams will be operative. While Dankaur block will have 12 clusters with 30 teams, Dadri and Jewar will have 12 clusters with 25 teams and eight clusters with 18 teams respectively.”CMO Dr Ohri said that a mobile quick response team will be on standby for any emergency.Prasun Dwivedi, sub-divisional magistrate (Sadar), also said the meetings of tehsil task force are being held on a regular basis, to chalk out a blueprint for vaccination of everyone over 18 years in Greater Noida, from July 1. “We have properly coordinated with residents’ welfare associations, pradhans, kotedars, anganwadi workers and ward members, to increase numbers for upcoming vaccination,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-no-vaccination-at-govt-centres-on-tuesday-101624904413553.html

We had necessary evidence, and nabbed Singhal immediately,” said a senior police official, requesting anonymity.Based on the constable’s complaint, a case was registered against the suspect under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 279 (rash driving), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), and 307 (attempt to murder) at the Sector 58 police station.Singhal was produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/man-driving-on-wrong-side-of-road-assaults-traffic-constable-nabbed-101624904293588.html

Schools will teach these bridge courses for Class 2 to Class 10 from July 1 to August 14. The regular syllabus will start in schools only after August 14, SCERT has stated. Speaking at the inauguration of the courses, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad said that last year due to the pandemic, the students and teachers had to resort to online education.“Due to this, many students were unable to get the necessary attention. Even though the school education department started various initiatives to get the syllabus going, many students were left out. As a result, these bridge courses are designed. From Class 2 to 10, these courses will give a thorough revision of important topics that students will need as a base to start the next academic year,” said Gaikwad.She added that the team from SCERT have organised these courses for students who may have doubts about the syllabus from the previous academic year.The lectures will be held for 45 days online, from July 1 to August 14. The lectures will be in Marathi and Urdu for better clarity for students. The courses will cover Mathematics, Social Science, Science, and will also include Marathi, Urdu and Hindi languages.Bacchu Kadu, minister of state for education, added that the bridge courses will ensure that students from all strata of society receive education.“These bridge courses will reach students who had a learning loss in the previous year due to the pandemic. They can now do revision and start with the new academic year,” said Kadu.As per SCERT officials, the regular syllabus for the current academic year will start only after the bridge courses are finished. Students during the course are expected to fill worksheets. Their worksheets can be used by the schools for internal assessment. During the bridge courses, students will be given at least three tests at regular intervals. The aim of these tests is to examine how much the student has understood and where the child needs to improve.Vishal Solanki, commissioner of education, said that students should focus on topics that they find difficult.“This course is designed so that the basics are clear for every child and they can start their new academic year with confidence,” said Solanki.Vandana Krishna, additional chief secretary, School Education, said “Teachers can help students perform better by eliminating their doubts through the bridge courses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/scert-launches-bridge-courses-for-classes-2-10-ahead-of-new-academic-year-s-syllabus-101624904233533.html

The decision was taken at a meeting held on Monday by state higher and technical education minister Uday Samant, with vice-chancellors of universities in the state. “A meeting was held today with all the vice-chancellors of the non-agricultural state universities, and it was unanimously decided to give a concession in the fees for aided and unaided colleges affiliated to these universities. The exact amount and details of this concession will be declared on Tuesday,” said Samant. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, students and parents, especially from the rural areas, have been financially affected. The fee concession will certainly help students complete the academic year. Savitribai Phule Pune University’s (SPPU) vice-chancellor Prof Nitin Karmalkar said, “Today’s meeting held by the minister Samant was fruitful. Various options were discussed to give concession in the fees. There are many stakeholders at a university and after discussing with them, the exact percentage or amount will be finalised. As the fee structure of every university is different, concessions need to be worked out well.”“Also the decision taken by the SPPU to cancel fees of those students who have lost either a single, or both parents, due to Covid was appreciated. The minister appealed to other university chancellors to take a similar decision,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-universities-agree-to-reduced-fees-for-academic-year-202122-101624904234109.html
28-06-2021||Chandigarh||SC again clears decks for power privatisation in Chandigarh||The Supreme Court on Monday once again stayed the Punjab and Haryana high court’s stay order against the privatisation of the Chandigarh electricity department, clearing the decks for the process. Senior standing counsel, UT, Pankaj Jain confirmed that the apex court has stayed the high court order. “Notice has been issued today and stay granted in favour of UT,” Jain said, adding that the case will now be taken up in mid-August. The matter was listed before the bench of justice Abdul Nazeer and justice V Ramasubramanian. The UT administration had argued that the HC order goes against the SC’s previous order. The HC on May 28 had stayed the administration’s move to privatise the power department. The order was passed on a fresh plea from the UT Powermen Union, which had approached court stating that opening and finalisation of the tender bids be stopped. It was argued that the administration is not justified in hurrying through the process amid the pandemic. Earlier, on December 1, too, the HC had applied brakes on the privatisation process. However, the UT had approached the SC, which stayed the order and remanded back the case to the HC. The decision to privatise the department was taken on May 12, 2020, after directions from the Centre, but has been stuck in litigation. However, now the administration can go ahead with the process. “The administration will soon finalise the financial bids and hand over the power department to a private firm,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity. Seven companies are in the fray: Sterlite Power, ReNew Wing Energy, NTPC Electric Supply Company Limited, Adani Transmission Limited, Tata Power, Torrent Power and Eminent Electricity Power Company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sc-again-clears-decks-for-power-privatisation-in-chandigarh-101624904114180.html
28-06-2021||Other||This Sangam city ‘Tarzan’ has risked his life rescuing 2K reptiles and wild animals||Ankit aka Tarzan of Prayagraj is busy these days rescuing reptiles and other animals that have come out of their burrows following the heavy rains in the district. Ankit Jaiswal (24), a reptile and wild animal catcher of the city, rescues snakes, monitors lizards and other wild animals being spotted in homes and other areas of the city, and releases them safely in their natural habitat.The prime objective is to safely rescue the animal before it is killed by panic-stricken people. Ankit, a resident of Kydganj locality, and his friend Ashish rush to the spot soon after they receive a call about the presence of a wild animal. He has rescued over 2000 animals until now, including snakes and big lizards but crocodiles, alligators, Kabar bijju, pythons, fox, jackals, and peacocks. Besides receiving rescue calls from people across the city, he also receives help from the police, army and other departments, if any wild animal is spotted on their premises. Moreover, the forest department often takes his services for rescuing reptiles. Without using any safety gear, Ankit takes a risk in rescuing the wild animals. Despite being bitten once by a Cobra during a rescue operation, he continues saving the lives of animals and relieving locals from their terror. “People usually call local police station after they spot snakes or wild animal inside their houses. As I have given my number to many cops, they immediately contact me for rescuing the animal. I along with my friend Ashish, immediately rush to the spot after receiving the call as my main objective is to catch the snake or the other animal alive before it is killed by local people. We then release the rescued animal usually at Arail and the forest area of Bhita. We do not have any fixed fee for the service but we accept whatever people give us for the expense of coming to the spot. People should not panic after they spot snakes or wild animal, and instead, they should evacuate the place immediately. The reptiles themselves are afraid of humans and try to escape in a bid to save their life,” he shared. Ankit has not taken any formal training to catch and rescue animals but has developed the expertise by watching TV channels—Animal Planet, National Geographic, Discovery etc. “I developed an interest in reptiles and wild animals as I used to watch these channels. I was inspired by the teams of experts engaged in rescuing reptiles and animals and saving their lives. While the experts on these channels are equipped with sophisticated safety equipment and anti-venom, I have to rely only on a stick to catch the deadliest of snakes. Once rescuing a large cobra in the Andawan area, I was bitten in my finger as soon as I tried to catch it. However, the bite was not too deep and I reached the hospital with the rescued cobra where I was given treatment’” he said.“With heavy rains lashing the region, at present, I am receiving 5 to 6 calls each day for rescuing snakes and monitor lizards. Last year, I was called, for catching a Kabar bijju (honey badger) which has entered High Court premises, while, I also rescued a crocodile that has entered Karenda village on the banks of Yamuna River in the Kareli area. Recently I rescued some large pythons in Naini and Cantonment areas,” he further said. However, despite giving his services, while risking his life, his repeated requests to the forest department to appoint him on some post or give him some fixed fee for his job have fallen on deaf ears. “I have made requests to many officials for my appointment in the forest department, but no positive response was given by them,” he complained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/this-sangam-city-tarzan-has-risked-his-life-rescuing-2k-reptiles-and-wild-animals-101624903274031.html

Asthan also planted a guava sapling near his house after returning from Sanjay Van.Sushil and Asthana shared that 30 to 40 persons converged at the Sanjay Van last Wednesday to plant saplings in Smriti Vatika in memory of loved ones lost during the pandemic.Besides families, the forest department also invited a few nursing staff, ward boys and ward sweepers from LLRM Medical College to plant saplings of their names as Corona warriors.The initiative was the brainchild of divisional forest officer of Meerut Rajesh Kumar who thought of giving existing ‘Smriti Vatika’ campaign a different and innovative dimension by linking it with the memory of those lost to the pandemic, and to honour Corona warriors who worked hard during pandemic, even risking their lives.District magistrate of Meerut K Balaji also appreciated the initiative and assured his support and cooperation. He directed officials to look for more vacant places where more such plantations could be carried out. He also planted a Baniyan sapling in the Smriti Vatika.Divisional forest officer Rajesh Kumar said that the department has demarcated an enclosure as ‘Smriti Vatika’ inside the Sanjay Van and the idea behind inviting family members of Covid-19 victims and Corona warriors together to plant saplings to show respect for them and to add a new dimension in the existing project of ‘Smriti Vatika’.The DFO said that a similar plantation drive will begin in the rural area from the first week of July, and plans are afoot to invite families from villages to plant saplings in the memory of their lost loved ones. “We will develop similar Smriti Vatika in different rural locations,” said Kumar and added that “It would help forge a bond between flora and people”.He also appreciated the group of doctors and people who have been promoting plantation through their organisation ‘Haritima’.The DFO said that the initiative is open for all and people interested in planting a sapling in memory of their beloved can contact him at his office or on mail dfomeerut@gmail.com.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/keeping-memory-of-kin-lost-to-covid-alive-by-planting-saplings-101624902793490.html

Banerjee and Ghatak missed their deadlines to respond to the CBI plea. On June 9, the high court declined to take the affidavits on record. Banerjee and Malay Ghatak approached the Supreme Court on this point.The top court on Friday told the TMC leaders to file a fresh request to the high court and asked the high court to decide “de-novo” the fresh pleas. The Supreme Court said the TMC leaders, in their application, shall give reasons in support of bringing the affidavits on record at this stage of hearing. It added that an advance copy should be sent to the CBI to enable it to come up with a response by Tuesday, the next date of hearing.The Narada case pertains to a two-year-long sting operation whose videos were uploaded months ahead of the 2016 assembly elections. The sting, conducted by online news portal Narada News, allegedly caught TMC leaders accepting money in exchange for alleged favours to a fictitious company.The CBI alleged that Banerjee, Ghatak and other TMC leaders played a key role in stopping agency officials from performing their legal duty after the four leaders were arrested. It claimed that Banerjee sat on a six-hour-long agitation at the CBI office at Nizam Palace in south Kolkata after the arrests while Ghatak went to the Banshall court premises during the virtual hearing of the case before the special CBI court on May 17. The agency has accused Ghatak of trying to influence the judge who heard the bail petition of the accused leaders.The judge granted bail to the four politicians on May 17 but the high court stayed the bail order the same night. The four leaders have since been released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-ghatak-file-new-request-in-calcutta-high-court-ahead-of-narada-hearing-101624902194472.html

They have threatened to go on a complete strike from July 4. Out Patient department (OPD) services remained suspended in government hospitals, medical colleges and veterinary hospitals. Doctors are protesting under the banner of the Joint Punjab Government Doctors Coordination Committee. This is also the fourth consecutive day when health care was hit, as doctors were also on strike on Friday; Saturday and Sunday were government holidays, and then too only emergency services were available in hospitals. Doctors are not attending to jail inmates as well, but Covid patients are being taken care of. Punjab State Veterinary Officers Association, Rural Medical Officers Association, Punjab Dental Medical Officers Association and Punjab Ayurveda Officers Association are also supporting the protests. “Punjab health secretary and other officers are appealing to us to withdraw our strike. We, however, will discuss our demands with the entire panel of the state government that has been constituted to listen to issues of employees, opposing the Pay Commission recommendations that the state cabinet has accepted,” said PCMS president, Dr Gagandeep Singh, while addressing a press conference with other joint committee members. The doctors claimed that the government was deliberately creating an impression that the NPA is an allowance given to doctors for not doing private practice, while many such other professions exist. “The fact, however, is that even the Supreme Court has observed in one of its judgments that the NPA is actually a risk allowance, given to the doctors as they are exposed to every serious disease,” said vice-president of the association, Dr Gagandeep Shergill. Doctors also claimed that the government was systematically destroying the health infrastructure in hospitals that it runs. “Already, doctors are not ready to join government service because of meagre salary. Such arbitrary reductions and ending the NPA would further discourage professionals,” they said. Later, members of the joint committee met the panel of government officials that the finance secretary and the health secretary are leading and gave a detailed presentation on why the NPA needed to be increased than being reduced. PATIENTS RECOUNT HARASSMENTPatients returned without getting consultation and treatment in districts like Moga.. Baljeet Singh, 52, of Chotian Kalan village, said, “I am suffering from a liver disease and I came to Moga civil hospital to see a doctor. I have been told to come on Tuesday.” Over 400 patients visit the OPD at Moga civil hospital every day. All OPDs, routine labs and administrative services in civil hospitals in Faridkot, Moga, Bathinda, Muktsar, Ferozepur and Fazilka districts remained closed on Monday. At the Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital (GGSMCH), Faridkot, interns and junior residents (JR) also joined the protest under the banner of Junior Doctors Association and Medical Students Association. Dr Shilekh Mittal, medical superintendent, medical college and hospital said: “Most OPD services remained closed.” Dr Chander Shekhar Kakkar, a senior vice-president of the PCMS Association, Punjab, said, “The government must act fast and accept our demands.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/npa-reduced-health-care-services-paralysed-as-govt-docs-continue-strike-101624901774085.html

Officials of the DTCP said that the developers illegally constructed these farmhouses and were planning to sell plots on an area of 10 acres, for the construction of farmhouses. The plot where the colony was developed is classified as agricultural land and is owned by private developers, as per the administration’s revenue records.RS Bhath, the district town planner for Gurugram, said while two farmhouses were under construction, the third was developed as a model house to lure gullible buyers. “The developers, taking advantage of the lockdown, were trying to develop 10 acres of land illegally despite the fact it is on the foothills of Aravallis. No permission was taken and all norms were violated,” said Bhath, adding a road network and other constructions were also demolished.The DTCP also issued a notice to a family that was residing in a farmhouse in the area to vacate the premises. An FIR would be registered against the developers, officials said. As per urban development rules of the state, Gurugram district is notified as a “controlled urban area”, where permissions are required to be taken from competent authorities for developing a colony. The enforcement team of the DTCP deployed three earthmoving machines to demolish the structures. A team of the Gurugram police personnel was also present at the spot to keep a check on the situation. Ashish Sharma, an assistant town planner with the enforcement wing, said that the developers had also levelled 15 acres adjoining the illegal colony and carried out road mapping in the area. “An adjoining plot was also cleared of markings. The owners have been given a clear warning that any construction without permission from the competent authority would be demolished. Criminal cases would also be registered against violators,” he said. The development of illegal farmhouses in the Aravallis and on its foothills has been a major issue faced by the district administration and urban local bodies. Last year, the department had demolished 19 such illegal farmhouses in the Aravallis, after the Supreme Court took cognizance of the violation. Last week, the Sohna Municipal Council demolished 10 illegal farmhouses constructed in Raisina village, which is located close to Gairatpur Bas village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/illegal-farmhouses-on-foothills-of-aravallis-demolished-in-gurugram-101624900454140.html

Secretary, UP Basic Shiksha Parishad, Pratap Singh Baghel in an order on Monday said, “The programme of distributing appointment letters to teachers has been cancelled. The new date and time for their distribution will be announced separately later.” Earlier, these newly appointed assistant teachers were to get their appointment letters on June 30. The merit list has already been announced on June 26. “However, the counselling process, including verification of documents of selected candidates, is being held as per schedule on Monday and Tuesday (June 28-29), Baghel said.In the recruitment of 69000 teachers, some posts reserved for general and Scheduled Tribes (ST) categories were left vacant on which the recruitment process is being done now, said an official familiar with the issue. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had earlier said instructions had been issued to complete the process of recruitment on 69,000 vacant posts of assistant teachers for Scheduled Tribe candidates in a time-bound manner. He said previous vacant posts should also be filled at the earliest. He said in four years four lakh youth were appointed in government jobs.It took the state government two years to wrap up the appointment of 69,000 assistant teachers in government primary and upper primary schools across the state. The posts were advertised in December 2018 and the state government had conducted the examination for the post of assistant teacher in January 2019. The government could complete the appointment only in December 2020, after a long-drawn legal battle in the high court and Supreme Court after candidates filed a lawsuit.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had distributed appointment letters to select recruits in October and December last year and even interacted with them while others received them from local MLAs, MPs and UP ministers in their respective districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/distribution-of-appointment-letters-to-6k-assistant-teachers-deferred-101624899853329.html

Samajwadi Party will win 2022 polls by sweeping 350 seats,” Akhilesh claimed.In a statement issued by SP, he said: “The chief minister, in his arrogance of power, crossed all limits in rigging the district panchayat chairpersons’ polls in the state. His anti-democratic conduct has put the existence of constitutional institutions in peril. By holding public mandate hostage, the BJP leaders in nexus with the state administration forcefully and deceitfully prevented Samajwadi Party candidates from filing their nominations. And the SP leaders are being harassed by filing fake cases on them. The sad part is that instead of checking such persons who were disrupting the poll process, the officers concerned chose to be mute spectators instead of taking action.”Akhilesh further alleged that after getting rejection from the people, the BJP people in Balrampur in a bid to forcibly ensure its victory put the SP candidate under “house arrest” and snatched the nomination papers. Similarly, in Lalitpur also BJP people did not allow the SP candidate for file the nomination papers, he alleged.Akhilesh also alleged that some BJP elements laid siege to the main gate of the collectorate in Gorakhpur and “guarded” every entry point to the collectorate. “Such an act in the chief minister’s home district was shameful,” he said.He alleged that in Jhansi the SP candidate was prevented from filing the nomination, in Varanasi the SP candidate’s nomination was rejected in a conspiracy while in Basti, some people tried to abduct the SP candidate.In Ghaziabad, just before the nomination the SP candidate and his proposers were abducted; in Bareilly, a former SP MLA was attacked and in several districts the police and revenue officer instead of stopping malpractices played an active role, he further alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-accuses-yogi-of-foul-play-in-dist-panchayat-chairpersons-polls-101624899733337.html
28-06-2021||Ranchi||BJP boycotts TAC meet over ‘unconstitutional’ regulations, JMM hits back||The three BJP legislators, who have been appointed members in the newly constituted Tribes Advisory Council (TAC), boycotted a meeting of the panel on Monday, alleging that the TAC regulations notified by the state government earlier this month violates schedule fifth of the Constitution. The party also listed other faults in regulations, including lack of provision to a “tribal essentially being made chairman of the council”, besides many provisions of quota for a woman and a representative from primitive tribal group (PVTG). Traditionally, the chief minister is the ex-officio chairman of the TAC council. Till now all chief ministers in Jharkhand have been tribals, barring Raghubar Das, who was in power from 2014 to 2019. TAC is an advisory body to deliberate, suggest and even review the government’s decisions and policies related to tribal rights and development. The Hemant Soren government on June 4 cleared the new regulations, that were notified on June 7, giving the authority of appointing members of the 18-member council to the chief minister. The power earlier lied in the hands of the Governor. The government later constituted the new panel, which includes the three BJP legislators, besides two non-elected members. “The new regulations are unconstitutional, as they violate the spirt of the Constitution’s fifth schedule. Instead of making the CM its ex-officio chairman, a provision should have been made that only a tribal can head the council. Besides, we had demanded that there should be a permanent seat for a woman and a representative of PVTG, but the government turned it down. The present woman member is by virtue of being a legislator. So, we have decided to boycott the TAC meeting till they amend the rules,” said BJP legislature party leader Babulal Marandi.Besides Marandi, former BJP minister Neelkanth Singh Munda and legislator Koche Munda are the two other members of the council. Reacting to the development, JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya held a press conference and charged the BJP of diverting people’s mind on a day the chief minister again pledged the government’s commitment towards development of tribals. “Babulal Marandi should answer whether CM Hemant Soren, who is heading the panel, is not a tribal. Is Sita Soren not a woman member in the panel? And as far as PVTG representation is concerned, one seat is still vacant in the panel. He should have waited a while. In fact, Marandi should be rest assured that a non-tribal will not hold the TAC chairman chair, as BJP is not going to return to power in the state for 50 years,” the JMM leader said, taking a swipe at the BJP leader in an apparent reference to allotment of Raghubar Das as the only non-tribal CM of the state. On the issue of conditionality of regulations for giving appointment power to the CM, Bhattacharya reminded that it was the BJP government in Chhatisgarh that first made a similar move in 2006, and the Hemant Soren government was just following it’s footsteps. “The decision of the Raman Singh government in Chhattisgarh was challenged in court, but both the High Court and the Supreme Court refused to strike it down,” said Bhattacharya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/bjp-boycotts-tac-meet-over-unconstitutional-regulations-jmm-hits-back-101624898774028.html

The team of vaccinators, comprising UNICEF personnel, local health workers and professionals, completed the task of administering the first dose to 52,500 people above 18 years of age in 10 panchayats under Bankatwa block, which has a total population of 116,863 as per the 2011 census, said officials.Of those vaccinated, 35,000 were in the 18-45 years of age group and the remaining 17,500 above 45 years of age. It took over two months for the team to complete vaccination that registered the highest inoculation of over 20,000 on June 21 and June 22, said officials. Ashok said that the district administration has been keeping an eye on migrant workers and other non-residents of Bankatwa blocks. “They will be given the jab as and when they come. In the meantime, they are being also tracked and efforts are on to ensure that they get vaccinated in whichever part of the country they are,” said the district magistrate. The development came barely a few days after Bijbani South, a panchayat in Bankatwa block, became the first panchayat in the state to be inoculated against Covid-19 recently. The vaccination drive, which started on January 30, was not easy for the health workers as many rumours were going the rounds about the side effects of the Covid vaccine among the villagers. “We came across many villagers who feared repercussions of vaccination in the form of death, fever or impotency and hence, the vaccination drive did not yield the desired result on the outset,” said Gyan Prakash, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Sikarahana. However, over 20,000 people were inoculated during the mega drive on June 21 and 22. “It could be possible only after regular meetings of the government officials, local representatives and other workers like Jivika and Anganwadi workers, ward members, sevikas among other representatives of different groups. As a result, we were able to complete the target,” said Dr Ashutosh Kumar, medical officer and in-charge of primary health centre (PHC), Bankatwa. Meanwhile, locals hailed the participation of religious leaders and local representatives. “Yes, the people were hesitant for taking jab fearing several imaginary problems. However, the mindset changed with the help of constant announcements from mosques, encouraging people to go for the jab,” said Zahir Hussain, Imam of Jama masjid, Shekhauna village in Banktwa block. A resident of Shekhauna village, 57-year-old Md. Zuber Hashmi said, “The rumours about the vaccine were totally rubbish. Like any other individual, my family members and I are hale and hearty since we took the jab. Neither fever nor any other complications surfaced at all. We are eagerly waiting for the second dose to save ourselves from the virus.” According to the bulletin released by the East Champaran district health department, altogether 670,673 people have received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine as of June 28, while 71,467 have received both doses across the district.INFOGRAPHICSBANKATWA (Block) District: East ChamparanSubdivision: SikarahanaPanchayats: TenRevenue village: 27Anganwadi centre:130Population: 1,16863 (As per 2011 census) Vaccinated persons: 52500Between 18 and 45: 35000Above 45: 17500||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/biharentire-18-population-of-bankatwa-block-receives-first-dose-against-covid-101624898653278.html

Following this, the administration is reaching at the door of such persons, requesting them to get vaccinated. However, people have reportedly refused to take the jab, and demanded rectification of the system.As per available information, one 18-year-old Sweety Priya of Triveniganj on Saturday last returned disappointed from a vaccination centre after she didn’t get a jab. However, she claimed to have received a vaccination certificate later.“I tried to contact officials at Triveniganj sub-divisional hospital, but no one listened to me. Later, I called Supaul district magistrate (DM), who directed health officials to rectify the error.”The next day, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Pramod Kumar, in-charge deputy superintendent of hospital Dr Birendra Durbey and district coordinator, UNICEF, Anupama Chudhary reached Priya’s house to allegedly persuade her to get vaccinated. Priya said, “But, I put a condition that they first rectify the mismanagement in vaccination drive. Only then will I get the jab.”She also claimed that hers was not the only such case.When contacted for comments, Supaul DM Mahendra Kumar did not respond despite several attempts.The hospital deputy superintendent Dr Birendra Durbey on Monday said “We begged a collective apology from the girl, but she is adamant. We are still in touch with her.”Another student Sumit Kumar, also a resident of Triveniganj, contacted the Supaul DM with a similar complaint.“Much to my dismay, when I checked my text messages, I found a vaccination certificate and immediately talked to the DM.

On the demand by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi for a white paper on the Covid crisis in the country, Anwar said people had the right to know the scale of suffering the pandemic had brought on the nation and its economy. “While the government departments have put the Covid toll to 4 lakh, many other national and international agencies and media have assessed the casualty to be around 42 lakh,” said the Congress leader.On the huge escalation in prices of essential commodities and petroleum products, he said, “The myth of fuel prices being linked with international marked has been demolished, as prices kept on rising in the country when cost of crude had dipped elsewhere.” To a query on Shatrughan Sinha’s tweet on Sunday that seemed to imply that there were people of a “new variant” who were unhappy with PM Narendra Modi without a reason, Anwar said it could be his personal views. “There are reasons for the people to be unhappy with Modi, as he could not handle many contentious issues properly and thereby left the people to fend for themselves,” said Anwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nitish-uneasy-in-nda-says-cong-s-anwar-101624898594035.html

His good knowledge of Sanskrit, which he often demonstrated during his service days while delivering discourse to youth or singing bhajans, is coming handy in his new avatar.But he is not the first state police chief to seek solace in spiritual pursuits post retirement. Former DGP Anand Shankar was a known devotee of Radha-Krishna and often joined bhajan-kirtan. After retirement, he spent a lot of time in Mathura and Barsana. In Patna also, he regularly boarded bus to reach Patna’s revered Mahavir Mandir, which is managed by another former inspector general of police Kishore Kunal, now called an Acharya.Kunal’s quest for spiritual pursuit became apparent when he was in service and it prompted him to take early retirement. Besides being the general secretary of the Mahavir Temple trust, which he has expanded for various philanthropic activities like hospitals, orphanages etc. he has also done extensive research and written exhaustive two-volume books on the Ayodhya Ram Janbhoomi. At one point of time. he was also a negotiator in the Ayodhya dispute.Anand Shankar’s predecessor DN Gautam, who also served as security advisor to the Jharkhand government, is also a Lord Krishna devotee and devotes most of his time delving into the ocean of spiritual knowledge. He is also a good orator and often invited to share his vast knowledge of various scriptures at public platforms. He also wrote a book ‘Naeen: The man and spirit of Vivekanand’.Arvind Pandey, a serving IPS officer, is also known for his bhajans. His family had priests of the famed Vindhyachal Temple. Though Pandey made it to the IPS, his spiritual inclination remained intact. He also knows Ayurveda and loves learning new things about it.However, Gupteshwar Pandey, who heads two temple trusts, Garibnath temple trust in Muzaffarpur and Hariharnath Temple trust in Sonepur, is the first DGP to become a spiritual preacher. And he says that he loves connecting with the audience. “I have no qualms in admitting that I have failed in politics. I don’t have all that politics demands and politicians need to excel. Now I have realised that God is the only thing that keeps me interested and now I have started enjoying my new innings,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-ex-dgp-pandey-latest-top-cop-to-take-spiritual-route-101624898533848.html
28-06-2021||Delhi||Bihar facing all-round crisis, Chirag welcome to join us: Tejashwi||The leader of Opposition in the Bihar Assembly, Tejashwi Yadav spoke to Arun Kumar about the political situation in Bihar, his comment that the Nitish Kumar government may not last beyond a few months, and the possibility of an alliance with Chirag Paswan.Edited excerpts:You recently said that the Nitish Kumar govt will fall in 2-3 months. How do you back this claim?My statement does not come out of blue, and in fact, it’s genesis lies in the nature of the mandate of the last assembly elections. The leader of a party which was reduced to 40-odd seats occupied the chief minister’s chair, defying the message inherent in the people’s will. The contradictions of the ruling coalition are being played out in the open, and are there for everyone to see. Look at the absolute lack of communication across political parties in this alliance, and you will realise that their days are numbered.But what makes you believe that this government will fall?It is a question of how much longer, and to what extent, the CM allows his power to be diminished. At some time, the business of governance has to be taken seriously. It’s been a little over six months and, trust me, when I say this, Bihar is facing a serious all-round crisis. The government has shown no indication of how it’ll get up to the task. There’s not even a signal of intent whether it is the pandemic or floods or issues of employment as well as everyday deterioration in law and order.Do you have the numbers to provide an alternative? Who you are banking on?We have played the role of a very responsible and active Opposition, and we have done so from a position of confidence and power that we derive from those who have reposed their trust in us. In terms of numbers, we don’t need a lot, as you already know looking at the thin line between peoples’ will and the idea of “managed majority”.There’s is often talk of a likely split in the Congress or the RJD. How do you see this?This is the SOP of Nitishji’s propaganda whenever he is on a shaky wicket. I see such talk as not more than a juicy gossip emanating out of 1, Anne Marg to cover up for his abysmal performance and absolute failure. What I can say though that we are a democratic party, and quite well-structured in terms of organisation. There are plenty of forums within the party to voice concerns and debate the way forward.Will RJD throw its weight behind Akhilesh Yadav in UP, as it did in behind the TMC in West Bengal, or contest the polls itself?We are not a power-hungry party or an election machine. Our ties and support are based on pro-people, progressive, and development-oriented politics. We will extend support to whoever is close to our ideals of social justice inclusive development paradigm as in the position to defeat the Fascist agenda of BJP.How realistic is the chance of Tejashwi-Chirag tie-up?Look I have said it quite a number of times recently that our families have a long-standing relationship that continued even when Chirag ji and the LJP became part of BJP-led NDA. However, Chirag ji has to take crucial decisions with regard to ideological commitment. He will have to rework his politics in the light of what is being brazenly done to the progressive politics of social justice where Late Ramvilas ji remained a crusader with my father for decades. To put it succinctly, it is up to him to cut through the contradictions and make up his mind.What role will RJD have in a likely Opposition alliance, which is said to be working on a plan without Congress?RJD and Laluji have played a historical role in bringing progressive parties together and forging a shared agenda. We will not deviate from the path we have always followed. I believe in view of the massive challenges ahead where ordinary citizens are feeling extremely helpless across India, any idea of whatsoever front shall not be feasible without the Congress. Hence the priority should be to broadening the very base of an alternative rather than reducing its size.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bihar-facing-all-round-crisis-chirag-welcome-to-joins-us-tejashwi-101624898533254.html

Only 1-2 per cent of the kids are likely to develop any post Covid complications like multiple inflammatory syndrome or severe symptoms which require admission in ICU wards, the report reads. The state administration and the district have started preparing for the much-anticipated third wave reported to more likely affect kids as the age group below 18 is not yet eligible for any Covid vaccine in the country. As per the June report released last weekend, experts have stated that over 90-95% of the infected kids are likely to remain asymptomatic or with mild symptoms and could be treated at home while less than 5% will develop moderate symptoms due to the infection and might require hospitalisation. Only 1%-2% of the kids might require ICU beds due to severe symptoms like pneumonia or post Covid complications like multi-inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The report states that apart from Covid, flu-like symptoms are also common indicators of malaria, dengue, typhoid and flu. Other symptoms include headache, body pain, weakness, itching in the throat, vomiting, stomach ache and diarrhoea and breathlessness. “Kids with comorbidities and malnourished kids are more likely to develop complications due to Covid,” said Dr Aarti Kiniar, who is also part of the paediatric state task force. She said, “If a kid is infected in the house, the family must not only isolate the child but also senior citizens because they are most vulnerable. If the child is aged less than 5 years then other family members must wear a mask. A good balanced diet and keeping the body hydrated are important. In the case of infants, breastfeeding should not be stopped. In case of home isolation, the family doctor must be updated every day about the child’s status.” The signs Mild Covid symptoms in kids Kids appear normal Kids eat less comparatively Breathing is also normal Age respiratory rate <2 months <60 breaths per min 2–11 months <50 breaths per min 1–5 years <40 breaths per min > 5 years <30 breaths per min||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/less-than-5-kids-to-face-complications-post-covid-101624897034670.html

Singla had alleged that Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal and his brother-in-law Jaijeet Johal were behind the illegality. Singla had even alleged an attempt on his life, while he was shooting the purported video.The matter drew widespread attention after Congress MLA from Gidderbaha Amrinder Singh Raja Warring and Congress MP from Ludhiana Ravneet Singh Bittu retweeted videos of the Akali leader levelling direct charges on the state’s ruling political dispensation.Located on the outskirts of Bathinda city, the defunct power facility has an estimated 2.20 crore tonne of environmentally hazardous fly ash spread over 853 acre. Government-run and private thermal plants provide fly ash for free to three identified sectors for safe disposal. PSPCL director, generations, Paramjeet Singh said on Monday that no single person, group, or firm has ever been given a contract to remove fly ash kept in ponds for decades.“As per the Central government’s directives, thermal plants are mandated to dispose of ash. It can be used in manufacturing cement and brick kilns only through a particular mechanical and chemical process. It is also used in highway constructions and ash has no use in any other sector,” he said, adding that as there was no safe disposal method of flyash, it had been dumped in huge ponds for over four decades.Lehra Mohabbat-based thermal plant DP Garg chief engineer, who also has the charge of Bathinda’s unused power plant, said 56 private agencies involved in cement manufacturing or brick kilns have been authorised to lift ash without any charges.“Bathinda district has no river bed, having sand mine or quarry is out of the question,” he added.Senior executive engineer of GNDTP Girish Gupta said an average of 30,000-tonne fly ash is taken away every month from the dykes. “Nearly 90% of the stock is lifted by a leading private cement manufacturer. PSPCL facilitates only three sectors, who have a mechanism to use ash,” he said.BOX OR SUBHEADSIT to probe bid on Singla’s lifeBathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) BS Virk said a special investigation team (SIT) under an SP-rank officer was formed on Monday to probe an alleged bid on the life of SAD leader Sarup Chand Singla.

28-06-2021||Kolkata||‘Like saying I went to moon’: Bengal Guv rebuts Mamata on Jain hawala case link||Kolkata The acrimonious relations between West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and the Trinamool Congress-led state government hit a new low on Monday, with chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleging that Dhankhar was an accused in the 1996 Jain hawala case and branding him a “corrupt man”, a claim that was quickly rubbished by the governor.“The governor’s name cropped up in the Jain hawala case. They had gone to court and got the name cleared. But again, a PIL was filed, and it is still pending. I am sorry to say he is a corrupt man,” Banerjee said, while speaking to the media at the state secretariat.Mamata Banerjee said she had written letters to the Centre on three occasions to relieve Dhankhar of the post.“If the Centre is not aware then I am telling. Bring out the charge sheet and check whether his name was there or not. Why is the Centre allowing a man like this to continue as the governor?” she said.The Jain hawala case cited by Mamata Banerjee was a reference to a political scandal in the mid-nineties centered around a handwritten diary that mentioned alleged hawala payments of about ₹65 crore. The names of the recipients were written in codes and matched initials of some top political leaders. The Central Bureau of Investigation filed more than 2 dozen chargesheets in this case but the cases collapsed because the CBI didn’t produce any corroborative evidence to prove the bribery charge.Dhankhar rushed to deliver his rebuttal, declaring that there wasn’t not an iota of truth in Banerjee’s allegations.“I never expected a leader of her stature to create sensation, engage in misinformation and misrepresentation. I have not been charge-sheeted. There is no such document. This is far from facts. This is plain and simple untruth, misinformation. I have not taken any stay from any court,” Dhankhar said.“It is as good as saying Dhankhar accompanied Neil Armstrong to the moon,” the governor said.But to a question, the governor made it clear that he will not sue Banerjee for defamation. “In Indian tradition, no one has ever taken any action against a younger sister. I am not going down that path.” Trinamool Congress MP Sukhendu Sekhar Ray, however, sought to punch holes in his denial, pointing that Dhankhar didn’t mention if his name cropped up at some point or not. “He never revealed whether one of the names, found in the Jain dairy, was his or not. He just said his name was not in the charge-sheet. This could be just half the truth. We would need to probe deeper,” Ray said.The Jain hawala case cited by Banerjee was a reference to a political scandal in the mid-nineties centered around a handwritten diary that mentioned payments of about ₹65 crore made via hawala. The names of the recipients were written in codes and matched initials of some top political leaders. The Central Bureau of Investigation filed more than 2 dozen chargesheets in this case but the cases collapsed because the CBI didn’t produce any corroborative evidence to prove the bribery charge.Banerjee’s offensive came hours after Jagdeep Dhankhar, who was on a week-long tour of Darjeeling, alleged that there was corruption in the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), the semi-autonomous body that manages Darjeeling and Kalimpong hills in north Bengal. On Saturday, the governor tweeted that there had been no election and audit in GTA since 2017.“The Governor is deliberately trying to disturb the peaceful situation in north Bengal and hence he met those people who are in favour of dividing north Bengal. He told them to stage a revolt. Is it the job of the governor?” Banerjee added. Dhankhar’s Darjeeling visit came at a time when a section of BJP lawmakers, including two MPs - John Barla and Saumitra Khan – raised demands for a separate statehood or Union territory status for certain districts in north Bengal. The Bengal unit of the BJP has already said that it neither endorses nor supports the demand. The BJP, however, said the TMC should respond to the allegations and questions raised by the Governor on GTA.“The Governor has raised some serious allegations against the GTA. Cases may continue in the court. But are the chief minister’s today’s allegations answers to the questions raised by the Governor? Is she trying to say that because the Governor’s name is in the Jain Hawala case, there can be corruption in GTA? Is she justifying this,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, vice president of BJP in West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/like-saying-i-went-to-moon-bengal-guv-rebuts-mamata-on-jain-hawala-case-link-101624896553699.html
28-06-2021||Lucknow||Priority is 2022 polls, not contesting zila panchayat election: Maya||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Monday announced that her party will not contest zila panchayat chairperson election in protest against the use of money power as well as misuse of government machinery by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Addressing a press conference, Mayawati said to secure victory in the zila panchayat chairperson election the BJP has adopted same tactics that were used by the Samajwadi Party when in power to grab the posts of chairpersons in various districts.When the BSP decided to break alliance with the SP in 1995 then too, the political parties were concerned over the strategy of the SP. Now the BJP is committing the same mistake. It is weakening the roots of the democracy, which is unfortunate and should be condemned, she said. “Rather than using their energy in the zila panchayat chairpersons’ posts, the party members should mobilize their resources in strengthening the organisation, increasing the base of the party among all communities so that BSP forms government on its own strength in the 2022 assembly election, we are aware of the fact that once BSP forms government all the chairpersons will join the BSP as they could not survive without the support of the ruling party,” she said.Mayawati said she wished to make it clear if the chairpersons’ election had been impartial and fair the party would have contested the election and majority of candidates fielded by the party would have secured victory in the election.“When in power, the BSP did not permit improbity or irregularity in the election to instill confidence in democracy among the people. I hope people will ponder over these issues, to save democracy they will vote for the BSP in the coming assembly election,” she said.Alerting the party workers over the tricks adopted by rival political parties, Mayawati said under a planned strategy the rival parties are spreading rumours that BSP was not active for the assembly election.“They are trying to lower the morale of the cadre before the assembly election. They should know that after announcement of unlock by the government I arrived in Lucknow, I am reviewing the working of the party regularly with following the Covid protocol,” she said.The main slogan of the BSP in the 2022 assembly election will be ‘To save UP, to save sarvajan community, bring BSP back to in power, she said.The BSP has bagged 361 zila panchayat wards, in various districts, it is in strong position in Azamgarh, Saharanpur, Meerut, Bhadohi, Ghazipur, Jalaun, Chitrakoot, Banda and Pratapgarh districts with bagging more wards than the BJP and SP. The BSP candidate failed to file nomination for the chairperson post in Saharanpur district on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/priority-is-2022-polls-not-contesting-zila-panchayat-election-maya-101624896133718.html

Though the drastic fall in new Covid cases had made the city eligible for Level 2 restrictions, the emergence of Delta plus variant placed districts under stricter Level 3 or Level 4. From June 14 to June 27, the city saw less than 6% positivity rate or just a little above 5%. The city has reported the highest number of cases in the state and the district reported the highest number of cases in the country, during both the first and second waves. Pune district also reports the highest number of mortalities due to the infection in the state. Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “Due to increased testing and people adhering to the Covid-appropriate behaviour, the number of new Covid cases being reported has fallen drastically. However, the virus is still here and we need to adhere to CAB behaviour and get vaccinated. We have seen a great response to vaccination in the city and for the past two days the district crossed one lakh vaccinations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-under-unlock-positivity-rate-remained-below-6-101624896073161.html

Robots would ensure perfect cuts and minimum blood loss during the procedures while the duration of surgery will also be reduced, said Prof RK Dhiman, director, SGPGI.Kidney transplant is the most preferred treatment in end-stage renal disease patients. Traditionally, kidney transplant is performed by open surgery and requires large incisions in the body. But now the surgical procedure would be minimally invasive through robot assisted kidney transplant technology. In this, a robot will support the kidney transplant, he said Dhiman said, “A high level of expertise is required in robotic surgery for kidney transplant. And doctors at the PGI have undergone extensive training required for it.”Compared to the conventional open kidney transplant surgery, robotic kidney transplant requires a much smaller incision to remove the diseased organ and insert the donor’s kidney and then to stitch the blood vessels and the ureter.Robotic surgery minimises hand tremors. Thus the surgeon operates with more precision, skill and control, even in the most difficult surgeries.The procedure is especially useful when the surgery is deep and narrow like in kidney transplant, when the surgeon requires fine skills of dissection and micro suturing, which could be well performed by robot assisted technology.The use of robots in kidney transplant will help minimise blood loss, hospital stays, post-operative complication rate, recovery time and surgical scars, added Dhiman.

28-06-2021||Pune||Sule-Mohol at war of words over PMC spending on garbage processing plants||A war of words has broken out between Member of Parliament (MP) Supriya Sule and Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol on Monday after Sule demanded an inquiry of the money spent on garbage processing plants. Sule on Monday visited the Uruli Devachi and other garbage plants around city. Sule said, “Every year, the PMC is spending ₹200 crore on garbage, but the problem is not being sorted out. Neither the issue is getting sorted at the garbage depot nor the garbage piling has stopped in the city. There is need for an audit of the money. If needed the ruling party can invite either CBI or ED (Enforcement Directorate). As it is, the ED is conducting an inquiry in every small thing, then this is the big issue and they should do inquiry here too.” After Sule’s comment, Mohol issued a statement immediately and said, “As elections are ahead, Sule made the inquiry in garbage plants but it is the same NCP which is responsible for it. During their tenure, garbage plants got burned and shut down.” Mayor said, “Deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar has been ruling in the city for the last many years. Sule is pointing out towards NCP’s failure as the garbage issue is lying as it is. During our last four and half year’s tenure, we started six new projects.” Mohol said, “By inviting ED inquiry, it is good that she expressed confidence in this agency. She should have the same confidence in the ED for other ongoing inquiries in the state.” NCP MLA Chetan Tupe said, “Why has the mayor got angry immediately after a demand for an audit? It is the taxpayers’ money. There should be audit and inquiry in it. Ideally, the mayor should support Sule’s demand as it is in the interest of citizens. If money getting spent and no result, something is going wrong. Ideally, mayor should take citizens’ side but indirectly he is supporting contractors. The tipping fee and transport fee got increased during the BJP tenure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sulemohol-at-war-of-words-over-pmc-spending-on-garbage-processing-plants-101624895715009.html

Shopkeepers at the Hanuman Garhi road are up in arms against the proposed widening of the road for which shops will be demolished. Traders accused the district administration of not coming up with a clear cut policy of either compensation or new shops for those who will be displaced. On the other hand, the project to install lord Ram’s statue in Manja Barhata village of the district was also stuck as farmers had moved the high court, challenging acquisition of their land for the project.“The district administration has not come up with a clear policy for shopkeepers whose shops will be demolished,” said Nand Kumar Gupta, trader leader. “As a last resort, it has been decided to move the high court, if the administration is not able to come up with a clear cut policy for rehabilitation of shopkeepers who will be displaced,” he added. In protest of the decision to widen the road, the traders have also decided to take out a procession from Ram Ki Paidi Ghat to Tedi Bazar on July 1. “A panel of traders will also try to resolve the issue through dialogue with the district administration,” said Prem Sagar Mishra, trader leader. “All issues of traders will be addressed amicably through dialogue,” said Ved Prakash Gupta, BJP MLA from Ayodhya constituency. Projects of Ayodhya are likely to be put on the fast track after the document for Ayodhya’s development was presented before Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 26. Widening of the Hanuman Garhi road is also a part of this project. Both sides of the road are dotted with shops. The administration has set a standard of 13 metres and 24 metres for the road widening projects in Ayodhya. But the traders are demanding to curtail it to 10 metres and 18 metres, respectively. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced to install the tallest statue of Lord Ram (251 feet) in Ayodhya during Deepotsav celebrations in 2017. However, the project is yet to take off even after four years. A site in Ayodhya’s Manja Barhata village was finalised for the project instead of the earlier site – Meerpur Duaba village. The Ayodhya administration had started the process of land measurement in Manja Barhata for the mega project. But, the project was stuck after around 65 farmers filed a writ in Lucknow high court, challenging acquisition of land. The court had directed the Ayodhya administration to carry out land acquisition according to the laid down procedures and norms. But the issue could not be resolved till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ayodhya-development-plan-now-hanuman-garhi-road-widening-project-hits-roadblock-101624895714138.html

The UPPCL officials, during the meeting, said the corporation needed a financial assistance of ₹18,000 crore from the state government, and ₹12,000 crore of it urgently, to meet cash requirements for payment of dues to power generating companies, coal companies etc.“UPPCL officials have held a meeting with the finance department to discuss things and arrive at a solution,” additional chief secretary (energy) Alok Sinha said, adding, “But it may require a few more rounds of meetings to take a final decision.”Devraj said discussions were being held at the government level to find out a way to help UPPCL/discoms. He, however, declined to share details discussed in the meetings with the finance department and the chief secretary, saying, “it is too premature to share.” The officials, who are in the know of things, said the government had no option but to oblige the UPPCL to maintain smooth power supply in the election year.“The only thing that is to be finalised is how to arrange funds and in which shape (it is) to be given to it (UPPCL),” they said.The government, according to officials, might consider issuing state bonds worth ₹12,000 crore to help UPPCL meet the capital requirement partially while the dues pending against government departments could be adjusted against the government loan of around ₹500 crore.“The government may have to provide the rest of the assistance in cash,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-finance-dept-power-corporation-officials-meet-to-work-out-formula-for-aid-101624895594443.html

Eleven states in the country have already reported Delta-Plus infections. UP needs to be well prepared in advance to tackle it according to the recommendations of the state Covid experts’ panel,” the chief minister said.He also said the state was enhancing genome sequencing facilities for extensive study of the coronaviruses.Currently, genome sequencing was being carried out at KGMU (King George’s Medical College) in Lucknow, BHU (Banaras Hindu University) in Varanasi, CDRI (Central Drugs Research Institute) in Lucknow with the help of IGBI (Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology), New Delhi, he said.“Such genomic studies would certainly help in devising ways to tackle the Delta-Plus variant,” he said.He said vaccination was the best bet for protection from coronavirus infections.The state has administered 3.04 crore Covid vaccination doses so far.“It is heartening to see the rising enthusiasm among people for vaccination in rural vaccination centres. People are turning up in large numbers there,” he said.He said although the Covid-19 situation was improving, this was also the time to be more alert as markets, shops, and movement had opened up unhindered.“People need to be more responsible towards following Covid appropriate behaviour and police also need to be active in enforcement of safety protocols such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and sanitisation. Minor negligence or laxity could prove dangerous,” he said.In the past 24 hours, the state did 2.63 lakh Covid tests and only 190 fresh cases were reported across Uttar Pradesh while 261 patients had recovered and were discharged from hospitals, he said. The daily positivity rate was 0.1% while the recovery rate was 98.5%, he added.At present, the state has 3046 active Covid cases and 1868 of them are in home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/over-5900-paediatric-icu-beds-in-place-in-up-says-yogi-adityanath-101624895473757.html
28-06-2021||Pune||Kolhapur still records highest RT-PCR weekly positivity in the state||Pune: Though the second Covid wave has been showing signs of waning in the state, Kolhapur district has remained a matter of concern for the state health department. The weekly positivity rate of Kolhapur has dropped to 7.4% (June 19-June 25) from 15.2% (June 6- June 12), yet the district has recorded the highest positivity rate in terms of RT-PCR testing at 16.8%. According to officials from the state health department, Kolhapur has recorded satisfactory vaccination rate and still, the positivity rate fails to drop as expected. As per the data given by the health department, during June 19-June 25, there were 148,330 tests conducted in Kolhapur of which 26,675 were RT-PCR tests. Of 10,931 samples that were tested positive, 4,483 were from RT-PCR tests. Maharashtra’s state surveillance officer Dr Pradip Awate said, “It is a district with high vaccination rate in terms of population, but has recorded 16.8% weekly positivity rate. Apart from Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and Sindhudurg are other districts which have recorded high positivity rate in terms of RT-PCR tests.” He, however, said that the case fatality rate (CFR) in Kolhapur is not something to worry about. According to the state government’s latest guidelines, the weekly positivity rate to be considered for the decision regarding levels of restrictions must be determined only on the basis of RT-PCR tests. “It is a standard and good quality test to be undertaken to determine the positivity rate. All we need is a good sample size,” said Dr Awate. As per the latest guidelines by the state, Kolhapur is under Level 4 restrictions with minimum relaxations in place. However, on Monday, traders remained adamant about reopening of shops. After a meeting with police authorities, they agreed to hold the reopening of non-essential shops for two days. Dr. Yogesh Sale, district health officer of Kolhapur district, said that rise in positivity rate is because of increase in tests. He pointed out that the peak of the second wave came in the third week of May by which time other districts had started to record a downward trend. He claimed that the second wave will be waning in Kolhapur in the next 10-15 days. “We have increased the testing numbers. The rate of RT-PCR tests is also high. So naturally, the positivity rate based on that will go up,” said Dr Sale. He informed about the steps taken by the district administration to bring the Covid infection in control. “We have the highest rate of vaccination in the state. We are also emphasising institutional quarantine. Curbs have been increased to break the chain. Also, spot testing of superspreaders is being done. Hopefully, in the next 10-15 days, cases will go down substantially,” said Dr. Sale. Daulat Desai, Kolhapur collector, said that he won’t be able to comment as he was in quarantine because of fever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/kolhapur-still-records-highest-rt-pcr-weekly-positivity-in-the-state-101624895234602.html

UP aims to administer 10 lakh doses per day while Lucknow has planned 30K doses per day to speed up the vaccination drive. “The cluster model of vaccination gave us good results and our previous week’s target was achieved on Friday,” said Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar, chief medical officer, Lucknow. Lucknow has administered about 14 lakh doses, the highest among all districts, and UP 30859397 doses, till Monday evening, since January 16, when the vaccination campaign started. Under the cluster model of vaccination, the coverage in the trial run increased from 52% to about 70%. Under the cluster model, motivating teams go on door-to-door visits and then vaccinating teams administer doses at nearby places such as schools or clinics. One-third of the development blocks were covered in the trial since June 21. From July 1, the cluster model of vaccination will be applicable to all development blocks. Too meet the target of administering 10 lakh doses every day, Uttar Pradesh roughly requires 3 crore doses of the vaccine. “We have been informed about 1.5 crore doses coming to UP for July. We are now waiting for it and expect them to start arriving in different lots in the next 48 hours. The entire lot of 1.5 crore will arrive by July 10,” said a senior health official. He said, “Once this consignment is delivered, the schedule for the next chunk of 1.5 crore doses will be there. But it depends on the companies when and in what number they send the lot.” July will have 27 working days, barring Sundays, when the vaccination campaign will run. On each day, the target is to administer 10 lakh doses. The state has over 8,000 vaccination sites and plans to take the number up to 10,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-to-expand-covid-vaccination-coverage-focus-on-cluster-model-walk-in-jabs-and-online-appointments-101624895233863.html

We have seen that the victims are reluctant to come forward and lodge cases in this regard as the complaint may lead them into difficult spot. So, their identities and personal details are protected as per the law.” In May, two men were arrested in Rajasthan in a case involving at least 100 males, in the age group of 25 to 55 years, being duped in an online scam involving nude videos of the victims. The accused posed as women, befriended the victims and then solicited the nude videos, based on which the victims were then blackmailed. The tricksters used photos of women as their profile shots and chatted with victims. They then used voice modulation software due to chat. In Oct 2020, the cybercrime cell of the Pune police had received complaints from eight men within a short span of two weeks stating that they were being blackmailed by `women’ who lured them into posing nude on screen video call recorders. The victims were well educated and salaried persons with some of them students between the age group of 25 and 40. The women blackmailed them by threatening to viral the recorded video calls on different social networking platforms. The cyber sleuths had been seeking all account transaction details of the victims from where the extortion money was sent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/case-against-woman-for-blackmailing-youth-over-nude-video-101624895173073.html
28-06-2021||Pune||PMC denies NCP allegation of discontinuing Swach contract||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has alleged that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has planned to scrap the waste collection work with Swach and appoint a private contractor for the same. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led PMC administration has denied the allegations and said that the waste pickers are being misled. Both ruling and opposition parties supported social activist Baba Adhav and assured him to continue the work of Swach organisation with the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). At the same time both BJP and NCP attacked each other over the garbage collection and Swacch issue. PMC’s contract with the Swach cooperative expired in December 2020 and only temporary extensions of one or two months have been granted since, adding to the uncertainty in this pandemic. As the PMC did not continue the contract and did not accept their demands, social activist Baba Adhav carried out a morcha at the PMC headquarters. MP Supriya Sule, Congress leader Mohan Joshi participated in the morcha and supported Adhav.As Adhav staged agitations in front of municipal corporation, ruling BJP office bearers also joined the agitators and discussed with Adhav. BJP leader and leader of house Ganesh Bidkar said, “Some people misguide the Swach waste pickers. PMC did not have any plan to discontinue their contract. I have given instructions to the PMC officials to prepare the proposal and submit for approval.” NCP city unit president Prashant Jagtap said, “For the last 14 years more than 3,000 waste pickers have been working with PMC. They created the system but PMC is in a process to appoint a private contractor for garbage collection. If the garbage collection work gets handed over to the private firm, these 3,000 waste pickers will lose their livelihood. During Covid-19 pandemic, these workers work hard and the PMC must consider their demands.”BOXDemands made by waste pickers-Life insurance cover for 7,000 registered waste-pickers, premiums to be paid by PMC.-Covid incentive for working throughout the lockdown of ₹30 per month for slum households and ₹10 per month for other properties for six months for SWaCH waste pickers. -Renewal of the PMC – SWaCH model for a 10-year period with due corrections of deficiencies such as increase in slum subsidy support to waste-pickers and provision of replacement system for emergency absences. - Push-carts, buckets, bags and PPE, over-due from PMC for over 1.5 years.- ID Cards to informal waste-pickers who are not part of the cooperative.Space for efficient and safe sorting and recycling of waste.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-denies-ncp-allegation-of-discontinuing-swach-contract-101624895053062.html

28-06-2021||Patna||NDA contradictions are in the open, governance a casualty: Tejashwi Yadav||The leader of Opposition in the Bihar Assembly, Tejashwi Yadav spoke to Hindustan Times about the political situation in Bihar, his comment that the Nitish Kumar government may not last beyond a few months, and the possibility of an alliance with Chirag Paswan. Edited excerpts: You recently said that the Nitish Kumar government will fall in 2-3 months. How do you back this claim? My statement does not come out of the blue, and in fact, it’s genesis lies in the nature of the mandate of the last assembly elections. The leader of a party which was reduced to 40-odd seats occupied the chief minister’s chair, defying the message inherent in the people’s will. The contradictions of the ruling coalition are being played out in the open, and are there for everyone to see. Look at the absolute lack of communication across political parties in this alliance, and you will realise that their days are numbered. Also Read | Tejashwi reaches out to Chirag again, tells him to join Bihar oppositionBut what makes you believe that this government will fall? It is a question of how much longer, and to what extent, the CM allows his power to be diminished. At some time, the business of governance has to be taken seriously. It’s been a little over six months and, trust me, when I say this, Bihar is facing a serious all-round crisis. The government has shown no indication of how it’ll get up to the task. There’s not even a signal of intent whether it is the pandemic or floods or issues of employment as well as everyday deterioration in law and order. Do you have the numbers to provide an alternative? Who you are banking on? We have played the role of a very responsible and active Opposition, and we have done so from a position of confidence and power that we derive from those who have reposed their trust in us. In terms of numbers, we don’t need a lot, as you already know looking at the thin line between peoples’ will and the idea of “managed majority”. There’s is often talk of a likely split in the Congress or the RJD. How do you see this? This is the SOP of Nitishji’s propaganda whenever he is on a shaky wicket. I see such talk as not more than a juicy gossip emanating out of 1, Anne Marg to cover up for his abysmal performance and absolute failure. What I can say though that we are a democratic party, and quite well-structured in terms of organisation. There are plenty of forums within the party to voice concerns and debate the way forward. Will RJD throw its weight behind Akhilesh Yadav in UP, as it did in behind the TMC in West Bengal, or contest the polls itself? We are not a power-hungry party or an election machine. Our ties and support are based on pro-people, progressive, and development-oriented politics. We will extend support to whoever is close to our ideals of social justice inclusive development paradigm as in the position to defeat the Fascist agenda of BJP. How realistic is the chance of Tejashwi-Chirag tie up? Look I have said it quite a number of times recently that our families have a long-standing relationship that continued even when Chirag ji and the LJP became part of BJP-led NDA. However, Chirag ji has to take crucial decision with regard to ideological commitment. He will have to rework his politics in the light of what is being brazenly done to the progressive politics of social justice where Late Ramvilas ji remained a crusader with my father for decades. To put it succinctly, it is up to him to cut through the contradictions and make up his mind. What role will RJD have in a likely Opposition alliance, which is said to be working on a plan without Congress? RJD and Laluji have played a historical role in bringing progressive parties together and forging a shared agenda. We will not deviate from the path we have always followed. I believe in view of the massive challenges ahead where ordinary citizens are feeling extremely helpless across India, any idea of whatsoever front shall not be feasible without the Congress. Hence the priority should be to broadening the very base of an alternative rather than reducing its size.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/nda-contradictions-are-in-the-open-governance-a-casualty-tejashwi-yadav-101624890373336.html

The man was identified as Jaikato Chandra Rai, 24, a resident of Nadia district in West Bengal. The 18-year-old woman, Parineeti, is a resident of Narail district in Bangladesh. The couple was arrested on June 26. “Human traffickers often adopt new methods to trap women, who are later often pushed into the sex trade. But after a thorough interrogation we didn’t find any foul play in this case. Both families knew about the wedding and had given their consent,” said a senior BSF official.

28-06-2021||Kolkata||‘I am sorry to say…’: Mamata Banerjee amps up attack on Guv Jagdeep Dhankhar||KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee escalated her attacks on governor Jagdeep Dhankhar by several notches, alleging that he was named in the Jain hawala scandal of the 1990s that implicated several leading politicians and branded him as a “corrupt man”.“The Governor’s name had cropped up in the Jain hawala case. They had gone to court and got the name cleared. But again, a PIL was filed, and it is still pending. I am sorry to say he is a corrupt man,” Banerjee told reporters at the state secretariat.“If the Centre is not aware, then I am telling. Bring out the charge sheet and check whether his name was there or not. Why is the Centre allowing a man like this to continue as the governor?” she added.Dhankhar, who has an acrimonious relationship with the chief minister, trashed the charge. “I have not been charge-sheeted. There is no such document. This is far from facts. This is plain and simple untruth, misinformation. I have not taken any stay from any court,” said Dhankhar. The Jain hawala case cited by Banerjee was a reference to a political scandal in the mid-nineties after investigators, who were probing 23 demand drafts seized at the instance of a Hizbul Mujahideen operative in Delhi, found a diary from the hawala operators. The handwritten diary mentioned payments of about ₹65 crore. The names of the recipients were written in codes and matched initials of some top political leaders.The Central Bureau of Investigation filed more than 2 dozen chargesheets in this case but the cases collapsed because the CBI didn’t produce any corroborative evidence to prove the bribery charge. Earlier in the day, Dhankhar, who was on a week-long tour of Darjeeling, alleged corruption in the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), the semi-autonomous body that manages Darjeeling and Kalimpong hills in north Bengal.Mamata Banerjee said the governor was trying to disturb the peaceful situation in north Bengal and met people who are in favour of dividing north Bengal. “He told them to stage a revolt. Is it the job of the governor?” Banerjee added. Banerjee said that she had written three letters to the centre on three occasions to relieve Dhankhar from the post of the state’s governor. On Saturday the Governor tweeted that there has been no election and audit in GTA since 2017. “The Governor has raised some serious allegations against the GTA. Cases may continue in the court. But are the chief minister’s today’s allegations answers to the questions raised by the Governor? Is she trying to say that because the Governor’s name is in the Jain Hawala case, there can be corruption in GTA? Is she justifying this,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, vice president of BJP in West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/i-am-sorry-to-say-mamata-banerjee-amps-up-attack-on-guv-jagdeep-dhankhar-101624886593117.html

The survey was conducted by civic body-run BYL Nair Hospital and Kasturba Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory (KMDL) between April 1 to June 15.The BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said that 2,176 blood samples were tested for the study.

The carcass of the two-year-old female leopard was sent for a postmortem examination. The result suggests that it died due to a head injury after being hit by a vehicle around 4am.” Since the incident took place at the border around Asola Wildlife Sanctuary, the Delhi forest department was also informed before the jurisdiction was confirmed.A senior forest department official from Delhi said that they were informed about a leopard being hit by a vehicle on Surajkund road around 10.30am on Monday. However, the carcass had already been taken for a postmortem examination and other formalities by the Haryana forest department.Also Read | Poaching picks up during pandemic in Himachal“Over the last few years, there have been quite a few leopard deaths by speeding vehicles reported from the Haryana side. The issue is that roads aren’t well lit at night; cars ram leopards that are crossing over,” the official said.A video of the carcass started doing the rounds on Monday morning. “This video came to me because we work on wildlife issues in the Aravallis. We have been warning all along that there is a sizeable leopard population here. There are lots of signs. I confirmed the roadkill with Haryana’s wildlife department as soon as I got the video. The boundary of Asola Bhatti sanctuary in the video. It’s a very sharp bend where vehicles cannot slowdown immediately. We have been asking for an underpass to be built,” said Sunil Harsana, wildlife activist, Mangar, Haryana.A study published in January showed the Aravallis near Gurugram, Faridabad and Delhi can support rich biodiversity and wildlife if protected from further habitat fragmentation. The study found a total of 1,327 signs (such as scat, pug marks, scratch marks) of 13 mammal species during two seasons—winter and summer of the survey in 2019. Two species of large carnivores- leopard and striped hyena, four species of herbivores, two primate species and seven species of meso-carnivores (eg. fox, civets, mongoose, etc,) were found. Surprisingly, both Faridabad and Gurugram Aravallis were found to harbour a larger variety of mammals compared to the Asola Bhatti Sanctuary, which is a protected area. The largest number of species were recorded in Faridabad Aravallis (14), followed by Gurugram Aravallis (11), Mangar Bani (10) and least in Asola wildlife sanctuary (9). However, Mangar Bani and Gurugram Aravallis showed 30% more sighting of animals (because the forest is not as fragmented in this region as compared to Delhi or Faridabad) of animal signs per kilometre in comparison to Asola wildlife sanctuary and Faridabad Aravallis.Harsana, a resident of Mangar village in Faridabad who has informally surveyed the Aravalli stretches in the region for years, took up formal research methodologies to document biodiversity here and was awarded the study under Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF-India).“There is leopard presence in that region. We have been seeing incidents of road kills for past 5-6 years, which needs to be addressed. In the past, there were talks with the Haryana government to track the movement of leopards but the project did not materialise,” said Bilal Habib, senior scientist at the Wildlife Institute of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/leopard-found-dead-on-surajkund-road-near-gurugram-101624885213206.html
28-06-2021||Chandigarh||Bante wali bottle, a refreshing summer treat, all-time wonder||The unassuming and distant cousin of the upmarket fizzy drinks sits humbly on the wheeled cart of the nimbupaaniwalla with citrusy and minty whiffs afloat in the air from the strategically placed yellow lemons and green mint leaves. The sight of the transparent bante wali bottle brings back effervescent memories of childhood when quenching one’s thirst at the roadside rehri was a sublime practice. While stuck in a traffic jam, one afternoon, my drifting eyes beheld a familiar yet forgotten sight of the Codd-neck bottle, with a marble to block its mouth, displayed on a roadside cart. It sat there trying to lure passers-by with its pristine charm; charm which has been shadowed by the likes of high-end carbonated drinks that come with catchy jingles and vibrant advertisements. I hardly remember seeing or hearing any commercial that has promoted the eclectic bante wali bottle also known as Goli Soda and yet it has survived the onslaught of time and change of taste or habits. In times when soft drink makers are spending billions on flashy advertisements demonstrating the biggest names of Hollywood and Bollywood guzzling down bottles of the artificially flavoured drinks; the modest bante wali bottle remains unsung despite its ability to quench one’s thirst on a par with its branded cousins. My fondest memories of the bante wali bottle co-exist with the annual ritual of spending the summer vacation at my maternal grandparents’ house in Jaitu. The house was nestled in the middle of a row of houses built on one side of a busy street. The opposite end was inhabited by shopkeepers and stall owners. On our arrival, somebody was despatched to fetch chilled bottles from the vendor. The curious child in me never failed to be amazed at the creation of the bottle’s unique structure. Endlessly, I tried to figure out how the manufacturer managed to insert a marble in the bottle’s neck and how I could retrieve the marble from the neck without breaking it. Had somebody asked me during those impressionable years to name the Seven Wonders of the World, my first guess would have been, “Bante wali bottle!” In summer, the vendors either stationed their carts outside the railway or bus stations or pushed them into narrow lanes to reach out to those who longed for something refreshing to mollify the heat or something tantalising to tickle their taste-buds. The drink was also served with equal fanfare depending on the demand. Some customers preferred to gulp it directly from the bottle where others preferred it poured out in a glass garnished with fresh mint and assorted with a dash of lemon and a sprinkle of rock salt to enhance its flavour. For those who wished to drink from the bottle, the man would oblige by propelling the marble blocking the mouth of the bottle into its constricted neck with the help of an ice pick and all this he did nonchalantly with the flair of the modern-day bartender. The diffident bante wali bottle is struggling to sustain itself in a world of cut-throat competition. However, I still sense a bond with it as it’s one of the few things that remind me of the innocent pleasures of childhood. sonrok15@gmail.com The writer is an Ambala-based college teacher||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bante-wali-bottle-a-refreshing-summer-treat-all-time-wonder-101624884313249.html

28-06-2021||Chandigarh||A good life that started with the polo quartet||Polo is known as the sport of kings. There was another way to be a polo player without being a king or a rich man. The Indian Army, following the traditions left by the British, maintained a number of polo teams that played in various venues during winter. I picked up the sport at the Indian Military Academy (IMA). I was already an accomplished horseman thanks to being the son of an army officer. I got into the sport to escape the unarmed combat classes conducted in the afternoon. I was a quick learner and soon a part of the IMA polo team. Apart from myself, there was Rupinder Brar (Rupi), Ajinder Randhawa (Randy), Gurcharan Sohi (Prince) and Dalip Tung, who was not in our course. Also read: Hong Kong controller, local components: How LeT makes drones to attack IndiaThrice a week, we got to play polo with three officers, making up the eight required to form two teams: The commandant, the equitation officer and the academy adjutant, Major Maharaj Kumar Bhawani Singh (Bubbles), the crown prince of the Jaipur royal family. We were indeed the blue-eyed boys who got to move in high company. The best part was the polo trips to Meerut and Delhi, wherein we escaped a cadet’s tough life for a month or so. Morning rides followed by a gargantuan breakfast and a polo match in the evening. That was the schedule. Sometimes, Bubbles took us for a ride in his Mercedes sports car after the match and gave us a nice treat at Connaught Place. Prior to getting commissioned, cadets are allotted the arm or service to serve in. Rupi and I were allotted artillery, Randy to the armoured corps and Prince to the Army Service Corps (later switched to the armoured corps). We were commissioned on June 27, 1965, and the polo quartet split up. Polo went on the backburner over the next few years but in mid-1968, Rupi and I were posted to the Artillery Centre at Nasik Road with the aim to raise a polo team for the artillery. I, however, got selected to go for training as an Air OP Pilot. My polo was revived in 1970 when we started playing for the artillery but that too got short-circuited due to the Indo-Pak war of 1971. After the war, Rupi, who was easily the best among us, changed over to 61 Cavalry, which is the only horse mounted Cavalry regiment in the world. He went on to become an international polo player with a handicap of 5 goals. He travelled across the world playing for India and went on to command the regiment before calling it a day. Polo, for me, became a once-a-year event since I was heavily involved professionally. But such was the passion that when I was preparing for the Defence Services Staff College exam, with just a month to go, I pushed off to Hyderabad to play as part of Rupi’s team. Everyone thought I was crazy but I couldn’t resist the opportunity. Eventually, it had no effect on the result and I got a competitive vacancy to attend the Staff College Course in Australia. I continued playing the sport as and when I could be spared from my duties till my premature retirement in 1994. It is time to reflect back on a life well lived. A service of 29 years in the army, during which I fought in a war for the nation, played polo for the artillery, flew as an Air OP Pilot, commanded an artillery regiment and an army aviation squadron. Thereafter, in civil aviation, I flew helicopters for 17 years, flying the high and mighty during election campaigns before finally calling it a day. The good life started with the polo quartet. Prince and Randy are already in the happy hunting grounds, leaving Rupi and myself on mother earth. The great memories will remain till it is our time to bid goodbye. bullysangha@gmail.com The writer is a Chandigarh-based defence veteran and Vir Chakra awardee||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/a-good-life-that-started-with-the-polo-quartet-101624882272998.html

In a letter to state BJP president OP Dhankar, Sampat Singh thanked him for nominating him as a member of Haryana BJP’s executive committee but said that he can’t accept any such responsibility when farmers were agitating. Also read: Hong Kong controller, local components: How LeT makes drones to attack IndiaTalking over phone, Sampat Singh said he has been supporting the farmers’ agitation since Day 1 and will not accept any position in the BJP till their grievances are redressed. “I believe in politics without police protection.

I am in the BJP but I won’t hold any position until farmers’ issues are resolved,” he said. Sampat Singh had quit the Congress and joined the BJP in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah at a rally in Rohtak’s Meham on October 9, 2019, in the run-up to the assembly elections. He had left the Congress after he was denied an assembly seat from Hisar’s Nalwa.

28-06-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: The risks and trade-offs of an unlock paradigm||This column had earlier argued that the state government had taken a risk by linking incentives with responsibility while unlocking Maharashtra earlier this month. The smart men in the corridors of power thought they can stay away from being in the lock-unlock picture every week, through just one order during the ongoing fight against Covid. It also reflected a shift from the scenario of a guardian-like-government where the onus is vested with individuals. Three weeks later, the government has had to revise its order by reducing the five-level relaxation plan to three, citing an emergence of cases of the Delta-Plus variants in Maharashtra. The latest diktat removes the first two levels, which offered maximum relaxations, even if the local positivity rate is below five per cent, as mandated under the mechanism. The government has also restructured ways to calculate the positivity rate by considering positive cases only against RT-PCR tests done. This means some of the old curbs are back in cities like Pune, Nashik and Nagpur, where restrictions were eased at a pace that prompted health experts to express worry and advise caution. If the original order passed the responsibilities on to people when they wanted to avail of incentives by way of restarting activities, restructuring it meant an admission that the number of cases could increase fast with people violating norms pertaining to Covid- appropriate behaviour. Soon after the unlock process started, most cities were witnesses to crowding. Markets were back to normal and people looked oblivious to a virus that thrives on crowds. How does it reflect on citizens? In one of his articles that appeared in Mint Lounge, journalist Aakar Patel wrote: “Policing in India is less about law than about order. This is how it has always been in a nation whose population tends to anarchy, even when under self-rule.” In a country of 1.3 billion people, order is something is often missing and has to be forced using mandate. This is exactly why police here are trained primarily to control crowds rather than pursue scientific investigation, a reflection often seen in the lower conviction rate. Policing, as Patel argued, is carried out through “bandobast” when people are supposed to behave on their own. It’s also possibly because human behaviour in reality is not as rational, which means when people during unlock are offered wide degree of liberty on the economic front, and movement, they are unlikely to stick to habits inculcated during lockdown. So how could the state government have struck the right balance in its plan to reopen Maharashtra after the second wave? There are no easy answers: One way could have been to take baby steps by easing limited curbs, that too, at a slower pace, or to offer incentives on activities that would encourage people not to step out and yet spend money to boost trade and accelerate economy. The latest order on one hand is bound to create confusion among people and traders, who have seen series of decisions in the past few days with different guidelines for weekdays and weekends. It is also likely to lead to further uncertainty where businessmen may find it difficult to take risks given the unpredictability. But then, Maharashtra has already paid a heavy price during the second wave. With local body elections lined up early next year in 10 major cities of the state, the government needs to carefully reopen sectors based on needs and priorities. If abolishing the e-pass for inter-district travel has resulted in indiscriminate travel, there can be a rethink on bringing it back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-the-risks-and-trade-offs-of-an-unlock-paradigm-101624876813058.html

Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh also spoke to Sekhri over the phone, assuring him that his concerns will be addressed. In a statement on Sunday, Amarinder said: “Sekhri is a dyed in the wool Congressman who has spent his whole life with the party and all rumours about his leaving the party are baseless.” He said Sekhri denied the reports in a section of media that he was leaving the Congress to join other party. He said it is the party’s duty and responsibility to watch and safeguard the interests of all senior leaders. Hindu face of Congress in Majha The three-time MLA, was scheduled to join the SAD in presence of party president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday as he was feeling suffocated in the party over the alleged interference by cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa in his constituency. Sekhri, who served on key posts in the Congress and is known as a Hindu face of the party in the Majha region, is not talking to the media yet. He lost the 2017 assembly elections to SAD candidate Lakhbir Singh Lodhinangal by only 500 votes. Since then, neighbouring Fatehgarh Churian MLA Tript Bajwa increased his activities in the Batala segment. Tript Bajwa’s interference tipping point Bajwa managed to put his loyalists at the helm in the Batala municipal corporation, further marginalising Sekhri. In September last year, Sekhri had filed a police complaint against Tript Bajwa for ignoring Covid-19 norms. The former minister of state also met former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in Delhi on June 22. He said he was called by Rahul for seeking his suggestions on the ongoing feud in the Punjab Congress. After meeting Rahul, he had questioned the role of Captain Amarinder Singh in the turmoil in the party. A month ago, he accused Amarinder of ignoring the pleas of schools and colleges of Punjab by refusing their offer to set up Covid care centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-ex-cong-mla-sekhri-in-hospital-hours-before-event-to-join-sad-101624873272324.html

28-06-2021||Delhi||Need a breather: Delhiites pack bags, holiday within city||Fresh out of the second wave of the pandemic and anticipating a third one, Delhiites are currently stuck in a limbo of uncertainties. And therefore, a change is a must to keep the spirits high! Making the most of the time in between the two waves are some city residents, who are heading out for staycations, but within the city’s periphery! Recently, Anushka Maheshwari, a south Delhi-based entrepreneur, went on a short vacation with her extended family to a south Delhi based hotel. She says, “It was all going to be about my husband, our two-year-old daughter and me. But as soon as we shared the plan, we were also joined in by my parents, sister, brother-in-law and their four-month-old baby. It’s clear that everyone is tired of being indoors, especially those who have young children.” For Maheshwari, the vacation was not about the destination, but a change of routine. “When we saw that the cases have decreased, we decided to give ourselves a much needed break. Even if it meant going to a hotel near our house, we didn’t mind. At least the domestic chores needed no attention, for there was room service to our rescue! But, since we were travelling with kids, while choosing the hotel we first checked their sanitisation services,” she adds. Similarly, Gurugram-based IT professional Anuj Arora says that he felt that the time was ideal to step out, and a room with a view is all that he and his friends were looking for during the stay. “I took a short break with my friends to go to a hotel at Aerocity, for two days. We didn’t want to travel very far, as we understood that though the number of cases had reduced, it was still possible to contract Covid. Still we wanted to come out of our houses and meet each other in a safe environment. In the pre pandemic era, we would take up extensive road travel, but since that requires one to make pit stops, we decided against doing it in the present scenario. So a hotel, which is within the city itself, was the best choice because kuchh toh time mile boys hang out karne ka isi bahane... but we didn’t let our guards down and ensured that we were always properly masked up whenever stepping out. Getting a breather was all what this outing was for us.” And there are some others who have got themselves jabbed before plunging into their breaks. Ravi Sarda, a businessman from Model Town, who has plans for a staycation with his wife and two children, says, “Many of my friends have gone for such outings, and we thought it would be a great idea to get a change from the mundane work from home scenario. My wife and I have got ourselves vaccinated, and we’ll also be carrying our certificates, just in case we are asked for the same. Honestly, I’m not looking for a very fancy hotel, but just one that has ample open space for my kids to run around; they have been indoors for a fairly long time now, so I want them to enjoy in the outdoors. And my wife and me are looking forward to the breakfast buffet, which is a huge relief from the meal planning we have been doing everyday.” Author tweets @anjuriFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/need-a-breather-delhiites-pack-bags-holiday-within-city-101624862477462.html

Prime facie, there were no signs of any forced entry to the house. It seems that the assailants were inside the house, or they were allowed entry, or it was an insider’s job. We are investigating all possibilities,” the SP added.Since Toli Mohalla is a congested locality, the police are also trying to probe if the assailants entered the house through the roofs of nearby houses.The police said they are yet to get a complaint from the family and will register a case once that happens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-two-sons-shot-dead-in-ghaziabad-wife-critical-101624858811494.html

The lecture had to be discontinued thereafter,” said Shashikant Mane, senior police inspector of Juhu police station.HT has knowingly withheld the name of the college. The police said it could be a student’s mischief. “We are tracking the IP address of the computer or [the] device from where the objectionable clip was uploaded,” said another officer from Juhu police station.A few such incidents have come to light ever since most education institutes shifted to online teaching early last year due to the restrictions on holding offline classes amid the Covid-19 pandemic. On June 13, the Sakinaka police in Mumbai apprehended a 15-year-old boy from Jaisalmer in Rajasthan for flashing in front of a teacher during an online class.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hacker-posts-inappropriate-video-during-an-online-class-of-mumbai-college-101624857851858.html
28-06-2021||Delhi||Red Fort violence: Suspect arrested from Amritsar; 17 held so far||One more suspect has been arrested in connection with the case of alleged violence and vandalism at the Red Fort on Republic Day during a tractor rally taken out by farmers against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September last year, police said on Monday.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said that Gurjot Singh, who was wanted in the case and carried a reward of ₹1 lakh, was arrested from Amritsar in Punjab on Sunday. Singh is the 17 th person who has been arrested in the case, so far. At least six key suspects against whom rewards were announced are still absconding.A special cell officer, who did not want to be named, said that Singh, a resident of Tarn Taran in Punjab, was present at the Red Fort when the violence broke out. The police were looking for him his alleged involvement in the “conspiracy” and in “instigating” the crowd through “provocative speeches” that he delivered from the monument itself, the officer said.“We had got Singh’s video in which he was talking to the media at the Red Fort during the violence. Our teams have been camping in Punjab to nab the absconding suspects. Singh was among them. We got information about his presence in Amritsar and caught him on Sunday. He has been brought to Delhi and is being handed over to the crime branch that is probing the case,” the officer added.The crime branch submitted its first charge sheet last month and named 16 people, including Punjabi actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu, in it. All 16 were arrested in connection with the case filed by the police. While Sidhu and 12 others have been released on bail, three accused, 23-year-old Dutch national of Indian origin, Maninderjit Singh, Khempreet Singh and Jabrajang Singh, are still in judicial custody. Hundreds of farmers protesting on Delhi’s borders against the three farm laws passed by Parliament in September entered Delhi deviating from the routes approved for their tractor rally and clashed with the police at several locations on January 26 this year. One farmer died and 10 others were injured. More than 500 police personnel also suffered injuries in the violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/red-fort-violence-suspect-arrested-from-amritsar-17-held-so-far-101624857431533.html

A section of leaders led by Jamtara legislator Irfan Ansari also met AICC seniors with the demand to reconstitute the organisation. Encouraged by the hint of reshuffle, some senior leaders from Bihar have also been camping in New Delhi to bolster their chance of being catapulted to the top position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-congress-unit-set-to-have-new-committees-ahead-of-change-of-guard-101624850711035.html

In the next phase, senior secondary and secondary classes will be resumed followed by junior classes. We have designed bridge courses to compensate for the loss of learning among students,” said an official of the education department, who didn’t wish to be named.The decision to reopen educational institutes comes at a time when the second wave of Covid-19, which paralysed the state’s health infrastructure and caused thousands of deaths, is showing signs of abating with only 185 infections registered in the last 24 hours, as per the health department’s bulletin released on Sunday. The total number of active cases in the state has come down to 2,141 while the recovery rate has shot up to 98.38%.All government and private educational institutions in the state have remained closed since April 5, when the second wave of Covid-19 forced the state government to announce a lockdown. Education institutions opened up briefly this year after the tapering of the first coronavirus wave, which had prompted the Centre to clamp a nationwide lockdown in March 2020. Most schools have since relied on online teaching, which has created difficulty for students, mostly for those who are on the wrong side of the digital divide.Last month, the state government launched Tikashala or vaccination camps set up in various schools across the state to inoculate all teachers of government and private schools and their families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-educational-institutions-likely-to-reopen-after-july-6-minister-101624850111051.html

28-06-2021||Pune||Level 3 Covid-19 restrictions in Pune municipal areas from today||Pune will remain under level 3 restrictions and the fresh curbs will be effective from Monday. This comes as the Maharashtra government issued a new order, imposing stringent unlocking curbs at level 3 category, with the Delta plus variant claiming its first victim and the apprehension of a possible third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Pune, Siddharth Shirole, has shared the order issued by Pune Municipal Corporation. While most of the restrictions remain the same under level 3, the civic body has eased few restrictions.Bracing itself against the anticipated third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Maharashtra government has recently tightened the unlocking process in the state and announced that restrictions will not be relaxed beyond level 3. The government has effectively done away with level 1 and level 2, which allowed maximum relaxations under the initial five-level unlocking plan.Here's a look at the revised guidelines issued by the Pune Municipal Corporation:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/level-3-covid-19-restrictions-in-pune-municipal-areas-from-today-101624841001412.html

However, on June 25, Pawar said any alternative front, if formed, cannot leave the Congress. On June 26, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, too, dismissed the prospect of an Opposition alliance without the Congress.Asked about the meeting, the RJD leader said he was not aware of what transpired at the meeting, but “definitely all like-minded parties should come together with a common minimum programme to defeat this most oppressive, divisive, authoritarian and fascist government”.Yadav also recalled how his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad warned that the 2014 parliamentary elections would decide whether the country will remain intact or get divided. “I think most of the parties and citizens of our country have realised this today like never before.”Yadav also talked about reaching out to Lok Janshakti Party MP Chirag Paswan, who is facing rebellion from leaders of his own outfit. “The real tribute to him (Ram Vilas Paswan) would be carrying forward his values... and that is possible only when Chirag ji joins this existential fight against [MS] Golwalkar’s Bunch of Thoughts,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/congress-should-be-fulcrum-of-any-alliance-against-nda-tejashwi-yadav-101624840867943.html

We have sought approval to shift more. Ridhi is being shifted due to territorial fights.”The RTR has 77 tigers, including 27 cubs and sub-adults living in an area of 1,334 square km, making it the third most congested habitats for felines in India, after Corbett National Park and Kaziranga National Park in Assam.Ridhi will be shifted to Sariska soon after the state government nod is received, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/tigress-to-be-moved-out-of-ranthambore-reserve-over-fights-with-sibling-101624841064378.html

The Delhi Disaster Management Authority(DDMA) on Saturday issued fresh guidelines for phase 5 of Delhi unlock and said that the prohibited and restricted activities will continue till 5am on July 5.DDMA also discussed the situation outside stations of the Delhi Metro, marked by long queues due to a cap on the seating capacity at 50 per cent in each train coach. However, restrictions in the Metro will remain for at least another week.Last week, Delhi allowed shops to remain open through the week and markets to open with a partial workforce as daily Covid-19 cases showed a downward trend.Delhi was under a lockdown between April 19 and May 30 as the second Covid-19 wave raged the city. The city started unlocking in phases from May 31 with the permission to factories within industrial areas and construction activities to resume.

28-06-2021||Delhi||Amendment in DDA Act proposed to speed up land pooling implementation||The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has proposed changes in the Delhi Development Act, 1957, for effective implementation of the land pooling policy, which is aimed at meeting the city’s housing requirement in a planned way. Officials aware of the matter said a proposal regarding draft changes in the Act has been sent to the Union housing and urban affairs ministry.The land pooling policy, which was notified in October 2018, will be implemented in 95 urbanised villages on the outskirts of the city. Close to 17 lakh dwelling units are expected to be constructed in the next two decades in the land pooling areas namely Mundka, Baprola, Najafgarh, Alipur, etc.DDA officials said changes in the Act are needed to give it legal provisions. A senior DDA official aware of the development said, “There are issues related to land parcels that have not been pooled-in in sectors where we have reached the percentage of land required to implement the policy. Currently, there is no provision to get these land parcels. If this issue is not addressed, development in land pooling sectors can’t happen.”The other issue is related to stamp duty, as the policy requires the transfer of land twice between the owner and developer. As per the land pooling policy, landowners in these 95 villages will form a consortium and pool their land parcels. After planning, 60% of the land will be returned to the landowners or developed by the consortiums for residential, commercial and public and semi-public use.Sabyasachi Das, former planning commissioner with DDA, said , “The present Act doesn’t provide any legal backing for land pooling. Therefore, suitable changes are required in the Act as land pooling is one of the key development models for planned development. How will development work be carried out if the owner of one land parcel refuses to participate in the process? It is difficult for government agencies to acquire land now. A solution has to be found to address this issue.”As per the policy, there will be two land transactions—one when the landowner gives the land to the consortium and the second when the developed land is returned to the landowner. “The cost of land will unnecessarily increase by 15-16% if stamp duty is charged on both the land transactions. There is a need to have a provision to exempt stamp duty twice. It should be charged once when the developed land is returned to the owners,” said a DDA official.These are some of the issues that need to be addressed. “Some other changes have also been proposed as it is an old Act. We have sent the draft changes to the ministry,” said a senior DDA official. The ministry of housing and urban affairs did not respond.In 2019, the DDA started the work in land pooling areas. A senior DDA official said, “Over 6,900 hectares of land has been pooled or registered with DDA for the policy by owners.”As per the policy, “In order to ensure unified planning, servicing and subdivision/ share of the land in a sector as per Land Policy and Regulations, a minimum of 70% contiguous land of the developable area within the sector, free of encumbrances, is required to be pooled to make the sector eligible for development.”While the DDA has got 6,930 hectares of land parcels registered with it, it has not got 70% contiguous land in any of the land pooling sectors so far.In 2015, the then Union urban development ministry (now ministry of housing and urban affairs) had constituted a committee to revisit and redraft the Delhi Development Act, 1957. While the report was submitted to the ministry, no decision was taken on it, said a senior DDA official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amendment-in-dda-act-proposed-to-speed-up-land-pooling-implementation-101624836294990.html
28-06-2021||Delhi||Govt starts work on building database of Delhi’s migrants||The Delhi government is working on building an Aadhaar-linked database of all migrants in the city engaged in the unorganised sector, a move that comes in light of large-scale exoduses during the Covid-19 lockdowns in the Capital as tens of thousands of workers left Delhi for their towns and villages.“In order to create a comprehensive database of migrant workers, the government of Delhi has also issued a letter to states from which majority of the migrant workers come to Delhi, namely Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha, to share the database of migrant workers prepared by them,” showed Delhi government documents that HT has seen.A senior Delhi government official said, “There is no integrated and complete database of migrant workers in Delhi so far, which affects government estimates and budget allocations... It is also a question of implementation and delivery. We recently saw how the government faced problems in accurately assessing the requirement of food grains for people — mostly migrants — without ration cards, which led to a shortage.”The unorganised sector remains largely undocumented across the country, creating blind spots for the state and hindering policy drafting and implementation. Almost 90% of the country’s workers are employed in the informal unorganised sector.The documents also highlighted that such a database will be essential to efficiently implement The Code of Social Security Act, 2020, which merges eight existing labour laws and is supposed to include migrant workers in the unorganised sector in its ambit. The Union government also began an independent survey of migrants across the country in 2020 and individual state databases are supposed to enhance its strength. The survey was suspended mid-March in the light of uptick in Covid-19 cases but is likely to resume soon, said a senior official, adding that the national database will be necessary to properly implement The Code of Social Security Act.Further, the Supreme Court in May this year, during a suo motu proceeding in light of problems faced by migrant workers, identified the slow registration of workers in the unorganised sector as a major implementation flaw in schemes for their benefit.Tens of thousands of migrant workers left the Capital after the Union government put in place a hard lockdown in March last year to limit the spread of Covid-19. With a blanket ban on all public transport in the initial phase of the curbs, several of these migrants left on foot, forcing the government to step in and set up food camps, arrange transport, implement schemes subsidised ration, health and financial assistance schemes.While the government did not keep a record of migrants leaving Delhi during the 2020 lockdown, more than 800,000 of them left in buses in the first four weeks of the lockdown imposed from April 19 this year as the Covid-19 caseload hit record levels.The Delhi government document also said, “Registration of principal employers and contractors has now been facilitated through an e-district portal and it is mandatory to provide certain details regarding the migrant workers being employed by them at the time of registration.”“It is further submitted that on 03.05.2021, Section 142 of the Code of Security came into effect by notification in the official gazette. Section 142 provides for submission of details of Aadhaar by any employee or unorganised worker or other person for registration as a beneficiary under the Code,” the documents said.The documents also said, “This development will enable it [the Delhi government and the Centre]to collect Aadhaar details of unorganised workers including migrant workers to create a national database of beneficiaries. It further stated that the National Data Base for Unorganised Workers, which is being developed by the National Informatics Centre is at an advanced stage and an inter-state migrant worker can register himself on the portal on the basis of Aadhaar details.”While the Census also tracks migration numbers, the available figures have turned out to be inadequate especially after mass movements during the pandemic and the next figures are expected to come late, said the state government official quoted above.Delhi has the second highest population of inter-state migrants in India, according to 2011 Census data on migration released in July 2019, which shows that marriage and work or business drive the influx. The city-state only trails Maharashtra, a much larger and more populous state.The data also said that more than 6.3 million people in Delhi – which is nearly 40% of its 2011 census population of around 16 million – were migrants from other states. Of these, around two million were recorded to have migrated for work. But the data did not bifurcate employment in the organised sector and the unorganised sector.Labour unions in the city peg the number of migrants engaged in the unorganised sector at two million, of which around 60% would be in the construction sector and the remaining would be in industries and daily wage work. “With their families, the collective population of migrants associated with the unorganised sector in the Capital would be around 8 million by now,” said Animesh Das, president of the Delhi unit of Indian Federation of Trade Unions.Experts called the state government’s database plans an “essential initiative”.“Creation of a robust and dynamic database of migrant workers in unorganised sector will not only enable the state to plan and prepare initiatives and policy response to pandemic or similar crises in future, it will also greatly help the state to understand their living conditions, family size, sources of income, skills, social status, etc,” said Niranjan Sahoo, a senior fellow with ORF’s governance and politics initiative.“Creating a comprehensive and reliable database is challenging for Delhi considering labour moves seamless in the National Capital Region (NCR). Therefore, it would need the active cooperation of neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Rajasthan. It will also need support of the Union government given its National Capital Territory (status)… This would also help avoid duplication of data.”Sahoo also said linking Aadhaar data is critical to avoid overlapping.Debolina Kundu, professor at the National Institute of Urban Affairs, said: “At present, other than the 2011 Census data, there is no official database on migrants in Delhi which could help the government to work out their social protection strategies. It is important to have recent data on migrants by various indicators like their place of origin (states, cities and/or villages), period of stay, reasons for migration and other important parameters which may help the government work out a comprehensive policy for their overall well-being.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-starts-work-on-building-database-of-delhi-s-migrants-101624836326164.html

28-06-2021||Delhi||A haircut above the rest: Outdoor allure a win for roadside barbers||Hari Singh’s roadside salon has been attracting a whole new kind of patrons. Once popular only among construction workers and local vendors, these days one can spot office-goers with unkempt hair, grey roots and scruffy beards waiting in their cars near his shop.“The minimum wait is two hours on weekends. When I came here, all my customers were labourers, vegetable vendors and auto drivers; now quite a few of them are people who live in flats,” says Singh, giving the names of the various multi-storey apartment buildings in the area, where many of his new customers live.While the business of salons and hairdressers has suffered since the pandemic began last year, Delhi/ NCR’s ubiquitous roadside barbers are getting new clients who desperately need a haircut but are fearful of walking into the air-conditioned salons for fear of contracting the Sars-Cov-2 that causes coronavirus disease (Covid-19).While Singh, who runs his roadside salon in Greater Noida, does not know much about the epidemiology of Covid-19, he says his customers tell him that an open, roadside establishment like his is much safer than the closed confines of a neighbourhood salon.“But most bring their own towels, and make sure that I tightly wear my face mask while I give them a haircut or a shave,” says Singh. “Sunday is the busiest day for me as most of the new clients have their off on weekends.”Sitting on Singh’s high wooden chair with a headrest is a middle-aged man from a nearby apartment. Ask him about his choice of the roadside barbershop and he says, “It is safe, cheap and to my surprise, this barber does as good a job as any I know,” says Atul Saxena who works in an IT company in Noida and has frequently visited Singh’s salon since unlock began last year. So, will he stick with his new hairdresser even after the pandemic? “ I might,” is his laconic reply.In east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar, Munna Thakur, another roadside barber, also attracts many customers from DDA’s SFS flats located right behind his shop. “Earlier, probably they did not know I existed, now many of them come here and also invite me home for a haircut,” says Thakur, who hails from Gopalganj in Bihar and like most roadside barbers charges only ₹30 for a haircut and ₹15 for a shave, making about ₹400 every day.“But some of my new customers feel that I charge too little and offer me ₹50 for a haircut; my charges have almost remained the same because most of my old customers are rickshaw pullers and labourers who cannot afford more,” says Thakur, who has been working at the same spot for 10 years.Unlike Singh’s dressing table in Greater Noida, which has only a few scissors, blades and shaving cream, and an aftershave lotion, Thakur’s has an assortment of shaving creams, lotions, balms, and hairstyling gels of various colours and fragrances of unknown cosmetic brands. “That is cucumber face cream; that is rose water, and this is anti-septic lotion,” he says, holding up all small plastic containers, bottles, and boxes one by one. After getting a shave from me, you feel fresh and completely rejuvenated.”So, where does he procure all his shaving material from? “A salesman who mostly buys it from Sadar Bazar delivers it every day,” says Thakur. Manish Tenguria, a graphic designer in Mayur Vihar, who is at Thakur’s shop for a haircut, swears by his new barber’s professional skills. “ He gave me a patient hearing about the kind of haircut I wanted. I feared he might make a mess of it, but he got it almost right. There is something salubrious about this open, no-frills salon under the tree, a perfect place for a fast haircut in these times of the pandemic,” says Tenguria.Many of these roadside barbers are from UP and Bihar, working at the same spot for decades—and they often ask their friends and relatives to run the establishment for them when they take an off and visit their native places. “I have not moved my table even a feet since I set it up here 15 years ago. You can say I am a bit superstitious about it,” says Mohammed Abdul, who runs a barber’s on a Lodi Colony footpath in central Delhi. In 2010, Abdul opened a salon in an Uttam Nagar market, but the business collapsed within two months and he was back at the roadside salon under the tree. “Thankfully, I had asked a relative to run this place while I tested waters in Uttam Nagar. Perhaps working on this footpath is my fate. But I am happy here; the tree saves me from sunlight, and if it rains, I hang a tarpaulin over my chair.”Most of his customers, Abdul says, come in the mornings and evening, now a lot of them government employees, but he believes that it has more to do with his haircutting skills than their fear of the virus. “I keep abreast of new trends in hairstyle. I am as good as any top hairdresser in the city,” he says with confidence, adding that he is an avid reader, and spends time reading Urdu fiction in the afternoon when his corner of the colony is deserted. “In the evening a lot of my poor customers such as auto-rickshaw drivers and vendors come and pour their hearts out to me, talking about all the joys and sorrows of their lives.”Most of these roadside barbers open at 7 am and close their shop by 8 in the evening, leaving their wares in the custody of private guards on night duty working at nearby markets, schools, banks, ATMs, and other establishments. “We can open our shop till there is daylight as we do not have electricity. I bought this new chair a few months back for ₹1200 and leave it with a guard in the local community market,” says Raghu Raj, who runs a makeshift salon in Mayur Vihar.He spent about ₹2000 to start this shop six months back. “I was in working with a catering service, but lost my job during the pandemic,” says Raj, whose shop is not under a tree. He says that, unlike other roadside saloons, he is yet to attract many apartment dwellers. The trick, he has been told by a fellow barber, lies in being under the tree. “Maybe I need to shift under one soon,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-haircut-above-the-rest-outdoor-allure-a-win-for-roadside-barbers-101624832822865.html

They had announced that they would stage an agitation outside the homes of 62 Congress councillors in the city on Monday. A day before their protest, the mayor conducted a meeting with over a dozen Congress councillors at his camp office near Rose Garden on Sunday and announced that the resolution regarding revoking of the exemption will be annulled in the next house meeting of MC.Mayor Sandhu stated that the resolution has been kept pending as of now and the staff has been directed to continue the exemption for houses up to 125 sq yards area. A new resolution to annul the previous one will be tabled during the next house meeting of MC, as per the norms.Starting this financial year, the civic body had revoked the water-sewer fee exemption for houses up to 125 yards area and increased the water-sewer tariff by up to 60% for different categories. Only the houses with an area up to 50 sq yards with only ground floor were exempted from water-sewer charges.BJP district president Pushpinder Singal said that the Congress is trying to befool the public by keeping the resolution pending ahead of assembly elections. “The resolution should be annulled immediately otherwise we will stage a protest outside the office/houses of all the 62 congress councillors with our demand on Monday.”Mayor Sandhu stated that the decision to reinstate the exemption was taken during a meeting with MLA Dawar and the BJP was just trying to gain political mileage by raising baseless allegations. Leader of BJP councillors Sunita Rani was also part of the committee which had earlier approved the revocation of exemption, he said. Rather than misleading the residents, the BJP councillors should first stand with the farmers who have been protesting for the last seven months, he added.Apart from BJP, Congress MLA Surinder Dawar and councillors from the central constituency had also opposed the decision during a meeting held with the mayor on June 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/watersewer-tariff-ludhiana-mayor-announces-reinstatement-of-exemption-for-houses-upto-125-sq-yd-101624823469155.html

Slamming MLA Pandey for his alleged failure in taking up development works in the constituency, LIP leader and in-charge of north constituency, Randhir Sibia, stated that five leaders will sit on relay hunger strike every day, which will continue till the decision to give the government job to Pandey’s son is rolled back.The state government had recently approved jobs for Arjun Partap Singh Bajwa, son of Qadian MLA Fateh Jung Singh Bajwa, as inspector (Group B) in Punjab Police, and Bhisham Pandey, son of Ludhiana North MLA Rakesh Pandey, as Naib Tehsildar.Bajwa has declined the job and Pandey should do the same. The government had announced jobs for unemployed youth, but is instead giving them to the sons of MLAs. Pandey is also working for his vested interests rather than the development of the constituency, due to which we were forced to sit on hunger strike,” said Sibia.Despite attempts were made to reach MLA Pandey, he was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-lip-begins-relay-hunger-strike-against-govt-job-for-mla-pandey-s-son-101624823409434.html
28-06-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana motorists in for a rough ride this monsoon||With mounds of rubble and sand still lining dug-up roads and construction sites, this year’s monsoon promises to be a rough ride for motorists and pedestrians alike.A number of development works are underway across the district ahead of the assembly elections. However, with projects to install sewer and drain lines still incomplete, it is unlikely that municipal corporation (MC) officials will be able to translate their monsoon preparedness rhetoric into action before the showers begin, as such residents may find several areas, particularly the Malhar Road, Railway Station Road from Rekhi Cinema Chowk to clock tower, Pakhowal Road, Rani Jhansi Road, and Model Town-Jawaddi Road, waterlogged. Not only do the dug-up roads increase the odds of meeting with a road mishap, they also lead to winding traffic jams. The construction run off blocks the drainage system and causes flooding in low-lying area, which inconveniences residents, increases incidence of disease and jeopardises commuters’ lives during the rainy season. Shopkeepers’ business affectedSlamming MC officials for their poor timing, a shopkeeper at Rekhi Cinema Chowk, Chanderkant Chadda, said, “Authorities should have installed the storm lines during the lockdown as markets were closed and there was little traffic on roads. We were hoping for business to pick up after restrictions were lifted, but customers tend to steer away from areas where construction is underway.” Bemoaning the slow pace of development projects, Satinder Singh, who runs a shop on Malhar Road, said, “Work has been on for two years, but the project is nowhere close to completion. Meanwhile, shopkeepers and commuters are a harried lot as sometimes shops’ entrances are blocked and pits are formed at different points on the road.” “The best time to install interlocking tiles along roadsides was summer during the lockdown. Now, the construction run off will block sewers. Commuters’ lives have been endangered as a large number of projects have been initiated at once in the run up to the assembly elections,” a resident of Model Town-Jawaddi Road, Jaskirat Singh said. Bottlenecks galore With traffic already affected to due the Ferozepur elevated-road and Pakhowal railway overbridge and under-bridge projects,delay in the Malhar Road project is expected to make matters worse as it is being used to divert traffic towards Sarabha Nagar and BRS Nagar, state Road Safety Council member Rahul Verma said.  “Traffic jams are already being witnessed in the morning and evening rush hours. Authorities should complete construction as soon as possible, else it will be difficult to manage traffic during the rainy season. Temporary patch work should be done at Malhar Road to facilitate movement of traffic,” he said. Navigating the Railway Station Road from Rekhi Cinema Chowk to Clock Tower is a veritable nightmare due to the ongoing installation storm sewer lines. One side of the road has been completely blocked to traffic, increasing pressure on the other side, which leads to traffic snarls and bottlenecks.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “Directions have been issued to expedite construction work. The projects were delayed due to technical issues and imposition of lockdown. Storm sewer lines will be installed near the Clock Tower by the month-end and the Malhar Road project will be completed by September. Construction companies have been told to ensure the safety of commuters while taking up development projects.”Ongoing projects 1) Malhar Road is being upgraded to a smart road. After missing the June deadline, the project – initiated in July 2019 – is now expected to be completed by September. 2) A major chunk of the Railway Station Road, starting from Rekhi Cinema Chowk to Clock Tower, has been dug up for installing a storm sewer line. The project is due by June 30.3) The roadsides of Rani Jhansi Road, Model Town-Jawaddi Road, and Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar (BRS) Road among other areas in town have been dug up for installation of interlocking tiles.4) The Pakhowal Road ROB-RUB project is underway near Canal Bridge and Hero bakery Chowk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-motorists-in-for-a-rough-ride-this-monsoon-101624823349275.html

28-06-2021||Chandigarh||Hawala racket: Kingpin’s nephew, Amritsar Improvement Trust employee summoned for questioning||The Tarn Taran police have summoned three men, including nephew of the racket kingpin and an employee of the Amritsar Improvement Trust, for questioning in connection with the hawala transactions allegedly made by a former wrestler for getting heroin consignments from Pakistan. Manohar Lal, alias Anthony Pehalwan, a former Congress leader who joined the BJP in 2017, was arrested by the Tarn Taran police on May 25 after his name emerged during investigation in the case wherein 3-kg heroin smuggled from Pakistan was seized. The Tarn Taran police’s anti-narcotic cell had arrested one Nishan Singh of Ferozepur district on April 5 with the recovery of heroin. During Nishan’s interrogation, it emerged that Anthony had transferred ₹89 lakh to Pakistan through hawala route for the contraband.Those called for questioning are Anthony’s nephew Rakesh Kumar, alias Bunty of Yaseen Road, Gagan Sharma, an employee of the Amritsar Improvement Trust, and Gaurav Kumar of Chheharta. Gagan and Gaurav were assisting Anthony in finance-related business. “As per our information, the three allegedly were making hawala deals at Anthony’s behest. They have been called for financial analysis on Monday,” said a senior police official.The police have also sent a reminder to the Centre’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for providing details about the hawala transactions made by Anthony and his team in the last few years.“Though Anthony managed to get bail from a local court on the pretext of age and due to Covid-19, we are seriously monitoring the case as it concerns drug smuggling. Earlier, Anthony revealed during interrogation that he has links in Canada only where his daughter studies. But, our technical teams found that he was in contact with several people in nine countries —US, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Russia, England, Pakistan and Kuwait,” said the official. He said, “About his two links in Pakistan, Anthony had told us that they are his wrestler friends, but we have confirmed that one of them is a lawyer. Anthony didn’t cooperate during the investigation and we could not interrogate him more due to his ailing condition. Now, things rely on the FUI report which will confirm Anthony’s suspected transactions in the nine countries. He also has links in Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Haryana.”The police are also awaiting the report of a forensic science laboratory regarding the digital video recorder that was seized from Anthony.Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale said their teams are working to ascertain all links of the accused. “We have also sent a reminder to the FUI regarding Anthony’s details. And the report is expected to arrive in a few days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hawala-racket-kingpin-s-nephew-amritsar-improvement-trust-employee-summoned-for-questioning-101624823231693.html

There is a strong buzz that Sekhri, a three-time MLA, may join the SAD in presence of party president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday as he is feeling suffocated in the party over alleged interference by cabinet minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa in his constituency. Verka, the ruling party legislator from Amritsar West and chairman of the Punjab State Warehousing Corporation, said, “Sekhri is my senior party colleague and part of family. I will request him to not take any such step. Punjab Congress affairs incharge Harish Rawat and chief minister Amarinder Singh are also reaching out to him,” said Verka.Sekhri, who served on key posts in Congress and is known as a Hindu face of the party in Majha, was not available for comments. He lost the 2017 assembly elections to SAD candidate Lakhbir Singh Lodhinangal by only 500 votes. Since then, neighbouring Fatehgarh Churian MLA Tript Bajwa increased his activities in the Batala segment. Bajwa managed to put his loyalists at the helm in the Batala municipal corporation, further marginalising Sekhri. in September last year, Sekhri had filed a police complaint against Tript Bajwa for ‘ignoring’ Covid-19 norms.The former minister of state also met former Congress president Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi on June 22. After meeting Rahul, he had questioned the role of CM Amarinder Singh in the current turmoil in the party.‘Assured of addressing all his concerns’Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday said former minister Ashwani Sekhri will stay in the Congress and there is no question of his leaving the party. In a statement, Amarinder said he spoke to Sekhri and assured him that all his concerns will be addressed. “Sekhri is a dyed-in-the wool Congressman who has spent his whole life with the party and all the rumours about his leaving the party are baseless,” he said. It is the party’s duty and responsibility to watch and safeguard the interests of all senior leaders, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/talk-of-sekhri-joining-sad-cong-s-verka-meets-three-time-batala-mla-101624823229018.html

The usual hustle and bustle was conspicuously missing from Sunday special markets and wholesale markets in Chaura Bazaar, Akalgarh Market, and the AC Market. Not just customers, vendors also refrained from setting up their stalls. However, shopkeepers are hoping that business will rev up by the next weekend. Chaura Bazar Lal Rangi Ram Street Shopkeepers’ Association president Gurinder Sood said, “Markets opening on Sunday is the first step towards normalcy. The footfall was around 10-15% and Sunday rush was nowhere to be seen. It seemed like any normal day. However, more customers will surely turn up over the next weekend. This week, customers were caught unaware as relaxations were announced suddenly on Saturday evening.” Shopkeepers are expecting out-of-town customers to start visiting from the next weekend. Akalgarh Market Garment Association president Manpreet Singh Bunty said, “Customers from other towns, districts and states visit the wholesale markets of the city exclusively on Sunday. Though low footfall was seen this time, at least 20% of the business lost due to the lockdown was restored.” Beopar Mandal general secretary Sunil Mehra and district president Arvinder Makkar, while hailing the government’s latest orders have demanded a relief package for businesses that have taken a hit during lockdown. they have sought for some relief in electricity bills and property tax . Social distancing, masks ditched Despite the administration cautioning residents against flouting Covid protocols to prevent a resurgence in cases, many people could be seen huddling together with face masks. Traders, however, have appealed people to follow the rules to prevent another Covid-induced lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-markets-reopen-on-sunday-to-low-footfall-101624823049494.html

However, stakeholders are confident that they will gradually be able to recoup their losses as life inches towards normalcy. After lifting of weekend restrictions, the continuing curbs on bars and an early curfew timing are restaurateurs’ primary grouses. Hotel and Restaurant Association president Amarvir Singh said, “Bars should be opened at the earliest as they account for 35-40% of the restaurant business. The curfew relaxation period should also be extended till 10pm as most residents prefer to dine after 8pm and at present we have to wind up by 7:30pm.”Restaurant owners attributed the late announcement regarding relaxations for the low footfall on Sunday. Restaurants have been allowed to open at 50% capacity from 5am to 7:30pm amid declining cases.Iron Chef owner Amitoj Singh said, “We only received around 25-30% customers. We expect business will be back on track by July. Residents are fearful about stepping out at the moment.” Senior vice-chairperson (excise and taxation), Punjab State Traders Board, and owner of Basant Restaurants, Bhupinder Basant said,”People are slowly adapting to the circumstances and the footfall is improving by the day.

28-06-2021||Chandigarh||SFJ terminates lobbying among US lawmakers after 3 months||Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a secessionist group facing multiple probes in India and declared an unlawful entity, has summarily terminated its lobbying among US lawmakers within three months of launching a campaign to garner their support, documents show.In the lobbying disclosure reports filed by its registered lobbyist, “Blue Star Strategies LLC”, the SFJ has been described as a “US-based NGO that supports the secession of Punjab from India”.The lobbyist has further disclosed in its filings that the specific lobbying issue of its client was to “raise awareness in the US of treatment of the Sikh community in India”.The documents submitted to the US Senate Lobbying Disclosure platform show that Blue Star Strategies’ lobbying registration report on behalf of the SFJ was filed on March 12, 2021, while the first quarterly disclosure report was filed by it a little over a month later on April 19.Besides raising “awareness in the US about the treatment of Sikh community in India”, the initial filing also mentioned, “efforts by the Sikh-American diaspora in the US to draw attention to these issues” among the specific lobbying issues.However, the second part was omitted from the lobbying disclosure filings made post-registration.Also, in less than three months of the registration, Blue Star Strategies filed a termination report for its lobbying activities on behalf of the SFJ, effective May 31.The termination report was subsequently posted on the US Senate Lobbying Disclosure platform on June 15.While no particular reason has been given for the termination, the lobbyist has disclosed “less than USD 5,000” as income from the client for the second quarter of 2021, while a similar amount was disclosed in the first-quarter report.It has also disclosed the US House of Representatives and the department of justice among the houses/agencies covered under the lobbying activity for the client.Queries sent to the lobbyist as well as the client through their websites remained unanswered, while there was no response to calls made to the phone numbers listed there.The SFJ has been in focus in the recent past in India after several people, including activists associated with the long-running farmers’ protests on Delhi borders, were issued summons by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with a case registered against this organisation.In the FIR, the SFJ has been described as “an unlawful association under the UAPA Act” and has been accused, along with other Khalistani terrorist groups, of conspiring “to create an atmosphere of fear and lawlessness and to cause disaffection in people and to incite them towards rising in rebellion against the government of India”.It has also been alleged that as part of this conspiracy, huge funds were being collected abroad for on-ground campaigns and propaganda against missions in countries like the USA, the UK, Canada, Germany, etc.SFJ’s Gurpatwant Singh Pannun was among the nine individuals linked to separatist Khalistani outfits who were designated as terrorists by the Indian government in July last year under the UAPA Act.Later in December 2020, the NIA filed a chargesheet against 16 people associated with the SFJ and based in the US, UK and Canada under the anti-terror law, UAPA, for allegedly indulging in seditious activities and promoting enmity on the grounds of region and religion in the country. These also included Pannun. The documents filed on the Senate Lobbying Disclosure platform further show that it was the second attempt by the SFJ at lobbying for its cause among the US lawmakers, but the previous one was done indirectly.The Government of India also has a registered lobbyist in the US, which typically covers issues related to bilateral relations between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sfj-terminates-lobbying-among-us-lawmakers-after-3-months-101624822688981.html
28-06-2021||Chandigarh||Groundwater contamination: NGT directs Punjab to allocate ₹280 cr to 9 urban local bodies||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Punjab government to allocate ₹280 crore at the earliest to nine urban local bodies (ULBs) to mitigate groundwater contamination.The NGT principal bench headed by chairperson justice Adarsh Kumar Goel also asked the state authorities to provide canal water supply to Fazilka villagers along the Pakistan border.The NGT was hearing a petition filed by a farm rights activist from Fazilka, Vikram Ahuja, in July 2019 stating that untreated sewage of 21 municipalities of Punjab’s Malwa belt is flowing through drains into the district, resulting in contamination of groundwater in Fazilka villages.These ULBs either lack STPs or work inefficiently and domestic and industrial effluents are thrown in drains that affect nearly 120 villages of Fazilka. Ahuja said drains continue to stink due to the discharge of untreated waste into them.He said on Sunday that works undertaken by the state authorities to control the hazardous practice of discharging untreated municipal waste into the drainage networks is going on at a slow pace.Nine municipalities of Fazilka, Ferozepur, Moga and Muktsar have submitted detailed project reports (DPRs) to the state government for laying of sewerage network, water supply schemes and installation of sewage treatment plants (STPs) as long-term measures for control of water pollution.Nihal Singh Wala needs ₹49.13 crore, the highest among earmarked local bodies, and Fatehgarh Panjtoor municipality has the lowest requirement of ₹8 crore to check pollution.Accepting a report submitted by NGT’s state monitoring committee, the tribunal stated that to ensure transparency, Punjab should assure that data of sludge generated during the operation of STPs is maintained.It directed deputy commissioners of Fazilka and Muktsar to ensure that STPs at Jalalabad and Muktsar towns are handed over to an expert agency, Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board for operation and maintenance (O&M).It observed that in most of the STPs, the quantity of sludge generated during the operation of STP is not measured and no proper record is maintained for the same. Further, the disposal of sludge in an environmentally sound manner is not made by most of the ULBs.“There is a need to maintain a record of operational hours of STPs, sludge generated per day and its disposal. Sludge should be used as manure. Also, state agencies should ensure regular payment to contractors for smooth operation and maintenance charges of STPs,” it observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/groundwater-contamination-ngt-directs-punjab-to-allocate-rs-280-cr-to-9-urban-local-bodies-101624822628997.html

Police have also recovered seven cars — two Hyundai Creta, a Toyota Innova, a Toyota Fortuner, a Mohindra Scorpio, a Maruti Suzuki Swift VDI and a Swift Dzire — which were to be sold further.

The first blast at 1.37am ripped off the roof of a single-storey building at the technical area of the airport manned by the IAF in Satwari area of the city. The second one at 1.42am was on the ground.Jammu and Kashmir director general of police (DGP) Dilbag Singh termed the twin explosions at the high-security air force base a terror attack. He said the police and other agencies were working together with IAF officials to unravel the plan behind the attack.An FIR has been registered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the case has been taken over by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).Investigators scanned CCTV footage, including from cameras installed on the boundary walls of the airport, in an effort to determine from where the drones came. However, all the CCTV cameras focused on the roadside, officials said. Drones cannot be detected by radars deployed at border areas to monitor enemy activity, they said, suggesting that a different radar system that can detect drones as small as a bird be installed.Earlier in the day, IAF officials said the blasts were being thoroughly probed by a high-level IAF investigation team, which was joined by a team of the NIA. The Western Command Air chief had also reached the site.There have been several incidents of Pakistan using drones in border areas of Jammu and Kashmir to drop arms, ammunition, weapons, drugs and Hawala money to fuel terrorism in the region. The incident comes at a time when defence minister Rajnath Singh is at Leh in Ladakh to take stock of the security scenario.Terrorist with IED nabbed in JammuWhile officials were investigating the drone attack, another major strike was averted when a person, probably owing allegiance to the banned Lashker-e-Taiba, was arrested along with an improvised explosive device weighing around six kg, the director general of police said. The person was tasked with triggering the IED in a crowded place. “The suspect has been detained and is being interrogated. More suspects are likely to be picked up in this foiled IED blast attempt,” the DGP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/drone-strike-at-jammu-iaf-station-two-injured-101624820547856.html

We all know Pakistan, controlled by its army, would never deviate from its bleed-India campaign. Therefore, it is high time that we seriously pondered over the new threat.”Of late, Pakistan has been using drones to drop arms, ammunition, weapons, drugs and hawala money in border areas of Jammu and Kashmir to fuel terrorism.“The Sunday attack in the dead of night is a first of its kind in India and it must ring alarm bells among those at the helm of affairs,” said the officer.He suggested regulation on sale of drones and other low-flying objects in India.“We have many defence installations in J&K surrounded by civilian population. Though it remains a subject of probe, in this case, it appeared the drones took off from a nearby locality to carry out the attack. They, however, missed the intended target — the helicopter hangar,” the army officer said.The Jammu technical airport houses choppers, including Mi17 helicopters and transport aircraft.The officer could not rule out the possibility of Pakistan’s involvement in the Sunday attack.“Pakistan started digging trans-border tunnels into plains of Jammu region on the lines of Hamas fighters in 2012 and successfully used them to push armed terrorists into Jammu. Now, drones have emerged as a new threat for us,” he said.It may be stated here that India has been exploring anti-drone technologies with Israel and has also been developing indigenous technology. While India explores anti-drone technologies, one can easily order and get delivered at the doorstep heavy lift drones with 4K camera from online marketing portals that cost less than ₹6,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jammu-airbase-blasts-drones-emerge-as-new-threat-to-defence-installations-101624820543359.html

28-06-2021||Bangalore||How mathas play a role in shaping political landscape||Bengaluru In the past few weeks, prominent politicians running to mathas (mutts) or monasteries in every nook and corner of Karnataka, has been played on loop by Kannada TV news channels, reporting and interpreting almost every angle of significance of such visits. The frequency of such visits is indicative of either a political crisis or the onset of elections, analysts and observers said, making them a powerful group with influence over every sphere of not just society but the electoral landscape including governance and policy. And mathas rarely turn down such visits, treating everyone at their doorstep equally, giving enough content for the politician to flaunt, almost as if claiming to have got the validation and backing of these Mathadisha’s (pontiffs or chief abbotts) and its followers. Though mathas were traditionally only into social and religious duties, people who are aware of their workings, said that there has been a growing involvement of some of these entities in politics especially since the 1980’s. “Some mathas are deviating from their original goal of Adhyatma, spirituality and moral education and guidance,” said one person involved and aware of the workings of these institutions. “These are not their objectives but it has become their main objective now. Today to expect swamiji’s to teach politicians morality is beyond question,” the person cited above said. Estimates are that there are thousands of such mathas in Karnataka and several of them have come up in the last two decades to consolidate the community in a region and become a larger bargaining power for better education, representation and other benefits for its members. Experts said that the situation is such that every community wants a matha or feels incomplete. These entities run schools, colleges, orphanages and other social activities in which thousands of children are educated, irrespective of caste. Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who is from the dominant Lingayat community, has been trying to get the backing of these mathas to mobilise support against his removal from the top chair. His son, BY Vijayendra, too has been making frequent trips to these mathas, which people aware of the developments said, was not just to get the backing of these pontiffs behind Yediyurappa but also to recognize him as the potential heir in lieu of his imminent electoral plunge. Some of these matha’s are entwined in Karnataka’s deep-rooted caste-based politics, backing candidates, opposing or proposing policies that are likely to impact the community, making political statements and even bargaining for better reservation and representation. In recent times, almost all major communities like the Kurubas, Valmiki, Vokkaliga and the Panchamasali (the largest sub-sect within the Lingayats) have held large rallies and processions seeking better reservation opportunities that gave Yediyurappa an opportunity to restructure the entire process and allowing him to be seen as heeding to demands from all communities. Yediyurappa has managed to get the backing of at least 17 small Lingayat mathas from Tumakuru and other places to back him openly but a few others Kudalasangama-based Panchamasali mutt Seer Jagadguru Basava Jaya Mrityunjaya Swami, who led the demands for better reservation for the Panchamasali sect of Lingayats, has suggested that if the BJP does replace Yediyurappa, they consider making a Lingayat candidate from north Karnataka as chief minister. Ramesh Jarkiholi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Gokak, visited Suttur Matha in Mysuru on Friday in the wake of developments that he would seek a re-induction to the cabinet as the case of sexual exploitation levelled against him gets weaker. The connection between politics and mathas runs deep, with the former sometimes openly endorsing a candidate or resolving to defeat one in elections. In Chitradurga’s Murugha Matha of the Lingayat community, about 200 kms from Bengaluru, the main hall is filled with pictures of the head pontiff, Sri Shivamurthy Murugha Sharanaru sharing space with former prime ministers, chief ministers and other prominent politicians. Just before the 2018 elections, BJP national president Amit Shah and his Congress counterpart Rahul Gandhi had visited several mathas in Karnataka. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too had made references to several such mathas and their pontiffs, specific to the geography of his rally, during his speeches in the run up to the elections. The head pontiff of Madara Guru Peetha that represents the Madigas, a socially backward community, had successfully engineered the defeat of the then Congress minister H Anjaneya after publicly stating that he would “go to any extent” to defeat the latter, who was earlier the secretary of the matha. The head pontiff of the Tontadarya Matha joined farmers and others and successfully campaigned against a proposed 6 million tonne Posco steel plant, in Gadag, in 2011, demonstrating their ability to mobilise people for a cause, which sometimes is political. Yediyurappa is arguably the biggest political leader of the Lingayat community which has made it more difficult for the BJP to replace him, fearing a backlash from the group which is believed to be the largest in the state. Siddaramaiah lost power in 2018 after attempting to accord a separate religion status for the Lingayats and tried to distinguish between Veerashaivas (considered a sub-sect and a term used interchangeably with Lingayats) which was seen as an attempt to divide the community. “Yediyurappa came up not because he had the support of the community. But when he became powerful, the community sided with him,” said a senior BJP leader, requesting not to be named. “The community supports a strong leader and does not back them just because they are from the same caste,” he added. A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at Azim Premji University said that the Lingayat support to the BJP is currently routed through Yediyurappa but the party is probably unsure if the community may back another outfit if the chief minister is replaced. “The formula is such that the party (BJP) cannot do without Lingayat support in Karnataka and it is not sure if Lingayat support is guaranteed without Yediyurappa,” he added. He said that in other states there have been instances of chief minister’s parading MLAs but in Karnataka, Yediyurappa may be forced to parade the support of mathas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/how-mathas-play-a-role-in-shaping-political-landscape-101624818849457.html

The committee comprises SC Kollur, scientific officer of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), a Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation representative, a Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) representative, a regional officer of MPCB, Pune, and a regional officer of MPCB, Mumbai.The state mentioned that the committee should study the NGT order issued in 2020, to develop a proper system to control the emission of hazardous gases from the crematorium. The state has given a three-month deadline for a report to be submitted to the Bombay High Court.Shrinivas Kandul, additional city engineer of the PMC electrical department said, “State has included a PMC representative in the committee. PMC may include its environment officers.”Meanwhile, PMC has already assigned the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)-linked National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to study the air pollution in the area around the Vaikunth crematorium.Vikrant Latkar, petitioner and resident of Aanadbaugh said, “In the 300-metre radius of Vaikunth, there are 20,000 directly affected due to hazardous gases. It is okay that the state formed a committee, but it is on paper. It will take more than six months to sort out the problem. For the last three years, residents are complaining and PMC hasn’t taken any substantial action so far.”Of the 24 crematoria in the city, there are residential areas around Vaikunth, Wadgaonsheri and Vishrantwadi crematoria.

Union sports minister Kiren Rijiju and BJP MLA Siddharth Shirole tweeted about the incident. Rijiju tweeted, “As it is we are lacking sufficient sports facilities in our country. All the sports centres need proper care.”The sports complex was used for a meeting on an upcoming sports international university project.The directorate of Sports and Youth and Services, government of Maharashtra, on Sunday issued a circular stating “Only one car was allowed on the main athletic stadium, that too on the concrete cement platform. A few cars followed the first car and the situation got out of control. We regret whatever happened and such issues will not happen in the future.”Shirole tweeted, “Not only has the athletic track worth crores of rupees at Shiv Chhaptrapati Sports Complex been damaged, but the spirit of sportspersons who bring glory to our nation has been severely dented by the shameful & arrogant actions of MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi) leadership.“Don’t get me wrong. I love cricket but imagine the uproar if SUVs drove and parked over the pitch of an international cricket ground. That is what the MVA leadership did... disrespected and destroyed an international athletic track, and with it the morale of our athletes.” “At a time when PM Modi is inspiring our sportsperson to bring glory for our country, the tall leaders of Maha Vikas Aghadhi government are doing such shameful acts. I demand immediate apology from them and an impartial inquiry into the entire incident,” said Shirole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/convoy-of-cars-parked-on-athletic-track-of-shiv-chhatrapati-sports-complex-draws-bjp-fire-101624818729220.html

The announcement was made by Samant after he met professors on protest at the state higher education department office. Professors have been on protest since June 21 for various demands. Samant, along with senior education department officials, held discussions on the spot, after the professors ended their protest. Samant said, “Till now, of the total approved 4,074 recruitment posts of professors, 1,600 posts have been filled. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the recruitment process had gone on hold and the proposal for the recruitment of 3,064 professors has been sent to the finance department from my ministry. We are hoping to get it approved by next week.”Another important issue raised by the professors was about working on an hourly basis and an increase in payment. Samant said that payment will be done on a 48- minute method, set by the University Grants Commission (UGC). The University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines for professors who work on an hourly basis is that one lecture payment should be 48 minutes in duration and not 60 minutes. Earlier, the rate for an hourly lecture was ₹500 which is now increased to ₹650. For practicals the rate for an hour was ₹150, which has been increased to ₹250 now. Samant also approved the recruitment of 121 librarians and 659 university teachers, a long pending demand of the Maharashtra State Librarians Federation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-higher-and-technical-education-minister-commits-to-recruiting-3-064-professors-in-state-101624818728031.html

In the past two days, the vaccination drive in the district crossed the 0.1 million mark for the first time, since the drive began on January 16.As per the district’s information office, as of June 25, a total of 3,452,967 vaccine doses have been administered, of which the overall vaccine wastage is 0.9%. Of the total 3.4 million doses administered, 31,076 have been wasted. Of the 3.4 million vaccines administered, 2,648,080 were of Covishield and 3,39,312 were of Covaxin. Dr Sachin Edake, district immunisation officer, said, “We have instructed at all sites to ensure that the vaccine wastage is kept to a minimum. If a vial is reserved with 10 doses for 10 beneficiaries, then it has to be used within the 34 hours of its opening. However, if the vial is not used then its efficacy is compromised.”Vaccine wastage is bifurcated into two - unopened vials beyond the expiry date, or because of exposure to heat, being frozen, breakage, missing inventory or theft; the second is discarding unused vaccines returned from the site. Discarding opened vials at the end of the session can be because the number of doses have not been used, or there is a dilution with water, suspected contamination and poor vaccine practices.On Sunday, Pune district saw a drop in the number of vaccinations, as 26,722 vaccinations were recorded at 136 sites - 40 government and 96 private. In the past two days, as supply of vaccines resumed, the drive has been boosted, however, on Sunday, many government centres were shut||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punes-vaccine-wastage-percentage-stays-below-1-101624818672194.html

It is a negligible surge and the situation is under control,” said Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), Zilla Parishad.The positivity rate of rural Pune, as of June 27, is 8.5%, while the percentage of bed occupancy is 13.9%. Level 3 restrictions are in place in the 13 talukas, where the case fatality rate is 1.5%.“The situation has improved since the last week of April. From the number of hotspots at 400, we have brought it down to under 100 and the way in which testing and vaccination has been going on in rural Pune, the number of hotspots will not increase further,” added Prasad.As of date 1,380,253 people have been vaccinated in rural Pune.The rural administration has also focussed on random testing.

28-06-2021||Pune||Covid-19 vaccine may be required to be taken annually: taskforce chair||Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman of the state’s Covid-19 taskforce, during a ‘live’ Facebook session on Sunday, said that over time, neutralising antibodies decrease, so the Covid-19 vaccine would be required to be taken annually.“A second dose of the vaccine against Covid-19 would be required to be taken again in the next 10-12 months,” said Dr Oak, adding that just like influenza vaccine, which needs to be taken seasonally, the Covid-19 vaccine may also be required at regular intervals. Dr Oak said, “It looks like we will have to take the vaccine every year. We are yet to complete one year since the Covid-19 vaccination drive began, not just in India, but in western countries too. We began the drive from January 16. As of now, it is quite possible that with time, the level of neutralising antibodies decreases. With other vaccines, like those given against influenza, the neutralizing antibodies remain for about 10-12 months. For now it looks like we might have to take a second dose of Covid-19 vaccine next year.” The influenza vaccine is a seasonal shot given to protect against three to four influenza viruses. Dr Oak also said that the new variants have to be taken seriously as mutation is seen in protein spikes. He said, “Now we have enough oxygen supply and enough isolation beds, but ICU beds are full. A particular mutation is considered to be a variant of concern after considering three factors - infectivity, virulence and its impact on vaccination and our Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. While the first two are not within our control, the last one is most important. Even today, there is vaccine hesitancy in rural areas which needs to be addressed. Even after vaccination, a mask is the best preventive method.” Explaining the difference between Covishield and Covaxin, he said that while Covaxin is made from a completely dead virus, Covishield is made from an attenuated or a weakened virus. He added, “It is partly true that the gap between two Covishield doses has been increased because of a shortage in supply. However, even in western countries the gap has been increased to more than eight weeks.”In view of the anticipated third wave which is likely to infect children the most, as the age group is yet to be vaccinated, Dr Oak said, “In the trials for those aged between 12-18 for Covaxin, it was found that there were no major side effects and that the results were satisfactory. I believe that vaccination for those aged between 12-18 years can begin shortly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid19-vaccine-may-be-required-to-be-taken-annually-taskforce-chair-101624818670509.html

Police said that it appears the riders were racing their motorcycles which led to the accident.The deceased was identified as Rahul Teotia, a native of Mehrauli in Delhi. His friend, identified as Yash Kumar, 30, who is a resident of Rohini in Delhi, was seriously injured in the incident, police said.Sanjay Kumar Singh, station house officer (SHO), Knowledge Park police station, said that the two bikers had come to Greater Noida area on a joyride. “ The accident took place on Agra-Noida side of the expressway around 9.50am. The rear tyre of Teotia’s bike got burst and he lost balance at around two kilometres from Zero Point in Greater Noida. Kumar, coming in the same direction, hit the Teotia’s bike and the two riders were injured,” he said.The SHO said that police received information about the accident through Twitter. “A police team reached the spot and rushed the two victims to a private hospital where Teotia died. Kumar is undergoing treatment at the hospital,” he said.Singh said police have not received any complaint in this regard. “We will conduct an awareness drive and advise people not to race on the Yamuna Expressway as it could be fatal,” the SHO said.Ashutosh Singh, Noida traffic inspector, said the traffic police frequently conduct enforcement drives to check racing bikes. “The police team stops them at the DND Flyway and Chilla Boder, and asks them to return. It appears that the two bikers from Delhi took some other routes for the Yamuna Expressway. We will conduct an enforcement drive on the expressway soon,” he said.A few months ago, a sports bike riders’ video had surfaced in which they were seen racing on the Yamuna Expressway. Police said that these bikers, mostly from Delhi, usually go for a joyride on the Yamuna Expressway till Rabupura and Jewar, and then return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/one-killed-as-speeding-bikes-collide-on-yamuna-expressway-101624816567865.html
28-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s govt schools go the extra mile to make sure no student is left behind||With the first phase of online classes set to commence in over 1,030 Delhi government schools from Monday, principals and teachers have come up with innovative methods to track students and introduce them to another year of virtual learning.In a circular issued on Friday, the Directorate of Education asked teachers and principals to use the first phase, between June 28 and July 3, to establish an initial the pupil-teacher connect through the phone and prepare a list of students who don’t have either smartphones or feature phones.Several principals of public schools in areas such as Lajpat Nagar, Mayur Vihar, Rohini, Okhla, Najafgarh, Jafrabad, and Tilak Nagar said they will focus on providing emotional support to students and mentally prepare them before starting online classes.Awadhesh Kumar Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini, said the school will deploy teams of teachers to visit nearby localities with microphones. “Our teachers will go to busy intersections and make announcements on microphones about the new academic session. Even if the students are not present, relatives or neighbours of those families will inform them, and the students will return to their classes. When we did this activity last year, we were able to identify the localities where dropouts are more common and where intervention might be of more help,” he said.Most principals HT spoke to said that the focus will be on tracking Class 6 students. Every year, around 170,000 students move from municipal schools, which offer education only up to Class 5, to government schools in Class 6. Due to the pandemic, migration, and poor record-keeping, only 76% of such students could be traced last year.Schools such as Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Molarband said they are mindful of lessons drawn from last year’s admissions. “This time, we made it a point to note down contact numbers and updated addresses of all children, along with the bank account numbers linked to their subsidies. Before the pandemic, doing this was difficult as not all families had phones or remembered the number. But this time, we insisted on getting one contact number at least,” said principal Sujata Tamta.Not just tracking students, some schools are also taking measure to instil a connection between students, their peers and the institutes.Mudassir Jahan, head of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Noor Nagar, Okhla, said they are planning to record a video of the school to share with students on WhatsApp groups. “Along with Class 6 students who have been admitted this year, those who have been promoted to Class 7 also haven’t even visited their schools once. Their learning has been on WhatsApp due to the pandemic since last year. So, we plan to record a video of the school and its teachers along with photographs of their classmates so that they feel some sort of connection,” she said.Jahan also said that they plan to use the local community to track missing students. “Though we don’t expect many students to be missing, we will use local mosques, school management committee (SMC) members, and engage community leaders as shiksha mitras to contact families,” she said.Along with finding missing children and providing emotional support to students, schools are also taking efforts to provide tools of digital learning to those in need. Bijesh Kumar Sharma, principal of Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Lajpat Nagar, said they have started an initiative with students of the school and their parents to help such families. “We provide the raw material for masks and toys to some families and sell the finished product in the market. The revenue generated is used to provide smartphones and other such requirements for needy students,” he said.According to school officials, they have raised ₹1.90 lakh from the initiative which saw participation from around 15 members from eight families, including Afghan refugees.Delhi government has also facilitated a mental health and well-being workshop with professional counsellors to train its mentor teachers, who will later conduct similar workshops with other teachers in schools under them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/loudspeakers-to-fundraisers-schools-go-the-extra-mile-to-ensure-no-student-left-behind-101624814833468.html

Exercise is necessary not only for good physical health but also good mental health. The current times are very stressful. People need to go to the gym after taking all necessary precautions,” said Ashish Tanwar, an engineer and a regular at the gym.Arpita Aggarwal, another fitness enthusiast, said, “Yoga helps build good physical and mental health. It is extremely necessary. It is good that gyms and yoga centres can open now. If Covid-19 cases continue to go down, I hope the government soon allows swimming pools to open as well.”The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) said in a notification on Saturday that gymnasiums and yoga institutes in the national capital can open from Monday.“Gymnasiums and yoga institutes will be permitted to open with up to 50% capacity. The owners shall be responsible for ensuring strict compliance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. In case any violation is found, strict action will be taken against the owner, as well as the individual, and the premises will be sealed forthwith,” a DDMA notification, dated June 26, read.Delhi has been under a lockdown since April 19 in the light of an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases. At its peak, on April 20, Delhi recorded more than 28,300 new Covid-19 cases in a day – a number that has now dropped to 89, according to the government’s Covid-9 health bulletin issued on Sunday.While Delhi started implementing a phased relaxation process from May 31, gyms were allowed to resume operations only on Saturday. Even during previous year’s lockdown, while the scaling down of restrictions had begun in early-June, gyms and yoga centres – usually seen as a threat in terms of transmission of the virus because of the closed spaces and little room for social distancing – were allowed to resume operations only around mid-September.“Delhi has more than 5,000 gyms, fitness centres and yoga centres. The industry was under a lot of financial stress because of the previous lockdown. The latest one was a massive blow. Many of them went out of business in the last few weeks. We hope we manage to recover financially in the coming months,” said Chirag Sethi, vice-president of Delhi gym association.Vinay Sangwan, owner of Anytime Fitness, a chain of gyms in Delhi-NCR, said: “In the time of the pandemic, people need to stay fit, both physically and mentally, for which gyms and yoga centres are very necessary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-gyms-open-with-covid-protocols-101624814834161.html
28-06-2021||Delhi||Owners of banquet halls in Delhi look to make up for lost time||Owners of banquet halls and those involved in allied wedding-related businesses heaved a sigh of relief after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) came out with an order on Saturday allowing banquet halls to reopen from Monday, as part of its measures to unlock the Capital in a phased manner after a nearly two-month long lockdown that was put in place following the fourth wave of Covid-19 in the Capital.As per unlock rules issued by the DDMA, weddings can be held in banquet halls with the number of guests capped at 50. However, if a wedding is being held in court or at home, the existing cap of 20 people remains in place.Ramesh Dang, president of Community Welfare Banquet Association Delhi, said he is glad that restrictions have been eased after nearly two months. “We welcome the move. This was long pending. We are reaching out to our staff. While some are in Delhi, some had returned back to their native places,” said Dang.He said while some bookings had been placed months ago, bookings that were cancelled or postponed amid the fourth wave of Covid-19 are being rescheduled now. “By tomorrow (Monday), things will fall in place. We wrote to the chief minister and the Lieutenant Governor and are relieved that restrictions have been eased, although this comes a little late,” said Dang.He said while other states, such as Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, had eased restrictions earlier, Delhi delayed lifting the curbs. “Since Delhi eased restrictions after neighbouring states, a lot of revenue has been directed outside the city. Nonetheless, something is better than nothing,” said Dang.Shiv Kumar, owner of Carnival motel and Resort, located at GT Karnal Road, said he was hoping for business to bounce back. “Since the decision came only a day ago, it will take some time for the machinery to kick into action. Our staff is also scattered in different places. We will start calling them,” said Kumar.He said that while the move was welcome, the wedding industry had been badly hit. “Only two-three dates are left for this month. There are some dates next month but many people have already booked facilities in Haryana and other states. We have faced a massive loss,” said Kumar.In addition to banquet halls, allied stakeholders and industry players, including band companies, decorators, caterers, and jewellers, are hoping for the revival of business.Virender Chawla, managing director of the Chawla Band, said while business had been hit, he was hopeful that it will recover. “Since last night (Saturday), we have started getting requests from people. People are enquiring and we are optimistic that things will get back on track. Delhi doesn’t take a lot of time to get back on its feet. In a month or two, things will become as before,” said Chawla. The band has asked all its employees to get vaccinated as a safety measure. “All our employees are getting vaccinated. We will follow all rules,” said Chawla.He said that many people are hoping to get married in the coming weeks since there were concerns about a possible third wave. “Cases are low and people want to fulfil their commitments since things are slightly better now,” said Chawla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/owners-of-banquet-halls-in-delhi-look-to-make-up-for-lost-time-101624814832675.html

On Monday and Tuesday, polio drops will be given to children up to the age of five years at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/lockdown-extended-till-july-5-16-new-covid-19-cases-in-gurugram-101624814831976.html
28-06-2021||Delhi||Some hiccups but Chandni Chowk warms up to idea of being a vehicle-free zone||Newly-installed steel gates plastered with posters announcing a ban on entry of motorised vehicles between 9am to 9pm and a fine of ₹20,000 have come up at the entrance of the revamped Chandni Chowk, opposite the Red Fort. With the 1.3 km stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid becoming a no-go zone for motorised vehicles, queues of rickshaw pullers line up the entrance and keep an eye out for potential customers entering the market.Pappu, 22, who has been ferrying passengers in the area for the past six years, said there has been some improvement in earnings since motorised vehicles were barred on the stretch. “Since cars are no longer allowed during the day, more people are hiring cycle rickshaws. The restrictions need to be implemented more strictly. Makeshift e-rickshaws need to be banned too. They clog traffic and eat into our share of customers,” said Pappu, who goes by his first name.Prem Kumar, 24, another rickshaw puller, said while more people were reaching out to rickshaws since the ban on vehicles, it was crucial to ensure compliance. “Cars and scooters also keep entering whenever they get the chance. E-rickshaws also need to be banned if the focus is on pedestrianisation,” said Kumar.When HT visited the revamped stretch on Saturday, motorised vehicles such as scooters and cars were plying during the daytime. One of the two security guards on duty told HT that while they were only allowing vehicles with exemptions to pass through, some people got aggressive when they were stopped. “Many visitors including those who come for worship here, also ask us to open the gates. Sometimes they get aggressive but we try to stop them or comply with requests,” said the guard, who did not wish to named.Despite repeated attempts, senior traffic police officers did not comment on the allegations.As per a gazette notification issued by the Delhi transport department on June 14, motorised vehicles are no longer allowed to ply on the main Chandni Chowk Road from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Mosque from 9am to 9pm. Fire tenders, ambulance, hearse vans, and other emergency vehicles along with vehicles deployed for enforcement and maintenance services, however, have been kept out of the purview of restrictions.The 1.3-km stretch has been turned into a pedestrian-only zone as part of the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project being spearheaded by the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), the nodal agency for the redevelopment of the heritage market. Work on various aspects of the first phase of the project is expected to be completed by the end of July.SRDC officials said the installation of street lights on the stretch along with the control room for CCTV monitoring is expected to be completed by June 30. Work on all toilets is also underway and is expected to be completed by July 31.Shoppers and residents also welcomed the area becoming a vehicle-free zone.Mohd Sadir, 38, who has a shoe shop in Ballimaran, said he was happy with the pedestrianisation and hoped that more areas will be covered soon. “We welcome this step but the area needs to be beautified beyond this stretch,” said Sadir, who lives in Ballimaran. He said while there were some challenges in transporting goods, people will get used to the timings gradually. “There is always some resistance to new initiatives. Cycle rickshaws are always there for ferrying both goods and passengers,” said Sadir.Deepa Mehra, a resident of Kucha Ghasi Ram, said while the main stretch has been completed, work needed to be amped up. “The pedestrianisation plan is good since vehicles would clog all the roads earlier, leaving little to no space for walking. Cars should be completely banned in the area but there is a need to move beyond the mains stretch into the galis. The core problems remain. They should have worked on the inner streets first,” said Mehra.While most people have welcomed restrictions on motorised vehicles, some residents along with custodians of places of worship have sought some relaxations on account of inconvenience being faced by worshippers. Officials from the Gurudwara Sis Gang Sahib said the elderly and disabled worshippers were facing challenges due to a ban on motorised vehicles.“Two-wheelers are also not being allowed to come inside. If this continues, many people will not be able to visit us the way they way did earlier. Senior citizens are also getting dissuaded since vehicles are no longer being allowed,” said a visitor, who did not wish to be named.Maulana Mohammad Furquan Qasmi, imam, Sunehri Masjid, Fountain Chowk, said while the curbs on entry of motorised vehicles were needed “for a place like Chandni Chowk”, limited passes for emergency use could be given out to various places of worship. “We welcome the beautification but traffic police should hold consultations and issue passes for emergency use to those who come to worship here. Every time, we step out for some emergency work or transfer of goods, we are threatened with fines. If elderly or disabled individuals visit us, we can’t ask them to go back and return after 9 pm. Those of us who live here should not be inconvenienced,” said Qasmi.He added that it was crucial to listen to local residents before implementing new measures, a sentiment that was echoed by multiple residents of the area.Anil Pershad, 77, who belongs to the famous Chunnamal family, said challenges were mounting for local residents in the area. “There is a lot of traffic chaos since work is still underway. Unless specific instructions are given to security guards, residents will continue to face troubles while going in and out. There is no arrangement in place for catering to health emergencies either. It will help if local residents like us can be given a pass which can be used in emergencies,” said Pershad, adding that residents were not being made stakeholders in the revamp initiative.“If Chandni Chowk is being beautified, it should be done in such a manner that people who left the area are motivated to come back. People don’t want to come back since nothing is being done for the local residents. We can’t park our own cars here,” said Pershad.Nitin Panigrahi, deputy general manager, SRDC, said exemptions have already been provided to the elderly and emergency vehicles including ambulance and hearse vans. He added that plans for the introduction of e-carts for the elderly were also being considered. “Since the restrictions on vehicles, the environment has improved in terms of safety for elderly people. We may also introduce e-carts for the elderly,” said Panigrahi.He added that it was the responsibility of enforcement authorities to ensure compliance with the restrictions of vehicular movement. “SRDC doesn’t have enforcement authority. Traffic police are spreading awareness and signages and barriers have been installed though,” said Panigrahi.Sanjay Bhargava, president Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, said that business had improved in the area and things were expected to improve further as things fall into place. “Business has only grown with pedestrianisation. Once work on CCTV is completed and enforcement becomes stricter, things will improve further,” said Bhargava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/some-hiccups-but-chandni-chowk-warms-up-to-idea-of-being-a-vehicle-free-zone-101624814830755.html
28-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s DoE asked to pay ₹50,000 to student for an attendance goof-up||The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has asked the state education department to pay ₹50, 000 to a student who was erroneously marked absent for a Class 12 practical exam that he had appeared for and was awarded lesser marks on a pro-rata basis by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The error took place after the child remained enrolled at two Patrachar (correspondence) centres due to administrative confusion despite requesting for a change of centre, the DCPCR report noted.“Department of education, the government of NCT of Delhi to compensate [the said student] with ₹50,000 as compensation for the mental trauma he has had to suffer because of the departmental lapse,” the commission noted in its report.The student had appeared for his Class 12 mathematics practical assessment in the academic year 2019-20 and was awarded 17 out of 20 marks in the test. However, as he was erroneously enrolled in two centres, one of which marked him absent, the board granted him four out of 20 marks in the assessment as per the pro-rata basis on humanitarian grounds. The complainant also met CBSE officials to flag the concerns.“Clearly, there were multiple systemic breakdowns at the Patrachar Vidyalaya level. The centre change information was not given to the original centre which resulted in the previous centre marking the child absent inadvertently,” the report noted.CBSE Patrachar centres at Delhi government schools allow out-of-school students to appear for their board exams and study in non-formal mode. The commission directed CBSE to award the student 17 marks out of 20 for his internal assessment. Despite repeated requests, the CBSE spokesperson did not comment on the matter.“CBSE is an examination body, i.e. its role is to conduct examinations and report scores. By seeking to decide marks to something the child has not scored and disregarding the actual marks scored by the child, the CBSE assumes to itself powers it does not have…By giving him marks lower than he scored (4/20), CBSE violates his right to education and deprives him of the world of opportunities that are dependent on the board results in our country,” the report noted.An education department official, requesting anonymity, said, “Candidates choose their Patrachar centre on their own. In this case, the student selected the wrong district by mistake. Though we added his name in the new centre, we missed cancelling his name in the other centre. As soon as we got to know about the issue, we flagged it to CBSE officials. This was even before the child or his parent noticed the issue. Since DCPCR has asked the education department to initiate proceedings against our officials, they (officials) will present their side to the director of education.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhis-directorate-of-education-asked-to-pay-rs-50-000-to-student-for-an-attendance-goofup-101624814769697.html
28-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police identify drug peddling hot spots in Capital as cases spike||The Delhi police have identified at least 15 areas in Delhi as the “hot spots” for narcotic drugs peddling based on the trend of seizures of the contraband and arrests of peddlers, according to a report shared by the police on Sunday.The analysis report was prepared by the narcotics cell of the crime branch collate information and data on the latest trends in the drugs trade. It is an internal assessment done annually and half-yearly, officials privy to the development said.Police statistics attached with the report also show that there has been a nearly 100% increase in registration of cases as well as arrests of drug peddlers and suppliers in Delhi in 2020, compared to 2017. Also, 91% more peddlers were arrests in 2021 till June 15, compared to the data for the corresponding period last year. The data also shows an increase of around 55% in the registration of cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act during the same period.The report lists Sultanpuri, Jahangirpuri, Inderpuri, Sagarpur, Uttam Nagar, Laxmi Nagar, Nand Nagri, Dwarka, Chhatarpur, Nizamuddin, Majnu Ka Tila, Paharganj, Kalyanpuri, Hauz Khas Village and Khanpur as the areas where maximum seizures and arrests have come from.“We did an action-based analysis of the latest trends of the trafficking and peddling of narcotic drugs to identify the hot spots in Delhi and the prime sources in other states from where these substances are smuggled into Delhi. The trend shows that in Delhi the narcotic supply chain is – local drug supplier, drug peddler and the users. The mapping of the hot spots is helping us in nabbing the suppliers and peddlers,” said deputy commissioner of police (narcotics cell) Chinmoy Biswal, who is also the spokesperson of the city police.The report says that the commonly used drugs in Delhi are marijuana, heroin, smack, cannabis, opium and cocaine, while drug users also look for codeine syrup and inhalants, including whipped cream containers, permanent markers, bleach, cleaning substance, glue, thinner, fluorescent ink and whitener. Some synthetic drugs such as LSD, commonly known as “acid” and “L”, MDMA, also referred as ecstasy or “molly”, ketamine, methamphetamine (commonly known as “meth” or “crystal”) are sold as party drugs among rich people, senior police officers from the narcotics cell said.As far as the supply of these narcotic substances is concerned, marijuana is one of the cheapest and mostly used contraband in Delhi. It is trafficked in Delhi mostly from Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, UP, Bihar, Assam, Manipur and Nepal where it is grown locally by the farmers. Cannabis on the other hand is trafficked into Delhi from Himachal Pradesh, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Nepal as well, said DCP Biswal.“Places in Rajasthan such as Bhilwara, Jhalawar, Kota, Udaipur and Jodhpur are the prime source of opium in Delhi. This contraband is also procured from Neemach, Ratlam, Mandsor, Indore in Madhya Pradesh and from Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly, Barabanki, Badaun, and also from Jharkhand,” he said.Narcotic drugs such as cocaine and heroin are trafficked into India from abroad via air and sea routes. The neighbouring countries are used as the transit points.Experts said the police will have to check the local supply network to contain the menace. “Identifying the local hot spots means the police are aware of the main distribution centres of narcotic drugs. But to control this menace, it is important to be vigilant against the local suppliers and monitor their activities regularly. The local police can play an important role in it. The second important step should be identifying the places where such drugs are produced and bust the supply chain through which the items are smuggled into Delhi. A holistic approach and better coordination with other states is the key in the fight against the drug menace,” said former IPS officer Ashok Chand, who served the Delhi Police for around 35 years and headed the special cell and crime branch units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-identify-drug-peddling-hot-spots-in-capital-as-cases-spike-101624814767727.html
28-06-2021||Delhi||45-year-old stabbed to death in Delhi's Sultanpuri during snatching attempt; 3 minors apprehended||A 45-year-old man was stabbed to death allegedly by three minor boys for resisting their attempt to snatch his mobile phone and cash on a street in outer Delhi’s Sultanpuri on Friday night.According to police, the suspects allegedly stabbed the victim, identified as Ravinder Bisht, took out his wallet having his Aadhaar card and some cash but left his mobile phone since the victim raised the alarm.The three boys, aged around 17, were caught late Saturday night allegedly with Bisht’s wallet, containing ₹700 and his Aadhaar card. Police on Sunday said they also recovered a button-activated knife allegedly used to kill the victim.“The boys told us that resorted to snatching money and valuables to fund their drinking habit. They killed the man to rob him of his mobile phone and cash, using which they had planned to buy alcohol,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh.Bisht lived with his wife and two children in outer Delhi’s Nangloi, nearly a kilometre away from the spot where he was stabbed, and worked in a factory in Mangolpuri. His wife, Kamla, is a homemaker while their 19-year-old daughter Meghna works in a private company and son, Navneet, is a Class 10 student.Around midnight on Friday, Bisht was returning home from the factory and had reached near Jalebi Chowk in an autorickshaw from where he started walking home. After walking a few metres, Bisht stopped to speak to someone on his mobile phone when the three boys, who were roaming in the neighbourhood allegedly in search of a target, spotted him, said police.“One of the boys caught Bisht from behind, grabbed his neck, and tried to choke him while his associate attempted to snatch Bisht’s mobile phone. When he resisted, the third boy took out the knife and stabbed Bisht multiple times in his chest. When Bisht screamed for help, they took out his wallet and fled, leaving him bleeding on the roadside,” said DCP Singh.Some passersby heard Bisht’s screams and rushed him to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial hospital, where he succumbed to the stab wounds during treatment. A case of murder was registered and investigators spoke to many people in the neighbourhood, some of whom had spotted the three boys wandering in the area at the time of the crime. The three were identified and apprehended, as they turned out to be juveniles, the police said.“Bisht’s wallet with his Aadhaar card and ₹700 cash, the knife used in the crime and the clothes they wore at the time of the crime and had blood spots, were recovered from them,” the DCP added.In another case, a 42-year-old man was stabbed to death allegedly by two men, including his nephew, over a personal dispute in south Delhi’s Govindpuri on Friday night. Both the suspects were caught on Saturday from Agra in Uttar Pradesh, where they were hiding after the crime.Police said the victim, Hari Kishan, was returning to his home in Transit Camp, Govindpuri, when his nephew Rahul, alias Ashu, and his friend Babu allegedly waylaid him in the lane. An altercation ensued between them during which Kishan allegedly tried to attack the two with an empty beer bottle.The two allegedly retaliated and stabbed him with a knife due to which he collapsed. The suspects fled while Kishan’s family members rushed him to Safdarjung hospital, where he was declared brought dead, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/45yearold-stabbed-to-death-in-sultanpuri-during-snatching-attempt-3-minors-apprehended-101624814647774.html
28-06-2021||World||Mixing vaccines gives good protection against Covid-19: UK study||A mix-and-match approach to Covid-19 vaccines - using different brands of jab for first and second doses - gives good protection against the pandemic virus, a UK study has found.The Com-Cov trial looked at the efficacy of either two doses of Pfizer, two of AstraZeneca, or one of them followed by the other.All combinations worked well, priming the immune system, the BBC quoted the study as saying on Monday.This knowledge could offer flexibility for vaccine rollout, the report quoted experts as saying.The UK's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there was no reason to change the current successful same dose vaccine schedules in the UK, however, given vaccines were in good supply and saving lives.But he says it might be something to look at in the future: "Mixing doses could provide us with even greater flexibility for a booster programme, while also supporting countries who have further to go with their vaccine rollouts, and who may be experiencing supply difficulties."Two doses are important to give the fullest protection and teach the body to make antibodies and T cells to block and kill the deadly virus.Some countries are already using mixed doses. Spain and Germany are offering the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines as a second dose to younger people who have already received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following concerns about rare but serious blood clots, rather than about efficacy.The Com-Cov study, which looked at giving the doses four weeks apart in 850 volunteers aged 50 and above, found that an AstraZeneca jab followed by Pfizer induced higher antibodies and T cell responses than Pfizer followed by AstraZeneca.Both of these mixes induced higher antibodies than two doses of AstraZeneca, the report said.The highest antibody response was seen after two doses of Pfizer, and the highest T cell response from AstraZeneca followed by Pfizer, it said.Lead investigator Prof Matthew Snape, from the University of Oxford, said the findings did not undermine the UK policy of giving people the same jab twice: "We already know that both standard schedules are very effective against severe disease and hospitalisations, including against the Delta variant when given at eight to 12 weeks apart."He said the new results showed mixed dose schedules were also effective, even though the interval of four weeks studied was shorter than the eight to 12-week schedule most commonly used in the UK. "This longer interval is known to result in a better immune response," he added. Mixed dose trial results for a 12-week jab interval will be available next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mixing-vaccines-gives-good-protection-against-covid-19-uk-study-101624903784227.html

28-06-2021||World||Wuhan lab scientist says no virus was made to infect people. Explains why||Danielle Anderson was working in what has become the world’s most notorious laboratory just weeks before the first known cases of Covid-19 emerged in central China. Yet, the Australian virologist still wonders what she missed.An expert in bat-borne viruses, Anderson is the only foreign scientist to have undertaken research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s BSL-4 lab, the first in mainland China equipped to handle the planet’s deadliest pathogens. Her most recent stint ended in November 2019, giving Anderson an insider’s perspective on a place that’s become a flashpoint in the search for what caused the worst pandemic in a century.The emergence of the coronavirus in the same city where institute scientists, clad head-to-toe in protective gear, study that exact family of viruses has stoked speculation that it might have leaked from the lab, possibly via an infected staffer or a contaminated object. China’s lack of transparency since the earliest days of the outbreak fueled those suspicions, which have been seized on by the US. That’s turned the quest to uncover the origins of the virus, critical for preventing future pandemics, into a geopolitical minefield.The work of the lab and the director of its emerging infectious diseases section—Shi Zhengli, a long-time colleague of Anderson’s dubbed ‘Batwoman’ for her work hunting viruses in caves—is now shrouded in controversy. The US has questioned the lab’s safety and alleged its scientists were engaged in contentious gain of function research that manipulated viruses in a manner that could have made them more dangerous.It’s a stark contrast to the place Anderson described in an interview with Bloomberg News, the first in which she’s shared details about working at the lab.Half-truths and distorted information have obscured an accurate accounting of the lab's functions and activities, which were more routine than how they’ve been portrayed in the media, she said.“It’s not that it was boring, but it was a regular lab that worked in the same way as any other high-containment lab,” Anderson said. “What people are saying is just not how it is.”Now at Melbourne’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Anderson began collaborating with Wuhan researchers in 2016, when she was scientific director of the biosafety lab at Singapore’s Duke-NUS Medical School. Her research—which focuses on why lethal viruses like Ebola and Nipah cause no disease in the bats in which they perpetually circulate—complemented studies underway at the Chinese institute, which offered funding to encourage international collaboration.A rising star in the virology community, Anderson, 42, says her work on Ebola in Wuhan was the realization of a life-long career goal. Her favorite movie is “Outbreak,” the 1995 film in which disease experts respond to a dangerous new virus—a job Anderson said she wanted to do. For her, that meant working on Ebola in a high-containment laboratory. Anderson’s career has taken her all over the world. After obtaining an undergraduate degree from Deakin University in Geelong, Australia, she worked as a lab technician at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, then returned to Australia to complete a PhD under the supervision of eminent virologists John Mackenzie and Linfa Wang. She did post-doctoral work in Montreal, before moving to Singapore and working again with Wang, who described Anderson as “very committed and dedicated,” and similar in personality to Shi. “They’re both very blunt with such high moral standards,” Wang said by phone from Singapore, where he’s the director of the emerging infectious diseases program at the Duke-NUS Medical School. “I’m very proud of what Danielle’s been able to do.”On the GroundAnderson was on the ground in Wuhan when experts believe the virus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, was beginning to spread. Daily visits for a period in late 2019 put her in close proximity to many others working at the 65-year-old research center. She was part of a group that gathered each morning at the Chinese Academy of Sciences to catch a bus that shuttled them to the institute about 20 miles away.As the sole foreigner, Anderson stood out, and she said the other researchers there looked out for her.“We went to dinners together, lunches, we saw each other outside of the lab,” she said.From her first visit before it formally opened in 2018, Anderson was impressed with the institute’s maximum biocontainment lab. The concrete, bunker-style building has the highest biosafety designation, and requires air, water and waste to be filtered and sterilized before it leaves the facility. There were strict protocols and requirements aimed at containing the pathogens being studied, Anderson said, and researchers underwent 45 hours of training to be certified to work independently in the lab.The induction process required scientists to demonstrate their knowledge of containment procedures and their competency in wearing air-pressured suits. “It’s very, very extensive,” Anderson said.Entering and exiting the facility was a carefully choreographed endeavor, she said. Departures were made especially intricate by a requirement to take both a chemical shower and a personal shower—the timings of which were precisely planned.Special DisinfectantsThese rules are mandatory across BSL-4 labs, though Anderson noted differences compared with similar facilities in Europe, Singapore and Australia in which she’s worked. The Wuhan lab uses a bespoke method to make and monitor its disinfectants daily, a system Anderson was inspired to introduce in her own lab. She was connected via a headset to colleagues in the lab’s command center to enable constant communication and safety vigilance—steps designed to ensure nothing went awry.However, the Trump administration’s focus in 2020 on the idea the virus escaped from the Wuhan facility suggested that something went seriously wrong at the institute, the only one to specialize in virology, viral pathology and virus technology of the some 20 biological and biomedical research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.Virologists and infectious disease experts initially dismissed the theory, noting that viruses jump from animals to humans with regularity. There was no clear evidence from within SARS-CoV-2’s genome that it had been artificially manipulated, or that the lab harbored progenitor strains of the pandemic virus. Political observers suggested the allegations had a strategic basis and were designed to put pressure on Beijing.And yet, China’s actions raised questions. The government refused to allow international scientists into Wuhan in early 2020 when the outbreak was mushrooming, including experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who were already in the region.Beijing stonewalled on allowing World Health Organization experts into Wuhan for more than a year, and then provided only limited access. The WHO team’s final report, written with and vetted by Chinese researchers, played down the possibility of a lab leak. Instead, it said the virus probably spread via a bat through another animal, and gave some credence to a favored Chinese theory that it could have been transferred via frozen food.Never SickChina’s obfuscation led outside researchers to reconsider their stance. Last month, 18 scientists writing in the journal Science called for an investigation into Covid-19’s origins that would give balanced consideration to the possibility of a lab accident. Even the director-general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the lab theory hadn’t been studied extensively enough.But it’s US President Joe Biden’s consideration of the idea—previously dismissed by many as a Trumpist conspiracy theory—that has given it newfound legitimacy. Biden called on America’s intelligence agencies last month to redouble their efforts in rooting out the genesis of Covid-19 after an earlier report, disclosed by the Wall Street Journal, claimed three researchers from the lab were hospitalized with flu-like symptoms in November 2019.Anderson said no one she knew at the Wuhan institute was ill toward the end of 2019. Moreover, there is a procedure for reporting symptoms that correspond with the pathogens handled in high-risk containment labs.“If people were sick, I assume that I would have been sick—and I wasn’t,” she said. “I was tested for coronavirus in Singapore before I was vaccinated, and had never had it.”Not only that, many of Anderson’s collaborators in Wuhan came to Singapore at the end of December for a gathering on Nipah virus. There was no word of any illness sweeping the laboratory, she said.“There was no chatter,” Anderson said. “Scientists are gossipy and excited. There was nothing strange from my point of view going on at that point that would make you think something is going on here.”The names of the scientists reported to have been hospitalized haven’t been disclosed. The Chinese government and Shi Zhengli, the lab’s now-famous bat-virus researcher, have repeatedly denied that anyone from the facility contracted Covid-19. Anderson’s work at the facility, and her funding, ended after the pandemic emerged and she focused on the novel coronavirus. ‘I’m Not Naive’It’s not that it’s impossible the virus spilled from there. Anderson, better than most people, understands how a pathogen can escape from a laboratory. SARS, an earlier coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2002 and killed more than 700 people, subsequently made its way out of secure facilities a handful of times, she said. If presented with evidence that such an accident spawned Covid-19, Anderson “could foresee how things could maybe happen,” she said. “I’m not naive enough to say I absolutely write this off.” And yet, she still believes it most likely came from a natural source. Since it took researchers almost a decade to pin down where in nature the SARS pathogen emerged, Anderson says she’s not surprised they haven’t found the “smoking gun” bat responsible for the latest outbreak yet. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is large enough that Anderson said she didn’t know what everyone was working on at the end of 2019. She is aware of published research from the lab that involved testing viral components for their propensity to infect human cells. Anderson is convinced no virus was made intentionally to infect people and deliberately released—one of the more disturbing theories to have emerged about the pandemic’s origins.Gain of FunctionAnderson did concede that it would be theoretically possible for a scientist in the lab to be working on a gain of function technique to unknowingly infect themselves and to then unintentionally infect others in the community. But there’s no evidence that occurred and Anderson rated its likelihood as exceedingly slim.Getting authorization to create a virus in this way typically requires many layers of approval, and there are scientific best practices that put strict limits on this kind of work. For example, a moratorium was placed on research that could be done on the 1918 Spanish Flu virus after scientists isolated it decades later.Even if such a gain of function effort got clearance, it’s hard to achieve, Anderson said. The technique is called reverse genetics.“It’s exceedingly difficult to actually make it work when you want it to work,” she said.Anderson’s lab in Singapore was one of the first to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from a Covid patient outside China and then to grow the virus. It was complicated and challenging, even for a team used to working with coronaviruses that knew its biological characteristics, including which protein receptor it targets. These key facets wouldn’t be known by anyone trying to craft a new virus, she said. Even then, the material that researchers study—the virus’s basic building blocks and genetic fingerprint—aren’t initially infectious, so they would need to culture significant amounts to infect people.Despite this, Anderson does think an investigation is needed to nail down the virus’s origin once and for all. She’s dumbfounded by the portrayal of the lab by some media outside China, and the toxic attacks on scientists that have ensued.One of a dozen experts appointed to an international taskforce in November to study the origins of the virus, Anderson hasn’t sought public attention, especially since being targeted by US extremists in early 2020 after she exposed false information about the pandemic posted online. The vitriol that ensued prompted her to file a police report. The threats of violence many coronavirus scientists have experienced over the past 18 months have made them hesitant to speak out because of the risk that their words will be misconstrued.The elements known to trigger infectious outbreaks—the mixing of humans and animals, especially wildlife—were present in Wuhan, creating an environment conducive for the spillover of a new zoonotic disease. In that respect, the emergence of Covid-19 follows a familiar pattern. What’s shocking to Anderson is the way it unfurled into a global contagion.“The pandemic is something no one could have imagined on this scale,” she said. Researchers must study Covid's calamitous path to determine what went wrong and how to stop the spread of future pathogens with pandemic potential.“The virus was in the right place at the right time and everything lined up to cause this disaster.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-lab-scientist-says-no-virus-was-made-to-infect-people-explains-why-101624901328409.html
28-06-2021||World||CCTV camera that caught Matt Hancock's affair removed, says Javid||The United Kingdom government has removed the mysterious CCTV camera that captured former health minister Matt Hancock who engaging and kissing an aide in the government's departmental office, successor Sajid Javid said on Monday. This comes two days after ex-health minister Matt Hancock was forced to resign for he broke Covid-19 guidance amid staunch opposition from Labour Party.Javid, UK's new health minister, was questioned about the secret device placed in Hancock's office as Cabinet ministers ordered a sweep of their offices. The UK government has moved to probe how was the camera placed inside the minister's office smoke alarm and how the footage was leaked in a security breach, forcing Hancock's exit from Boris-led government. "I haven't disabled the camera that you are talking about, but it has been disabled by the department,” Javid told reporters, as he began his new job at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).“I think for security it is just common sense… I don't think, as a general rule, there should be cameras in the secretary of state's office. I've never known that in the other five departments that I've run and I am not really sure why there was one here. But I am sure there will be more to this as the whole incident is investigated," said the Pakistani-origin politician who has previously held UK Cabinet posts as Home Secretary and Chancellor.In his letter of resignation to PM Johnson, Hancock said that the government owes “it to people who have sacrificed so much in this pandemic to be honest when we have let them down.”British PM Boris Johnson was under mounting pressure on Saturday to fire his health secretary after the admission that he broke Covid-19 guidelines by kissing an employee sparked accusations of blatant hypocrisy.The 42-year-old minister has been at the centre of the government's fight against the pandemic, routinely telling people to follow strict rules and even welcoming the resignation last year of a senior scientist who broke restrictions in a similar manner.British tabloids 'The Sun' has released photos and videos of the minister in an embrace and kissing his aide in an office at the Department of Health, evoking demands of resignation from the Opposition Labour Party which termed his position "hopelessly untenable".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cctv-camera-that-caught-uk-minister-matt-hancock-s-affair-removed-says-javid-101624894518226.html
28-06-2021||World||Pfizer, Moderna vaccines provide lasting protection: Study||Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s mRNA-based vaccines provide “persistent” and lasting protection for years from Covid-19, says a new study in Nature publication on Monday.“Our studies demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccination of humans induces a persistent GC (germinal centre) B cell response, enabling the generation of robust humoral immunity,” the authors said in an abstract of their study, referring to memory cells found in lymph nodes, where immune cells are educated to detect and fight the virus.Booster doses of these vaccines would probably not be needed as had been previously felt necessary, unless the virus evolves way beyond its current variants.Ali Ellebedy, an immunologist at Washington University in St. Louis who led the study, told The New York Times they did not look at the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, but he added he expected it to be less effective than the mRNA-based versions. Also not included, it appeared, was AstraZeneca, which retails in India as Covishield.But the good news for India, which is battling a devastating second wave of Covid-19 driven in part by the new Delta variant of SARS-CoV2, is that it is engaged in talks at the highest levels to find a way to authorise Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.Earlier research had indicated that only those who had survived Covid-19 infection and had been fully vaccinated acquired a persistent and lasting protection from the virus.After an infection, a specialised structure called a germinal centre forms in the lung, which serves as a school for memory B cells to recognise the virus. In vaccinated people, these germinal centres are formed in lymph nodes in the armpits.“Everyone always focuses on the virus evolving - this is showing that the B cells are doing the same thing,” Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, told the New York Times. “And it’s going to be protective against ongoing evolution of the virus, which is really encouraging.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-moderna-vaccines-provide-lasting-protection-study-101624899914092.html
28-06-2021||World||US Covid-19 cases hit new plateau as Delta variant rises||After declining fast for two months, the rate of Covid infections in the United States has leveled off since mid-June thanks to localized spikes in under-vaccinated regions of the country, data showed Monday.It comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to gain traction, now accounting for 35.6 percent of sequenced cases in the past two weeks, according to the covSpectrum tracker. Authorities have said it is poised to soon become the country's dominant strain.The seven-day-average of new daily cases has hovered at around 11,500 since June 16, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or about 3.5 per 100,000 people.A clear divide has emerged across the country, with cases rising rapidly in communities that have low rates of vaccination.For example, the city of Springfield in the midwestern state of Missouri is experiencing a surge of 36.8 new cases per 100,000, and has just 35 percent of its population vaccinated with one or more doses, a dashboard maintained by Covid ActNow showed.On the other hand, Burlington in the northeastern state of Vermont is seeing just 0.9 new cases per 100,000, and has 71 percent of its population vaccinated with one or more doses.Nationally, 54 percent of the United States' 332 million people have received one or more doses while 46.1 percent have had two doses, according to the CDC.The national immunization drive peaked in mid-April but has been declining since, with vaccine hesitancy much higher in states that lean Republican than those that predominantly vote for Democrats.Cases dropped steeply across the country from mid-April to the beginning of June, a period that coincided with spring weather and increased socialization outdoors.The summer heat however has brought more people indoors, where the primarily airborne respiratory illness mostly spreads. Air conditioning contributes by drying out the air and making conditions more favorable for the virus to remain viable.All of this spells danger for unvaccinated people, who are more exposed than ever in the face of the highly contagious Delta variant.According to research from Britain, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 88 percent effective in protecting against symptomatic disease from Delta, but just 33 percent after one dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-hit-new-plateau-as-delta-variant-rises-101624897958705.html
28-06-2021||World||'America Tirupati': US Hindu temple holds Maha Kumbhabhishekam||When throngs gathered to rededicate the oldest major Hindu temple in the United States, there was poignance -- prayers for continued recovery from the pandemic that struck many loved ones in India -- and the elation of coming together after more than a year of restrictions.And there was joy.Shouts of the divine name “Govinda!” rose Sunday from the crowd of worshippers at the Sri Venkateswara Temple, atop a steep hill just east of Pittsburgh. Dressed in festive saris and other traditional clothing, they gazed up toward a gopuram — an ornamented temple tower whose white, newly restored facade gleamed brilliantly in the mid-day sun.High above, priests stood on scaffolding and lifted ceremonial urns, pouring holy waters onto golden spires atop the gopuram.They repeated the ritual on three smaller towers at the center of the temple. There were drumbeats and the horn-like fanfares of a nathaswaram, a traditional Indian reed instrument, and floral petals soon came wafting down on the devotees from a helicopter overhead.Known as Maha Kumbhabhishekam, a reference to the sprinkling of holy water from ceremonial urns, the festival is traditionally held at Hindu temples once every 12 years to reharmonize and boost the spiritual energies of the temple and its deities.Several hundred devotees from surrounding states arrived throughout Sunday, culminating five days of prayers, chants and other rituals at outdoor fire altars. More than 20 priests took part, wearing yellow or saffron vestments around their waists; most were visiting from other North American temples.The Sri Venkateswara Temple is much smaller than its massive prototype, a temple by the same name in the southern Indian city of Tirupati. Still, this Pittsburgh suburb has become a pilgrimage destination for Hindus throughout North America and a landmark in the growing landscape of Hinduism in America. There are now hundreds of temples across the country, and about 1 percent of American adults now identify as Hindu, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center report.Kalathur Raghu, one of the temple’s founding members, recalled a much smaller ceremony on a chilly November day in 1976 to dedicate the new temple. “I think none of us expected to get to this level when we started,” he said.The temple is dedicated to Venkateswara, considered an incarnation of Vishnu, a deity associated with protection and preservation who is also known by Govinda. The stone murti, or statue, of Venkateswara stands at the holiest spot in the temple. Images of other deities stand nearby, such as those of Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity, and Bhoodevi, goddess of the earth.Devotees streamed into the temple Sunday afternoon to offer devotions to the deities at their newly rededicated shrines. There, priests chanted and bathed the statues in water, milk, honey and other traditional offerings, while devotees cupped their hands and received priests’ blessings.A Maha Kumbhabhishekam has both practical and spiritual significance.The ceremony is typically held every 12 years because it is believed that over time, the spiritual energies at a temple need to be ceremonially reharmonized. (In the earlier years of the Sri Venkateswara Temple, the intervals between ceremonies were longer than 12 years.)On a practical level, the temple is temporarily deconsecrated in the weeks leading up to the ceremony, enabling repairs in areas normally off-limits to all but priests. At the Sri Venkateswara Temple, contractors renovated everything from ventilation to weather-worn ornamentation.Volunteers also prepared for months. In days before the festival, women in saris wove garlands from thousands of mango leaves and carnations to decorate the tent and other festival areas.“For one and a half years we were miserable” during the pandemic, said Nagamani Kasi, the temple’s joint treasurer. “We didn’t get to do anything. … This is like going back to normal and enjoying it. It’s good timing.”The festival also included a large distribution of food to a nearby health center, which followed several other donations for pandemic relief locally and to India.The ceremonies began officially last Wednesday in a tent in the temple parking lot.Priests took turns chanting from the Vedas, four ancient scriptural texts, and tending to sacred fires at seven altars. Smaller idols of Venkateswara and other deities stood in front.The scent of incense and woodsmoke mingled with the humid summer air as the amplified voices of the priests rang out for hours each day. The priests chanted at times in unison, at other times in a call-and-response led by the clarion voice of Sri Venkateswara Temple head priest Samudrala Venkatacharyulu.At various points, priests led devotees in processions around the tent.The prayers are not just on behalf of the devotees but that the “whole universe be healthy and happy” and that the coronavirus “go away soon,” said Venkatacharyulu. He arrived here in 1982 at age 21 from the mother temple in India for a two-year assignment, which has stretched to nearly 40 and counting, in what he calls the “America Tirupati.”Hinduism historically had a tiny following in the United States, but its American profile grew following a 1965 congressional act that opened the doors to more immigrants from Asia and elsewhere.Pittsburgh drew Indian immigrants to engineering, medical and educational careers, and the Hindu community began to coalesce by the early 1970s, when a small group of children met in a theater basement to study classical Indian dance. “We would go and do a little prayer and then start the dance class,” recalled the instructor, Mani Manoharan.Community leaders concluded “we have to have a temple” and mobilized funds and other volunteer efforts, recalled Raghu. The Sri Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati contributed funds and sent craftsmen and priests to help.The Pittsburgh region’s Indian population was “not a large community at that time,” Raghu said, “but we had the passion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hindu-temple-holds-maha-kumbhabhishekam-sees-timely-rite-of-rejuvenation-101624897676280.html
28-06-2021||World||England’s pandemic ordeal set to end in next 21 days, says UK PM Johnson||England is “very likely” to be freed from pandemic restrictions on July 19, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, as he predicted the country is just three weeks away from returning to “life before Covid.”Despite a surge in infections of the new delta variant, hospitalization and death rates remain relatively low as the UK’s vaccine program progresses, he said.Johnson confirmed there will not be an early release from England’s social-distancing rules on July 5, which was an option if data had been good enough. He said it is “sensible” to take a few more weeks to analyze the infection patterns and deliver more second vaccine doses before lifting the curbs.“With every day that goes by it’s clearer to me and all our scientific advisers that we’re very likely to be in a position on July 19 to say that really is the terminus, and we can go back to life as it was before Covid as far as possible,” Johnson told reporters Monday.Entertainment and hospitality businesses including nightclubs and theaters have been shut due to the need to operate social distancing rules.While many bosses will welcome Johnson’s upbeat assessment, others are likely to remember they have been disappointed before, after plans to lift the limits on social gatherings were delayed by a month.Under the delayed timetable, all legal rules on social distancing are due to be scrapped from July 19, allowing nightclubs to reopen for the first time since March 2020. Audience limits will also be dropped for theater, concert and sports venues under the plan.New Health Secretary Sajid Javid will set out the government’s latest position in more detail in Parliament on Monday.Even though domestic rules are set to be eased, Britons face a harder time traveling overseas, as other countries impose curbs on arrivals from the UK in response to the rise in the delta variant. The authorities in Portugal, Spain and Hong Kong all announced new restrictions on British travelers.Johnson said he and Javid had spoken and reviewed the pandemic data on Sunday and concluded the best option would be to wait a “few more weeks” to deliver another 5 million vaccine doses before easing the remaining rules for England. Separate rules are in place in other parts of the UK.Both Javid and the prime minister say they want to take a cautious approach to lifting restrictions so that curbs do not need to be reimposed again.LockdownsThe government has put England into a hard lockdown three times since the pandemic began, after relaxations in the rules led cases to surge.Johnson said that while data showed a significant rise in cases of the new delta variant -- with coronavirus infections at the highest level since February -- the link between cases, hospitalizations and deaths has been “interrupted.” That’s an “encouraging” sign that the vaccine program is working, Johnson said.Johnson tried to brush aside questions about the scandal that prompted Matt Hancock to quit as health secretary on Saturday after admitting he broke social-distancing rules.Asked why he hadn’t fired the minister when the story broke, Johnson suggested he had in fact concluded Hancock should go after learning of the details on Friday.That prompted questions over whether Hancock resigned or was removed. Johnson’s spokesman later insisted the minister had quit voluntarily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/englands-pandemic-ordeal-set-to-end-in-next-21-days-says-uk-pm-johnson-101624889129496.html

Sayed Zulfi Bukhari, a British Pakistani businessman who served as Khan’s special assistant on overseas Pakistanis till May this year, conveyed a message from the Pakistani premier to Israeli foreign ministry officials and another message from Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa to then Israeli spy chief Yossi Cohen, Israel Hayom newspaper reported. The report said Bukhari, who lives in the UK, arrived at Ben Gurion airport from Islamabad on a connecting flight to London in the last week of November, taking advantage of his British passport. He travelled to Tel Aviv for the meetings and the Pakistan-Israel contacts were the outcome of “heavy pressure from the UAE”, the report added.Bukhari denied the report in a tweet. “DID NOT go to Israel. Funny bit is Pakistani paper says I went to Israel based on ‘Israeli news source’ & Israeli paper says I went to Israel based on a ‘Pakistani source’ – wonder who this imaginative Pakistani source is,” he tweeted, referring to reports in the Pakistani and Israeli media about the matter. “Apparently, I’m the only one who was kept out of the loop,” Bukhari added. Also Read | Imran Khan calling bin Laden ‘martyr’ was ‘slip of tongue’, says Pak minister In December 2020, Israel Hayom had reported about a secret visit to Israel by a “senior adviser to the leader of a large Muslim-majority country” despite the two countries having no diplomatic relations. At the time, the newspaper didn’t name the Muslim country involved. On Monday, Israel Hayom identified the country as Pakistan after getting clearance from the Israeli military censor. Monday’s reported cited a source in Islamabad. The visit to Tel Aviv by the Pakistani official came against the backdrop of key Muslim countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco normalising relations with Israel and a debate within Pakistan’s political and diplomatic circles about re-evaluating the country’s position on Israel. However, Khan had said in an interview in August last year that Pakistan “cannot ever accept Israel as long as Palestinians are not given their rights and there is no just settlement”. Khan had appointed Bukhari as his special assistant on overseas Pakistanis and human resource development a month after assuming office in September 2018. Bukhari, who had the status of a minister of state, resigned from the post on May 17 this year following allegations that he had illegally benefited from changes made to the Rawalpindi Ring Road project. Bukhari had denied allegations that he had received financial benefits because his land was located near the project. Israel Hayom’s report would suggest this was the first formal contact between Pakistan and Israel since the era of former military dictator Pervez Musharraf. At Musharraf’s initiative and with backing from Pakistan’s ally Turkey, then Pakistani foreign minister Khurshid Kasuri met his Israeli counterpart Silvan Shalom in the Turkish city of Istanbul on September 1, 2005. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Pakistan-Israel contacts in 2005 had not led to any substantial engagement and had subsequently fizzled out. In a statement issued by the Israeli foreign ministry in 2005, Shalom had described his meeting with Kasuri as “historic” and said Israeli hoped it would “herald the beginning of an open and mutually beneficial relationship” between the two countries. Shalom also thanked Musharraf “for his courage in promoting peace and moderation in our region”.There was no official word from the Pakistan government on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-s-aide-made-secret-visit-to-israelreport-101624872674038.html
28-06-2021||World||China operationalises Baihetan hydro project, biggest since Three Gorges||Two units of the giant Baihetan hydropower plant, said to be the largest one under construction globally, on the Yangtze river in southwest China generated electricity for the first time on Monday, state media reported.The project’s first two 1-gigawatt (GW) turbines will go into formal operation after a three-day trial that began on Monday, national broadcaster, China Central Television (CCTV) said.Built by the China Three Gorges Corporation - operator of the world’s largest hydropower plant in the world, the Three Gorges Dam - the Baihetan is located on the border between the southwestern provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.It is on the Jinsha, the upstream section of the Yangtze river, the longest in Asia.The dam has been operationalised in the run-up to the 100th anniversary of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) on July 1, state media reported, adding that it was a symbol of how efficient CPC is in planning and completing large-scale projects.“With a total installed capacity of 16 million kilowatts, the hydropower station is equipped with 16 hydro-generating units, each with a capacity of 1 million kilowatts, the largest single-unit capacity in the world,” the Xinhua news agency reported on Monday. That will make it second in size after the Three Gorges Dam, opened in 2003 on the Yangtze, with 22.5 million kilowatts of generating capacity, the Associated Press reported.The trial operation is limited to generators 1 and 14 while the remaining 14 generators of the hydropower station are expected to be put into use by July 2022.One of China’s biggest and most challenging engineering projects - as it had to tackle a set of complex geological and technical issues with a dam height of 289m - it has taken only four years to build, state media reported.Earlier this month, all 12 units of the Wudongde hydropower station, the world’s seventh-largest, on Jinsha river near the Yunnan and Sichuan border were also operationalised.With a total installed capacity of 10.2 million kilowatts, the Wudongde hydropower station is a key project in China’s west-east power transmission programme.The station’s construction began in late 2015, and it started to generate electricity in late June last year.By the middle of June, the station had produced 24.5 billion kWh of electricity, equal to that generated by around 7.68 million tonnes of standard coal, Wang Jintao, head of the Wudongde electricity plant under China Three Gorges Corporation, told Xinhua news agency.In its latest five-year plan covering the period of 2021-25, Sichuan province aims to complete the construction of 10 hydropower plants and start building another seven.Environmental groups have criticised the large-scale damming of the Yangtze and its tributaries because of concerns the over-engineering of the river has destroyed major habitats and damaged natural flood plains, Reuters news agency said in a report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-operationalises-baihetan-hydro-project-biggest-since-three-gorges-101624871112696.html

28-06-2021||World||Explained: Why Kim Jong Un’s weight issue is a talking point across the world||North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un’s weight has always been a talking point around the world. He disappeared from the public eyes for nearly a month, and resurfaced in June, but this time, a lot slimmer.The latest buzz around Kim’s weight started after an unnamed resident of North Korean capital Pyongyang said on tightly controlled state media that people “were most heartbroken when they saw the emaciated figure of the respected comrade general”. The man added that the people’s tears came out naturally.The report came out after Kim returned on June 4, looking noticeably thinner. The media in South Korea, which keeps a hawkish eye on what is happening inside the neighbouring country, showed the watch strap tightly tied around the waist of the North Korean leader, which, it said, appeared thinner.The heart issues of Kim familyThe issue is a talking point as the world looks for clues about his grip on the country, especially since his family has a history of heart disease.Kim (at 5ft 8) weighed over 140 kg a few months ago. After his latest appearance, the South Korean media is claiming that he lost around 20 kg. The 37-year-old is a chain smoker, fuelling further speculation about his health, given the fact that he has not officially chosen his successor.The father of Kim, who took over as North Korea’s supreme leader in 2011, died of a massive heat attack. Kim Jong II became the leader of North Korea in 1994 after his father passed away due to heart attack. Kim Il-Sung had ruled the country since he founded it in 1948.The reason for the world’s concernNorth Korea’s nuclear weapons programme has been an intractable problem for the West, especially the United States, given the fact that the tiny country has severed its ties from the world.The hermit country imposed further curbs due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), with Kim claiming a few weeks ago that there is not a single case of the infection in North Korea.The US wants to tackle North Korea’s nuclear programme, and the future of the country after Kim Jong Un.Kim’s disappearanceBefore the month-long disappearance, Kim was away from the public eye for six weeks in 2014. That was the longest he stayed away from the public gaze.When he came back, Kim was seen walking with the help of a cane, raising speculation that he was suffering from gout.Early last year, speculation about Kim’s health exploded after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15, only to reappear in public in early May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-kim-jong-un-s-weight-issue-is-a-talking-point-across-the-world-101624851813474.html

It did not disclose whether it believed anyone was killed or injured but officials said assessments were ongoing.The strikes came at the direction of President Joe Biden, the second time he has ordered retaliatory strikes against Iran-backed militia since taking office five months ago. Biden last ordered limited strikes in Syria in February, that time in response to rocket attacks in Iraq."As demonstrated by this evening's strikes, President Biden has been clear that he will act to protect U.S. personnel," the Pentagon said in a statement.The strikes came even as Biden's administration is looking to potentially revive a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. The strikes appear to show Biden's efforts to compartmentalize defensive strikes to protect American personnel, while simultaneously engaging Tehran in diplomacy.His critics say Iran cannot be trusted and point to the drone attacks as further evidence that Iran and its proxies will never accept a U.S. military presence in Iraq or Syria.Biden and the White House declined comment on the strikes on Sunday.U.S. officials believe Iran is behind a ramp-up in drone attacks and periodic rocket fire against U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq, where the U.S. military has been helping Baghdad combat the remnants of Islamic State.Two U.S. officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said Iran-backed militias carried out at least five drone attacks against facilities used by U.S. and coalition personnel in Iraq since April.The Pentagon said the facilities targeted were used by Iran-backed militia including Kataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada.One of the facilities targeted was used to launch and recover the drones, a defense official said.The U.S. military carried out strikes with F-15 and F-16 aircraft, officials said, adding the pilots made it back from the mission safely."We assess each strike hit the intended targets," one of the officials told Reuters.Iraq's government is struggling to deal with militias ideologically aligned with Iran which are accused of rocket fire against U.S. forces and of involvement in killing peaceful pro-democracy activists.Earlier in June, Iraq released Iran-aligned militia commander Qasim Muslih, who was arrested in May on terrorism-related charges, after authorities found insufficient evidence against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-carries-out-air-strikes-against-iran-backed-militia-in-iraq-syria-101624840230642.html

Despite that, in much of Europe and the US, curbs on daily life are easing as vaccination programmes bear fruit.Moscow on Sunday recorded 144 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, a day after Saint Petersburg set the previous highest figure. Russia has seen an explosion of new infections since mid-June driven by the Delta variant.The Delta variant is also feeding fresh outbreaks in Southeast Asia and Australia where authorities have brought back or prolonged restrictions. More than 5mn Sydney residents endured their first full day of a two-week lockdown on Sunday to contain the variant. Restaurants, bars and cafes were shuttered and stay-at-home orders were issued.More than 110 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Sydney since a driver for an international flight crew tested positive in June for the Delta variant.Australia’s northern city of Darwin also entered a separate snap 48-hour lockdown on Sunday after a handful of cases were linked to a coronavirus outbreak on a remote gold mine.Similar spikes in infections have recently been seen across Southeast Asia. Thailand will from Monday reimpose restrictions on restaurants, construction sites and gatherings in the capital Bangkok as it tries to contain a wave of infections. The country’s latest wave kicked off in April when a cluster was found in upscale Bangkok clubs.Indonesia set a new record for daily coronavirus cases on Sunday with a tally of more than 21,000, as hospitals are flooded with patients in Jakarta.The Bangladesh government said it would impose a new national lockdown from Monday, with offices shut for a week and only medical-related transport allowed.The announcement prompted tens of thousands of migrant workers to desert the capital Dhaka, where the lockdown will cut off their revenue sources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-deaths-in-moscow-spike-asia-pacific-sees-curbs-return-101624836380362.html
28-06-2021||World||Florida condo collapse: Families frustrated by slow pace of rescue ops||Rescuers digging through the rubble of a Florida beachfront condo sought to reassure families that they were doing as much as possible to find missing loved ones, but the crews said they needed to work carefully for the best chance of uncovering survivors.As the death toll rose Sunday to nine, relatives grew increasingly desperate for news and worried about the slow progress and dwindling hopes. No one has been pulled alive from the pile since Thursday, hours after the collapse. Some family members were taken by bus Sunday to a location near the site after relatives frustrated with the pace of rescue efforts demanded to visit the scene.“My daughter is 26 years old, in perfect health. She could make it out of there,” one mother told rescuers during a weekend meeting with family members. A video of the meeting was posted by Instagram user Abigail Pereira.“It’s not enough,” continued the mother, who was among relatives who pushed authorities to bring in experts from other countries to help. “Imagine if your children were in there.”More than 150 people are still unaccounted for in Surfside, and authorities and loved ones fear the toll will go much higher.Scores of rescue workers remained on the massive pile of rubble, searching for survivors but so far finding only bodies and human remains.In a meeting with families Saturday evening, people moaned and wept as Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah explained why he could not answer their repeated questions about how many victims they had found.“It’s not necessarily that we’re finding victims, OK? We’re finding human remains,” Jadallah said, according to the video posted on Instagram.Every time crews find remains, they clean the area and remove the remains. They work with a rabbi to ensure any religious rituals are done properly, Jadallah said.“So the question is, is why is things taking so long?” he said, “What we’re doing is making sure that everything is followed to a ‘T.’”Authorities said their efforts are still a search-and-rescue operation. Alan Cominsky, chief of the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department, said they are holding out hope of finding someone alive, but they must be slow and methodical.“The debris field is scattered throughout, and it’s compact, extremely compact,” he said.Debris must be stabilized and shored up as they go.“If there is a void space, we want to make sure we’re given every possibility of a survivor. That’s why we can’t just go in and move things erratically, because that’s going to have the worst outcome possible,” he said.In meetings with authorities, family members repeatedly pushed rescuers to do more. One asked why they could not surgically remove the largest pieces of cement with cranes, to try to uncover bigger voids where survivors might be found.“There’s not giant pieces that we can easily surgically remove," replied Maggie Castro, of the fire rescue agency, who described herself as “one of the people out there attempting to find your family members.”“They’re not big pieces. Pieces are crumbled, and they’re being held together by the rebar that’s part of the construction. So if we try to lift that piece, even as carefully, those pieces that are crumbling can fall off the sides and disturb the pile,” Castro said.She said they try to cut rebar in strategic places and remove large pieces, but that they have to remove them in a way that nothing will fall onto the pile.“We are doing layer by layer," Castro said. “It doesn’t stop. It’s all day. All night.”Rescuers were also using a microwave radar device developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab and the Department of Homeland Security that “sees” through up to eight inches of solid concrete, according to Adrian Garulay, CEO of Spec Ops Group, which sells them. The suitcase-sized device can detect human respiration and heartbeats and was being deployed Sunday by a seven-member search-and-rescue team from Mexico’s Jewish community.But as the work dragged on, family members grew desperate. Some asked to visit the site so they could shout messages to their loved ones, “so they can hear our voices.” On Sunday afternoon, relatives were driven to a location next to the site as crews continued their work.TV cameras showed two buses pull up and groups of relatives step off. They walked to an area near the scene, where officials said they could observe and have a moment of reflection.A fire in the rubble pile slowed rescue efforts earlier in the weekend, but Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said it was suppressed Saturday.She said six to eight teams are actively searching the pile at any given time, with hundreds of team members on standby ready to rotate in. She said teams have worked around the clock since Thursday, and there was no lack of personnel.Teams are also working with engineers and sonar to make sure the rescuers are safe.“We need to be sure that the pile does not fall on them. It does not fall on any possible survivors and we are diligently pursuing that as we do our work,” she said.Crews spent the night digging a trench that stretches 125 feet, 20 feet across and 40 feet deep, which, she said, allowed them to find more bodies and human remains.Earl Tilton, who runs a search-and-rescue consulting firm in North Carolina, said the rescuers in Miami-Dade County were doing an “outstanding job.” Rushing into the rubble without careful planning and execution would injure or kill rescuers and the people they are trying to save, said Tilton, who runs Lodestar Professional Services in Hendersonville, North Carolina.“I understand the families’ concerns on this. If it was my family member, I would want everyone in there pulling rubble away as fast as humanly possible,” Tilton said. “But moving the wrong piece of debris at the wrong time could cause it to fall on them and crush them.”During past urban rescues, rescuers have found survivors as long as a week past the initial catastrophe, Tilton said.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis praised the search teams as being “some of the best in the business.”“I’d hope that none of these things would ever happen anywhere, but if something like this happens, the people you would want are Miami-Dade search and rescue," DeSantis said during a Sunday news conference. "These teams have gone all over the world. These are the people that you want. And they’ve been there within minutes, and it’s been nonstop.”Authorities also sought to assure family members directly that the rescuers were well qualified, telling them during a Saturday meeting that some rescuers had worked on search-and-rescue operations after the Oklahoma City bombing, at the World Trade Center after the 9/11 attacks and following the Haiti earthquake.After remains are found, they are sent to the medical examiner. Authorities are gathering DNA samples from family members to aid in identification. Late Saturday, four of the victims were identified as Stacie Dawn Fang, 54; Antonio Lozano, 83; Gladys Lozano, 79; and Manuel LaFont, 54.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-condo-collapse-families-frustrated-by-slow-pace-of-rescue-ops-101624827475051.html
28-06-2021||World||Bangladesh: At least 7 dead, dozens injured in explosion in Dhaka||At least seven people were killed and dozens wounded in an explosion in Bangladesh capital Dhaka late on Sunday with authorities initially suspecting it to have been caused by gas cylinder blasts.“So far, we came to know seven people were killed in the explosion,” Dhaka’s police commissioner Shafiqul Islam told newspersons at the scene at Moghbazar area adding that the explosion damaged seven buildings and three passenger buses.Fire Brigade chief Brigadier General Sajjad Hossain said primary evidence suggested gas cylinder blasts caused the explosion but “we are yet to know how it actually occurred”.“There were gas cylinders at a restaurant at the ground floor of a nearby building and air-conditioners at a showroom upstairs while there were gas cylinders as well at the road construction site at the scene... investigations have been launched,” Hossain said.TV channels reported dozens of wounded, mostly bus passengers and passersby, being treated at three hospitals where doctors said many of them received severe burn injuries.According to residents in the neighbourhood, the explosion rocked the part of the city spreading panic while television footage showed broken pillars, concrete and glass shards strewn across the street at the scene in the central part of the country's capital.“I was on a bus when the explosion occurred. I jumped out of it through a narrow window of the vehicle, initially thinking the bus gas cylinder exploded... never experienced such a big explosion in my life,” 50-year-old Tajul Islam, who received injuries on his waist and complained of hearing impairment due to the explosion, told PTI.Another witness said he saw a fireball go over his head and the explosion turned everything dark and smoky in his vicinity while pieces of glass started to shower from above.“The sound was so huge... it scared everyone,” he told a TV channel.According to witnesses, soon after the explosion the buses and cars crashed into one another while panic-gripped passengers struggled to come out of the vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-at-least-7-dead-dozens-injured-in-explosion-in-dhaka-101624817665852.html

The case has been filed before the court of a chief judicial magistrate in Muzaffarpur.The complainant, Tamanna Hashmi, alleged a "conspiracy" in rising prices of petrol and diesel, while underlining that the price of crude oil is quite low. Hashmi further alleged that the prices of petrol have left the people of the country "terrorised" and "enraged".He has sought trial against Pradhan under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). These include Sections 420 (fraud), 295 and 295 (A) pertaining to deliberate malicious acts and 511 (attempt to commit an offence).

Nine people have been confirmed killed, officials have said.Vishal Patel, 42, his wife Bhavna Patel, 38, and their 1-year-old daughter Aishani Patel are believed to be among the missing, their niece Sarina Patel told CNN, adding that Bhavna Patel is four months pregnant.Sarina said she last spoke to her family on Father's Day."I had actually called them to tell them I had just booked a flight to come visit because they've been asking me to come to see their home and to meet their daughter. I haven't met her due to the pandemic," she said on Friday.They were home at the time the collapse took place, she said. "We have tried calling them countless times and there's just been no answers, text messages, nothing. They haven't contacted anybody," she said.Bhavna is a British and US citizen, the British media reported.Umma Kannayan, a family friend of the Patels, told the BBC that they were a "very loving" family who were closely involved in their religious community."Aishani was like the little baby of the temple," she said. "It feels like you've lost a part of yourself."She said she was waiting with the Patel family's relatives for news, but that "not much information has been shared" about the victims."I think all of us, the family included, and the folks that are very closely associated with them [at temple] would want to know the list of survivors currently present," she said. "Perhaps from there some hope either might be given or might be shattered, but some names out there would be very helpful for all."Meanwhile, the painstaking search for survivors is continuing as families waiting for news are increasingly fearing the worst. Some prayed for a miracle. Others have already begun to speak about their loved ones in the past tense.As of Sunday, at least nine have been confirmed dead and more than 150 people are still unaccounted for, authorities said, the USA Today reported.On 24 June, a building at the Champion Towers South Condo, around seven miles away from Miami beach, partially collapsed leaving at least five dead and 156 missing. Emergency officials are asking people to contact them if they have relatives unaccounted for.A state of emergency has been declared by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.The number of people unaccounted for is 159, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava told reporters Friday -- up from the figure of 99 that officials gave Thursday afternoon, CNN reported.Those 159 people "have been identified as possibly being on the site. So those are people that maybe live there, but we don't know whether they were there at the time," the mayor said at a news conference on Friday afternoon in Surfside.Numerous search and rescue personnel have been scouring the rubble, including from the surface, with search dogs, sonar and cameras.Structural engineers also have been shoring up other places -- such as areas near a parking garage underneath the rubble -- to allow crews to tunnel underneath with light machinery.The building's residents reflected South Florida's international and cultural mix, with affluent families from Argentina, Paraguay and Colombia and a tight-knit Jewish community.President Joe Biden on Friday approved an emergency declaration for the state, making federal aid available to Florida.The cause of the partial collapse of the building is not known.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indianamerican-family-among-over-150-missing-after-building-collapse-in-us-101624896414702.html

The site was shut for the visitors for the last two months due to strict Covid-19 restrictions.The visitors are allowed to visit the site in Sagar taluk of Shivamogga district from 10am to 5pm, the government order said. It, however, asked the visitors to follow Covid appropriate behaviour and warned of strict action against violators.The tourism department decided to open the Jog falls after heavy rains in the catchment areas of the Sharavathi river in Uttara Kannada and Shivamogga districts. The Sharavathi river falls at a place called Gerusoppa-Jog from a height of 253 meters, and gets segmented into four cascades namely Raja, Rani, Rocket, and Roarer. Due to heavy rainfall, all the four cascades are gushing forth aplenty, and offering a bewitching sight, the tourism department said.Directions and timings to visit the falls will also be displayed at the intersection of Honnavar-Sagar road on National Highway 66, tourism department officials said.The state tourism department of Shivamogga district has made adequate arrangements for complying with Covid-19 regulations. A special outpost has been created just outside the viewing area. There are sanitiser spray facilities, strict vigil to ensure wearing of masks and placards reminding the maintenance of social distancing.Following the decision to open the site, local shop owners have also sought permission to open the shops in the vicinity of the falls. Few of the eateries and souvenir shops have been allowed to open from Tuesday, the Sagar taluk officials stated. But all these shops will function in adherence to the standard operating protocols and the local Covid lockdown timings.The state tourism department sources said that they expect the footfalls to increase by the weekend. The tourism department officials informed that other heritage sites like Belur-Halebid, Aihole, Pattadakal, will be opened for the public later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-opens-jog-falls-after-two-month-closure-due-to-covid-19-restrictions-101624889336787.html
28-06-2021||India||10-month gap between AstraZeneca vaccine doses effective, 3rd booster shot ups immunity: Study||The human body's immune response to the AstraZeneca Plc Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be more effective if the gap between two doses is increased to about 10 months, a study by the University of Oxford published on Monday showed. Additionally, a third shot can push up the antibody levels, even more, said the study conducted on the vaccine now known as Vaxzevria.The study showed that an extended gap between the doses increased the level of protective antibodies. For the third shot, when given the first time after six months post the second dose, the booster was found to have induced a strong response and increased activity against coronavirus variants, the researchers found.Governments around the world are faced with severe vaccine shortages amid a race to fully vaccinate their population against the infectious disease which has killed at least 3,925,816 people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to the AFP.At least 181,026,780 cases of coronavirus have been registered. The World Health Organization estimates that the pandemic's overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records, due to the excess mortality that is directly and indirectly linked to Covid-19.In the last 24 hours, a total of 6,743 new deaths and 325,186 new cases were recorded worldwide.The countries with the highest new deaths were India with 979 new deaths, followed by Brazil with 739 and Colombia with 664.Some countries are also trying to tackle questions on booster shots in a bid to avoid overburdening the hospitals in the coming months of winter.The study by Oxford is likely to assist countries in their vaccine roll-out planning. Most nations have recommended a gap of 4 weeks to 12 weeks between AstraZeneca vaccines currently.Officials said this study will aid the world's response against the viral disease.“This is about preparedness,” Andrew Pollard, lead investigator on the Oxford vaccine trials, said at a press briefing Monday."This data show we can boost responses giving another dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine and that’s really important. More research on the duration of immunity from two doses and protection against variants would help determine whether booster doses are really needed," Pollard said.What the study foundThe study found that antibodies induced after a single dose survived to some extent after one year. Still, after 180 days the levels were half those seen at the 28-day peak. A second dose increased antibody levels between four- and 18-fold by one month after the shot, however.Volunteers in the latest study were drawn from Oxford’s original early and late-stage trials for the vaccine last year. Thirty participants who only received a single dose in the trial were given a second one about 10 months after the first. An additional 90 participants from those studies received a third dose in March this year. All volunteers were between the ages of 18 and 55, reflecting the recruitment age at that stage of the trials last year.More than half a billion doses of the Astra-Oxford vaccine have already been sent to 168 countries, according to the researchers.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10month-gap-between-astrazeneca-vaccine-doses-effective-3rd-booster-shot-ups-immunity-study-101624883551348.html

Dr Paul also said the government is hoping that the decision will come soon, according to news agency PTI.Covaxin is one of the three vaccines which are currently being used in India for inoculation of people against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The vaccine is developed by Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company Bharat Biotech in association with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Serum Institute of India's Covishield and Russia's Sputnik V are the other two vaccines which have been administered to Indian citizens so far.The lack of endorsement from WHO has been hampering travel plans for individuals as many countries are only accepting vaccines approved by the public health body.On June 22, the vaccine manufacturer said that Covaxin has shown the efficacy of 77.8% in phase-3 of the medical trial on 25,800 subjects. The positive findings of the trial are likely to help the firm secure an EUL from the WHO.Earlier, Bharat Biotech also expressed confidence in getting the UN body's approval based on "its experience of getting its other vaccines prequalified by WHO." It also said that emergency approval is expected during July-September. The manufacturer has also claimed that around 90 per cent of the required documents have already been submitted to WHO and the remaining will be sent in July.In June, the company also held meeting pre-submission meeting with the WHO.In India, the vaccine received emergency approval in January this year. It was given "restricted use in an emergency situation in the public interest", which raised questions and was also seen as contributing to vaccine hesitancy that marked the early stages of India's vaccination drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hopefully-soon-niti-aayog-s-vk-paul-on-who-emergency-approval-for-covaxin-101624886573040.html

The issue has multiple dimensions and we are trying to find an agreed way forward at the earliest, Paul said in a weekly press briefing.The Covid-19 task force chief said that the government is trying to expedite the progress in every possible way.This comes almost a week after US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer said it is in the "final stages" of getting approval for its Covid-19 vaccine in India.Pfizer chief executive officer (CEO) Albert Bourla said he hopes the company will finalize an agreement with the Indian government soon."Pfizer now in final stages to get approval for Covid-19 vaccine in India. I hope very soon we will finalize an agreement with the government," Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said at the 15th Annual BioPharma and Healthcare Summit.The vaccine was developed by Pfizer in partnership with the German firm BioNtech. It has a very high efficacy of over 90 per cent in preventing the infection.India is still at the stage where indemnity issues need to be sorted out with respect to approving the vaccines made by foreign companies.Paul also said the process of getting Bharat Biotech's Covaxin Emergency Use Listing (EUL) certificate from the World Health Organisation (WHO) is proceeding well.At present, India is using three Covid-19 vaccines, Covaxin by Bharat Biotech, Covishield by Serum Institute of India (SII) and Russia's Sputnik V, for vaccinating people against the coronavirus disease.Drug major Dr Reddy's Laboratories on Monday announced the commercial launch of Covid-19 treatment drug, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), at a maximum retail price of ₹990 per sachet.The company will supply the drug to major government as well as private hospitals across India, Dr Reddy's said in a regulatory filing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-discussing-ways-to-approve-pfizer-moderna-covid-19-vaccines-govt-101624881811763.html

The scheme will come into effect once the international travel resumes, she said in a press conference in Delhi.It will remain applicable till March 31, 2022, or after distribution of the first 5 lakh visas, whichever is earlier, she also said, adding that an international tourist will be allowed to avail the benefits only once. The announcements were part of the financial package and new schemes presented by Sitharaman to boost various sectors ravaged by Covid-19.The government will also provide financial support to the more than 11,000 registered tourist guides, travel and tourism stakeholders to revive the tourism sector battered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Under the scheme, a ₹10 lakh loan will be given to travel agencies, while registered tourist guides will be eligible for a loan of ₹1 lakh.The economic measures come as the tourism sector is severely hit by the Covid induced restrictions, especially local tourists guides who make most of the earnings from international visitors. They are a major source of income for them since the percentage of domestic tourists availing of their services is negligible.Last year, domestic tourism picked up slowly post the first lockdown, but after the onset of the second wave of Covid-19 and now the following outbreaks of Delta and Delta plus variants, the sector is still staring at a bleak future.In December last year, the news agency PTI reported that India’s hospitality and tourism sector suffered three-quarters of economic wipeout estimated to be up to ₹15 lakh crore.The impact of Covid-19 has been such that all other segments of tourism -- inbound, outbound, corporate, MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions), adventure and leisure -- will continue to underperform till the next two quarters, it also reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-to-revive-tourism-govt-waives-off-visa-fee-for-5-lakh-tourists-101624883369870.html
28-06-2021||India||JD(U) to contest UP assembly elections next year||Janata Dal (United) or JD(U) will be contesting the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. Party general secretary KC Tyagi said on Monday that while their first choice would be to be accommodated in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), it will still go ahead with its plans even if that does not materialise.“Our first choice will be to contest as part of the NDA, and we hope it works out. We have had old presence in UP since the days of the erstwhile Samata Party, though we did not contest in 2017. We had MLAs in the UP and we also had ministers in the government. The objective is to revive the party beyond Bihar,” he said.In Delhi assembly elections, the JD(U) contested two seats as part of the NDA, but could not open its account. In Jharkhand, it contested 46 of the 81 seats on its own but again, didn’t win even one though.Also Read | Bihar Congress unit set to have new committees ahead of change of guardThe move is significant, as in the UP, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is unlikely to leave much space for smaller parties even as the Opposition is trying to cobble up a united front to stop it from retaining power. This could also be viewed as rumblings within the NDA, which the Opposition has often flagged, since the 2020 Bihar assembly elections reduced the JD(U) to the third position. It must be noted that the party’s stance vis-a-vis UP elections comes at a time chief minister Nitish Kumar is in New Delhi for eye surgery and there are speculations about the party’s belated induction in the Union cabinet.Earlier this year, the party had planned to contest panchayat polls in UP from some seats in eastern UP with dominance of Extremely Backward Classes (EBC) as a build-up for the assembly polls, but eventually did not do so, said Tyagi.Tyagi said the party was only trying to expand in other states where it has had good organisation in the past. Last year, it suffered at the hands of its ally in Arunachal Pradesh when six of its seven MLAs joined the BJP. In the past, the party has contested from several states, including Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Jharkhand, but saw limited success in Arunachal only.“It may not have won many seats, but it did make its presence felt in several states. The effort is to reach out to more states such as Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhatisgarh, Rajasthan, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu and strengthen organisation,” said a senior leader.JD(U) leader and former party spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said the decision to expand party base in a planned manner has been under consideration for a long time. “We did fight earlier in many states and performed reasonably well. Now, the party wants to strengthen its organisational base and fight. This is a good move, as there have been such demands from other state units,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jdu-to-contest-up-assembly-elections-next-year-101624883533391.html

Activist Subash Sharma has alleged that Delphia laboratory of Bhiwani, Haryana, took over the task of conducting antigen tests unauthorisedly in the mela area as a sub-letting agency contracted by the Nalwa laboratory, and also issued authorisation to a vehicle to enter the prohibited mela area. Also Read | 1 address used for 3,825 Covid tests at Kumbh: Officials“We submitted documents of Delphia laboratory of Bhiwani, Haryana, with Nalwa laboratory related with Kumbh testing, including one signed on April 11 ,2021, with tempo vehicle no UK07C7737.It is the firm’s letter to local administration, stating that they are authorised for conducting of Covid-19 antigen testing in Kumbh Mela and so the vehicle be allowed movement in Kumbh Mela. Delphia laboratory operating during the Mahakumbh further proves the sub-letting of testing contract by Nalwa which puts a question mark on the testing,” he said. The chief investigating officer of the probe committee, Saurabh Geharwar, said that documents submitted by Sharma were being examined. “We had sought information regarding Kumbh covid testing, so we are examining and considering such submissions,” he said. Max Corporate Services lawyer Apoorva Aggarwal said they had only signed a memorandum of understanding with Nalwa laboratory but if it allowed some another firm without their knowledge, that points at deception.

28-06-2021||India||Kerala’s ex-Olympian seeks justice for rape survivor, attacks Josephine||Thiruvananthapuram: MC Josephine, Kerala’s women commission chairperson who resigned last week for snapping at a woman facing domestic violence, on Monday landed in another controversy after former Olympian Mayookha Johny alleged Josephine tried to shield a man accused of raping her friend.Mayookha Johny addressed a news briefing in north Kerala’s Thrissur to seek justice for a friend who, she said, was raped in 2016 and tried to move on without complaining to the police. She finally filed a complaint in March this year when the accused continued to blackmail her, threatening to release photographs and video clips that he had shot.The police appeared hesitant to act on the complaint, said Johny, India’s first female athlete to cross the 14-metre barrier in the triple jump. She has represented the country at the Asian Games and the Olympics continues to hold the current Indian national record for triple jump for female athletes and was awarded Kerala’s highest sporting event, the GV Raja Awards for 2019.“When we approached Josephine, she promised us strong action. But later, for reasons best known to her, she started talking in favour of the accused,” she said, alleging that Josephine played a key role in averting his arrest.MC Josephine, a central committee member of Kerala’s ruling party CPI (M), did not respond to repeated requests for her version. Josephine ran into trouble last week after her “then you suffer” remark to a domestic violence survivor during a live television show.Johny said she was forced to call a press conference for her friend after they appeared to have run out of options. “My friend has married two years ago but he still harasses her and threatens to release her photographs. I was also threatened for taking up her cause,” she said. Her friend sat by her side at the briefing.“The accused is an influential man. Now the police are asking for evidence and blame us for not approaching them soon after the crime. We feel bad when he roams around freely and continues to threaten the victim,” she said.Asked about Johny’s complaints, a senior Thrissur police officer said they are still investigating the case. “We are collecting evidence,” said the officer, insisting that they were yet to tie what he described as “some loose ends in the woman’s statement”. He also pointed that it was difficult to collect evidence in such cases after a long gap between the alleged crime and the offence. At the briefing, Johny said the police should seize his phone that was used to record the crime and other devices. “They will get enough evidence once they seize his phone and track his call records,” said Mayookha Johny, reasoning that if he was threatening to release her photos and videos, he must have kept them in a device.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-ex-olympian-seeks-justice-for-rape-survivor-attacks-josephine-101624883054281.html

The government has said that Delta Plus is present in 12 countries. What makes this variant a worry is the fact that it spreads more rapidly than the previous known variants. Delta Plus also has the ability to fight some vaccines and therapies being offered in different countries, and shows greater affinity towards lung tissues.Most of the cases of Delta Plus variant have been found on three states - Maharashtra, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh. The Maharashtra government has tightened restrictions with effect from Monday, allowing essential shops to remain open only till 4 pm on all days.The entire state has been put under 'level 3' restrictions, a state government notification said.Restaurants are allowed to operate dine-in facility with 50 per cent capacity till 4 pm on weekdays and takeaways and home deliveries after that, according to the order.Former ICMR chief Dr Raman Gangakhedkar said on Sunday that there is no need to panic due to the spread of the Delta Plus variant. He was speaking at a webinar on Covid-19, where another doctor said that ICMR data shows 70 per cent of people have developed immunity against coronavirus, and the country appears to be heading towards herd immunity.Delta Plus has already been declared a variant of concern by the Indian government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-plus-variant-very-localised-48-cases-found-till-now-says-govt-101624881866771.html

This comes after several meetings between the top Congress leaders and those from Punjab to resolve the ongoing feud between Sidhu and chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh.Rahul Gandhi has stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis in the Punjab unit of the Congress and has been meeting several leaders from the state at his residence. Vijendra Singla, Rana Gurjit Singh, Rajya Sabha MP Shamsher Singh Dhillon and MLA Lakhvir Singh were among those who met him on Friday.The leaders told the media after the meeting that decisions were made to strengthen the party ahead of the assembly elections due next year in Punjab. Senior party leaders fear that the bitter feud between the two tall Congress leaders in the state may hurt the party's fortunes in the elections.Gandhi earlier met Punjab pradesh Congress committee president Sunil Jakhar, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and Harish Rawat.The Congress party has formed a three-member panel headed by Mallikarjun Kharge to resolve the crisis. The panel has already met Amarinder Singh who came to Delhi on a three-day visit. The Punjab chief minister, however, did not meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi.Sidhu quit the Amarinder Singh cabinet in 2019 over change in his portfolio. But he stepped up his attacks in the last few months. The bitterness mounted in May after the government suffered a legal setback in a 2015 police firing case.His attacks have been public where Sidhu has called the chief minister a liar and accused him of not doing anything about issues like loan waiver.Punjab is crucial for Congress as it is one of the few states where the party is in power and the outcome will have an impact on its prospects outside the state.Assembly elections in Punjab are scheduled to take place next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navjot-sidhu-to-meet-rahul-and-priyanka-gandhi-amid-congress-infighting-101624880621965.html

Bhat alias Khalid was active in the Central Kashmir region since 2018.Kashmir police chief (IGP) Vijay Kumar said, “It is a big success for us.” He, however, didn’t reveal further details of the arrest.Vijay Kumar had recently said that security forces will soon neutralise Abrar, who was suspected to be involved in the attack on the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) at Lawaypora on March 25.Three CRPF jawans were killed in that attack carried out on Srinagar-Baramulla national highway and their rifle was also snatched. The rifle was later recovered from the possession of a terrorist earlier this month after three militants were killed during an encounter in Sopore.On March 26, police had also arrested local resident Muzaffar Ahmad Mir and his timber business partner Javeed, alleging they had helped Abrar Nadeem Bhat carry out the Lawaypora attack as overground workers.IG Vijay Kumar then said that Javeed had confessed to his role in the attack after he was arrested with his vehicle, in which few empty cartridges were found.“We have arrested both OGW’S and an operation was launched at two places to arrest Nadeem Abrar Bhat and two foreign terrorists who were involved in the attack. They will be neutralised soon.” IG Kumar said on March 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-police-arrest-top-lashkar-commander-involved-in-lawaypora-attack-on-crpf-101624878252930.html

Most of these drones are used by Pakistan-based terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM). On Sunday, two drones carried out attacks at the Air Force Station in Jammu, which the investigators have linked to LeT.HT Exclusive: Pak LeT behind drone attack in Jammu, target was ATC and parked IAF helicoptersOne such drone activity was thwarted by alert Indian security forces in Hiranagar sector of Jammu in June last year.The drone, which was shot down by the Border Security Force (BSF), fell into an open field. A forensic analysis of that drone was carried out by Delhi-based Drone Federation of India (DFI), which said that it was a locally assembled hexacopter. The components used are easily available in hobby shops, it added.The flight controller of the 24kg drone was CubeBlack, manufactured in Hong Kong. It also said that no pre-planned mission was set in the drone and it was controlled manually using the ground control system. It also said that the drone operator had disabled all modes of data extraction.The DFI further said that the estimated radius for takeoff was 10km beyond visual line of sight operation. The drone was in air for 35 minutes, said DFI, adding that the maximum possible range was 30 km. The DFI experts did not find any external hacking or custom firmware on the drone.The experts further said that based on the labelling of the components on the drone found in June last year, they observed that the drones are being created in batches.Top security officials have said that as many as 14 drone sorties have been made by Pakistani terror groups.Late on Sunday night, a fresh attempt to attack a military installation with the help of drones was foiled by the security forces. The personnel stationed at Ratnuchak-Kaluchak station fired at two unmanned aerial vehicles that flew away.The first drone was sighted around 11.45pm and the second one, at around 2.40am, said officials. A search operation has been launched and the area outside the military station cordoned off.The military station at Kaluchak has been on high alert since the 2002 terror attack. Thirty-one people, including 10 children, were killed in the attack. Forty eight people, including 13 Army personnel, 20 Army family members and 15 civilians were injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hong-kong-controller-local-components-how-let-makes-drones-to-attack-india-101624875870666.html
28-06-2021||India||Govt looking into Twitter displaying wrong map of India||The ministry of electronics and information is looking into the issue of Twitter displaying a wrong map of India, an official familiar with the matter said on Monday. The misrepresentation caused an uproar online amid the ongoing impasse between the government and the microblogging platform. The map, which shows Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir as a separate country, is available on the company’s website under careers sections on the page titled Tweep Life. HT reached out to Twitter but did not receive a response immediately. This is the second time Twitter has misrepresented India’s map. In October last year, the Centre had served Twitter with a notice over the geotag for Leh showing it as a part of China. Writing to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, the Centre on October 22 conveyed its “disappointment regarding the misrepresentation of the map of India”. It also asked Twitter to explain why action should not be taken against it and the micro-blogging site resolved the issue.Also Read | Twitter appoints American Jeremy Kessel as new grievance officer for IndiaIn December last year, the government warned Wikipedia for misrepresenting the country’s borders.Since it was a particular page, it issued Wikipedia an order to scrap it. “The secretary further adds that it violates the territorial integrity of the country, and it is well within the power of the ministry under section 69A to order it to be be taken down,” HT quoted one of the ministry officials as saying then.The current map fiasco comes at a time when the company is engaged in an escalating battle with the government over the new controversial social media and intermediary guidelines. The ministry has asserted that the social media firm has failed to comply with the guidelines, which can result in it losing the safe harbour protection granted to intermediaries under the IT Act. Twitter, in turn, has raised concerns about the safety of its employees in India and flagged intimidation by the police. There have been several instances of confrontation between the social media firm and the government over orders to block access to content and marking of posts by BJP leaders as manipulated media. Twitter’s grievance redressal officer Dharmendra Chatur also stepped down over the weekend, prompting the firm to hire a new official. Assistant professor of political science at the University of Albany, Christopher Clary, however, said that according to analysis, Twitter was also misrepresenting the map of the US. “By this analysis, I guess Twitter is also showing at least 10 American states as separate countries,” Clary tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-looking-into-twitter-displaying-wrong-map-of-india-101624876452497.html
28-06-2021||India||High court pulls up Goa government for hounding ‘whistleblower’||The Bombay high court at Goa pulled up the state on Monday for hounding a government employee who blew whistle on state-run sewerage corporation, which was discharging untreated sewage into a low lying water body, with the help of official documents. The court said it was unfortunate that the government filed a case of theft of documents against the employee in 2012 displaying intent to shoot the messenger instead of acting on the message.“You should welcome such government servants. Instead of hounding the messenger you should take the message. [Why] go against this person. This is not the way. You should [instead] reward him. Are these some documents under the Official Secrets Act?” the high court asked the state government and added: “Instead of remedying the situation, you are going after the government servant.”A staff nurse at the Goa Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour, Uday Chari, exposed the sewerage corporation’s malpractice in 2012 using field water quality test reports that the government claims he obtained without authorisation.The reports proved that the public works department was releasing untreated sewage into the open water bodies and fields, leading to water contamination beyond permissible limits, resulting in stench and pollution of the creek in the outskirts of the capital city.The state slapped him with a case of theft of documents and it has been pending ever since. Chari in 2020 approached the high court seeking quashing of the FIR filed against him.“The very ingredients necessary for this case to be registered as a theft were not made out and further this was a case only to victimise me for taking up this issue,” Advocate Ryan Menezes, who represented Chari told the court.While hearing Chari’s plea, the HC asked if the state government was beyond criticism.“You are pursuing this from 2012 and 2021. Are you trying to say that if somebody goes against the government then you will file complaints against them? Do the government departments have no other work?” the bench of justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalikar, said.The Goa government stuck to its stand and said a government servant was free to take up a public cause “but it had to be[done] through public channels.”“The offence is made out and there is no case for quashing,” advocate G Nagvenkar told the court.After hearing the government’s argument the HC said it was “inclined to quash the prosecution”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-pulls-up-goa-government-for-hounding-whistleblower-101624875792830.html

The error has been spotted in a map on the tweep life section under the career portal on Twitter’s website. The government might take strict action in this matter, senior government officials told the publication.In October 2020 as well, the San Francisco-headquartered company showed Ladakh as a part of China for which it apologised to a parliamentary panel after massive uproar.

28-06-2021||India||Arunachal child home refuses court order to send rape survivor to kin of accused||A childcare home in Arunachal Pradesh has politely refused to comply with a local court’s June 4 order to hand over a minor rape survivor to a relative of the accused, claiming it will further traumatise her. The childcare home has instead requested the court to appoint a neutral person as the guardian of the minor, whose rescue after years of sexual exploitation is mired in allegations of mishandling of the case.The 14-year-old Nepali citizen was trafficked to India many years ago and allegedly raped repeatedly by a government employee, at whose residence she worked as a domestic help. She somehow fled from his residence located in Roing of Lower Dibang Valley district in March this year, following which the accused was jailed and the matter reached the court. The court’s ruling on her custody has however left the childcare center protesting. “On June 4, a session court at Tezu in Lohit district asked us to hand over the child, who has been with us since March this year, to her local guardian, who is the sister-in-law of the accused. The child is already traumatized by her ordeal and handing her over to a relative of the accused, who is out on bail, could hurt her further,” said Desai Linggi, chairperson, Nani Maria Children Home (NMCH). Noting the non-compliance, the court issued a notice to NMCH on June 23 and asked them to appear in person on the next date of hearing in the case on June 29. Lingi pointed out that the accused was currently out on bail and there was a genuine need to appoint a “neutral” local guardian. “Since we were not shown any documents to verify the identity of the local guardian and also because she, [the local guardian named by the child’s father] was the sister-in-law of the accused, we have not complied with the order and instead asked the court to appoint another local guardian who isn’t related to the accused,” she added. Child rights experts have alleged mishandling of the sensitive case and pointed out that the accused was currently on bail and had contacted the daycare centre urging them to hand over the child to him so that she could be sent back to Nepal. Not just that, he was also playing host to the father of the survivor, who had arrived from Nepal after his daughter’s suffering came to light in March following her escape. The brother of the accused, his sister-in-law and the minor girl’s father have also been visiting the child at the childcare home. During her counselling sessions at NMCH, the child reportedly said that she doesn’t want to go with her father or the local guardian. NMCH officials also alleged that the minor survivor’s statement was recorded in the court of the local chief judicial magistrate in absence of her confidante as is required under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.Recent developments and alleged mishandling of the case has led the Arunachal Pradesh State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (APSCPCR) to send a team from Itanagar to Roing to probe the entire matter. “We have learnt that the norms required to be followed while recording the statement of a child by a magistrate were not followed. This is wrong,” said Gurmi Ringu, chairperson of APSCPCR. The child was working at the house of the accused for a sum of ₹1,500 per month, which was supposedly being sent to her parents in Nepal, claimed NMCH officials.According to NMCH officials, the rape survivor managed to escape two years ago and sought shelter in a house few kilometres away but the family returned her to the accused. She again managed to escape in March this year and took shelter in another house.After she disclosed her ordeal to the family, the matter reached the district child welfare committee, which decided to place her in the childcare centre, and lodged a case against the accused. A medical examination then revealed that the child, between 12-15 years of age, had been raped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arunachal-child-home-refuses-court-order-to-send-rape-survivor-to-kin-of-accused-101624872792500.html

Many steps are being taken by the Centre to bring investment and improve infrastructure here,” the Union minister said, according to ANI.Singh, who is on a three-day visit to Ladakh and is currently in Leh, earlier in the day, inaugurated 63 infra projects constructed by Border Roads Organisation (BRO). The defence minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will soon chair a meeting with the political leaders of Ladakh to discuss conducting polls in the Union territory. “PM Modi wants the political process to start in Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh,” he said, pointing out that the Prime Minister has already spoken to the political parties of Jammu and Kashmir.On Sunday, the defence minister interacted with 300 veterans, including Ashok Chakra winner Naib Subedar (Honorary) Chhering Mutup (retd) and Maha Vir Chakra winner Colonel Sonam Wangchuk (retd) in Leh.Praising the veterans for their “unparalleled dedication” to ensure the safety and security of the country, Singh said PM Modi’s decision to introduce the ‘One Rank One Pension’ scheme was a testimony to the central government’s unwavering commitment towards the welfare and satisfaction of the veterans. “Our aim is to take care of you in the same way as you all have taken care of the country,” the minister added during the interaction.This development comes after the recent meeting in New Delhi between PM Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah with the political parties of Jammu and Kashmir – the first of its kind after the abrogation of Article 370. Several senior leaders including National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah, former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah, and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, among others, were present in the meeting that lasted for more than three hours.“We kept five demands in the meeting – grant statehood soon, conduct Assembly elections to restore democracy, rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits in J&K, all political detainees should be released and on domicile rules," Azad said after the meeting concluded.Notably, a person familiar with the happenings of the meeting and who asked to remain anonymous mentioned that at the meeting PM Modi said he wants to remove Dilli ki Doori (the distance from Delhi) and also Dil ki Doori (the distance from the heart).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorism-one-of-the-main-reasons-behind-making-ladakh-a-ut-rajnath-singh-101624866759366.html

"Trial will almost complete till July-end and in August, we will be able to vaccinate children aged between 12-18 years," Arora said, according to news agency ANI.Zydus Cadila’s Covid-19 vaccine will become the fourth one to get a nod for use against the viral infection in India, if approved by the Drugs Controller General of India. The company has so far not released any data from its trials. The company’s Covid-19 vaccine, once approved, will be the second indigenously developed one to receive clearance in the country and the first DNA vaccine in the world. It will be a three-dose vaccine and will have to be administered intradermally.AIIMS Delhi director Dr Randeep Guleria told ANI that the Zydus Cadila vaccine is a new platform that is being used and its “something that we should be proud of.” “A platform for which research isn't done in past in our country and now making this new type of vaccine, the data is still being collated and one is hoping that they will be able to submit the data to the DCGI for regulatory approval,” Dr Guleria said.Also read | India's vaccine-related decisions based on science, says NTAGI chairperson“So, one is hopeful and that will depend on the company that how quickly the company is able to collate the data and give it to the regulatory authority,” he added.Arora also said that the government has targeted administering 1 crore doses every day to achieve the target of immunising everyone in the country within a time bracket of six to eight months.

28-06-2021||India||Current Covid-19 vaccines may be less effective against Beta variant, says study||A study of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, has indicated that current vaccines may be less effective against the Beta variant. Present on the surface of SARS-COV-2, spike proteins enable the virus to attach to and enter human cells, and all current vaccines are directed against them, it stated.The study, published in the journal Science on June 24, used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to compare the spike protein from the original virus found in China in 2019 with that of the Beta variant and the Alpha variant first identified in the United Kingdom. Cryo-Em is an imaging technique used to determine the biomolecular structures at near-atomic resolution.The findings led by researchers at Boston Children's Hospital in the United States indicate that mutations in the Beta variant, also known as B.1.351, change the shape of the spike surface at certain locations. As a result, neutralising antibodies induced by current Covid-19 vaccines are less able to bind to the Beta virus, which may allow it to evade the immune system even when people are vaccinated."The mutations make antibodies stimulated by the current vaccine less effective. The Beta variant is somewhat resistant to the current vaccines, and we think a booster with the new genetic sequence can be beneficial for protecting against this variant," said Bing Chen, from the division of Molecular Medicine at Boston Children's.The researchers also found that mutations in the Beta variant make the spike less effective and thus this variant is less transmissible than the Alpha variant. However, testing indicated that antibodies obtained by existing vaccines can still neutralise this variant, according to the researchers.The research team is now analysing the structures of other variants of concern, including the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), first identified in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/current-covid-19-vaccines-may-be-less-effective-against-beta-variant-says-study-101624863038382.html

The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) successfully flight tested the new generation nuclear-capable ballistic missile from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam island at 10:55am off the coast of Odisha. “Various telemetry and radar stations positioned along the eastern coast tracked and monitored the missile. The missile has followed textbook trajectory, meeting all mission objectives with a high level of accuracy,” DRDO said in a statement.Agni P is the first of the new class of Agni missile to be launched by DRDO. The ballistic missile weighs 50% less than Agni 3 and has new guidance and a new generation of propulsion. Since the missile is canisterised, it can be launched from rail and road and stored for a longer period and transported all across the country as per operational requirements.The missile, which has a range between 1000km to 2000km, can be used to target enemy armadas in the Indo-Pacific.Last Friday, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) successfully test-fired an extended range version of indigenously-developed Pinaka rocket at Integrated Test Range (ITR) in Chandipur off the coast of Odisha.That day, 25 Enhanced Pinaka rockets, which can destroy targets at distances up to 45 kilometres, were test-fired in quick succession against targets at different ranges on Thursday and Friday. The 122 mm Caliber rockets were also launched from a Multi-Barrel Rocket Launcher (MBRL).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-successfully-test-fires-agni-p-a-new-missile-in-agni-series-101624863307818.html

Defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said soldiers opened fire at the two drones but could not bring them down.“Searches were launched early this morning and we are also ascertaining whether they were being operated from a vehicle on the adjoining road,” he added.“On the midnight of 27-28 June, two separate drone activities were spotted over Ratnuchak-Kaluchak military areas by alert troops. Immediately, high alert was sounded and quick reaction teams engaged them with firing. Both the drones flew away,” he said.“A major threat was thwarted by the alertness and proactive approach of troops,” he said, adding the security forces are on high alert, the area has been cordoned off, and a search operation is in progress.Also Read | Pak LeT behind drone attack in Jammu, target was ATC and parked IAF helicoptersThe Kaluchak military station was attacked way back on May 14, 2002, by three armed terrorists from Pakistan. The trio first attacked a Himachal Road Transport Corporation bus on Jammu-Pathankot highway and killed seven passengers before storming the station where they killed 23 persons, including 10 children, and five army soldiers.Meanwhile, Sunday’s attack on IAF base in Jammu is believed to be the first-ever offensive use of drones to target an Indian military facility. The two “low-intensity” explosions left two IAF personnel injured. J&K director general of police Dilbag Singh said the twin blasts were a “terror attack”. “A drone with payload in both the blasts at Jammu airfield is suspected to have dropped the explosive material. The police have registered an FIR and investigation is on,” Singh said.A senior police officer said that police are investigating the attack but there were no vital clues available to them as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-more-drones-spotted-over-kaluchak-military-station-in-jammu-searches-launched-101624863251849.html
28-06-2021||India||Covishield’s green pass approval by EMA to be discussed on G20 sidelines||The approval of Serum Institute of India (SII)’s Covishield vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to be taken up by the Indian side with the European Union on the margins of the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in Italy on June 29, said people familiar with developments. SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla also said on Monday that he has taken up the matter “at the highest level” to ensure Indians don’t face any travel restrictions. “I realise that a lot of Indians who have taken Covishield are facing issues with travel to the EU. I assure everyone, I have taken this up at the highest levels and hope to resolve this matter soon, both with regulators and at a diplomatic level with countries,” Poonawalla tweeted. People familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that SII would apply to EMA for certification. Also Read | Dr Reddy’s Laboratories announces commercial launch of anti-Covid drug 2DGExternal affairs minister S Jaishankar and his team are currently in Italy for a meeting of the foreign and development ministers of the G20, which includes 19 countries and the EU. The agenda for the meeting at Matera includes a swift international response to the Covid-19 pandemic and equitable worldwide access to diagnostics and vaccines. The people cited above said the issue of EMA approval is expected to figure in discussions between Indian and EU officials on the margins of the G20 meeting. Travellers vaccinated with Covishield, the version of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India, are currently ineligible for the EU Digital Covid certificate or “green pass” – an immunity document set to be in place by July 1 to ease travel within and to the 27-member bloc – as EMA has approved only four Covid-19 vaccines that have received EU-wide marketing authorisation. The position taken by EMA is perplexing because Covishield and Vaxzevria, the AstraZeneca vaccine approved by the European agency, are qualitatively similar in nature, the people said. The Indian side has also reached out to EU authorities and key members of the bloc for greater understanding about the green pass and other national health regulations. The understanding on the Indian side is that the green pass is currently applicable only for intra-EU travel, though there could be a wider rollout at a later stage, and it will initially be available only to citizens of the 27 member states and EU citizens based outside the bloc. The people cited above also said EMA approval was more about processes involving the manufacturer of a vaccine and less about government-to-government understandings. The government can help facilitate the process but it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to seek approval from EMA. “There is still some time, and a solution will likely come soon as the matter is being taken up at different levels,” another government official aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity. The EMA’s current list of approved vaccines includes Vaxzervria, the AstraZeneca shot produced in the UK and other sites around Europe, Comirnaty or the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Moderna shot and Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine. The European Parliament voted overwhelmingly for the EU Digital Covid certificate on April 29 in response to demands from tourism-dependent countries such as Spain and Greece but questions remain about varying vaccination and testing rules in the 27 member states. Diplomats told Reuters in April that national differences on recognising negative antibody tests on top of PCR tests, technical difficulties in creating a single EU gateway, worries about discrimination against those who have not been vaccinated, and privacy issues meant that finding common ground across the EU might be tricky. The green pass, which was originally known as the “digital green certificate”, will contain information about vaccination, tests and recovery from Covid-19. Reports have said EU citizens will be able to obtain the green pass if they have any one of the three elements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishields-green-pass-approval-by-ema-to-be-discussed-on-g20-sidelines-101624861631690.html

According to police, Deb confessed to organising fake vaccination camps – one at north Kolkata’s City College and another in his office in south Kolkata’s Kasba, news agency ANI reported.“[Deb]…wrote letters to government agencies, [and he] would put receipt stamps on them to convince victims,” police told ANI, adding that Deb would himself pen down a response to the letters he wrote to the government agencies.Police further stated that the accused claimed to have written a mail to Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune for sending Covishield, and that the same is being verified. They said no other fake Covid-19 vaccination camps were organised in the city by Deb besides the ones in City College and Kasba, ANI reported.Meanwhile, a team of police officials conducted a raid at the residence of Debanjan Deb, and seized forged documents of different departments, and some stamps, ANI reported. Besides, three debit cards and bank passbooks were seized from the accused’s residence.Among the recovered stamps, some are of government departments such as Department of Information and Cultural Affairs, Public Works Department, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and West Bengal State Election Commission (WBSEC), ANI reported. Furthermore, as many as eight bank accounts, associated with Deb, have been detected till now and of these, one was in the name of his company WBFINCORP, through which he used to give salary to his staff, police told ANI.According to the ANI report, Deb’s staff and ex-staff are being examined by police. “Ten such persons have been summoned for examination or are being examined,” police said, adding that more people are being examined for “cross-examination.”This development comes after the Kolkata Police on Saturday held three more persons in connection with the fake vaccination racket. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) has already been formed to investigate the matter that was busted after Bengali actress and ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Mimi Chakraborty along with another TMC leader received fake Covid-19 shots at the camps in north and south Kolkata organised by Deb.Investigation has so far revealed that more than 800 people have received fake jabs, but police said the number could increase. Deb, who was masquerading as an IAS officer, was eventually arrested on Wednesday based on Chakraborty’s complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-fake-covid-19-jab-drive-accused-admitted-to-organising-two-camps-police-101624859751980.html

This comes after the DRDO earlier on June 1 said that the anti-Covid drug is approved for emergency use as an adjunct therapy to the standard of care in the treatment of coronavirus patients in hospital settings."Ideally, 2DG should be prescribed as early as possible by doctors for moderate to severe Covid patients for a maximum duration of up to 10 days," it said.The DRDO further said that uncontrolled diabetes, severe cardiac problem, ARDS, severe hepatic and renal impairment patients have not been studied yet with 2DG, and hence caution should be exercised."The 2DG should not be given to pregnant and lactating women and patients below 18 years," it added.The first batch of DRDO's anti-Covid-19 drug was released on May 17 by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, after the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) permitted the emergency use authorisation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), anti-viral drug as an adjunct therapy for moderate to severe coronavirus patients.The 2DG drug comes in powder form in the sachet, which is taken orally by dissolving it in water. It accumulates in the virus-infected cells and prevents virus growth by stopping viral synthesis and energy production. Its selective accumulation in virally infected cells makes this drug unique. The drug reportedly reduces a patient's average recovery time by two and a half days and oxygen demand by up to 40 per cent, the Union health ministry had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dr-reddy-s-laboratories-announces-commercial-launch-of-anti-covid-drug-2dg-101624858749823.html

28-06-2021||India||Pak LeT behind drone attack in Jammu, target was ATC and parked IAF helicopters||Prima facie investigations conducted by security agencies and Jammu and Kashmir Police has revealed the role of Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terror group in the drone strike at Jammu air base in early hours of Sunday. The drone attack is linked with the recovery of a 6 kilogram IED by Jammu police from an LeT operative leading to detention of at least three terror suspects by J&K Police.While the security agencies and state police are tightlipped about the drone attack, fact is that the Pakistan based terror group was targeting the air traffic control (ATC) tower with one drone and the other was aiming at either the parked IAF helicopter or the radar.“The two IEDs weighing around 5-6 kilograms with RDX as the main explosive charge were dropped at a distance of 50 yards from each other. One charge was some 40 yards from the ATC, while the other was around the same distance from the parked helicopter. The drop was made through a latitude-longitude device and that they missed the targets could be due to faulty execution or high wind factor,” said a senior security official.According to security agencies and state police, the two drones flew from across the border, which is mere 14.5 kilometers away from the Jammu airport, and returned back after the hit. The drone is suspected to be flying at a height of 1.2 kilometers and would have been powered by long range batteries. The drone strike has raised red-flag in the Jammu sector for as many as 14 drone sorties have been made by Pakistani terror groups, majority of them by LeT and two by Jaish-e-Mohammed. “Our estimate is that six sorties with weapon payloads were made in Samba sector, 3 to four in Hiranagar sector, 2 in Nowshera-Rajouri sector and another two in Arnia sector. We have found that the drones are assembled with different Chinese parts used of different makes for deniability. The dropped weapons were meant for Lashkar and Jaish operatives in the Valley with the specific design to disturb peace in Kashmir,” said a top security official.While the Indian security forces have been testing anti-drone jammer technology on the border with Pakistan, the problem faced is that the communications between Indian agencies itself gets jammed as a collateral damage. However, in the era of swarm drones, the Indian security forces are alive to the new threat posed by Pakistani terror groups and are expected to take counter-measures also.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-let-behind-drone-attack-in-jammu-target-was-atc-and-parked-iaf-helicopters-101624857978136.html

She said she was under tremendous pressure to hush up the case and had been threatened with implication in trumped-up cases. In her complaint, she said that three months ago, Baburaj came to her house in the guise of discussing an election issue and raped her. She said he raped her several times after threatening her he would tell her husband if she didn’t comply.Also Read | Kerala women’s panel chief resigns after remark stirs rowShe said after Baburaj told DFYI leader Lijesh about this, he also started harassing her and later raped her. She said she thought of killing herself frequently. Later, she said, she mustered courage and told her husband. Both of them approached the police. A senior CPI(M) woman leader from the district , who did not want to be quoted, said the woman got enough courage to approach the police after many women leaders took up the issue. The opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party have criticised the police for delay in arresting the accused persons, and threatened to launch an agitation.“Police deliberately delayed their arrest due to political pressure. They acted only after protests mounted,” said Congress working president T Siddique.Vadakara deputy superintendent of police Moosa Vallikadan said the investigating team had recorded her detailed statement and there would be a fair probe. “An investigation is on. Her statements will be recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of the IPC,” he said. A CPI(M) leader, who requested anonymity, said the law would take its course and refused to comment further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rape-of-party-worker-2-cpi-m-leaders-arrested-in-kerala-101624858872190.html

28-06-2021||India||Rajasthan CM urges PM Narendra Modi to increase supply of Covid vaccine||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to say that the state needed to vaccinate 1.5 million beneficiaries daily if it were to vaccinate the 7 million people due for their second dose by the end of July on time. Gehlot said the Centre was currently on an average supplying 300,000-400,000 vaccines doses daily to the state, which will obstruct the state’s effort to prevent the 3rd wave of Covid-19.“...More than seven million people will be due for their second dose by the end of July, 2021. To ensure time-bound and expeditious vaccination, we have created a capacity to vaccinate over 1.5 million persons per day. Presently our daily vaccination is limited to the extent of supplies received from Central government. The daily average of vaccine doses received, since the start of vaccination drive for 18 years plus, has been 300,000 to 400,000 only,” Gehlot wrote.The Central government reversed the vaccination procurement policy after persistent complaints by states over its pricing and availability in the open market. From June 21 onwards, Centre is procuring and providing vaccine doses to states, based on their vaccination rate in the past and future needs. The Central government has told states that it will distribute 120 million doses including 100 million shots of Covishield and 20 million of Covaxin to all states and Union Territories for the month of July.The Union ministry of health and family welfare has been sharing the estimated number of vaccine doses available in a particular month with states before the start of the month as part of its advance visibility plan so that states and UTs can prepare and schedule vaccinations accordingly.Gehlot’s letter states that the state has been recognised for demonstrating “exemplary” Covid management and is among the best performers in vaccination drive, having inoculated over 236 million people till date while achieving a negative (less than 0%) wastage.Negative wastage indicates optimum utilisation by using more than the minimum number of doses present in a vial of vaccine. Wastage of vaccine doses, which was initially very high for several states, was cited by experts as one of the reasons for states running out of doses before time.India has so far administered 371.8 million doses to 265.4 million people since January 16, 2021, when the national Covid-19 vaccination drive was launched. A total of 209 million people have received one dose, while 56.4 million people have been fully vaccinated till Sunday morning, according to government data. The Centre has, however, said it plans to scale up vaccinations to reach about 10 million doses in a single day by August. An average of over 6 million doses have been administered every day in the country between June 21 and June 27 after the new phase of the government’s vaccine drive came into effect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-cm-urges-pm-narendra-modi-to-increase-supply-of-covid-vaccine-101624856051690.html

Killing women is [not] bravery but a purely cowardly attack which deserves the highest form of condemnation,” Thakur said.Police and the army have launched a joint operation in the area.This is the latest in a series of attacks on locals in the Union Territory.On June 23, a shop owner was killed when gunmen opened fire on him in Srinagar.Police had said that militants fired upon a mobile phone shop owner Umar Nazir Bhat of Kelashpora, inside his shop at Main Chowk Habba Kadal in Old City.On June 22, a police officer was killed in a suspected militant attack on Srinagar outskirts.Officials said that Inspector Pervaiz Ahmad, who worked with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) wing of police, was fired upon near his home at Nowgam.He was rushed to Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) hospital in the Old City, where doctors declared him dead on arrival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cop-his-family-shot-dead-by-militants-in-south-kashmir-s-pulwama-101624853411683.html

The state fears the strain could become more severe in case of a third wave. On Friday, the state government decided to reduce the five-level relaxation plan, based on positivity rate and bed occupancy, to three. The first two levels, which had the maximum relaxations, were removed till further orders.Also Read | Delhi unlock 5.0: What’s opening in the national capital from todayMumbai would continue to follow the same restrictions (level three), despite its low positivity and bed occupancy rate, so as to avoid any spurt in Covid-19 cases.

Both the Central government and the World Health Organisation have advised us to take preventive steps in view of the mutation and we are adhering to them,” he added. This means that in places such as Thane, Navi Mumbai and Pune, where malls had opened and shops were allowed to function during regular timings, will have to adhere to the 4pm limit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-districts-to-bring-back-curbs-from-today-amid-delta-plus-variant-fears-101624850771346.html

The normal date for monsoon arrival over Delhi is June 27.Subdued rainfall activity is very likely to prevail over northwest and central India during the next five days and over western parts of peninsular India from June 28 onwards. Isolated or scattered thunderstorm activity accompanied with lightning and rainfall is also likely over these regions during this subdued monsoon activity period.Under the influence of strong moist southwesterly winds; fairly widespread to widespread rainfall very likely over West Bengal, Sikkim and northeastern states during the next five days. Isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall very likely over sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam and Meghalaya during the next five days; subsequently, moist easterly winds are likely to pickup in strength, causing enhanced rainfall activity all along the Himalayan foothills regions of north Bihar, north Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand around July 1 and 2, leading to increased inflow into the rivers originating or flowing over these regions, according to IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-progress-in-monsoon-rains-remain-subdued-101624848250927.html

The Jammu and Kashmir administration has decided that the annual Amarnath Yatra will be kept symbolic, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha said on June 21."Shri Amarnathji Yatra cancelled in wake of Covid-19 Pandemic. Decision after threadbare discussion with Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board members. Yatra to be symbolic only. However, all the traditional religious rituals shall be performed at the Holy Cave Shrine as per past practice," Sinha's office tweeted.Manoj Sinha also directed officials to make arrangements so that devotees can virtually attend the morning and evening ‘aartis’ at the cave shrine. This will allow them to pay obeisance while avoiding travel and exposure to the infection, Sinha said. He also stressed the need to follow Covid-19 protocol on the significant and pious days like pratham pooja and samapan pooja. He further said that saints visiting the shrine cave to perform aarti should follow Covid-19 appropriate behavior.The shrine board has put in place a virtual and televised mechanism for live darshan of aarti from the holy cave.Nitishwar Kumar, CEO of Amarnath Shrine Board said that both morning telecast of aarti at 6am and evening aarti at 5pm, each for 30 minutes, is to be live-streamed on Shri Amarnath ji Shrine board official website and the app specifically dedicated for the devotees, reported news agency ANI.

28-06-2021||India||When can kids go back to school?: AIIMS director has an answer||AIIMS director Randeep Guleria has said vaccination is the way out of the coronavirus pandemic as he gave a timeline for the availability of jabs for children against Covid-19, which so far has not affected them in a big way. Guleria acknowledged that children have lost on learning out as schools have remained shuttered in the last one-and-half years because of the pandemic. “Schools have to be reopened and vaccination can play an important role in that,” the senior doctor was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. The chief of India’s premier All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences said that making the Covid-19 vaccine available for children will be a milestone achievement and pave the way for the reopening of schools and resumption of outdoor activities for them.Guleria also said vaccines could be available for children in India around September when data from Phase two and three trials of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin on those in the age group of two to 18 years is expected. The Covid-19 vaccine could be given to children after the Drugs Controller General of India’s (DGCI’s) approval, Dr Guleria said. "If the Pfizer vaccine gets approval before that, then it can also be an option for children," Dr Guleria told PTI on Saturday.Also read | Possible 3rd wave of Covid unlikely to affect children, reveals WHO-AIIMS surveyThe news agency cited a senior government official as saying that Zydus Cadila is may also soon apply to the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) for emergency use authorisation for its Covid-19 vaccine, ZyCoV-D, which it claims can be given to both adults and children. "So, if the Zydus vaccine gets approval, it will be another option," Dr Guleria said.NITI Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said earlier this month that along with Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, Zydus Cadila's jab is also being tested on children. "Child cohort is not a small one. My rough guess is that if it is between 12 to 18 years, this itself is about 13 to 14 crore population for which we will need about 25-26 crore doses. We cannot have some people getting and others not getting. So we will have to take this into account when we strategize and make a decision based on how many doses of which vaccines are available,” Paul said.He further shared that not only Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, Zydus Cadila's vaccine is also being tested on children."So when Zydus comes for licensure soon, maybe we have enough data to take a view on whether the vaccine can be given in children," Paul said.Only Pfizer’s vaccine is approved for use in children across the world.Also read | Children can get and spread Covid infection': Centre clarifies 3 points amid 3rd waveSeveral experts have said that children will be affected the most in a possible third wave of the pandemic. A State Bank of India (SBI) research document has also said that children could be the next vulnerable group in the third wave, which could be as severe as the second and last for an average duration of 98 days. In its five-page report, SBI said the impact of any possible third wave of the pandemic could be significantly minimised by rigorous vaccination and providing better health infrastructure.Also read | Need more data to begin Covid-19 vaccination for children at large: ICMR DG“So vaccination should be the key priority, especially for the children who could be the next vulnerable group. With around 15-17 crore children in the 12-18 age bracket, India should go for an advanced procurement strategy like that adopted by developed nations to inoculate this age group," the SBI report said. However, the apprehension that children will be more affected or have greater illness severity in the possible third wave has been dismissed. The government has said that even though Covid-19 has not impacted children greatly so far but if the coronavirus’ behaviour changes or there are shifts in epidemiology dynamics they are likely to be affected. It has formed a national expert group formed to review Covid-19 among children and approach the pandemic in a new way and reinforce the nation's preparedness for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-can-kids-go-back-to-school-aiims-director-has-an-answer-101624846206379.html

28-06-2021||India||Jammu airbase attack: Use of drones poses new security risk||Rahul Singhrahul.singh@hindustantimes.comNEW DELHI The attack on an Indian Air Force base in Jammu on Sunday — believed to be the first-ever offensive use of drones to target an Indian military facility — is a watershed in asymmetric warfare and underlines the need for the armed forces to build capabilities to deter, detect and neutralise such aerial threats, people familiar with the developments said.While the IAF has officially only confirmed that two low-intensity explosions took place in the technical area of Jammu air force station, senior officials and experts said that the attack appeared to have been carried out using drones and marked a new chapter in Pakistan’s proxy war against India in Jammu and Kashmir.It is a serious and dangerous development, and steps need to be taken to deal with the drone threat, said Air Vice Marshal Sunil Nanodkar (retired), a former assistant chief of air staff. “It appears to be a trial run by the adversary to gauge India’s capability to detect small targets that can fly across the border and target Indian installations.”It is no secret that Pakistan-backed terrorist groups and its Inter-Services Intelligence have been using drones to smuggle arms, ammunition and drugs across the border into J&K and Punjab, but never have drones been used before for attacking a military base.“We need to beef up our surveillance capabilities, especially to pick up radar signatures of small drones that are capable of causing significant damage. The military also needs to invest in anti-drone capability,” Nanodkar said.The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has developed anti-drone technology to disable or shoot down hostile drones. The anti-drone system, which was deployed during 2020 Republic Day and Independence Day, has a range of two to three kilometres with radar capability to pick up the drone and then use frequencies to jam the unmanned aerial vehicle.The attack comes four months after the Indian and Pakistani militaries announced on February 25 that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the Line of Control from the midnight of February 24.“The ceasefire is meaningless if the new tactic is to carry out such attacks. The adversary appears to be testing not just what damage these drones are capable of causing but also India’s response,” said a senior official, one of the people cited above.A top official said that the investigation into the Jammu attack was being conducted on highest priority. Defence minister Rajnath Singh spoke to IAF vice chief Air Marshal HS Arora regarding the Jammu incident even as Western Air Command chief Air Marshal Vivek Chaudhari flew from Delhi to Jammu to take stock of the situation.In February, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane talked about the imaginative and offensive use of drones in Idlib and then in the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. In Syria’s Idlib, Turkish forces had successfully used drones to carry out attacks against Syrian tanks, air defence systems and other assets. Also, Azerbaijan made extensive use of Kamikaze drones to target and inflict losses on Armenian forces in a conflict last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-airbase-attack-use-of-drones-poses-new-security-risk-101624844387551.html

According to officials, the attack is believed to be the first-ever use of drones to target an Indian military facility.Multiple teams, including a team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), joined the probe and Jammu and Kashmir’s director general of police Dilbag Singh said that the twin blasts were part of a “terror attack”.Here is what we know about the blasts so far:-- The first of the two blasts took place around 1.37am on Sunday. The second, which was lower in intensity, followed after a few minutes at 1.42am.-- The blasts were reported at the high-security technical area of the Jammu airport that is manned by the IAF in the Satwari area on the outskirts of the city.-- A bomb disposal squad and forensic experts rushed to the spot soon after the blasts were reported.-- The blasts put defence minister Rajnath Singh, chief air chief marshal RKS Bhadauria and vice air chief air marshal HS Arora among other top officials in action. All are reported to be monitoring the situation constantly.-- A high-level IAF team is also looking into the incident. “There was no damage to any equipment. An investigation is in progress along with civil agencies,” the IAF’s official Twitter handle said.-- The police have registered a First Information Report (FIR) under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in the case, according to DG Dilbag Singh. “A drone with payload in both the blasts at Jammu airfield is suspected to have dropped the explosive material. The police have registered an FIR and investigation is on,” Singh said.-- Two suspects were detained by the J&K police on Sunday for questioning. The “possible target of the drones was the aircraft parked in the dispersal area”, according to an official concerned.The blasts come days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with the top political parties of the Union territory and announced that that election would be held there once delimitation is carried out, two years after the special status of the erstwhile state was revoked in October 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-iaf-station-blasts-drones-used-to-carry-out-terror-attacks-2-detained-101624838814674.html

He said the trial was almost complete and the government might be able to start administering this vaccine to children of 12-18 age group by end of July. “Trial for Zydus Cadila vaccine is almost complete. By July end or in August, we might be able to start administering this vaccine to children of 12-18 age group,” Arora said.Zydus Cadila is likely to soon apply for emergency use authorisation for its vaccine ZyCoV-D, which it claims can be given to both adults and children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-covid-wave-likely-to-be-delayed-may-hit-by-dec-govt-body-chief-101624841266259.html

The police have registered an FIR and investigation is on,” Singh said.The first blast at the airport, which is used for VVIP movement and armed forces’ strategic operations, took place at 1:37am, causing minor damage to the roof of a building, and the second one – said to be weaker in intensity – was reported at 1:42am in an open area, according to an IAF official.Singh said the police and other agencies were working with IAF officials to ascertain the specifics. A team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) was also at the spot.The air force said the blasts were also being probed by a high-level IAF team. “There was no damage to any equipment. Investigation is in progress along with civil agencies,” the IAF’s official Twitter handle said.There have been several incidents of Pakistan-based terrorists using drones in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir to drop arms, ammunition, drugs and money to fuel terrorism in the region. But experts indicated that drones have previously not been engaged by terrorists to carry out attacks.Following a series of back-channel contacts between Indian and Pakistani security officials, the two countries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in February. The truce has largely held, helping to ease bilateral tensions, though recent reports have suggested the back-channel contacts have stalled.Pakistan has also issued several strong statements in recent weeks about what it claims were the Indian government’s plans to carry out more changes in Jammu and Kashmir. India has rejected these statements, noting that Kashmir is an integral part of the country and Pakistan’s comments amounted to interference in internal affairs.On Sunday, the J&K Police said they had detained two people for questioning over the blasts. An official, who asked not to be named, said the “possible target of the drones was the aircraft parked in the dispersal area”.Another official said that the first blast created a hole in the rooftop of the building, indicating the use of “adequate amount of explosives”.Soon after the second blast, a bomb disposal squad and forensic experts rushed to the site, the official said on condition of anonymity.The incident comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi told political leaders from Jammu and Kashmir that elections would be held there once delimitation is carried out, two years after the special status of the erstwhile state was revoked.Defence minister Rajnath Singh is currently in Leh to take stock of the security scenario. A senior official said in New Delhi that the defence minister was expected to review the security situation in Jammu. The defence minister’s office said he spoke to Vice Air Chief, Air Marshal HS Arora, over the airport incident.It was not immediately clear from where the drones took off and investigations were underway to track their flight path, an official told news agency PTI.Investigators scanned CCTV footage, including from cameras installed on the boundary walls of the airport. The aerial distance from the Jammu airport to the international border is about 14km, the official said.While officials were investigating the drone attack, a person, suspected to be linked to Lashker-e-Taiba, was arrested along with an improvised explosive device (IED) weighing around 6kg, the DGP said.“The suspect has been detained and is being interrogated. More suspects are likely to be picked up in this foiled IED blast attempt,” Singh said.The Jammu airport is a civil airport with the runway and the ATC (air traffic control) under the IAF.Jammu airport’s director Pravat Ranjan Beuria told PTI there was no disruption in flight operations due to the explosions. “Flights to and from Jammu airport are operating as per schedule,” he said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-iaf-station-hit-by-2-explosions-101624835090782.html
28-06-2021||India||Number Theory: North-east, Delhi have biggest rain shortfall this year||In India, June 1 to September 30 is officially considered as the monsoon season. The actual amount of rainfall during this period varies from year to year. The first month of the monsoon this year has been exceptionally good – in total, monsoon rainfall until June 27 this year (up to 8.30am) is 173.15 mm.This is the 20th highest cumulative rainfall for this period since 1901, the earliest period for which data is available with the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).To be sure, not all parts of India have received abundant rains. Delhi, which is perhaps having the worst phase of an extended summer season right now, is among one of them. But it is not the only rainfall deficit region. North-eastern states have the biggest rainfall deficit this monsoon season. Here are four charts which summarise the progress of the monsoon so far.Windfall gain in cumulative rainfall seems to be evaporatingBecause rains vary each year, the standard practice to measure yearly variation is to compare a year’s rainfall with what is called the Long Period Average (LPA). This is the rainfall over a region in a given interval averaged over a long time period – IMD currently uses data from 1961 to 2010 as LPA. The year’s monsoon began with a bang. Rainfall on June 1 was 83.7% more than the LPA and 18th highest in absolute terms since 1901. However, it lost momentum in the first week – on June 8, cumulative rainfall was 23.8% more than LPA. This mark-up increased to 46.8% by June 20 and was at 22.9% on June 27. As stated above, cumulative rainfall so far is the 20th highest since 1901.The headline rainfall number hides regional variationsNot all regions have received higher than usual rainfall though. An HT analysis of IMD’s gridded database – each grid is a box covering 0.25 degrees longitude and latitude on the map – brings this out clearly. Of the 613 districts in the 2011 census (Delhi’s districts merged as one, while 19 districts are too small or irregular in shape to be captured by a grid) for which this calculation is possible, 305 have received “excess” to “large excess” rainfall compared to the LPA. The remaining 308 districts have received “normal” to “large deficient” rain. Most districts with a large excess of rainfall so far are located in the gangetic plains or in central India. “Large excess” rainfall has been reported in 12 of 13 districts in Uttarakhand, 41 of 71 districts in Uttar Pradesh, 27 of 38 districts in Bihar, 10 of 24 districts in Jharkhand, 4 of 19 districts in West Bengal, and 23 of 50 districts in Madhya Pradesh.At the state level, Manipur has the biggest shortfall in cumulative rainfall, while Delhi is ranked second. Many other north-eastern states also have a deficit rainfall when compared to the LPA. To be sure, a higher percentage deficit with the LPA does not tell us anything about the actual rainfall in a region, because LPAs themselves vary drastically. For example, even with a 57% deficit from LPA, Manipur cumulative rainfall is 109.7 mm, much more than Delhi’s 23.32 mm which has a 53.1% deficit from LPA.Heavy rainfall days have not seen a big jump so farThe nature of rain matters as much as the quantity of rain in a monsoon season. Theoretically, cumulative rainfall will be the same whether it rains in short spells consistently, or very heavily over just a few days. Heavy rainfall also causes damage such as flashfloods and waterlogging. The IMD actually classifies rainfall as light intensity (or of 7.5mm or less in 24 hours in a grid), moderate intensity (7.5mm-35.5 mm in 24 hours in a grid) and heavy and extreme intensity (greater than 35.5mm in 24 hours in a grid). An HT analysis shows that in absolute terms, it is light and moderate rain, which has been exceptionally high this year – ranked 5th and 10th highest respectively since 1901. Heavy and extreme rainfall this monsoon so far is only 37th highest. In terms of the share of these intensities in total rainfall, the share of heavy and extreme rainfall is the 24th lowest. As is to be expected, there are regional variations here as well. The share of heavy and extreme rainfall this year is the 10th highest since 1901 in Uttarakhand, and 22nd highest in Bihar and 25th highest in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northeast-delhi-have-biggest-rain-shortfall-this-year-101624834290173.html
28-06-2021||India||Covishield may not be eligible for ‘vaccine passport’ by the EU||Travellers vaccinated with Covishield, the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine manufactured in India, may not be eligible for the European Union’s “Green Pass” – an immunity document that is meant to ease travel within and to the bloc, according to reports citing official rules.The European Union had earlier said that member states can issue the certificates regardless of the type of Covid-19 vaccine, but the technical specifications indicate that the pass will be limited to “vaccines that have received EU-wide marketing authorization”.At present, four vaccines have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that can be used by the EU member states to issue the certificates. These are Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech), Moderna, Vaxzervria (AstraZeneca-Oxford), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson).Vaxzevria and Covishield are both the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccines. While the India-made Covishield has not been recognised by the EMA yet, the Vaxzevria version of the Astrazeneca shot produced and manufactured in the UK or other sites around Europe is approved, the reports said.A majority of people in India have received Covishield, manufactured locally by Pune-based Serum Institute of India.It is, however, unclear how much of an impact these certificates will have on Indian travellers. The certificate is mainly meant for EU citizens but other countries can obtain the certificate too — if they can convince authorities in an EU country they’re entering that they qualify for one.Covishield is also at the core of the World Health Organization’s Covax programme meant to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines to low- and middle-income countries.While these four vaccines have been approved by EMA, countries within the 27-member bloc can accept other vaccines as part of their own travel rules, the reports added.The EU has been working for months on the joint digital travel certificate for those vaccinated, freshly tested, or recently recovered from the virus. The free certificates, which will contain a QR code with advanced security features, will allow people to move between European countries without having to quarantine or undergo extra coronavirus tests.Several EU countries have already begun using the system, including Spain, Germany, Greece, and Poland. The rest are expected to start using it July 1.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-may-not-be-eligible-for-vaccine-passport-by-the-eu-101624822761510.html
28-06-2021||India||US, Kuwait deported nearly 4,000 Indians after Covid-19 pandemic broke||Thousands of Indians, mostly in the US and Kuwait, were deported to the country via special flights after completing their prison term during the past year, according to a report compiled by the external affairs ministry’s Covid Cell unit mentioning the flight operations during the Covid pandemic.The US and Kuwait alone sent back 4,000 deportees. Some Indians also returned by amnesty flights, said the report compiled by the external affairs ministry giving details about the Vande Bharat Mission, India’s largest repatriation exercise launched on 7 May last year to bring back citizens stranded abroad due to the pandemic.“These flights were mostly operated by Govt. of Kuwait to send to India those people who had turned illegal on expiry of their visa in that country. The Govt. of Kuwait paid for these amnesty flights and also indicated that the workers on return to India could re-apply for work visa at a later date,” the report said.“Another category of people who returned to India were deportees, a category of people who, upon completion of a prison sentence in their country, needed to be brought back to India by special flights at the expenses of the sending countries,” it added.HT has reviewed the ministry’s review report that documents the execution of VBM that was announced suddenly, the dilemma of the state governments, and the challenges encountered in the evacuation of citizens and the workarounds adopted.The states were preoccupied with inter-state movement of migrant workers and were faced with the dilemma of allowing stranded Indians return home while migrant workers at home were still held back and facing hardships,” it said, noting that the states feared “political backlash” for restraining movement of internal migrant workers while allowing VBM returnees.According to the aviation ministry the repatriation exercise, which has brought 2.06 million passengers to India so far, is currently in its 11th phase. But the most critical phase of the operation was completed by December 2020 when most Indians were brought back. The repatriation flights were later termed as international flights under bilateral “air bubble” arrangements with 24 countries. In addition, about 100 patients were also brought into the country by air ambulances for medical treatment.The report acknowledged that Indians in remote areas of Latin America and Caribbean countries, West Africa and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries could not be covered because of geographical distances and logistical hurdles due to internal lockdowns in these regions.“Also, VBM operations to specific locations in those regions were not found to be economically viable. Gathering stranded Indians to a hub, say, to either Panama City or Sao Paulo was explored but found not feasible. Plans to bring them to the US and put them on VBM flights did not materialise for the same reasons as well as due to visa issues… Ethiopian Airlines with an extensive network in African region was useful in bringing back stranded Indians in remote parts,” it said.The report underlined that the return of Indians by foreign carriers required approval of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The Covid Cell headed by the external affairs ministry, which was coordinating the repatriation of citizens, had to go to the civil aviation regulator for approvals on a case-by-case basis, notwithstanding DGCA’s reluctance to encourage these options that may inadvertently pose competition to VBM flights.“It required considerable persuasion with DGCA to get approvals on a case-by-case basis. In all, about 3,000 stranded Indians were evacuated from Peru, Columbia, Bolivia, Panama, Chile, Venezuela, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize, etc. and from the Caribbean region – Antigua, Barbados, Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, St. Lucia etc.” the report added.The Centre also allowed chartered flights to fly passengers in coordination with state governments and DGCA without the external affairs ministry or its missions. “This simplified procedure greatly helped Indian associations to expeditiously bring back stranded Indians in large numbers,” the report said, stressing that such chartered flights brought back 1.2 million people by October 2020, overtaking the number of passengers brought in by the VBM flights.“Notwithstanding, VBM flights commenced operations on 7th May 2020, although a decision to begin VBM was sudden, State Governments, Missions and relevant Ministries/Departments adjusted to the demands rather well,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-kuwait-deported-nearly-4-000-indians-after-covid-19-pandemic-broke-101624821100113.html
28-06-2021||India||Will never let go off AIADMK, says Sasikala in new audio clips||Chennai: In a fresh set of five audio clips released on Sunday, expelled All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) interim general secretary V K Sasikala has reportedly asserted that she will never let go of the party and will “set it alright”.In a conversation with former AIADMK cadre Balu, who joined the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), Sasikala is heard saying: “Chinamma will never let go of the party. I will set it all right.”The former AIADMK leader’s remarks came after Balu reportedly complained to her about the alleged rising caste and religious divisions in the AIADMK. The complaint was about accusations that former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami was nurturing his Gounder community that is predominant in Tamil Nadu’s western region from where he hails, and of sidelining people belonging to other castes, including the Mukkalathurs to which Sasikala and former deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam belong.Without naming Palaniswami or referring to his position, Sasikala said that before going to prison, she chose him as chief minister to recognise the goodwill of the people of the western region, which is popularly known as the Kongu region.“Kongu people are extremely affectionate towards our thalaivar (M G Ramachandran) and Amma (J Jayalalithaa). They are used to voting only for the AIADMK. I considered their affection and wanted to show recognition to them, so I handed over it (the post) to him. I did not have any other intention and at that time, I didn’t think anything.”She also insisted that the AIADMK has never functioned based on caste in the past.In 2017, both Palaniswami and Panneerselvam had buried their differences and ousted Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran from their party. The duo has since been running the party jointly as co-coordinator and coordinator, respectively. In 2018, Dhinakaran floated the AMMK along with rebel AIADMK MLAs and other supporters of Sasikala.AIADMK had recently expelled 16 party cadre for speaking to Sasikala, after passing a resolution stating that her phone conversations are ‘drama’.In a set of audio clips released a few days ago, Sasikala had said that the AIADMK and AMMK would have won the April 6 elections had they merged.While Palaniswami and Panneerselvam’s renewed cold war over power struggle worked to Sasikala’s advantage to reclaim the party, she hasn’t been able to draw in any of the prominent faces.Both Palaniswami and Panneerselvam, who are now leader of opposition and deputy leader of opposition in the assembly, respectively, have paused their power tussle and put up a united front against Sasikala. However, amid Palaniswami’s growing clout, Panneerselvam with little support was seen as softening towards Sasikala.“We have decided not to do anything in a hurry,” an AIADMK leader who is in support of Panneerselvam and Sasikala joining hands, said on condition of anonymity. “We have to work towards the upcoming local body elections, so it is better not to create any confusion now among the cadre.”Political experts believe AIADMK’s further course of action depends on whether the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) decides to go ahead with graft charges against Palaniswami and Panneerselvam as promised in its election manifesto.While in the opposition, the MK Stalin-led DMK had submitted a laundry list of corruption charges against the AIADMK leadership and their top ministers and promised to follow through via the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption and by appointing a special court for prosecution.“Stalin has had a respectful relationship so far with both of them, so we will have to wait and watch if Stalin will file such serious charges against them,” political commentator Durai Karunanidhi said. “If he does and causes Palaniswami and Panneerselvam to fall, the top leadership who owe their positions to Sasikala may seek her leadership. It’s doubtful if the grassroots cadre will support that though.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-never-let-go-off-aiadmk-says-sasikala-in-new-audio-clips-101624822268345.html
28-06-2021||India||Covid fight key focus of Stalin’s tenure||Chennai: It has been a little over 50 days since chief minister MK Stalin began his innings with no fanfare amid a raging pandemic. His team hit the ground as soon as they took charge on May 7 to contain the second wave of Covid-19. Stalin decided to hold a restricted swearing-in ceremony. He wrote to his cadre even before elections to celebrate the DMK victory inside their homes and continues to write to party workers not to gather on roads to greet him every time he visits a district to review pandemic-control measures. Having put the seriousness of the pandemic over celebrations of returning to power after 10 years and prioritising it over every other issue for an entire month are early signs of Stalin’s way of leadership. It’s different from that of his late predecessors, including his father M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa. They were quick to outdo one another, rename schemes and projects soon after they returned to power. Stalin is choosing a different way forward, but he is also doing so by taking others along beyond his party lines. Stalin set up a committee of MLAs from all parties, which includes AIADMK’s former health minister C Vijayabhaskar, to advise the government on Covid-control measures, besides consulting experts. The committee takes decisions such as a lockdown, which has been ongoing since May 10.Stalin has shown no interest in renaming ‘Amma’ canteens, the flagship budget canteens introduced by Jayalalithaa that were replicated across the country. It was touted that the DMK would rename it an ‘Anna Canteens’ after party founder CN Annadurai. The petty expectations aren’t misplaced as a couple of days after election results were announced on May 3, a DMK party cadre had vandalised an Amma Canteen and removed Jayalalithaa’s portrait in Chennai, but Stalin instructed that it be cleaned up and expelled the cadre. “This is a clear message that the DMK will not tolerate nuisance and anti-social activities,” M Subramanian had said at that time who now holds health portfolio, the most important amid the pandemic. Ministers like him, who are handling significant ministries such as finance and education, appear frequently for press conferences, indicating democracy within the party. “The finance minister is speaking on temples, the Hindu endowments minister is handling Covid-19 (as additional in-charge, Chennai) and the industries minister is speaking on education. From the way the ministries are functioning, they are demonstrating real collective responsibility,” says political commentator Maalan Narayanan. “I think the flip side of that, however, is fixing accountability becomes difficult because a minister could say it’s his personal opinion and it wasn’t an official statement.” Finance minister Palanivel Thiagarajan with his wrestling critiques has in fact captured pan-India attention more than his leader. Stalin providing a free hand to his team also comes from his position and confidence as the undisputed leader of the DMK after his father’s death. Party seniors too haven’t questioned his decisions. Stalin is drawing on his father’s legacy such as taking an oath as ‘Muthuvel Karunanidhi Stalin’ instead of ‘MK Stalin’ as he was introduced by governor Banwarilal Purohit. His first five orders on his first day as chief minister included a relief package for more than two-crore ration card holders affected due to the pandemic and free bus ride for women. On Karunanidhi’s 98th birth anniversary on June 3, he made six announcements including extending the free bus ride to trans persons and people with disabilities, a 250-crore multispeciality hospital in Chennai as well as an award and sops for Tamil writers. But he intends to forge his own ways by keeping with the times. He has changed the nomenclature of ministries and departments. Adding climate change to the environment and forest department and renaming personnel and administrative reforms department as human resources management department are examples.In his initial days, Stalin’s government was occupied making distress calls to the union government to increase oxygen allocation and the demand for vaccines is still ongoing. Stalin has written several times to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Covid-19-related requirements but always keeps the communication cordial. The state also led in announcing capital subsidies and opening a tender for investors to locally produce oxygen, oxygen cylinders and vaccines. The second wave is now being contained with deaths still being a concerning factor but the state was able to prevent large-scale deaths for want of oxygen.Covid-19 continues to keep Stalin and his new government occupied. Karunanidhi had a similar challenge after Annadurai’s death in office, when he dealt with a smallpox outbreak after taking charge in February 1969. Records of the fifth session of the state’s legislative assembly from March that year show that the then Harijan welfare minister, Sathyavani Muthu, had stated in the assembly that the situation was deadly from the spread of smallpox in Coimbatore. But, beyond that, the challenges are vastly different. “Reservation was a huge issue during Karunanidhi’s time and the DMK took up a socialist model in developing public sector undertakings, introducing welfare schemes which Jayalalithaa continued in her ways,” says Narayanan. “There aren’t many social issues now. Creating employment will be a task for the new government.” He adds that some of Karunanidhi’s announcements are still in vogue. “That’s a main difference I see so far in their leadership as Karunanidhi had clear goals if not a vision,” says Narayanan. “Covid-19 has occupied Stalin so far and his government is firefighting. It appears that Stalin is yet to set his goals. What is clear is that he wants to build goodwill and be known as a non-controversial chief minister.”On that aspect, Stalin’s pick for bureaucrats and ministers is much talked about. “It’s a mixed bag,” says Jayaram Venkatesan, founder, Arappor Iyakkam, an anti-corruption movement in Tamil Nadu. “The four secretaries to the chief minister and the chief secretary are people with high integrity which shows that there is an attempt to clean up the government. But, on the other side, it is concerning that he has given people facing cases and complaints ministership in departments from where there is potential for corruption, such as highways, public works, and municipal administration.” At least ten cases are pending with the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption against the previous AIADMK regime that are filed by Arappor Iyakkam.Beyond the boundaries of the state, Stalin’s role on the national platform is beginning to emerge. His father had been a partner with the union government as well as played an active role in rallying the opposition together. ‘Uravukku kai koduppom; urimaikku kural Koduppom’ was Karunanidhi’s adage meaning, “Let’s lend a hand for the relationship; raise our voice for our rights.” Stalin recalled this after his first meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi on June 17. They had a ‘cordial meeting’, Stalin told one of close aides in Delhi having submitted a list of 25 demands to the union government.The meeting would set the stage for the relationship between Delhi and the southern state which is now increasingly vocal on federalism and state autonomy. Stalin has written to his counterparts in mostly non-BJP- ruled states to come together on two issues -- objecting the draft Indian Ports Bill, 2021 and calling for moratorium for small businesses. He urged them to come together like they had for the union government to revise its vaccine policy and procurement. For now, the state BJP is uncomfortable over an issue of nomenclature. Stalin and his government has been referring to the government of India as Ondriyam (union), a deviation from Madhiya (centre), keeping in line with the Constitution that India is a union of states. The BJP, which believes that fringe elements are being emboldened with this narrative, had last week sought to know in the assembly if the DMK has any ulterior motive. The chief minister replied that no one needs to fear, and he will continue addressing the BJP-led government in Delhi as ondriyam as it’s a ‘philosophy of federalism’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-fight-key-focus-of-stalin-s-tenure-101624821668264.html
28-06-2021||India||Tiger was killed in ‘unwarranted firing’ by forest guard: Official||The death of an adult male tiger last week on the fringes of Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) in Assam due to firing by forest personnel was unwarranted, an inquiry into the incident by a forest official revealed.The carcass of the 10-year-old tiger with a bullet wound was found on June 18 at Japoripathar village close to Kohora range of the park. The forest department had initially said that the death was due to “accidental firing while trying to scare away the tiger from the public area.”However, on Sunday, a statement by KNPTR stated that an inquiry into the incident conducted by an assistant conservator of forest revealed that the firing was unwarranted and based on its finding, the forest personnel responsible for the death was suspended.A post-mortem of the carcass had revealed bullet injury through lungs and heart of the animal, the statement informed.A day before it was shot, the tiger had killed a cow “probably because of the fact that it had three worn out canines while one was missing”.Three carcasses of tigers have been recovered from KNPTR this year.Earlier this month, the carcass of a four-year-old male tiger was found at Sidha Kathani area of the park.According to forest officials, the carcass bore multiple injury marks and it was stated that the tiger died after sustaining grievous injuries during a fight with another male tiger.The carcass of a female tiger cub with puncture marks on neck and broken ribs was found in the park in February. Forest officials said the cub, aged around 4 months, might have been killed by a bigger tiger.As per the 2017 census, Kaziranga had a population of 111 tigers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tiger-was-killed-in-unwarranted-firing-by-forest-guard-official-101624821548291.html
28-06-2021||India||More questions arise over land deal for Ram Temple||Descendants of the original owner of a key parcel of land in Ayodhya have decided to challenge its transfer to the Ram temple trust and say the 22-hectare plot, a part of the Ram temple complex, is tied up in two separate legal cases and a police complaint.Documents seen by HT and local officials say the 22,450 square metre land at Bag Bijaisi in Ayodhya – which is currently owned by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust – originally belonged to local resident Fakir Mohammad and his wife Bakhtar Bibi.Wahid Ahmed, one of Fakir’s descendants, said the ownership of the plot is currently disputed with several claimants in Fakir’s extended family. The Ayodhya additional commissioner’s court and the Ayodhya civil district court are hearing separate petitions on the plot’s ownership since 2017 and 2020, respectively, he added. HT has seen corresponding court documents.“We are left with no option but to challenge the registry to the trust in the high court. As the high court is not working at full capacity due to the pandemic, we will file the case once courts start functioning normally,” said Ahmed.The plot – which now comprises two adjacent tracts of 12,080 sqm and 10,370 sqm – is at the centre of an escalating political row over an allegation of corruption in the purchase of the land.Two weeks ago, two Opposition politicians alleged that on March 18 this year, Kusum Pathak sold the 12,080sqm plot for ₹2 crore to Sultan Ansari and Ravi Tewari, who then sold the land to the temple trust for ₹18.5 crore, 10 minutes later.The same day, the temple trust purchased the 10,370 sqm plot directly from Harish Pathak and Kusum Pathak for ₹8 crore.In response, the temple trust — a 15-member body overseeing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya — and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rejected the charges and said the land was bought at lower-than-market rates. Temple trust secretary Champat Rai said the land was officially registered only on March 18, adding that two transactions occurred on March 18: from Pathak to Ansari-Tewari, and Ansari-Tewari to the trust.But documents furnished by Ahmed and the Hazi Fakir Mohammad Waqf Khuda Rasool Trust, a 97-year-old body started according to Fakir’s will, showed that Pathak’s ownership over the plot was itself disputed – and tied up in two separate legal proceedings. HT has seen the Rasool trust’s documents claiming ownership.Moreover, Ahmed said the whole plot was registered as a waqf property under the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board, which means that market sale of the land needs prior permission.In the 1900s, Fakir and Bakhtar, who were childless, decided to constitute a trust, which would control the 22 hectare plot. Upon their death, ownership of the land passed to the Rasool trust set up according to Fakir’s will in 1924 and it was registered with the Waqf board.Under the UP law, land registered to the Waqf board is deemed to be dedicated for religious and charitable purposes and such are usually non-transferable. In their will, the couple also mandated that the custodian (mutawalli) of the land will be a relative, who will be selected by family and could be removed in case of irregularities. HT checked the legal documents that set up the trust.This arrangement held for 70 years but problems started in 1994 when the then custodian, Mahmud Alam died.In 1996, Mohammad Aslam, another descendant of Fakir, was appointed custodian of the land. But Alam’s four sons — Mahfuz Alam, Javed Alam, Noor Alam and Firoz Alam — refused to accept him and got the property registered in their names in 1997.In 2009, Mohammad Aslam approached the tehsil (sadar) office and asked that the 1997 registry be cancelled. After scrutinising papers, the tehsildar cancelled the registry, according to documents seen by HT. The four brothers challenged this decision and got their names back in the property papers in 2016.Mohammad Aslam died in 2015 but his relative, Mohammad Naeem, challenged the restoration of the four brother’s names in the property papers. Naeem filed a petition in the court of the additional commissioner (Ayodhya) on March 29, 2016.The court issued a stay order on September 1, 2017. HT has seen a copy of this order.“This stay order still continues till date. Despite the stay order, the four brothers made registry of the property to Kusum Pathak and Harish Pathak for ₹two crore on November 20, 2017,” said Ahmad.In January 2020, Ahmad and the Rasool trust challenged the transfer of the land to the Pathaks in the district court. “We pointed out that the property is a Waqf land and cannot be sold. Despite the stay order (from additional commissioner’s court) the property has been sold,” said Ahmad.In 2017, Ahmad also filed a complaint with the Waqf Board. “The Waqf board handed me a report on April 27, 2018, stating that the land at Bag Bijaisi is a Waqf property and cannot be sold,” said Ahmad. HT saw a copy of this letter.An FIR was also lodged at Ram Janmabhoomi police station against Mahfuz Alam, Javed Alam, Noor Alam and Firoz Alam on April 22, 2018. HT saw a copy of this FIR but the UP police refused to comment on any progress in the case.Sultan Ansari rejected Ahmed’s charges and termed the land purchase deal with the temple trust as legally bonafide.“The tehsil (sadar) had given a written order stating that the land at Bag Bijaisi is not a Waqf land. On this basis of this order the land deal was executed with the Ram Mandir Trust,” said Ansari. Tewari was not available for comment.The temple trust also refuted allegations of any irregularity in the land purchase deal. Mahant Dhinendra Das, chief of Nirmohi Akhara, who is member of the Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust said: “All papers of the land purchase deal made by the Ram Mandir Trust are in public domain. Anyone can see them. There is no irregularity.”“Anyone who carries out a shady land purchase deal never transfers the money through banks by the RTGS (real-time gross settlement) system directly into bank accounts of sellers,” said Dhinendra Das.The UP Waqf Board said it was verifying land records. “We have to check the land records first before making any public comment on the entire issue. It will take another couple of days for us to verify the land records with the board,” said Zufar Ahmed Farooqui, chairman of the board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-questions-arise-over-land-deal-for-ram-temple-101624821368246.html
28-06-2021||India||K'taka leadership row: BJP yet to act on dissensters||It’s been over a week since state party in-charge Arun Singh visited Karnataka, however, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is yet to take any action against legislators and leaders who made statements against chief minister BS Yediyurappa and his government, people aware of the developments said. The delay--or refusal--to act against detractors has indicated the possibility that the statements are part of the national leadership’s plans to replace Yediyurappa, they add. If this is to be believed, then it could mean that simmering dissent is likely to crop up again and likely to plunge the state into another round of political crisis during the Covid-19 pandemic. R Ashok, senior BJP leader and minister for revenue had said on June 18 that strict action will be taken against all those who issued statements “within a few days”. Even though Singh had warned against those making statements and even made it clear that Yediyurappa would continue as chief minister, the group of detractors continued to insinuate the possibility of a change in leadership. “Singh’s visit to Karnataka had nothing to do with leadership change. All party general secretaries were visiting their respective states and so did Singh,” said one BJP legislator, who identifies with the group seeking Yediyurappa’s removal. “It is only a matter of timing and who (replaces Yediyurappa) is the question,” the legislator said, requesting not to be named. Though Yediyurappa and legislators who have stood behind the chief minister, have made it clear that there will be no change in leadership, the free hand to the detractors appears to reignite the growing factionalism within the party in the state. Despite being known--or at least projecting--to be a cadre-based party where leaders are expected to toe the party line, there are several factions at work within the BJP. There are those who side with Yediyurappa, some who want him out, legislators who are part of the old-guard and at least one of the turncoats who defected from the Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) in 2019, people aware of the developments said. The party had issued a notice to Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand BJP legislator from Bijapur City and known critic of Yediyurappa in February, but he continues to make statements against the chief minister and his son, BY Vijayendra. Similarly, AH Vishwanath, one of the 17 legislators who defected to the BJP, has also openly called for Yediyurappa to be replaced. The likes of CP Yogeshwara, a minister in Yediyurappa’s cabinet, continues to travel to Delhi to convey his concerns to the national leadership. “I have told you earlier that I will not speak about politics in public and to ensure that it shouldn’t damage my party is why I have shared my pains between four walls. I have shared it with our top leaders from Delhi. I have written my exams, let us wait for results. You (media) also have patience and so shall I,” Yogeshwara said last week. Political analysts suspect that there are possibilities of talks going on despite the warnings from the national leadership on replacing Yediyurappa. “It appears as if nothing is settled,” A Narayana, a Bengaluru-based political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University told Hindustan Times. He added that contrary to popular belief, the BJP in Karnataka is a “combination of individual groups” and is not cohesive or coherent. The crisis in both national parties in Karnataka--BJP and Congress--adds to the already volatile political climate in the southern state. The Congress too continues to witness the battle between legislature party leader, Siddaramaiah and party president, DK Shivakumar, in a struggle to trump the other in the debate over the next chief ministerial face. The crisis in both parties has added to the uncertainty over questions of leadership with just two years left for the 2023 assembly elections. MB Patil, former minister and senior Congress leader on Sunday said that the party has not gone into any elections in Karnataka or other state by projecting any one leader or a chief ministerial candidate. He said that the party will go into the 2023 elections collectively and after it wins will take the opinion of MLAs and then the high command will decide. “Everyone has a wish to become chief minister and there is nothing wrong in it,” Patil said. “It does not work if people (leaders) call themselves chief ministers. People should want this . We can’t become chief minister if we give self certification,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-leadership-row-bjp-yet-to-act-on-dissensters-101624819568119.html

28-06-2021||India||Centre sets up portal to track management of Covid in rural areas||A new web portal that tracks how Covid-19 is being managed in rural areas of the country is the government’s latest tool to tackle the pandemic, said people involved with it.Named Covid dashboard, the portal helps policymakers and administrators to find out just how prepared rural India is in terms of manpower and infrastructure to meet the challenge posed by the pandemic.“India has more than 2.5 lakh gram panchayats. As more rural areas got affected by the second wave of the pandemic, these grassroots institutions have assumed immense significance with limited healthcare services available in the rural areas,” said a senior official involved with the dashboard on condition of anonymity.The dashboard, now available publicly, allows anyone to track the formation of village health and sanitation committees, enrolment of frontline workers and volunteers, or the creation of isolation centres in schools or panchayat buildings. This helps in identifying gaps and tracking the overall progress, said officials.As of now, activity on the dashboard isn’t much, but the government is hopeful that it would pick up pace once the village panchayats start uploading real-time data.The portal also shows the readiness of the panchayats in terms of home isolation kits, updating of community preparedness checklist, and the identification of high-risk individuals.“In the vaccination drive too, the panchayats now play a critical role. Dissemination of correct information, encouraging people to take vaccines, organising surveillance and campaigns are the key roles of the panchayat leaders,” said a second official.When the centralised vaccination programme was rolled out on June 21, 63.68% of the doses were administered in the rural areas, the government had said in a press release. This amounted to 56.09 lakh doses while the urban areas recorded the vaccination of 31.9 lakh people, the release said.V K Paul, member (health), NITI Aayog, recently said that more than half of the total vaccinations carried out in the country in the last few weeks happened in the rural areas. He said that with the spread of information technology, educating people about vaccines became possible, which has given the government more confidence about being able to cover all of rural India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-sets-up-portal-to-track-management-of-covid-in-rural-areas-101624818671668.html
28-06-2021||India||Believe in science, shed Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday encouraged people to overcome vaccine hesitancy and dispel rumours about India’s coronavirus inoculation drive, urging them to “believe in science” and scientists who toiled to develop the life-saving shots in the year of the pandemic.“Through the year, many senior scientists have worked and that is why we have to believe in science, believe in scientists. And (people) should explain to these propagators of falsehood that... it is not so, so many people have taken the vaccine, nothing untoward happens,” the PM said in the 78th edition of his Mann Ki Baat radio address.The PM cited his own example and that of his mother, who he said was nearly 100 years old, to say that both of them have taken the shots, appealing to people not to pay heed to any rumours about the safety of the vaccines against Covid-19.“I have myself been vaccinated with both doses... And my mother is close to a hundred years of age… she too has taken both doses. At times, some people develop fever but it’s very minor, just for a few hours… not getting vaccinated can prove dangerous,” Modi said.In his monthly address, he also lauded the progress of India’s vaccination drive and said the country has achieved many “extraordinary milestones” in the fight against the pandemic.“Just a few days ago, our country accomplished an unprecedented feat. On the 21st of June, the next phase of the vaccination campaign commenced… and that very day, the country registered a record of administering vaccines to over 86 lakh people, free of cost… that too on a single day! Such a huge number of free vaccinations by the Government of India,” he said.The Prime Minister made the statements at a time India has recorded its best week of vaccination figures since June 21, when the central government said it will take charge of supplying jabs free of cost instead of putting the procurement burden on state governments. Since then, the country has administered an average of over six million doses per day.However, this recent spike in vaccinations comes on the back of a month of slowdown, which saw fewer jabs administered daily and concerns raised by several state governments over the supply of shots.Experts, too, say that the pace of India’s immunisation drive still needs to pick up, because even at this rate (of six millions jabs per day), it would take India until February 2022 to vaccinate its entire adult population.Modi also cautioned against complacency and the notion that the pandemic has been defeated, underscoring the need to maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour and getting the jab.“We have to save lives…If someone says corona is gone, do not be under this mistaken notion... This ailment is like a master of disguise. It keeps changing its looks… surfaces in myriad new forms and colours. And to protect ourselves from it, we have two ways. One is adhering to the protocol for corona – wearing a mask, frequently washing hands with soap, maintaining distancing… and the other way is …along with all this, getting vaccinated,” he said.The PM was apparently referring to the second wave of infections that debilitated the health care infrastructure of several states in the country, including national capital New Delhi, between March and May this year. Scientists say the lack of social distancing and adherence to Covid hygiene, and the spread of a more transmissible virus variant are likely to have contributed to the sudden surge in cases in the country.PM Modi on Sunday said that the country will mark the National Day of Doctors on July 1, and it “is our duty to thank them with an equal measure of affection and encourage them”.Separately, the Prime Minister spoke about the upcoming Tokyo Olympics and advised people not to “pressure” the athletes and the sportspersons who have all had their “own share of struggle and years of toil”.“They are going not only for themselves but for the country... I want to advise you too, that we should not pressure these players knowingly or unknowingly, but support them with an open mind and bolster the enthusiasm of every player,” he said. The Olympic Games begin on July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/believe-in-science-shed-vaccine-hesitancy-modi-101624818608068.html
28-06-2021||India||States will get 120 million Covid-19 vaccine doses for July||The central government will distribute 120 million doses of coronavirus vaccines – 100 million shots of Covishield and 20 million of Covaxin – to all states and Union Territories for the month of July, according to advance information shared with them, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.These 120 million doses will make up for total Covid-19 vaccines being made available across the country through July – 75% of these will be given to states and Union Territories after being acquired by the Centre, and the remaining 25% will be acquired by private hospitals, as per the country’s new vaccine policy.This development comes on the heels of India recording its best week of vaccinations – an average of over 6 million doses has been administered every day in the country between June 21 and June 27 after the new phase of the government’s vaccine drive came into effect.Also Read| Covishield may not be eligible for ‘vaccine passport’ by the EUExperts, however, warned that the pace of daily vaccination may see a drop from what has been seen in the country the past week as 120 million doses spread across July translates to about 4 million doses a day.In June, 106 million doses were administered across the country (an average of 3.9 million doses through the month) till Sunday morning. To be sure, nearly 42 million of these have been administered just this week.The Union ministry of health and family welfare has been sharing the estimated number of vaccine doses available in a particular month with states before the start of the month as part of its advance visibility plan so that states and UTs can prepare and schedule vaccinations accordingly. “Providing information on availability of vaccine doses in advance helps states and Union Territories plan their vaccination distribution, and in turn slot allocation, schedule in a more effective way,” a senior health ministry official said on condition of anonymity.The Centre has devised a methodology to compute vaccine doses that need to be allotted to states, which includes pro-rata population of 18 years and above age group; the Covid-19 disease burden based on the number of active cases in each region; and progress of the vaccination drive there.Also Read| Can vaccine composition be changed? Here's what ICMR chief saysTwo vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — are currently part of the government’s vaccination programme. While Serum Institute of India locally manufactures the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine under the brand name Covishield, Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research co-developed Covaxin.Another Covid-19 vaccine, Russia-made Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya Institute, also received the national drugs regulator’s emergency use authorisation on April 13, and is now being administered at select private Covid-19 vaccination centres in the country under pilot mode.India has so far administered 371.8 million doses to 265.4 million people since January 16, 2021, when the national Covid-19 vaccination drive was launched. A total of 209 million people have received one dose, while 56.4 million people have been fully vaccinated till Sunday morning, according to government data.The government has, however, said it plans to scale up vaccinations.“We are preparing to administer close to 10 million doses in a single day by August. The programme will get an increased vaccine supply in coming months,” said Dr NK Arora, chairman of the working group on Covid-19 vaccines.However, an ambitious target of 10 million doses a day will depend almost entirely on supplies, as the country has shown it has the infrastructure and manpower to give close to that many doses a day (8.6 million doses were administered on June 21). To hit this target throughout August, the country would need more than 300 million doses in that month.Also Read| 'Making Covid-19 vaccines available for kids would be milestone achievement’While Covishield supplies have been ramped up by the Serum Institute of India to produce 100 million doses a month, scaling up monthly Covaxin supplies may take longer, even though the Centre announced in the past that Covaxin production could go up to 100 million doses per month by September, an official said, asking not to be named.“The current production capacity is 25 million doses per month and this is likely to be maintained till August-September this year, after which more supplies will happen,” one of the executives of Bharat Biotech told HT last week, on condition of anonymity, adding that it looked like by the end of this year, a target of 60-70 million doses was likely.On June 8, the Centre placed orders for 440 million doses – 250 million doses of Covishield and 190 million of Covaxin – to be procured from August onwards, in addition to an advance order of 300 million doses placed with Hyderabad-based Biological E’s vaccine and will be delivered by December. The Biological E vaccine is currently in Phase 3 trials.Experts stressed that based on current supply rates, covering the country’s entire eligible population may take longer than anticipated.“The way our vaccination programme is going, be it insufficient vaccine supplies or other logistical issues, it is going to take a lot of time before the entire target population is covered. Even 8 million a day is not enough if you really want to cover the target population fast enough. Therefore, what is more important is to implement other measures also to break the chain of transmission such as effective messaging regarding strict adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour; maintaining good hygiene, etc,” said Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital.Clinicians stressed the need to take the vaccine to attain protection against the viral disease.“There are different variants of the virus in circulation; therefore, people should hasten to get the shot as it will provide protection against the disease,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-will-get-120-million-vaccine-doses-for-july-101624818248020.html

28-06-2021||Today's||In Punjab, the Congress is its own worst opponent||In 2014, it took Sonia Gandhi just one phone call to make Captain Amarinder Singh agree to be the Congress candidate against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Arun Jaitley in Amritsar. Disinclined though to contest the Lok Sabha elections, he agreed without demur.The Captain won and was appointed the party’s deputy leader in the House under Mallikarjun Kharge. He exited Parliament before the 2017 assembly polls, leading the Congress to a thumping victory in Punjab, mopping up 77 of the 117 seats in a triangular fight with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).For some inexplicable reasons, it was only in the closing phases of the poll campaign that Rahul Gandhi, who became Congress president later that year, projected Singh as the party’s chief ministerial face at a rally in the SAD’s Amritsar stronghold of Majitha. Very much present at the stage then was Navjot Singh Sidhu.The wheel has since moved full circle. In the changed scenario, Sidhu is seeking to anchor the opposition within and Kharge is leading a three-member in-house audit of the chief minister’s delivery record on poll-time promises. The dissidents include a clutch of ministers and members of the legislative assembly upset with the bureaucracy’s disproportionate clout. But Sidhu is most vociferous in the attacks on his 79-year-old senior he accused of being a habituated liar in an interview to this newspaper.Also Read | Navjot Sidhu to meet Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi amid Congress infightingThe cricketer-turned-politician has raised many issues of malfeasance and unkept assurances. Of greater political import is the quashing by the high court of a botched police probe into the 2015 sacrilege incidents under the previous SAD regime. A new special investigation team (SIT) constituted on the court’s diktat in May is mandated to submit its report in six months on the impiety that led to police firing on outraged protesters.The officer who steered the first SIT, which incurred the judiciary’s wrath, joined AAP during Arvind Kejriwal’s recent visit to Amritsar, where the latter was all sugar and honey about Sidhu who had ambled up and then quickly distanced from the AAP in the lead up to the last elections. Quite clearly, the internal Congress discord and the spectacle the central leadership has made of the stock-talking exercise have afforded openings to its rivals to fish in troubled waters.The issues on the table came to a head after the court verdict in the desecration case which was a major factor in SAD’s electoral rout and the loss of the recognised-opposition status to the AAP. Sidhu’s in-the-face accusation of the CM being in cahoots with the Akali leadership has muddied the waters at a time the Congress should be preparing for next year’s elections. His swashbuckling ways, which are an electioneering asset, haven’t helped the patch-up efforts.Given that the differences were resolvable behind closed doors, the blame for the exacerbated crisis rests as much at the doorsteps of the central leadership. The Captain, for his part, has kept his counsel even as the inquirers and the dissidents are generous with sound bytes to TV channels. Having twice appeared before the Kharge panel, he has reasons to be displeased with the top leadership’s lack of contact with him amid a series of meetings Rahul Gandhi has held with ministers and legislators from the state.Equally unpalatable for the elected CM are suggestions that the committee has handed him an 18-point “to do” list. The claims made in interactions with the media will be ready-made talking points for the party’s opponents in the upcoming elections.Factionalism within was one reason why the Congress lost in Assam and Kerala. The malaise could similarly inflict the party in Punjab where even the Captain’s worst detractors rate him as its best bet in the 2022 battle. The emerging picture defies commonsense and realpolitik, more so when the CM is a phone call away from Sonia Gandhi and has passed most electoral tests post-2017, including the local body polls amid the farm agitation.In Punjab, the Congress is clearly its own worst enemy.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-punjab-the-congress-is-its-own-worst-opponent-101624889293290.html
28-06-2021||Today's||Tri-service commands: Use a strategy of persuasion||India is all set to create four new theatre commands and, in all likelihood, this will be announced by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi from the Red Fort on August 15. These new commands will be raised and operationalised over a two-year period and will be viable by August 2023.The new commands will include the integrated maritime theatre command (IMTC) and the integrated air-defence command (IADC), which had been earlier described as a low-hanging fruit in the radical rewiring of India’s higher defence management, a policy initiative that has been in stasis since the 1999 Kargil War. The other two commands will be China- and Pakistan-specific.PM Modi announced the creation of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) in his August 2019 Independence Day address. The first incumbent, General Bipin Rawat, assumed office on January 1, 2020, and this was welcomed as a much-needed but long-delayed first step in the reorganisation of India’s higher defence management (HDM).Also Read | Leadership, asset split key concerns for air force on theaterisation moveThe lack of “jointness”, integrated planning and synergy between the three armed forces, has been a distinctive feature of the Indian military. In particular, there here has been less-than-satisfactory utilisation of airpower, perhaps due to a degree of diffidence and lack of clarity in the use of trans-border military capability embedded in Indian strategic culture. India did not use its modest-but-credible airpower in October 1962 when China chose to teach Jawaharlal Nehru a lesson in realpolitik.And for the record, there was no reference to airpower in Galwan of 2020. Similarly, the 1999 Kargil War and the 1987 Indian Peace Keeping Force operation in Sri Lanka saw less than optimal integration of airpower in the military effort.Thus the need for more effective jointness/synergy among India’s three armed forces was acknowledged post-Kargil and the report of the Group of Ministers (2000) recommended the creation of the post of a CDS and a VCDS as the “first major step in establishing synergy and ‘jointness’ among the Armed Forces”. Very soon, the first integrated, tri-service command was established in Port Blair as the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), with then Vice-Admiral Arun Prakash as the first Commander-in-Chief. It was expected that, progressively, greater jointness/synergy would be nurtured and that India would move towards setting up such tri-service commands, wherein the sum of their individual assets under a single commander would be more effective than that of their individual verticals that were disparately located.However the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, at the time, was unable to pursue these initiatives with the requisite resolve and this went into the back-burner for over a decade. To his credit, PM Modi, after an indifferent scorecard in his first term in the domain of defence management, accorded this high priority in his second term, and hit the ground running.In August 2019, CDS was announced. In August, the new commands are on the anvil and the directive is that these commands should become operational in August 2023. This taut timeline and the visible political direction is commendable, but this long-delayed reform towards enabling greater jointness in India’s HDM will call for making haste slowly, and only after objective deliberation among the principal stakeholders.Recent media reports refer to a degree of dissonance within the military and the Indian Air Force has been painted as the dog-in-the-manger in the creation of the new commands. This is unfortunate and undesirable, whatever be the truth behind such aspersions.India’s integrated tri-service commands (one is hesitant to use the word theatre) can become truly effective only when all the interlocutors are brought onto the same page consensually and by persuasion. The reforms in HDM and related military command structure cannot be effectively realised by political diktat. Compliance can be ensured, albeit in a sullen manner, for, in a democracy, the political direction must be obeyed by the military but giving all the three forces a robust sense of ownership would lay stronger foundations.Thirty years after economic reforms, there are lessons for India as it embarks on the next phase of reforms in the defence domain. A combination of political leadership, technocratic talent, and willingness to build on work left behind by previous governments helped steer through the reforms. PM Modi has given the necessary direction and priority to reforming India’s defence management. Defence minister Rajnath Singh has an onerous responsibility and, given his political experience both as former party president and home minister, he would be able to provide the necessary political leadership and heft. But the rigorous staff work and internal deliberations within the government will have to be undertaken objectively and without any rancour and in a non-partisan manner. Effective and enhanced jointness to prevent another Galwan/Pulwama must be the objective.Commodore (retired) C Uday Bhaskar is director, Society for Policy Studies The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/triservice-commands-use-a-strategy-of-persuasion-101624888993405.html
28-06-2021||Today's||Reforms for a new India in the 21st century||This year, we mark 30 years of the deregulation of the Indian economy. It began, as some would argue, under the compulsion of the Fund and the Bank, with a looming balance of payment crisis. By then, the economy was almost completely constricted by the rule of licences, quotas and discretion, with no breathing space for enterprise. Suffocated as it was, the economy welcomed the breath of fresh air with the liberalisation of 1991. We recall the political will of Prime Minister (PM) PV Narasimha Rao and an abiding finance minister (FM) Dr Manmohan Singh for having pulled it through.If we commend that leadership for rescuing India from “falling off the cliff”, we also should condemn them for losing an entire decade for India, when they, under the leadership of the former FM-turned-PM, failed to carry on that momentum. It was a matter of sheer absence of political will and commitment.Just before that lost decade, PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee showed this political will and commitment in planning for the Goods and Services Tax (GST). However, that failed to take off between 2004 and 2014. Both GST and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) were passed by the Narendra Modi government in its first term.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), under PM Modi, believed and committed itself to deregulate our economy. It was stated in “minimum government, maximum governance”. The simple guiding philosophy, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas meant that there shall be no discretion or appeasement on any ground — no “first charge on the treasury” exclusively to anyone.Minimum government, maximum governance implies that both structural reforms and ease of doing are being undertaken. Disinvestment, deregulation, monetisation are happening equally as archaic laws are being banished, compliances are being brought down in number, and greater transparency is infused by the adoption of technology.Archaic laws, irrelevant even as they may be, were useful instruments for unscrupulous regulators. In the first term itself, PM Modi ensured the weeding out of 1,200 such laws, discarding 58 more in the second term.There were over 6,000 compliances affecting the common man’s daily life, spread between the Centre and the states, and across several departments. Working together with the states, we plan that by August 2022, the 75th anniversary of our Independence, citizens will have relief from these.Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas is the all-inclusive, non-discriminatory empowering objective. It clears out all the pitfalls and biases of all earlier attempts at welfarism. Equally, it settles the debate of welfare-versus-reforms for development. It is a philosophy which believes in empowerment and discourages patronage. The previous government’s emotional but stand-alone call to remove poverty, garibi hatao, failed because it was not well thought-through. It did not simultaneously build the necessary ecosystem for aspirational growth and choice for individuals.This is clear especially in how the PM Jan Dhan Yojana, coupled with the near saturation achieved in the Aadhaar, and spread of mobile usage — JAM, the triad for financial inclusion — in addition to Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), proved effective during the Covid-19 pandemic. This is especially stark, when the world over, governments were struggling to reach their poor, but in India, we repeatedly succeeded in crediting, at the click of a button, the necessary assistance and relief so needed by them.Not just JAM, a host of measures, carefully planned and executed with no discrimination, built the necessary environment for the poor to feel included without having to beg for it. Every eligible and volunteering household got electricity (Ujala), a toilet (Swachhata) and a clean cooking medium (Ujjwala). Individuals and families receive cashless health care (Ayushman) and Life and Accident cover (Jeevan Jyoti Suraksha Bima). The smallest of businesses who have no security to offer can avail Mudra loans from ₹50,000- ₹10 lakh. Svanidhi scheme, which was launched during the pandemic, gives street vendors and small eateries collateral-free credit up to ₹10,000. More than 2.5 million such vendors have availed this through the banks. Using drones, accurate land records are being created. In rural areas, it is particularly empowering for the poor to be given a “record of rights” of their possessions, whatever their size.The remarkable feature of each one of these schemes is in its execution. Unless somebody refused a benefit, every eligible citizen received it, a granular approach to inclusion. The scale of coverage and the last-mile delivery within five years can be studies in governance.Factor market reforms are crucial for development. The three Farm Acts were undertaken after extensive consultations. Forty-four labour laws are simplified to become four codes.The pandemic posed a challenge but did not deter or dilute the conviction with which India has to leap forward. It needs transformational, not incremental changes. We have to make up for that lost decade as well. During the pandemic, even as we extended relief and assistance to the poor and the needy, we did not miss out on the opportunity that the times presented for reform.The health sector and its regulations are being ramped up. Power sector reforms are being undertaken to bring in private sector efficiencies and comply with sustainable environmental goals. The importance of one nation-one ration card being achieved through digital technologies cannot be lost on any of us. Migrant workers and their families so deserve it.Even during the pandemic, systemic reforms were undertaken with the cooperation of the states. This was made possible because states were allowed enhanced borrowing as an incentive, for each of the milestones achieved. PM Modi, in his post on LinkedIn, titled Reforms by Conviction and Incentives, listed some of these reforms. They are one nation-one ration card; automatic, online and non-discretionary licence issuance under seven Acts; notifying floor rates for property tax, water/sewerage charge to be in line with stamp duty guidelines; and DBT in lieu of free electricity supply.Prepared in the midst of the pandemic, for lifting the economy out of the hardships faced by this unprecedented situation, Budget 2021 gave a leg up for infrastructure spending. It also lays a policy prescription for public sector enterprises and provides a road map for financial sector reforms. Professionalising banks is on course. Bond markets are being deepened. Using technology, tax administration is becoming faceless — discretion leading to harassment is being removed. An asset monetisation pipeline is ready. Greater disclosures and better regulation are instilling confidence in domestic retail investors, drawing them to the markets.The 1991 reforms were the 20th-century story. Being undertaken today are the reforms for a New India of the 21st century.Nirmala Sitharaman is India’s finance ministerThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/reforms-for-a-new-india-in-the-21st-century-101624888753330.html
28-06-2021||Today's||E-commerce: Excessive regulations can undermine the sector’s growth potential||The past few years have witnessed numerous regulations that have been proposed to streamline/regulate the e-commerce sector. The government has released multiple drafts of the e-commerce policy and, in parallel, has also brought out clarifications of foreign direct investment (FDI) norms and the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, all of which have a direct or indirect bearing on the sector.While there is no denying that streamlining the growth of the sector is important given its market potential, one has to be mindful that this is a nascent sector and accounts for only four per cent of the total retail market in India. Over-regulation tends to curb competition and create monopolies instead of ensuring its holistic growth dovetailed with fair competition. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been highlighting the need for self-regulation in place of statutory/administrative regulations. This is the approach required for this sector as well.The most recent addition to this long list of regulations trying to govern e-commerce are the proposed amendments to the E-commerce Rules under the Consumer Protection Act. These amendments, on the face of it, would make the operating framework for e-commerce entities in India much more complex due to the compliance requirements that may be covered in existing regulations as well.Also Read | Improve the ease of doing civil society workThe proposed amendments seem to have an overlap with existing regulations under FDI norms and Competition Law. Clauses about related party transactions and exercising control over sellers, in case of marketplaces, have been addressed through existing FDI press regulations.For instance, the current amendments propose that “Every e-commerce entity which intends to operate in India shall register itself with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) within such period as prescribed by DPIIT for allotment of a registration number”..“Provided that the DPIIT may extend the period for registration of such ecommerce entity for sufficient reason, to be recorded in writing”.E-commerce firms in question are already registered in India with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), with the government having access to the requisite data. Unlike any company that is registered only once, does this imply that e-commerce firms will be registered for a certain time period only and would have to go through the process again, every time the registration deadline comes up? One can say with certainty that this could not have been the intention on the part of the government as it will create a licensing regime for the sector, which may again limit competition and become detrimental for consumers.While the intent behind enacting these regulations is noble – to protect consumer interests – these complex regulations may result in bogging down a sector that has thrived and expanded to empower both consumers and sellers over the past few years.Over the past 10 years, e-commerce has empowered consumers probably more than any other intervention. Through its network, it has reached every corner of the country and has created a parity between consumers from all sections, social and geographical strata. Consumers across the country have more and equal choice, increased accessibility, and convenience. With the plethora of choices available at a click of button, it has helped products/brands to reach even the remotest corners of the country.Also Read | Soft infrastructure, and a tablet for all, can catalyse India’s developmentIn the past year and a half, even as we live through the pandemic, e-commerce emerged as the hero in keeping the economic engine running by supporting MSME sellers to replenish inventories as well as catering to consumer demand during lockdown. Sellers have more access and ease of selling with reduced inventory and logistics costs.Governments and private players across the globe are making efforts towards ramping up e-commerce capabilities and infrastructure to leverage this revolution and ensure that the economy at large benefits.At this juncture, the government’s endeavor should be to create an ecosystem that helps the sector thrive as opposed to creating regulatory uncertainty and complexity. The government has repeatedly promised to facilitate ease of doing business, to do away with unnecessary compliance requirements, and encourage technology adoption. These proposed amendments, however, seem paradoxical to this promise and reminiscent of the license raj days.When the time is ripe to open up the economy to encourage investments, these amendments will act as a disincentive for e-commerce companies and sellers.Lalit Bhasin is the President of Society of Indian Law FirmsThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/ecommerce-excessive-regulations-can-undermine-the-sector-s-growth-potential-101624870092222.html
28-06-2021||Today's||Gender equality must be central to Covid-19 recovery plans||Even after decades of work and attention, gender inequality remains a significant barrier to human development. Women and girls worldwide are still discriminated against in accessing healthcare, education, political representation, and employment, impeding the realisation of their rights. In India, persistent gender inequality is a consequence of deeply entrenched patriarchal norms, which disproportionately impact girls and women. While these challenges have existed for centuries, the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated them significantly, especially for young girls from marginalised communities.The crucial role of gender equality is underscored by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which recognises it as not only a fundamental right but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. Addressing gender inequality, therefore, requires recognition of the complex factors that enable it. Patriarchy and gender inequitable attitudes have ensured that decision-making power is predominantly held by men and has been observed in most societies, including India.Also Read | Investigating gender disparities in India’s vaccine rolloutSocietal control on women’s and girls’ autonomy and choice is often reinforced by patriarchal norms, which is reflected in practices such as early and coerced marriage, limited contraceptive choice and preventing adolescents from receiving comprehensive sexuality education. These practices place an undue burden on women’s and girls’ bodily autonomy and agency to prevent teenage pregnancies and childbirth, unsafe and coerced sex, unsafe abortion, and intimate partner and gender-based violence.A recent study reveals that two million adolescent girls in India have an unmet need for modern contraception and 78% of abortions among teenage girls are unsafe. Sexual and reproductive health and rights have a direct bearing on bodily autonomy and integrity for women and girls.A girl who cannot define whether, when or how many children to have, or choose to stay in school instead of marrying at a young age, or who accepts domestic violence as her fate, stands little chance of completing schooling, faces reduced opportunities for paid employment or entrepreneurship, and experiences diminished decision-making in other spheres.Among the most critical determinants affecting women and girls’ decision-making about their sexual and reproductive health is the education level of both partners. Global evidence suggests that there is a direct bearing of education on reducing child marriages, teenage pregnancies, and maternal deaths, in addition to empowering girls to take control of their lives. In fact, nutrition, education and health of girls are interconnected, and improvements in one area help others: Better nutrition leads to improved learning, better retention in school, job opportunities and delayed marriage.Despite the evidence and significant progress in girls’ access to school in India’s most remote villages, an estimated four million girls remain out of school, denied their fundamental human rights. The reasons range from safety issues to deeply entrenched, discriminatory social norms, from a lack of access to toilet facilities and menstrual hygiene to poverty and the need to work. Even when in school, quality remains an issue and both content and classroom practice remain steeped in a culture that fails to recognise girls as equal.The problem was persistent before Covid-19, but with the ongoing lockdown, progress has been reversed. Forced out of school because of Covid-19, girls are back to the old ways – they eat last and least, fall into domestic servitude, and any remote learning opportunities are denied because of a digital divide that is worse for girls. School exclusion is at its highest where patriarchy, poverty, and policy gaps intersect.Yet programmes are often designed and implemented in silos and viewed as the domains of separate ministries and agencies. Funders often back siloed programmes, implementers work in silos, and policy makers create policies in departmental isolation. Making advances in gender equality requires facilitating convergent action across stakeholders and sectors. This in turn would increase economic opportunities for girls and women and address their health, education and safety needs.Girls are best served when traditional boundaries are crossed. The barriers of silos need to be broken so that stakeholders – including girls and women themselves – can come together and address issues like violence, child marriage, child labour, menstrual hygiene, health and education.Government, civil society organisations and funding agencies must identify priority issues together and link stakeholders to provide cross-sectoral, collaborative solutions to meet the multiple, intersecting needs of girls and women. Lessons from such a convergent approach to programming in India would be instrumental in developing tools for the global application of a scaled-up convergent response for gender equality.Gender equality is a moral, economic, and health issue that demands urgent action. As such, gender equality must be central to Covid-19 recovery plans and should prioritise sexual and reproductive health and rights, equal access to education and jobs for women and girls.The Generation Equality Forum in Paris (June 30 to July 2), which commemorates the landmark 1995 Beijing Conference on Women and Development, unveiled blueprints that illustrate the critical actions needed to secure transformation in gender equality. It calls upon governments, the private sector, civil society, philanthropies and CSOs, youth, and allies to accelerate change and intensify global ambition for gender equality.In the future, donors, implementers, and policymakers need to adopt a unified-yet-complementary approach and put inclusion at the heart of their efforts to improve the lives of girls and the most vulnerable communities.We need to break the intergenerational cycle of poverty and build stronger economies and social systems. While recognising that women’s and girl’s empowerment is a moral imperative, investing in academic, vocation, and life skills for girls and young women represents one of the most significant opportunities for sustainable and inclusive development and smashing patriarchy.Poonam Muttreja is executive director, Population Foundation of India, and Safeena Hussain is founder and executive director, Educate GirlsThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/gender-equality-must-be-central-to-covid-19-recovery-plans-101624867571970.html
28-06-2021||Today's||Sharpening India’s vaccination strategy||The months straddled by the second wave of Covid-19 stand out for tumultuous and vagarious changes in vaccination policy.In April, the central government released a liberalised vaccination strategy which expanded the eligibility to the 18-45 years age group. Pure confusion pervaded about our objectives with the strategy. Were we trying to combat the ongoing second wave (which was impractical) or to prevent a future third wave (which didn’t warrant such a hurried, knee-jerk response)? Were we primarily trying to dampen mortality or infections or both? Much of such confusion still persists despite the partial reversal of the liberalised strategy in June.Nonetheless, with the second wave apparently departing and with some invaluable time in hand, there arises a crucial opportunity to sharpen and focus our vaccination strategy in order to best prepare for an imminent third wave. Although vaccine supplies are projected to increase in upcoming months and many states have recently shown some improvement in vaccination performance, the current indiscriminate approach to vaccination is least desirable.Also Read | Covishield’s green pass matter being taken up at highest levels: Adar PoonawallaThere is a need to prioritise vaccine recipients based on vulnerability and epidemiological profiles so as to maximise population health gains, in case the increase in vaccine supply does not suffice.This applies mainly to the 18-45 years age group, though undoubtedly also to the remaining age groups. Apart from persons with comorbidities, certain other categories such as hawkers, vendors, and rickshaw drivers have been frequently argued as meriting targeted vaccination since they could act as super-spreaders apart from being prone to infection.However, there is a need of adopting a broader definition of who is vulnerable. Those with lesser access to health facilities; those with fewer luxuries to practice isolation and social distancing; and the rural population, for example, are important vulnerable categories, since they can contribute to greater morbidity and mortality.Many targeted strategies, such as user fees exemptions in public health facilities, have traditionally been characterised by pervasive inclusion and exclusion errors. For the very same reason, they have been held as inefficient from time to time. The challenge at hand is magnified when it comes to targeting vulnerable groups for vaccination. Identifying these vulnerable groups, most of which belong to the informal sector, can be an exacting exercise and may come with a greater likelihood of inefficient targeting and leakages. However, unlike in the case of user fees, there is a strong case for a targeted vaccination strategy despite the potential inefficiencies. The most practicable, expedient, and least resource intensive methods to identify and target vulnerable sections have to be conceived for this purpose.Since segregating these vulnerable groups is difficult, certain readily available proxy means could be adopted for targeting these groups.Take for example the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), which covers more than 100 million families based on certain deprivation and occupational criteria, from the Socioeconomic and Caste Census (SECC). Until June 25, nearly 160 million PMJAY e-cards had been issued. A cursory look at the deprivation and occupational criteria shows that most categories of PMJAY beneficiaries would meet one or more criteria for vulnerability. It should be relatively easy and efficient to target these populations given the infrastructure that is already in place. Also, nearly 80% of PMJAY beneficiaries are from rural areas. A similar precedent already exists from last year, wherein PMJAY officials identified and traced high-risk beneficiaries from their database through call centres to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment.There is a particularly strong case for subsidising Covid-19 vaccines under the PMJAY health insurance scheme, given the positive externalities, low moral hazard, and other such desirable traits. Public and private empanelled hospitals can be roped in for the purpose, and measures such as temporary “express empanelment” of private hospitals may be envisaged as was done last year. The fact that the central government has already conceived a vaccine pooling mechanism for small private hospitals in the country can only be complementary. This could also promote more equitable utilisation from the 25% share of vaccines that has been reserved for the private sector, which is disproportionate and inequitable in existing circumstances.Anticipation of colossal implementational challenges shouldn’t form a pretext to condone inefficient and indiscriminate policies or practices.

28-06-2021||Today's||The cautionary tale behind population control||The Covid-19 pandemic may have fast-tracked the oncoming peak of a global population decline by at least a decade, according to a recent Bloomberg report. The pandemic has slowed the already slowing global birth rates, from the United States (US) to China, experts estimate. Is this good news or bad?In recent weeks, at least two Indian state governments – Uttar Pradesh and Assam – have advocated aggressive population control, with the chief minister of Assam asking Muslims to adopt family planning and also declaring a policy that large families will stand to lose certain state benefits.Population control, grounded in classic economic theories, has been a double-edged sword. It has both advantages and costs. In over half of the world’s nations, the rate of population growth is falling behind replacement rates, and, perhaps for the first time, the growth rate in the world’s population is projected to be zero by the end of the century, according to United Nations (UN) data.Also Read | From 1901 to 2011, what the census tells us about India’s populationMy colleague, Roshan Kishore in a data-backed piece titled, Why India can shed its population obsession in Hindustan Times, has provided useful insights into the country’s demographics, which has been a hot-button political issue, urging new economic thinking on the issue.The economic foundations of population control policy The economics of population, which started with Malthus, is now undergoing revisions. One example is that China hopes to reverse a fall in its population by raising the maximum allowable number of children per household from two to three.Some well-known economic hypotheses led governments to aggressively control population to spur growth, the objective of growth being central to the politics of all low- and middle-income countries.Malthus had predicted that the world’s population would grow at a faster rate than the rate of food production. He was right in flagging these concerns in the Principle of Population in 1798. The population tends to grow exponentially (geometric growth), he argued, but food supply grew in a slower arithmetic ratio. Malthus thought England was foredoomed.Malthus was ultimately proved wrong as breakthroughs in agricultural technology made countries, such as India, net food surplus. Amartya Sen showed that famines killed millions in Bengal, but some famines were caused not by the absolute lack of food, but its high price.Harvard economist Harvey Leibenstein had demonstrated, with his famous big-push theory (also called critical minimum effort thesis), how population growth tends to erode incomes.The main economic argument that follows from Malthus’s warnings was that if per capita income (or pcy, y being the shorthand for “income” in standard equations) is low, then people are too poor to save. Since investment is taken to be equal to savings, low savings would mean the economy doesn’t grow.Malthus had argued that if per capita income is greater than subsistence level (defined as the bare minimum income that one needs to survive), then the population starts growing initially, but there’s a physical limit to the population growth of around 3% beyond which population growth flattens.Leibenstein’s main argument was that countries have to invest beyond this level at which population growth stabilises or levels off. This is the famous big-push theory. So, investments need to be beyond this level because population growth will swallow up any small increases in per capita income, according to Leibenstein.These are the intellectual foundations of population-control policies. And as is clear, they have more to do with economics than politics.However, while these theories increased our understanding of population economics, many of these theories were later found to have many flaws. Later economists showed there’s no one-on-one correlation between per capita income and growth in y (or income).The big-push theory did not consider the distributional aspects of income. Higher per capita income may not lead to more savings (and, therefore, investments) if income is not well-distributed.It is possible that two countries may have the same per capita incomes, but different levels of investment. If investment is very capital intensive, it will lead to inequality. The most important critique is that the big-push theory calls for just that — a massive one-time injection of capital to raise per capita incomes beyond the population growth rate. But capital, as we know, is always scarce.The reality of population dip The UN’s data is clear that the decline of the global population has started. This entails serious economic consequences.“For instance, there would simply not be enough people to work for the economy, (you can have) a large non-productive aging population to support, the government may not have enough resources to support pensions and this would lead to de-industrialisation, as with Japan,” said Arup Mitra, an economist with the prestigious Delhi School of Economics.Mitra, referring to economist Kuznets, said India is at a stage of demographic transition where mortality rates were declining and fertility rates would decline in the next two to three decades or so.“There is still scope to cut population growth because India still has a positive growth rate, but our population policy should keep in the mind the larger consequences of zero population growth. You will need some positive growth in population happening to not end up like Japan,” he said.Once a country falls below the so-called replacement level, which is 2.1 births per woman — the level below which population decline sets in — then it is very difficult to come back up. There can be series of economic fallouts, such as declining demand.Of 86 countries where fertility fell below the replacement level, only Tunisia managed to raise its fertility back up, according to data cited by David Fickling in Bloomberg.Many economists have started a rethink of some of the old ideas. As far back as 1937, iconic economist John Maynard Keynes gave a lecture on “Some Economic Consequences of a Declining Population”. His key worry was poor demand for investment in places where companies encounter a falling population of consumers.Although India has not yet hit the replacement level, many developing countries, such as Iran and Brazil, have. And therein lies a cautionary tale for India.In a new paper, The End of Economic Growth?, Stanford University professor Charles Jones has modelled the opposite of a Malthusian world, or what could happen in a nation where population growth goes into free fall. According to his model, overall output and living standards fall and ultimately humans simply vanish from that place.“We are nowhere near that level of crisis. We still have a large population that needs to be controlled with incentives and disincentives. But disincentives for families not following population norms should never be retrospective,” said Anindita Sen, a professor with Calcutta University.Analysts have argued that India’s current economic demographic dividend, more young people than old, needs to be tapped fast as economic resources before it vanishes, and the country enters what demographer Wolfgang Lutz and colleagues call the “Low-Fertility Trap Hypothesis”. The hypothesis states that low fertility in one generation caused low fertility in the next, creating a demographic dead-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-cautionary-tale-behind-population-control-101624862531828.html
28-06-2021||Editorials||The dangers of anti-science, anti-vaccine propaganda||India has a singular mission over the next year — vaccinating the population against Covid-19. Universal vaccination is the only way to save lives, prevent future waves, revive economic growth, send children to school, resume social interactions and defeat the pandemic. Eligible citizens, young and old, must take both jabs and encourage others as well.Unfortunately, scientific reality hasn’t deterred some public figures from acting irresponsibly. A primary example is lawyer, Prashant Bhushan, who has been consistently advising against vaccines on Twitter. With 2.2 million Twitter followers, his disregard for science can potentially sway fence-sitters who are hesitant to take vaccines to follow suit. Misinformation about the effectiveness of vaccines foments hesitancy at a time when various studies point to this being a significant barrier to the fight against Covid-19. There is little to distinguish Mr Bhushan and Ram Kisan Yadav (Baba Ramdev) who have both peddled misinformation about vaccines, revealing that the anti-science impulse in India makes strange bedfellows.Also Read | The message from JammuVaccination is not legally mandatory. Therefore, an individual can choose not to take the jab. But unless it is on medical advice, this would be self-defeating. Those actively campaigning against vaccination pose a threat to public health. Citizens should also remember that vaccination certificates will be crucial to return to a new normal, from accessing public spaces to travel. Not getting vaccinated would not only risk one’s life but also prevent returning to a pre-Covid-19 life. Influencers should take the jab, and if they don’t want to do so, at least stop commenting on issues they know little about.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-dangers-of-anti-science-anti-vaccine-propaganda-101624888573251.html
28-06-2021||Editorials||Assessing the Rao legacy||A hundred years ago, on June 28, a boy was born in present-day Telangana. Mahatma Gandhi had begun his non-cooperation movement. The Nizam ruled Hyderabad. Independence was distant. Born at such a tumultuous time and socialised in an agrarian setting, it is a test to his remarkable talent that the new-born of 1921 went on, exactly 70 years later, to become one of independent India’s most consequential prime ministers. At a critical time in the nation’s history, by reorienting India’s economic and foreign policy direction, in fundamental and arguably irreversible ways, PV Narasimha Rao played a transformative role.Rao had a long political career, spanning from legislator to Andhra Pradesh chief minister, parliamentarian to a senior minister in the Indira and Rajiv Gandhi government. But the defining legacy of Rao would be his years as PM between 1991 and 1996. Close to retirement, Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination brought him to power by accident. But Rao recognised the gravity of India’s economic crisis and used all his political skills to support and shepherd historic economic reforms. As articles to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the reforms in this paper have documented, it was Rao’s political skill, perhaps even more than Manmohan Singh’s economic grasp, that opened up India to the world, liberalised Indian industry, set the ground for growth and an expansion of the middle class, reduced the State’s stifling powers, legitimised the private sector, generated jobs, reduced poverty, and created the cushion for ambitious welfare schemes. He also ably negotiated a new post Cold-War reality.Rao was not flawless though. As home minister, his role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots was dubious. Under his watch as PM, the Babri Masjid was demolished, dealing a blow to Indian secularism from which it is yet to recover. He failed to tackle the impact of Mandal and Mandir, and contributed to the weakening of the Congress in north India. He deployed his political cunning, using State agencies, against rivals. And his political career, towards the end, was mired in corruption allegations, including a charge of conspiracy to bribe parliamentarians. But despite this mixed record, Rao’s abiding legacy, as his finest biographer Vinay Sitapati argued, was his contribution in reshaping India’s trajectory. A hundred years after his birth, 30 years after his policy reforms, and 17 years after his death, Rao’s legacy lives on. He deserves more recognition, both from his old party and from the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/assessing-the-rao-legacy-101624887853307.html
