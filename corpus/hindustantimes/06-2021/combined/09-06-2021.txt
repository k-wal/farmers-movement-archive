09-06-2021||News||Economic recovery begins, but of what kind?||The Indian economy went into a tail-spin due to the second wave of Covid-19 infections, but with the infection curve on a downward trajectory and the unlock process underway -- Delhi and Mumbai removed many restrictions on June 7 – the latest high frequency indicators show that the economy has started recovering. However, given the experience of the economic recovery after the first wave, it is also important to look into the nature rather than just its trajectory.NIBRI has gained ten points in the last fortnight The Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) jumped to 69.7 in the week ending June 6. To be sure, NIBRI bottomed out in the week ending May 23 itself when it fell to 60.3. It increased to 62.9 in the week ending May 30. The latest value of NIBRI is comparable to where it was in the week ending June 21, 2020. A NIBRI value of 100 indicates pre-pandemic level of economic activity. The question to ask is whether NIBRI will take last year’s trajectory or grow at a faster pace.“Near-term growth dynamics remain crucially contingent on two factors — the pace of relaxation of lockdowns and the pace of vaccinations. The former will determine the speed of recovery in mobility and broader economic activity, while the latter will be important for ensuring that the number of cases remains in check and the lockdown easing remains sustained”, said a note by Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi.Job market is still bad Employment numbers from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) suggest that the employment scenario continues to be worrisome. The unemployment rate has been in double digits in the last four weeks. It actually increased from 12.15% to 13.62% between the week ending May 30 and June 6, even though NIBRI – which is supposed to be a proxy for economic activity – went up. “The Indian labour market is in its worst condition since the nation-wide lockdown months of April and May 2020,” Mahesh Vyas, the Managing Director of CMIE wrote in an article published on the CMIE website. “Employment has been falling since January 2021 when it touched a recent peak of 400.7 million. It has fallen in each of the four months since then. It fell by 2.5 million in February, 0.1 million in March, 7.4 million in April and then by 15.3 million in May. The cumulative loss since January therefore is a substantial 25.3 million. This is a significant 6.3% fall in the employed workforce over a four-month period”, he added. CMIE is the only high-frequency source of employment indicators in India. The CMIE numbers are in keeping with a fall in perception on employment in the latest round (May 2021) of RBI’s Consumer Confidence Survey.Companies are deleveraging rather than investing Labour markets lagging behind output growth has led to what has been termed as profit led growth in the Indian economy in the last fiscal year.A June 8 research note by Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Advisor at the State Bank of India, shows this clearly. Ghosh looked at results of 1,000 listed companies for 2020-21 and found that profits grew at a much faster pace than revenues in most sectors. “We observed a 4% decline in top line (revenue), while EBIDTA and Profit after Taxes (PAT) grew by 19% and 54% respectively over FY20. However, excluding BFSI (banks, financial services and insurance) and refineries, the set reported 2% growth in top line and 36% and 34% growth in EBIDTA and PAT,” the note said.Also Read | After the pandemic, the centrality of the Blue Economy in recoveryLack of demand, reflected in poor revenue growth, also means that companies are deleveraging instead of investing even though the monetary policy environment continues to be accommodative. “One direct corollary of the pandemic in FY21 was a distinct slowdown in bank credit growth that has also continued into FY22. We believe such low credit growth was a direct fallout of corporates rapidly deleveraging by repaying high-cost loans through funds raised through bond issuances”, the note added.” Interestingly, corporate willingness for new investments remains low currently as the economy is still recovering from the devastating second wave.”If firms continue to behave prioritise deleveraging instead of investing, it is bound to perpetuate a vicious cycle of low investment demand leading to low mass incomes leading to low consumption demand, which will generate further headwinds for investment demand. This is exactly where the role of a fiscal stimulus, which can give a boost to mass demand and break this vicious cycle, comes in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/economic-recovery-begins-but-of-what-kind-101623147824877.html
09-06-2021||Dehradun||Conduct Covid death audit, orders Uttarakhand high court; report by June 21||Dehradun:The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday ordered the government to conduct an audit of Covid deaths in the state and submit its report by June 21. The court’s direction, which comes amid delays in reporting Covid deaths by hospitals, was issued on a bunch of public interest litigation filed by lawyers and activists, Sachdanand Dabral, Dushyant Mainali, Anu Pant and Rajendra Arya.Uttarakhand has reported over 3.35 lakh Covid cases and more than 6,800 deaths. More than 10% of the deaths, or 868 deaths, are classified as backlog deaths since they were reported after a delay by the hospitals.Anoop Nautiyal of Social Development for Communities Foundation (SDC) said hospitals should be ordered to report deaths within 24 hours to enable the authorities to effectively deal with the situation. “Last year 89 backlog Covid deaths were reported while the rest of such deaths have been reported from May 9 onwards. Initially, authorities tried to be strict on this issue, but hospitals continued to report backlog deaths. Since May 17, the hospitals have reported nearly 700 backlog deaths and these deaths have been reported every day for the last 23 days”, Nautiyal, who has been tracking the state’s statistics, said.Dushyant Mainali said the high court also directed the state government to file a detailed affidavit listing its preparedness for the third Covid wave, especially the recommendations of the committee constituted by the state government in this context.The court also directed the state government and Centre to collaborate to ensure the state gets a regular supply of life-saving Covid drugs and medicines for the treatment of black fungus. The court also directed the senior health officials present at the virtual hearing to apprise the court about how and where black fungus patients are being treated and the efforts to spread awareness about the treatment facilities.The court also directed the secretary health to issue a circular on pricing of Covid treatment in private hospitals, items wise, process-wise and treatment-wise.The court also directed the state government to conduct an audit of ventilators and ICUs available in government hospitals, how many of them are being used, how many are non-functional and other such details regarding their status. The court said village level isolation centres should be created in anticipation of the third wave. The court also asked the government to create an online portal that could be used by people from outside the state who may want to help the state in its battle against the epidemic. The court also directed the state government to form a district-level task force under the social welfare department to track people who don’t have an identity card such as beggars, sadhus, labourers and get them vaccinated.Expressing displeasure over secretary tourism Dilip Jawalkar not having visited Char Dham, the court directed him to apprise the court what the preparations and measures the government had taken for the phase-wise opening of Char Dham yatra and upcoming tourist season by June 16.The high court also directed the state government to submit a report on Covid tests conducted in the state in May in view of some reports that point to discrepancies in testing. On 28 April, the court ordered the government to increase daily Covid testing in Dehradun, Haldwani and Haridwar to at least 30,000 to 50,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/conduct-covid-death-audit-orders-uttarakhand-high-court-report-by-june-21-101623263349947.html
09-06-2021||Mumbai||Door-to-door vax in Mumbai: Covid is the enemy, conduct surgical strikes, HC tells Centre||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked the Centre to adopt a surgical strike approach and not wait for the needy, elderly and specially-abled persons to go to vaccination centres. The court also questioned the Centre as to why it had refused permission to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to conduct door-to-door vaccination when other states and certain civic authorities across the country had already started the same without waiting for a go-ahead from the Centre. In light of this, the HC has asked the Centre to inform it on Friday whether it will be considering a national policy on the issue of door-to-door vaccination. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari seeking directions to the Centre, the state and BMC to provide door-to-door vaccination to those aged over 75, the specially-abled and bed-ridden, was informed by Kapadia that the state of Kerala had already started the same for bedridden persons and had issued a notification in this regard. She further submitted that states like Orissa, Bihar and Jammu and Kashmir had also undertaken such initiatives. After hearing the submissions, the court referred to the near-to-door decision of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) which was submitted by the Centre on Tuesday and sought to know from additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Centre why it was not going to the needy persons. “You will admit Covid-19 is a bigger enemy and we have to strike it down. The enemy is residing in certain persons who cannot come out. Your approach should be like a surgical strike,” observed the bench. “When a surgical strike is required, you are assembling force near borders and not entering into enemy territory. You are waiting. You are making decisions for public benefit, but it seems they are delayed. Decisions if taken earlier, could have saved many lives,” noted the court. The bench then referred to the submissions by the petitioner and sought clarity on how the states had gone ahead with door-to-door vaccination if there was no policy by the Central government and said, “You should understand sentiments of families of such persons and current black fungus spread. Door-to-door is the best possibility for vaccination such persons.” When Singh submitted that the Centre would come out with new standard operating procedures and a national policy the bench said, “Let us know your (Centre) response during next hearing. We trust the government and it can come up with a sound policy. Considering the situation in the country, if it (door-to-door) has happened in south, extreme north and east then why not west?” While referring to the submission by senior counsel Anil Sakhare for the BMC that it was willing to have door-to-door vaccination provided the Centre approved it the bench said, “You cannot clip wings of authorities. BMC has failed to live up to our expectations.” It also sought to know whether the BMC or the state government helped a senior politician to receive the vaccination at his home in Mumbai at the beginning of the vaccination programme. HC has now posted the PIL for further hearing on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/doortodoor-vax-in-mumbai-covid-is-the-enemy-conduct-surgical-strikes-hc-tells-centre-101623263229211.html
09-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: BJP alleges corruption in cleaning of nullahs; mayor rubbishes claims||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Bandra member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Ashish Shelar on Wednesday alleged corruption by the Shiv Sena-ruled Mumbai civic body, in the desilting and cleaning of nullahs in Mumbai. Shelar also alleged that the corruption in the desilting of nullahs, stormwater, open drains and culverts has led to waterlogging in the city leading to hardship to the common citizens of Mumbai.Shelar, who paid visits to the spots of the nullah cleaning works in the city two days ago, said that the claims of nullah cleaning to the tune of 104% to 107% have been proved false in the first rains in the city. “The city has 170 large nullahs with the length of 253km and small size nullahs admeasuring 439km, micros nullahs measuring 621km and open drains of 1,992km. The desilting, cleaning as well as maintenance, costs Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) around ₹200 crore a year, through contracts awarded. The corruption through nexus between bureaucrats, contractors and ruling parties has badly affected the strengthening of the infrastructure,” he said.Shelar said that the parameters to measure the nullah cleaning by the civic body is faulty per se. “The corporation has been claiming to have completed 107% cleaning of these nullahs. Our question is how did you measure it when there is no set formula to ascertain or prove it. The BMC does not keep any records of weighing of the silt, CCTV footage to prove its dumping. The tenders given to the contractors are for the cleaning of nullahs thrice a year, but nobody has seen the cleaning except done before the monsoon,” he said.Shelar said that though they have been talking about it for five years, the issue of corruption for the last 30 years will be raised at an appropriate time. “It is true that we were partners with Sena in BMC, but being junior partners, we had no say in decision making. We will discuss the corruption in the civic body for the last three decades with proof at appropriate times. Ultimately, it’s the money paid towards taxes by 60,000 households in the city that goes down in drains because of corruption,” he said.Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said that they do not take the allegations seriously. “Some people use social media for ranting and keep talking senseless. There is no need to take them seriously. We are committed to serving the people of Mumbai and are ready to take up the valid suggestions openly,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bjp-alleges-corruption-in-cleaning-of-nullahs-mayor-rubbishes-claims-101623263109178.html
09-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s only Doppler radar is defunct again||The city’s only Doppler weather radar (DWR), operated by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), remained defunct on Wednesday when the southwest monsoon made an early entry into Mumbai.DWR at Navy Nagar in Colaba is the only radar in the city but has been out of commission since May 16, a day before Cyclone Tauktae hit.Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of meteorology at IMD said DWR was defunct owing to technical glitches. “We are working on it and the radar is likely to be operational within a week or two,” said Mohapatra.This is not the first time that the instrument, used for tracking clouds and forecasting weather patterns, has been inoperable at a crucial moment. On December 4, 2017, when Cyclone Ockhi brushed past the Mumbai coast, the radar was not functional. The radar was also not functional on multiple days during extreme rainfall events in June and July 2019, and also on June 1, 2020, about 48 hours before Cyclone Nisarga made landfall in Maharashtra.KS Hosalikar, head, surface instrument division, Climate Research & Services, IMD, directed queries to Jayanta Sarkar, director, IMD, Mumbai. However, despite repeated attempts, Sarkar did not respond to calls or messages.“Wednesday’s event is a perfect example of why we need a radar. From satellite pictures, we could see clouds forming near Mumbai. In the absence of a Doppler radar, it becomes difficult for forecasters to track clouds, the direction in which they are moving and the estimated rainfall over different areas,” said Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and PhD student at the University of Reading, England.Not having a functional DWR can be dangerous in terms of disseminating correct information to the public and civic officials for preparing for any disaster-like event or flooding, said Deoras, who maintained that Wednesday’s heavy rainfall was the last of the pre-monsoon activity.DWR was installed in the city in 2010 for weather surveillance up to 400kms from the coastline and was first recommended soon after the floods of July 26, 2005. While satellite pictures can be used in lieu of radar images, experts said, the latter is limited in value. “If an x-ray is a satellite image, then a doppler radar is a CT scan. The quality and range of data it gives are simply much better, allowing us to make better predictions about where the cyclone’s spiral banks will be located, where they will bring more rain,” said Deoras.MS Reddy, former vice-chairperson of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), said there was a pressing need for setting up at least two more DWRs. “Mumbai as a city is becoming increasingly prone to urban flooding, especially because of recurring high-intensity short-duration rainfall events. DWRs give us a lead time of three to six hours and tell us the temporal and spatial variation of rainfall for different areas. This means we can know where exactly it is going to rain and how intense the rain will be. These are crucial details, especially for warning commuters or moving people from low-lying areas,” said Reddy.Reddy said with recurring low-pressure and cyclones in the Arabian Sea, Mumbai is now vulnerable to floods even before the onset of the monsoon season.“Maharashtra has to be prepared for such events. The disaster management plan is not updated enough, not enough mock drills are conducted and not having a DWR is going to be detrimental in managing a disaster,” Reddy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-only-doppler-radar-is-defunct-again-101623263049177.html

Raigad district collector Nidhi Choudhari said, “The weather department has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall in the district of Raigad till June 11 and since Raigad district has many landslide-prone villages, we are shifting the villagers to safety.” Choudhari said the earlier red alert from India Meteorological Department (IMD) for Raigad was for June 11 and 12, and the heavy rains on June 9 were unexpected, which affected many people in the district. “The people were recently shifted during Cyclone Tauktae and now again are being shifted due to heavy rains. Hence, many are unwilling to cooperate,” Choudhari added. While some are relocating to their relative’s houses, others are being shifted by the administration. Of the 103 villages, nine come under the Class 1 category, which is highly prone to the landslide. “Villages in Mhasla, Khalapur, Karjat and Mahad taluka come under Class 1. I have spoken to the sub-divisional officers of those talukas, who have confirmed that all the precautionary actions are being taken,” Choudhari said. Around 11 villages come under Class 2, and 83 villages come under the Class 3 category. From the Class 3 category, residents living on the edge are being relocated. A total of around 4,000 population comprises of Class 1 and 2 categories. The maximum landslide-prone villages are in Mahad taluka which has 49 such villages in all three categories, followed by 15 in Poladpur, 13 in Roha, six in Mhasla, five in Mangaon, three each in Panvel, Khalapur, Karjat and Sudhagad, two in Shrivardhan and one in Tala.Till now Raigad administration has evacuated1139 citizens from landslide-prone urban areas along with 111 citizens and 15 families (excluding 111 citizens) from dilapidated buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rains-wreak-havoc-35-000-citizens-from-103-villages-shifted-in-raigad-101623262929739.html

09-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai rains: Trains, buses out of gear; BMC, Railways play blame game||Public transport was thrown out of the gear as several parts of Mumbai were flooded due to the season’s first heavy rainfall on Wednesday. The central and harbour lines of the Central Railway (CR) were suspended for over 11 hours. As seen every year, the Railway and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) pointed fingers at each other as commuters suffered. Meanwhile, the bus service of Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) bus services was disrupted as many routes were diverted due to flooding. While suburban train service is the biggest mass transport system in Mumbai, the BEST buses are the second most preferred.Local train services on the CR’s mainline were suspended between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Thane railway stations after waterlogging was reported on railway tracks in Sion and Kurla. Train services were suspended from 9.55 am and resumed at 8.03 pm on Wednesday.Water on the railway tracks at Sion railway station was four inches. Railway Protection Force (RPF) and commercial railway staff were deployed to help passengers that were stranded inside local trains, said CR officials.“I was stuck with my father for three hours near Sion. My father and I were travelling to CSMT for his regular check up. While on the way back the local train stopped ahead of Sion. We were helped by the RPF staff and then waited for another two hours for water to recede and reached home by a bus.” said Ganesh Singh, a Kurla resident.People also took to social media website Twitter asking for help. “@Central_Railway @grpmumbai @rpfcr My sister is travelling from Kalyan to CSMT She is stuck in train before Kurla station since last 4 hours .. She is 5 months pregnant. Please help.” tweeted @mr_kiran143.Train services on the harbour railway were suspended between CSMT and Vashi railway stations. Due to waterlogging near Chunabhatti railway station train services were suspended from 10.20am.“As per Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast, there is heavy rainfall in the Mumbai area. Waterlogging has occurred at several places in the city. These are Hindmata junction, Kings Circle, BPT Colony, Sardar Hotel junction, Shanmukhanand hall area, Nair hospital area, Wadala library junction, Mankhurd Railway station, under Sion bridge and a few other locations. All these locations are near the Central Railway mainline and harbour line tracks. Due to heavy rains, the water level is continuously rising on track.” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, Central Railway.Train services were operational on the Trans-harbour railway line, between Vashi and Panvel railway stations and on Western Railway were operating normally but with caution speed for local trains. Local train services between Wadala and Vashi did not resume till 11.10pm. Train services resumed between CSMT- Vadala and CSMT-Goregaon railway stations. Railway officials pointed out that the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation(BMC) water pumps were not functional in many locations near the railway tracks.“BMC pumps were not operational and were not working in many places on the railway tracks. This is one of the reasons why the water did not recede.” said a senior railway official who did not want to be named.However, mayor Kishori Pednekar told the reporters, “On collection of water on railway tracks, we have been continuously coordinating with railway authorities but considering the officers do not have enough knowledge of local areas at times the issue is not handled properly. We are in continuous touch with the railway authorities to ensure that culverts are cleaned.”CR responding to Pednekar tweeted, “Railways is committed to work in close coordination with MCGM for running the train services for our esteemed passengers. And hence, we refute the statement given by honourable Mayor, Mumbai.”Civic chief IS Chahal said that owing to heavy rainfall in Sion and Chunabhatti, rainwater came on the railway tracks and as such railway traffic was affected at Sion, Chunabhatti and also Dahisar.12 outstation train services operating from the city were rescheduled.The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) diverted its bus routes on nearly 78 routes in the city due to waterlogging on arterial roads. Around 50 BEST buses broke down after water entered the buses on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-rains-trains-buses-out-of-gear-bmc-railways-play-blame-game-101623262809181.html

09-06-2021||Noida||Two persons arrested for dowry death||Greater Noida: Two persons were arrested on Wednesday in connection with a dowry death case, in which a 23-year-old woman was allegedly strangled to death by her in-laws more than six weeks ago in Greater Noida’s Surajpur. The suspects -- Anande, 50, and Manjesh, 25 -- are father-in-law and brother-in-law of the victim, Dolly. They were arrested from Hardoi district of Uttar Pradesh by a team of the Gautam Budh Nagar police, officials said. The victim was also a native of Hardoi, the officials said, adding that her husband, Brajesh, was already arrested on April 28, four days after the incident took place.In the police complaint, Dolly’s mother Rajwati, 45, had said that her daughter had an arranged marriage with Brajesh in 2015. “Soon after the marriage, her in-laws started demanding dowry. They harassed my daughter for not meeting the dowry demands,” she said. Rajwati said that the two families had held a meeting and sorted out the issue one year ago. “Dolly and her in-laws then shifted to Surajpur in Greater Noida. However, on April 24, Dolly’s neighbour called us over phone and said that she was dead,” she said.  According to police, the victim’s kin visited Greater Noida and found that Dolly was allegedly strangled to death by her in-laws. Rajwati then filed a case against Dolly’s husband Brajesh, father-in-law Anande, brother-in-law Manjesh and mother-in-law Suman. All the suspects had fled the spot after the incident, said police.Ajay Kumar, station house officer, Surajpur police station, said that a case was registered against the suspects under sections 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 304-B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code, and under sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act.“On Wednesday, the police team arrested Anande and Manjesh from their Hardoi residence. However, the victim’s mother-in-law is still on the run,” he said.The two suspects were produced in court and sent to judicial custody, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-persons-arrested-for-dowry-death-101623262269102.html

The construction work is likely to start at the site by the first week of August, they said.On Wednesday, Meerut divisional commissioner Surendra Singh inspected the site, along with top officials of the Gautam Budh Nagar administration and the Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL), which is the nodal agency for the project. The commissioner also interacted with affected farmers from villages such as Nagla Ganeshi, Nagla Chhitar, Rohi, Parohi and Ranhera to understand if they have any issues. According to the officials, the commissioner’s visit was aimed at expediting the work of rehabilitation and resettlement of farmers so that the work at the site can be started at earliest. The administration will provide JCB machines to farmers to get their houses demolished after vacating them, they said.“We have already shifted 600 out of 3,003 farmers, whose houses are being demolished to make way for the work to start at the ground. To further fast-track the shifting of farmers from their houses to the new world-class airport township in Jewar, we will provide them JCB machines to get their houses demolished. We will transfer physical possession of 1,334 hectares of land to YIAPL by June-end, paving way for work to begin at the site,” said the Meerut divisional commissioner, who also reviewed the progress of the project at Sector Omega 1 office of NIAL.The work on the ambitious project was supposed to start by June this year, but it got delayed due to the Covid-19 restrictions, the officials said, adding that the Prime Minister’s Office will soon announce the date for the foundation stone laying ceremony of the project. “Once the work begins at the site, the project will become operational in 36 months as per the timelines. We have developed a world-class township that has all facilities such as school, dispensary, temple, park, water supply, drainage network and other civic services to make sure farmers, who gave their land, stay happy,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of NIAL.Swiss firm Zurich International AG, the concessionaire of the airport project, will invest ₹30,000 crore and has got 40 years to fully develop this project. Under PPP model, the concessionaire will design, build, finance, operate and transfer the project to the government after 40 years.

Even so, the approval to obtain the drug for treatment will still vest with the divisional commissioner at Meerut.According to a government order issued May 19, state officials had directed that treatment of such patients will be taken up at government medical colleges and the drug, considering its limited availability, will be available at the divisional headquarters at Meerut, Varanasi, Agra and Lucknow. Both Ghaziabad and GB Nagar districts fall under the Meerut division. As of now, kin of patients from both districts have to travel to Meerut to source the injections.“Considering the fact that families have to travel daily to Meerut and back for the drug, the injections will be made available in the districts itself, while the approval will be provided online from Meerut. The arrangement is being brought about for the convenience of patients and their kin. We are not changing the approval conditions in the government order but only distribution,” said Surendra Singh, divisional commissioner (Meerut). The division at Meerut is also catering to patients from the nearby Saharanpur division.“The injections will be available in Ghaziabad and GB Nagar within a day or two and the stock will be released from the office of the respective chief medical officer (CMO). Earlier, a similar situation had prevailed when the Tocilizumab drug (used in Covid-19 treatment) was available only at Ghaziabad, Lucknow and Varanasi. Even though patients required it lesser quantities, as compared to Amphotericin B, their families still had to travel to these three cities to get the injections,” Singh said.Patients from as many as 20 districts in the state are under treatment at the Meerut Medical College, he added, while 30-40 patients from Delhi. He said that 94 of the 159 patients of black fungus (in the Meerut division) were taking up treatment at Meerut Medical College while Ghaziabad and GB Nagar each have 20 patients getting treatment in their respective districts. “The families of patients being treated for black fungus suffer each day as they have to travel often to Meerut to get the injections, and many returned empty handed due to the short supply. I also went several times but did not get any injections. So, I travelled to other cities and went as far as up to Chandigarh to get it,” said Rakesh Kumar, brother of a patient from Ghaziabad. “We also spent a lot of money on my brother’s treatment. We finally got him admitted to hospital in Delhi where he is due for a surgery and most importantly, he is also getting the injections. It will be a major relief if the drug is available locally,” Kumar added. Officials of the health department at Meerut said that they only had 150 vials of Amphotericin B available on Wednesday.“The stock is limited, and we are issuing doses in proportion to the districts. We had about 160 active cases of black fungus as of Wednesday, and these include 116 patients in Meerut and 20 each in Ghaziabad and GB Nagar, besides other districts. So far, there have been 41 casualties due to black fungus in the Meerut division,” said an officer from the health department at Meerut, who wished not to be identified. Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer of GB Nagar, said that the Amphotericin B being made available locally about a week ago.“But this arrangement was for a short span. Families have to travel to Meerut to get injections from Meerut. Now, we have been told that we will get stock of 60 vials on Thursday, and we will send our vehicle to get the stock from Meerut,” he added.Ghaziabad CMO Dr NK Gupta also said that similar number of vials will be made available to the district. “We will send our vehicle to get the stock, which we will store at our vaccine store and distribute it proportionately to patients. The communication about local availability was received from Meerut on Wednesday evening,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/black-fungus-medicine-to-be-made-available-locally-in-ghaziabad-and-gb-nagar-101623262089084.html

This is in accordance with the New Education Policy that promotes teaching in the mother tongue so students may grasp what is being taught in class with ease.In its academic council meeting held on Wednesday, the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University gave its consent to teach computer science in Hindi, said vice chancellor Vinay Kumar Pathak who chaired the meeting.The vice chancellor said a few private colleges have also shown interest to run the computer science course at the undergraduate level in Hindi. Their request was in sync with the New Education Policy and hence it was approved by the academic council.“The B Tech course in Hindi will help students coming from remote, rural backgrounds. Now it will be easy for them to study the subject in their own language,” said Vineet Kansal, pro vice-chancellor, AKTU and director, Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET), Lucknow.But there are a few hurdles to overcome as B Tech computer science books in Hindi are presently unavailable in the market. “It was felt that once a few colleges start B Tech in Hindi, then publishers will be encouraged to start printing books in Hindi or translate English books,” he said.An official said, “The New Education Policy approved by the Centre last year puts a focus on students’ mother tongue as the medium of instruction while emphasising that no language should be imposed on anyone. The policy document states that since children learn and grasp non-trivial concepts more quickly in the language spoken at home, which is often the mother tongue, it should preferably be the medium of instruction.”M Tech courses in Artificial Intelligence and Data ScienceSimultaneously, approval was given to start M Tech courses in artificial intelligence and data science from the upcoming session at the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET), Lucknow.Further in accordance with the New Education Policy, approval was given to IET to conduct two non-credit research-based courses in BTech. These courses include Practices and Ethical Issues in Research and Research Methodology.Besides, to comply with the New Education Policy, the university has given permission to conduct courses in five new branches in emerging areas. These include artificial intelligence and data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning, computer science and design, automation and robotics and MBA innovation entrepreneurship and venture development.Along with this, it was also decided to provide the benefit of the Homi Bhabha Teaching Fellowship of the University to the PhD students of the Centre for Advanced Studies of the University.In the meeting, approval was given for reimbursement of expenses incurred in internship to the students of the University’s Center for Advanced Studies, said Asheesh Misra, university spokesman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-b-tech-computer-science-in-hindi-at-aktu-colleges-101623261969769.html

Reviewing a meeting at Shakti Bhawan here, Sharma said that he had been getting a lot of complaints about power cuts in rural areas and asked officials to give top priority to resolving consumers’ grievances. “Use social media to inform people about emergency load shedding at the local level,” he suggested. Stressing the need for supply of electricity as per the roster, the minister asked the UPPCL chairman to see it that villages got uninterrupted power between sunset and sunrise unless there was an emergency requiring load shedding. He said farmers must get adequate electricity for irrigation purpose and asked officials to make arrangements of swiftly changing transformers that got damaged or burnt. He told officials to ensure that consumers got correct bills and fix accountability of the staff. The minister said business and other activities were getting normal with relaxations in the partial Corona curfew and this, he added, would further increase demand for power, posing a challenge to the staff to maintain supply. He said power employees had earned good reputation by working as Corona warriors and providing smooth supply of power to people during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ensure-regular-power-supply-to-villages-from-sunset-to-sunrise-energy-minister-101623261548986.html
09-06-2021||Lucknow||Jitin Prasada in BJP: Saffron party plays Brahmin card||Former union minister Jitin Prasada, 47, joining the BJP on Wednesday may help the saffron party address the issue of perceived neglect of Brahmins ahead of the 2022 UP assembly polls.Jitin Prasada, who in all probability is likely to be fielded in 2022 UP polls and may be among the star campaigners for the party, was among top opposition leaders who had through his ‘Brahmin Chetna Parishad’ been taking up the issue of neglect of Brahmins under the current BJP regime in UP. “Because, he was among those leaders considered close to the Congress top leadership, Jitin Prasada becomes even more important in UP,” a BJP leader explained.In 2017 UP polls too, BJP had got key Brahmin leaders from opposition space to defect - first getting Brajesh Pathak of the BSP, barely a day after he had coordinated a well-attended Mayawati rally and followed it up by getting former Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi, daughter of former UP chief minister Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna, to join the party. Both Pathak and Joshi had joined in 2016 within a few months of each other, both were given tickets to contest from coveted Lucknow assembly seats that are known as BJP bastions, and both made ministers in the Yogi Adityanath government after party’s landslide win. Joshi is now a BJP MP from Prayagraj.“Despite its shift to OBC-Dalits, the numerically dominant political vote banks, the BJP has nearer to the assembly polls treated ‘imported’ Brahmin leaders with respect and I think Jitin Prasada, who had twice been defeated in the Narendra Modi wave of 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls but continues to have a following in several regions, would be rewarded well,” a BJP leader said.Within the BJP, the joining of yet another key Brahmin leader from the opposition ranks is being seen as party leadership’s desire to look beyond the current crop of home-grown Brahmin leadership, largely limited to the likes of deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, a former mayor and presently an MLC, and Rajya Sabha MP and union minister Shiv Pratap Shukla.Barely a year after being persuaded by the Congress top leadership to reject BJP’s overtures in 2019, Jitin Prasada had set up a ‘Brahmin Chetna Parishad’ in 2020 to rally the Brahmins and had been targeting the Yogi Adityanath government for neglecting the community.In fact, till May, he had been tweeting Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s attack on the BJP. However, it was his June 5 tweet, wishing UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on his birthday that had first made many in the Congress uneasy.“Efforts were made to contact him since, but he remained inaccessible until today when it all came out in the open after his meeting Union home minister Amit Shah and railway minister Piyush Goel, followed by his meeting with BJP chief JP Nadda and his formal induction into the BJP,” a Congress leader said while admitting Prasada’s exit was a loss to the Congress.“He was feeling neglected. Though the Congress top leadership wanted him, a personal secretary of a powerful leader in the party was busy promoting Jitin Prasada’s adversary in the Lakhimpur Kheri region,” a Congress leader said.Prasada had won the 2009 Lok Sabha polls from Dharauhra Lok Sabha constituency, where he was credited of having carried out several development tasks – helping in the setting up of an ONGC hospital in Sisaiya, a charity eye hospital in Mohammadi and several projects to address the issue of annual floods that played havoc in the region.Some Congress leaders admitted that Prasada, whose father and political stalwart Jitendra Prasada had also served as political advisor to former Prime Ministers Rajiv Gandhi and PV Narasimha Rao, was politically of great value to the BJP in UP where the ruling party had appointed Brahmins in key bureaucratic positions to address the issue of perceived neglect of community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prasada-in-bjp-saffron-party-plays-brahmin-card-101623261369003.html

In the state budget presented in the assembly on March 8, the government had set aside ₹170 crore to fund the scheme to ensure timely payments to the corporation. The scope of the scheme was expanded to cover government college students as well. The government had also announced that the payments will be made every fortnight after the implementation on April 1. “The corporation has already sent bills amounting to ₹15.9 bills for April and ₹6 crore for the first fortnight of May. They are yet to be cleared,” said a PRTC official, who did not wish to be named. “The government has promised to sanction funds every fortnight, but it is strange that the bills have not been cleared for two months. Instead of making late payments to the corporation, the government should give the required amount in advance,” said Nirmal Singh Dhaliwal, convener, PRTC-linked trade unions.PRTC managing director Bhupinderpal Singh said the corporation has received a communication from the government that the payments will be made in the coming days. “We are ensuring that the bills are forwarded on time, so that there is no delay in receiving funds,” he said.Amid lockdown restrictions and free travel incentives, PRTC’s income has almost halved. It had been recording daily revenue of around ₹1.35 crore in March, which has gone down to ₹75-80 lakh since April 1.The corporation runs buses from nine depots in Ludhiana, Kapurthala, Chandigarh, Patiala, Bathinda, Budhlada, Barnala, Faridkot and Sangrur. “It spends around ₹65 lakh a day on diesel for running its full fleet of 1,073 buses, while the daily salary and pension bill is pegged at ₹55 lakh,” said Dhaliwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/prtc-awaits-31-crore-dues-for-providing-free-bus-travel-to-women-101623261009593.html

Even SAD vice-president Prem Singh Chandumjara is eyeing the seat, and is reported to have opposed Brar’s candidature. “I am here to build the party at the grassroots level, as earlier this seat was with the BJP. This duty has been assigned to me,” said Brar, while denying that there is any rebellion against him.Meanwhile, fissures within the party and possible division of votes between it and the old ally BJP has strengthened the chances of Congress to make a hat-trick in the constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/local-akali-workers-oppose-sukhbir-aide-s-foray-into-rajpura-seat-101623255008869.html

All the accused are on the run.Vanan said that the two girls, aged 16 and 17, have given video-recorded statements in which they have reiterated all the charges made in their statements to the special Pocso court. The girls said they were physically and mentally tortured at the home and made to give in to the sexual demands of the perpetrators.Police said the details are horrifying. “Investigation has found that Thapar allegedly had physical relations with the 19-year-old daughter of the warden, and he, along with others, used to sexually abuse and exploit the woman on a regular basis,” said Dr Vanan.The girls said they were in the children’s home for the past four years, but no action was taken despite repeated complaints to Tirkey, the CWC chief, the SSP said, adding that the police were looking at the involvement of some other suspects as well.The death of a three-and-a-half-year-old girl due to brain tumour in the home 25 days ago is also being investigated. “This little girl was the daughter of a rape survivor who didn’t want to keep her. Thapar and his wife didn’t inform the police or the district administration about the death, which they were legally bound to,” SSP Dr Vanan stated in his report to the Jamshedpur deputy commissioner, Suraj Kumar.Police are still awaiting medical reports of the two rescued girls to determine if they were raped.MTWT is a Jharkhand government-approved NGO. It has no links with Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity.The shelter home located at Shamsher Tower in Kharangajhar had 23 girls in two rooms on the second floor, while the warden lived in another room on the same floor with her daughter and son. Thapar and Tirkey lived on the first floor, while 22 boys lived on the ground floor.Police has recommended to the district collector to act against MTWT and CWC chief Tirkey, and to rehabilitate the girls. Twenty-one girls are being taken care of by the Seraikela-Kharsawan CWC for the time being.Vanan said police were also probing allegations that Thapar and Tirkey used to transfer government funds and private donations into their personal accounts. “The girls told us that they took away the money donated to them by many people for clothing, food and other items. All the five named accused will be arrested soon as different teams are raiding possible hideouts,” he said.In a similar case at a shelter home in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur, which came to the fore in three years ago, 12 people, including main accused Brajesh Thakur, were sentenced to life imprisonment in February 2020 by a Delhi court, which heard the case following orders from the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jharkhand-shelter-home-sexual-abuse-case-gets-bigger-accused-still-at-large-101623254828894.html

It had released ex gratia funds for 3,737 Covid-19 victims so far.Asked how many affected families had so far received the compensation amount, Amrit said, “We will check and revert.”The exercise was initiated after a bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar of the Patna high court ordered the state government to verify the death toll from all sources before placing it in the court. Bihar chief secretary and Patna divisional commissioner had in two affidavits, given a different death figure for Buxar district.“We are aghast at the manner in which the affidavits are being filed. The bench deserves better treatment from the government. We don’t appreciate this,” the bench said. The judges, who were hearing public interest litigation after reports about corpses floating in the Ganga, said the chief secretary’s affidavit said only six deaths had taken place in Buxar since March 1, 2021, while the divisional commissioner’s affidavit referred to 789 cremations at just one cremation ghat, Muktidham Charitarban, Buxar, between May 5 and May 14.The state health department, on the basis of the HC directive, had sent detailed instructions to district magistrates, civil surgeons, and heads of medical colleges and hospitals to verify from all sources the deaths at their respective institutions or at the district level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/73-jump-in-covid-toll-as-bihar-recounts-its-dead-101623254654678.html

Bihar has over 75,000 government schools covering all the panchayats and even larger number of private and affiliated schools.In the second phase, all the family members of the students of the schools will be covered. The in-charge medical officer and block education officer will coordinate prepare the list and select the schools for vaccine camps. A massive awareness campaign will also be launched to remove misgivings about vaccination and create awareness about the need of getting vaccinated.The move is significant in view of reports of widespread vaccine hesitancy, either due to certain misgivings or rumours. The Tika Express, a mobile van that carries healthcare staff to far-flung areas offering free vaccination at site to residents, has also met with resistance in several parts of the state.The government aims to cover the entire population above 18 years of age in a phased manner and hence it now wants to go via the trusted school route.Additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar and additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit have jointly written to all the district magistrates, civil surgeons and district education officers regarding this along with a format to be filled by teachers, parents and family members of the students. Jeevika and Asha volunteers will also be involved in the exercise.The letter says that the officers concerned will prepare an action plan to organised vaccination camps in at least 3-4 schools every day to cover all the persons of the area within three months. Each camp should be able to vaccinate at least 300 beneficiaries in a day and for this awareness campaigns should be launched to make people aware about the need of getting vaccinated to be safe and also keep others safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-plans-to-use-its-vast-network-of-schools-to-boost-vaccination-101623254648295.html

The Union minister participated in the ceremony virtually.Speaking about injections for treating black fungus, he said, “If there is any more need in UP, that too will be filled by the injection bank set up in Maharashtra by us.”“As and when UP would want, we can supply 50,000 injections, that too at a cheap price,” he added. “We have already lost many lives due to shortage of oxygen and, in such a situation, we have to be self-sufficient in the matter of oxygen supply,” he said. The plant is being constructed by Prabhavya Industries at Saraswati Hi-tech City. The minister said it was a good sign that a road constructing company was setting up an oxygen plant where 1500 cylinders of oxygen per day will be ready by September.The Union minister said Covid-19 vaccination will also have to be accelerated.“In such a situation, make big malls, parking lots as vaccination centres where people can get vaccinated by sitting in their cars,” he suggested.He added that preparations should be made in advance for ventilators as well. The ventilators that come from abroad cost ₹12 to 15 lakh each.“We have prepared ventilators in collaboration with MSME (unit) of Visakhapatnam at a cost of ₹1.48 lakh each and if UP needs it, we will make them available also,” he assured.Uttar deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said that there had been some problems regarding oxygen and ventilators during the second wave, but the government was now well prepared for the predicted third wave and the people of the state will not face inconvenience.Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister for MSMEs Sidharth Nath Singh said the Yogi government was setting up oxygen plants in the entire state and health facilities were rapidly being expanded and upgraded.Umesh Jaiswal, owner of Prabhavya Industries, announced that he would provide free oxygen from this plant to the Kaushambi district hospital, too.He has already announced free lifetime supply of oxygen to three government hospitals of Prayagraj district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gadkari-assures-up-of-all-help-in-fight-against-covid-black-fungus-101623253208101.html

No settlement can be achieved without the consent of Sikh Sangat (community) and Taksal.”The army had carried out the operation to flush out militants, led by the then Taksal head Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, out of the Golden Temple complex. The operation led to extensive damages, following which the SGPC filed a suit in the Delhi high court in 1985.On the court’s order, both sides — the Union government and SGPC — are ready to resolve the dispute out of court since 2019. However, no meeting has been held between the two sides so far. The SGPC discussed the issue in its last executive committee meeting held on June 2 and resolved to start the process of talks after the Operation Bluestar anniversary on June 6. “The SGPC is looking for possibilities of out-of-court settlement… However, we would like to warn it against taking the risk of doing so as the issue is not of money but is related to the dignity and sentiments of the Sikh community,” said Khalsa.The purpose of filing this suit by the then SGPC president Gurcharan Singh Tohra was to make the Centre admit that the military action was totally unjustified, he said, asking the incumbent, Bibi Jagir Kaur, to “stay alert on this issue and address it considering the sentiments of the Sikhs”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/damdami-taksal-against-out-of-court-settlement-of-op-bluestar-damages-suit-101623252968746.html

The existing lockdown is scheduled to end on June 14, after being extended for seven more days earlier on June 7.“Keeping the number of deaths and new cases in mind and aimed at bringing down the Covid-19 infections further, lockdown will not be relaxed at one go. Home minister Basavaraj Bommai, health minister K Sudhakar and I have held detailed discussions with the chief minister in this regard,” news agency PTI quoted minister R Ashoka.The minister said that relaxations to the Covid-19 restrictions in the state and the unlocking would be done in a phased manner. He also confirmed that the lockdown would not be lifted completely in one go and said that it might be done in four or five phases. “First will be timings, now the relaxation (for shopping) that is there between 6 to 10 am, it may get extended further. Also, those who go for a walk at parks may get some relief. All this is subjected to a final decision by the chief minister. Lockdown will not be relaxed at one go,” PTI further quoted Ashoka.Ashoka, who is currently the vice-chairman of Karnataka state disaster management authority (KSDMA), also said that the daily new infections in Bengaluru is still hovering around the 2,000-mark every day and it should fall below the 500-mark for an unlock. “We will also have to keep in mind the rise in positive cases as we unlock,” he added. Responding to a question, he also said that many sectors which are currently operating under the work-from-home scheme would continue to do so, while some other sectors like the medicine and medicine equipment manufacturers have already been given certain exemptions, the PTI report showed.Meanwhile, state health minister Dr K Sudhakar also denied any possibility that the restrictions would be lifted in one go. “As per experts' opinion, if [the] positivity rate is less than 5% and cases are less than 5,000, curbs can be lifted. There is no confusion on lifting restrictions. Other states like Maharashtra, have opened up only after reduction in cases. If you compare with other states, the second wave has relatively subdued quickly in our state,” he said. However, both ministers affirmed that all decisions would be taken and announced by chief minister BS Yediyurappa after consulting with experts.According to a bulletin from the state health department on Wednesday, 10,959 new Covid-19 cases were identified in Karnataka in the last 24 hours and 192 people lost their lives on the day.

On Wednesday, officials had to opt for police protection as they started land measurement in Ranje village as a part of the land acquisition exercise. The villagers accused that police force was brought to intimidate them though officials from MSRDC claimed it was a precautionary measure.The land acquisition of the western part of the outer ring road will be constructed by MSRDC beginning in March with 38 villages in four tehsils affected as about 763.12 hectares of private land will be acquired on the western side of the ring road. There has been increasing opposition from the farmers from Ranje, Kusgaon, Khopi, Kanjaale and Kelawade under Bhor tehsil.“I own 1.7 acres of irrigated agricultural land on which I have my home. Of this, almost 1.25 acres will be acquired for the ring road post which I will be left with a negligible piece of land. The administration should tell me how my family is supposed to earn a livelihood when we completely depend on this land’s agricultural produce for the earning,” said Pradip Jaykar, a resident of Ranje.Sandeep Patil sub-divisional engineer Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) said the presence of police personnel was only a precautionary measure and not to use force.“We have listened to farmers’ grievances and have tried to resolve their doubts. But further queries can be cleared only after completing the land measurement procedure. So, we are requesting the locals to let us complete that,” said Patil.The joint measurement survey has been undergoing on the western side of the Ring road and the survey process in 12 villages of 160 hectares has been completed so far. The land acquisition for the Eastern side has also begun but the Covid induced curbs and the resistance from affected villages have delayed the deadline of completion of the land acquisition process for the project.Other villages in Bhor tehsil have also started peaceful protests to oppose the land acquisition. Dinkar Dalvi, a resident of Kanjale village, accused the administration of not listening to the objections raised by the landowners saying the administration has not scheduled hearings and 90% of the objections are pending with them. “Whenever officials came for land measurement, we handed over the list of objections and asked them to come back after resolving those, but they keep mum on these issues,” he said.

09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Akali Dal slams meagre hike in paddy MSP||Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Wednesday termed the ₹72 per quintal hike in minimum support price (MSP) of paddy as “meagre”, adding that it would take agriculturalists further away from the Centre’s promise of doubling farm income by 2022. The central government has set ₹1,960 per quintal MSP for paddy this year, up from ₹1,888 in the last kharif season. Terming the hike not sufficient to cover the increase in the cost of agricultural inputs, including diesel and fertilisers, the SAD president said the government should have taken into account the actual cost of production while determining the MSP. “The 1.5-time-income formula should be applied on the actual cost of production, including rent and interest foregone by farmers on land and machinery,” he said.Asking the Centre to provide a level playing field to the farming community, Sukhbir said the MSP on paddy was a cruel joke on farmers who were already in a state of crisis due to the three farm laws, which were expected to undermine the MSP regime. “The careless manner in which the MSP has been calculated exposes the apathetic attitude of the government towards farmers. The SAD demands the government provides a remunerative support price to farmers as well as the agriculture sector,” said the party president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-dal-slams-meagre-hike-in-paddy-msp-101623248529363.html

He said the arrested kidnapper, identified as Santosh Chaubey, revealed that the couple’s luxurious lifestyle attracted them, and his gang decided to kidnap the woman believing that her husband would pay a hefty ransom for her safe release.STF deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Deepak Kumar Singh said the kidnappers demanded ₹1 crore from her husband and later settled for ₹25 lakh after multiple negotiation calls. He said the investigation so far suggested that 10 people were involved in the kidnapping plan and nine of them were still at large.The DSP said Anurag Shukla had lodged the complaint about his wife’s abduction with the Sushant Golf City police station on Sunday itself after getting the ransom call, but the incident was not publicised so that kidnappers did not become aware of the police team’s action plan.He also stated that the kidnappers had made the ransom calls to the woman’s husband from the woman’s phone by changing their location continuously.The STF team surrounded a house in a residential locality behind Vidya hospital near Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science (SGPGIMS) after tracking the caller’s location.The woman was found locked inside a room of the house and her limbs were bound with cloth at the time, the DSP added. Chaubey was arrested while the other alleged kidnappers managed to escape, he said.Four of the alleged kidnappers were identified as Jitendra, Kallu, Rohit and Bablu while the five others were yet to be identified, he said.Singh said the woman told police that she was abducted by a group of five people in a car.She said three persons pulled her into the car when she reached a deserted stretch while returning from her evening walk and they gave her a sedative to make her fall unconscious. She said she was continuously kept unconscious and allowed only to go to the toilet during the over 52 hours that she spent in captivity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-lawyer-rescued-from-kidnappers-clutches-in-lucknow-one-arrested-101623246007401.html

It was suspected that the vials meant for vaccination at the Naurangabad PHC were used at a vaccination camp in Noida last month instead.“A complaint was lodged by the district immunisation officer and the case was registered at the Gandhi Park police station in Aligarh against unidentified (people) over the 32 missing vials of Covid vaccine. Tough action will be taken against anyone found guilty,” the Aligarh CMO said.“The case was registered after staff nurse Pushpa gave unsatisfactory excuses that the vials were broken. The doctor on duty, medical officer Dr R Pillai, has been transferred from the Naurangabad primary health centre,” the Aligarh CMO said.The staff nurse and the medical officer have not been named in the case. “The chief medical officer in Noida, too, has registered a case at a local police station with regard to the matter. Now, the Aligarh police will investigate the matter along with the Noida police to find out where those vials have gone,” the Aligarh CMO added.In May, a vaccination camp was organised in a housing society in Noida. The first dose of the vaccine was administered to 187 residents of the housing society. After the two-day camp, when the residents downloaded their vaccination certificates, they found a difference in the dates and noticed that the Naurangabad primary health centre was mentioned (as the vaccination centre).The Noida residents complained and the matter reached Aligarh where CMO constituted a two-member committee after a shortage of vials was detected at the Naurangabad primary health centre. After receiving the inquiry report, the staff nurse was sent on leave on Monday and the medical officer transferred. On Tuesday, the staff nurse was suspended, the Aligarh CMO said. A case was also registered in Noida against the organiser of the camp where vials meant for vaccination at the Naurangabad PHC were allegedly used in Noida instead.Recently, a case was registered against an ANM (auxiliary nurse midwife) with the Jamalpur urban primary health centre in Aligarh after she allegedly threw 29 vaccine vials in a dustbin without administering them to the beneficiaries.The Civil Lines police of Aligarh are on the lookout for ANM Neha Khan who allegedly became untraceable after the case was registered against her and her service contract was revoked. Police have raided Kasganj city but are yet to nab Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/case-registered-in-aligarh-as-32-empty-covid-19-vaccine-vials-go-missing-101623245648409.html

Also, some developers have already started the vaccination campaign for their site-based workforce. The reports further mentioned that such focus indicated that project implementation and delivery would continue seamlessly once the Covid-19 second wave abates.Among the top seven cities, Mumbai alone accounted for nearly 25% of leasing activity in India in the first quarter of 2021, a 34 per cent growth on a quarterly basis, the report showed. Two real estate investment trusts (REIT) are headquartered in Mumbai -- Mindspace Business Parks, Brookfield -- have witnessed a rental collection of around 99%, despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the report showed.As far as the housing market is concerned, government incentives such as the stamp duty cuts, stamp duty reduction to female house-buyers and the recently announced Model Tenancy Act and healthy consumer demand have helped the property registrations and sales to increase in the last two quarters, the report said. Amidst the pandemic, Citroen has opened its first showroom in the city and popular brands have leased spaces in prominent malls and prime streets such continue to be in demand, the report mentioned.Emerging high growth assets, namely, data centres and warehousing and logistics, also seem promising for the city, which currently is a top location in India for data centres and accounts for 45% of the country’s existing capabilities. Also, major infrastructure projects such as Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link (MTHL), Coastal Road project and newer metro rail lines have already commenced gradually and once completed would enhance the city’s connectivity.Maharashtra continues to witness a decline in its daily new Covid-19 infections and Mumbai recorded seven new fatalities on Tuesday, its lowest since many days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-real-estate-sector-sustains-covid-19-second-wave-activity-to-pick-up-as-cases-abate-report-101623245004951.html

The opposition party will also demand that land acquisition for national highways be done on market rates and displacement compensation be offered to the affected landowners. Making the announcement on Wednesday, party spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said the vaccine and Fateh kit scams had shaken the conscience of Punjabis as the elected government and its members were profiting from their misery during the time of pandemic. “The Congress government has admitted its fault that it sold vaccines to private hospitals at huge margins and in turn allowed them to charge a premium. Instead of dismissing the health minister, Capt Amarinder Singh is shielding him and trying to silence the opposition by registering cases against senior Akali leaders for holding a peaceful and democratic protest to demand justice in the case,” said Cheema. Cheema said SAD president had also exposed the Fateh kit scam under which prices of medical kits, which were to be supplied to Covid patients, were jacked up repeatedly from ₹800 to ₹1,400 per kit by inviting one tender after another even as the first one was valid for six months.He said Sukhbir would lead a dharna outside the CM’s residence on June 15, and will be joined by other senior leaders of the party, including core committee members, legislators, former legislators, constituency in-charges, district presidents and youth unit office-bearers. On Monday, Sukhbir and 225 other party leaders and workers were booked for violating Covid-19 norms on the CM’s orders, after they had gathered for a protest near the health minister’s house in Mohali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/akali-dal-to-protest-outside-punjab-cm-s-house-on-june-15-101623243607929.html

We need to strike it down. The enemy is residing in certain areas and in some people who are unable to come out. Your (government) approach should be like a surgical strike. You are standing at the borders waiting for the virus carrier to come to you. You are not entering the enemy territory,” the bench observed.Now, beneficiaries can correct mistakes in vaccine certificate via Co-WINThe court said that the government has taken several decisions to alleviate the difficulties faced by the public but said that few of those decisions may have been delayed which led to loss of several lives. The Centre told the court that it cannot conduct a door-to-door vaccination programme at this moment.The court pointed out that door-to-door vaccination programmes have been started by Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar and Odisha and also by civic bodies in Vasai-Virar in Maharashtra.“Why should the same not be encouraged in other states across the country? The central government cannot clip the wings of those state governments and civic bodies who wish to do it (door-to-door vaccination) but are waiting for the Centre's nod,” the court said. The court also highlighted that only the Brihanmumbai Municipal Council and the Maharashtra government were waiting for the Centre’s nod.“Why is only the west waiting?” the court asked.The court directed additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for the Centre, to consider the issue.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Wednesday issued a red alert for Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts and said that these districts would receive very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places during the day.Catch full coverage of the Mumbai rainsThe chief minister directed the administration to also drain out the accumulated rainwater and resume transportation. Other than issuing directions to control rooms in Mumbai, the chief minister spoke to collectors of Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Palghar districts.Following the heavy rains, the traffic police was forced to shut four subways which led to vehicle owners abandoning their vehicles on roads. The traffic police closed Milan, Khar, Andheri and Malad subways for motorists due to water-logging.In Pictures: Unseasonal rain brings best air quality for Mumbai in 2 monthsRains also led to suspension of local train services from Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) to Thane and Vashi in Navi Mumbai, Sion and Chunabhatti. “In the morning between 9 am-10am in areas like Sion and Chunabhatti 55-60 mm rainfall was recorded. Owing to this, rain water came on the railway tracks. Currently road and railway traffic is affected only at three spots namely Dahisar subway, Sion and Chunabhatti,” Brihanmumbai Municipal Council (BMC) chief Iqbal Singh Chahal said.Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said that no claims regarding chances of waterlogging were mentioned earlier. “No-one has claimed that there will be no water logging in Mumbai due to heavy rainfall, nor can anyone make such a claim. But after waterlogging, if the water does not recede within 4 hours, in that scenario we can say that pre-monsoon work was not done properly,” Pednekar said.The city police asked Mumbai citizens to step out of their homes unnecessarily and asked them not to travel to inundated areas. Though there have been no reports of injuries or deaths due to the rain, heavy rains led to damage of vehicles as a wall collapsed in Savarkar Nagar in Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-rains-uddhav-asks-authorities-to-clear-out-inundated-areas-101623241603095.html
09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Never copy, rather make your life worth copying||The intricate subtleties involved in copying during exams were one of the rare domains in which academically weaker dimwits exercised a coveted edge over their egghead peers. To sneak peek into the student’s paper sitting ahead of you with squinted eyes needed adept mastering of oscillating your whole body left to right and vice-versa or craning your neck at a tilt over their shoulders right on time when the examiner’s focus lapsed a little in dealing with other miscreants. The absence of unity, loyalty, mutual synchronisation, and teamwork made one-sided cheating even tougher. After catching the offenders unaware, the examiner, if genial, would let them off the hook with a plain warning, otherwise, they would straightway snatch their sheets before escorting them out of the hall on a quiet. Hard-core cheaters were diligent in laying a strong groundwork well before the announcement of the datesheet as they shelled out a considerable time befriending luminaries whom they expected as neighbours in exams. The subdued cries of a failing candidate falling upon deaf ears would eventually galvanize them into pleadingly tapping their saviour’s back, though, those soft and gentle futile taps would transform into uncouth tugs of the shirts and blazers to draw special attention at the earliest. Feeling helpless over the ineffectiveness of their moderate endeavours, stooping to the most daring act to score passing marks as saving grace turned out to be their last resort. They would silently fish out all those abridged rolls of chits tucked deep into the remote confines of their shoes, socks, and even thief pockets for utmost urgency. No surprises for a correct guess about the final fate of all those offenders if heaven forbid their little clumsiness in the execution requiring nippy manoeuvres or an element of complacency put them in the examiner’s crosshairs. A stroke of luck besides the seating arrangement played a decisive role in clearing the hurdles for the harried students heading for writing an exam of an underprepared subject. However, my best friend and I were fortunate to have had roll numbers in sequence and working in tandem, we both cooed answers ear to ear, save our bad luck when I would get the last bench with her seat at the front of the next row. Separated by distance yet close by stratagems, our flair for tracking the movement of the eyeballs besides our lip-reading skills significantly helped us build an invisible bridge of communication that never caved in. Our foolproof record goaded us into swapping each other’s sheet for the first and last time before the prying eyes of the examiner once caught both of us by sheer surprise. We were summoned to the then principal of our school, and our good academic record was factored in to commute our punishment from getting rusticated to only a dressing down. Now, as an examiner, spotting the vulnerable tricks of the students soaked in innocence and immaturity would often take me back in time when we harboured a similar misconception that hoodwinking the examiner was child’s play by just fidgeting, wincing our foreheads, twiddling our thumbs or by pretending to tie the laces of our shoes. My childhood slip-up indeed helped me realise that copying had zero scope in both exams and life. Better for the kids to score less or even flunk the subject with honour in lieu of cheating on their own values. My principal’s remarks uttered that day still reverberate loud and clear: Never copy, rather make your life worth copying. shilpirasotra@gmail.com The writer is a government teacher in Pathankot||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/never-copy-rather-make-your-life-worth-copying-101623241147522.html
09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Political row in Himachal over demand to rename Dalhousie||The demand to rename Dalhousie, a hill station in Himachal Pradesh, after freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose has sparked off a political debate. Rajya Sabha BJP member Subramanian Swamy has written to the state government, demanding Dalhousie be rechristened Subhas Nagar. Former chief minister Shanta Kumar said on Tuesday that he had written letters to governor Bandaru Dattatreya and chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, demanding the town be renamed after the freedom fighter. Also read: Govt hikes MSP for various kharif or summer-sown crops by up to 62%When contacted, Thakur was evasive and said, “There is no information on this matter so far.” A Raj Bhavan official said that the governor had not received any letter on the renaming of the town from either Swamy or Shanta Kumar so far. Local residents opposed to move: Cong MLA Local Congress MLA Asha Kumari has opposed any such move and written to Thakur. “Residents of Dalhousie town are opposed to any such proposal that is why the previous (Congress) government turned down the proposal. Dalhousie is a famous hill station known nationally and internationally,” she said. She requested the chief minister to respect the sentiments of the people. “There is no point changing names of places. Instead, the government should focus on development,” she said. Local businessman Paramjeet Singh said, “Dalhousie is a town with its own old world charm. Why rename it?” Monument sought for Tagore, Ajit Singh, too But in his letter, Shanta Kumar said that his government had passed an ordinance in 1992 to rename the town after Netaji but later the Congress reversed the BJP’s decision. Besides Bose, Shanta Kumar demanded a monument to pay tribute to Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore, who had written parts of his famous composition, Gitanjali, at the hill station, and revolutionary leader Bhagat Singh’s uncle, Ajit Singh, who had spent time in Dalhousie during the freedom struggle. It is said that Bose was won over by the beauty of Dalhousie and stayed at the hill station for several months in 1937. There are two places named after him in the town, Subhash Baoli and Subhash Chowk, which also has his statue. Asha Kumari said, “We have high regard for Netaji in whose memory a chowk has already been built here.” The state government may hold a referendum in the town to gauge the sentiments of the locals on whether they are in support of renaming Dalhousie, she said. The town, set up in 1850, was the summer retreat of Lord Dalhousie, the British governor general in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/political-row-in-himachal-over-demand-to-rename-dalhousie-101623237907434.html
09-06-2021||Other||Sutradhara’s tales: “Political terrorism” leads to the darkest time in Pune’s history||The medieval times were indeed barbaric! Wanton destruction of towns and settlements was not an uncommon sight in medieval Deccan. Western Deccan became a fierce battleground where the Mughals, Adishahi and Nizamshahi dynasties were engaged in a constant power struggle. Kasbe Pune stood in the middle of the violent crossfire. Today, we shall sadly witness the harrowing account of Pune’s destruction due to “political terrorism”.Pune’s association with the Bhonsale family began when Maloji Raje Bhonsale, grandfather of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was granted the jahagir of Pune Pargana (subdivision consisting of a group of villages), in 1595 by the Nizam of Ahmednagar.Around 1600, Delhi emperor Akbar descended south and took over a large part of Ahmednagar’s Nizamshahi. For a short period, the Pune Pargana became part of the Mughal territory. But, before it could stabilise, within 20 years, Malik Ambar, the able prime minister of the Nizam re-conquered the territory and brought it under the Nizamshahi thus, overthrowing the Mughal rule. Like his father Maloji, Shahaji served in the army of Malik Ambar of the Ahmednagar Sultanate. At the time of Maloji’s death in 1606, the 12-year old Shahaji was a minor commander in Malik Ambar’s army. He, however, rose to the level of “Sar-lakshar” commander in few years.In 1601, he defeated Adishahi Sardar Ramrao to capture the territory of Pune and included the Pargana in the Nizam’s domains. Shahji soon became a trusted commander under the encouragement of Malik Ambar and was granted the jahagir of Pune and Shirval Pargana. However, there arose a discord between the two, and Shahaji Maharaj established an independent rule over the two Parganas. Malik Ambar tried overthrowing Shahaji’s rule by sending in armed forces, but Shahaji did not heed. He, in turn, joined the Adilshahi domain and served as commander under Bijapur’s Adilshah. Shahaji served Adilshahi wholeheartedly during the period of 1625 to 1628, till the demise of Ibrahim Adilshah. After the death of the king, Shahaji suffered due to unpleasant politics brewing in the kingdom and, at the same time, he as invited by the Nizam of Ahmednagar to return. The pressing reason for such an invitation was that the Mughal emperor Shahajahan was marching towards Ahmednagar to conquer the Nizam’s territory. Malik Ambar, who was the original reason Shahaji left, had passed away in 1626. So, it was natural for Shahaji to return to the Nizamshahi, and he took charge of his core territory around Pune in 1628.The violent betrayal and murder of his father-in-law, Lakhuji Jadhav (father of Jijabai), at the hands of Nizamshah in 1630 came as a rude shock to Shahaji, and he was compelled to resign from service under the Ahmednagar’s Nizam. He declared his independence and rebelled against the Nizamshahi and the Adilshahi at the same time. He sided with the Mughals for a while and was awarded the jahagir of Junnar and Pune.This move angered both parties, Nizamashahi in the north at Ahmednagar, and Adilshahi in the south at Bijapur. To crush Shahaji’s rebellion, Adilshahi commander Murar Jagdeo attacked Pune in 1630 and captured the town. Moro Tandeo Honap Deshpande, who was in-charge of Pune, was hiding underground on the banks of the river Bhima. He was captured by Murar Jagadeo’s forces, severely tortured with needles and nails, and badly beaten-up. The entire city was terrorised. Wadas, public buildings and crops were destroyed. The walls of the fort Killa-e-Hissar were brought down, and the city was literally killed. Residents were harassed and looted. Most inhabitants fled and took shelter in the hills around Pune. The wealthy merchants of Pune were taken to Bhuleshwar hill near Saswad as prisoners, where a new fort of Daulat Mangal was built and made the new administrative centre of the Pune region.It was not enough that the entire settlement was destroyed. The “terrorism” was such that the deepest fear of inhabiting the land was implanted through the installation of a gruesome symbol. The phrase “gadhavacha nangar firawane” (to plough a piece of land using a donkey), comes into existence because of this act. It is believed that a stone called “gadha gadhav”, or a medieval version of the gadhegal – literally translated as the “curse stone of an ass”, which also served as a royal decree, was installed near Kumbhar ves. The stone was marked by a pinning a broken sandal to its surface, symbolising no habitation allowed. The donkey is the only animal which copulates with a horse to produce a mule, which cannot reproduce again, and is considered inauspicious. The donkey is the mount of the Vedic man-woman god, Nirruti, and symbolises sinful behaviour and destruction. During early medieval times, when a king wanted to declare any piece of land uncultivable or inhabitable, he would get the piece of land tilled by yoking donkeys to the plough. Thus, the donkey was understood as a symbol of a non-productive waste land which would not yield any agricultural produce, and nor would people inhabit it. And if someone occupies such a land against the royal decree, they would be rendered childless.This nasty threat instilled deep terror in the minds of Pune’s inhabitants. They feared severe action by Adilshahi forces if they dared occupy the land. In addition to this, “sultani” (political) calamity, the “asmani” (from the skies) calamity too was eminent for Pune. All of Pune region suffered acute drought and famine in the early decades of the 17th century. Water and food was difficult to come by and it led to mass deaths and an exodus. The period from 1630 to 1638 is the darkest time in the history of Pune. Was there any hope left for Pune? Would any saviour arrive? That we will see in the next column.Saili Palande-Datar is an indologist, environmentalist, history researcher and farmer.

09-06-2021||Other||As stocks run out fast, Delhi govt assures all beneficiaries will get free ration||New Delhi: A large number of temporary food grains distribution centres set up as a lockdown relief measure by the Delhi government for those who don’t possess a ration card ran out of stocks on Tuesday, forcing officials to turn away people, several beneficiaries HT talked to said. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the scheme on May 18 and it was implemented from June 5. Needy people who don’t possess ration cards, including unorganised workers, migrant workers, building and construction workers, domestic helps are eligible to receive food grains under this relief initiative. The Delhi government estimated 2 million such beneficiaries in the city and identified 280 government schools as distribution centres. In the first phase, the government aims to cover 200,000 people.The Delhi government on Tuesday said the stocks will be replenished soon and grievances raised by several beneficiaries of the scheme will be resolved at the earliest.“We need the ration at any cost. We do not have enough to spend on food grains at this point,” said Pushpa Devi, 43, whose family are migrants from Saran district in Bihar and have their ration cards registered in their home state. Devi reached the Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in northwest Delhi’s Narela on Tuesday morning to collect ration but could not get it. Kaushalya Devi, another beneficiary, who too returned home without ration from a centre in north east Delhi’s Seemapuri, said, “We are already troubled by the delay and now we are forced to line up for ration every day. It is extremely painful.” Under the initiative, the government is distributing 4 kg wheat and 1 kg rice. On Tuesday, beneficiaries who queued up at distribution centres operating from government schools in several localities including Hauz Rani, Shahpur Jat, Chirag Dilli, Munirka, Seemapuri, RK Puram, Safdarjung Enclave, New Ashok Nagar and Ber Sarai were reportedly turned away after stocks ran out. On Saturday and Monday, several such centres in Khajuri Khas, East of Kailash, Dilshad Garden, Kalyanpuri, Jahangirpuri, Badarpur, Manglapuri and Gokalpuri could not cater to the crowds. Delhi’s food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain said centres ran out of stocks because a large number of people turned up “in excess of what was expected”. “But people should not be concerned. We have placed orders with the Food Corporation of India for more food grains, which will arrive soon,” he said. Over the past two days, there were also several instances of people being denied ration for not carrying identity documents and not having valid mobile numbers, even though the government order – a copy of which HT has seen – has provision for giving food grains on self-declaration in such cases.Regarding such complaints, Hussain said, “We have taken note of all kinds of grievances reported by the people. We assure you that things will be further streamlined in the coming days to make the entire process smooth and hassle-free. The Aam Aadmi Party government believes that ration is the right of people.”Anjali Bhardwaj, Right to Food campaigner and a member of Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, said the centres are running out of stocks since the beneficiaries are way above the government estimates. “The Aam Aadmi Party government has claimed that the situation is not grim this year. But they have capped the total distribution at 200,000 beneficiaries in the first phase, which can extend to a maximum of 2 million -- as against 6.9 million beneficiaries estimated last year. This is the reason why most government schools are out of stock or has not received any food grains. The government should fix this problem at the earliest.”The Delhi government had launched a similar scheme in March 2020 in the light of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-stocks-run-out-fast-delhi-govt-assures-all-beneficiaries-will-get-free-ration-101623235071316.html

Believing him, they downloaded the app and deposited ₹91,200 and ₹73000,” said Kumar.However, when they didn’t receive any return even after one month, they realised they had been duped, he added.“A probe was initiated by the special task force which found that the mobile app in question was available on Google Play Store between February 2021 and May 12, 2021, during which, it was downloaded by at least 50 lakh people. It also found that the money deposited through the app was then transferred to bank accounts of the arrested accused through payment gateways,” said the police officer. He added that the money was then converted into crypto currencies.“During the cyber forensic probe, the app was linked to China, where Pandey’s handlers are sitting. They used to en-cash the crypto currencies into their local currency to end the chain of money laundering, which started with duping Indians through the app,” said Kumar.Uttarakhand’s deputy inspector general (law & order) Nilesh Bharne, who was one among the investigators, said, “The accused Chinese handlers used to befriend Indians by luring them... with the promise of some commission under the garb of expanding their business in India.”“In this case too, they partnered with Pandey and used his identity documents to register a shadow company with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) and to open two bank accounts, where the money siphoned off from the victims was deposited. They opened a shadow company in Noida named Purple Hui Zing Zihao. Pandey was registered as the company’s owner and the firm was shown as the developer of the fraudulent app,” said Bharne.Pandey said the bank accounts and the company were handled remotely by the Chinese accused while he received commission from them.“He was paid ₹1.50 lakh by the Chinese as ‘salary’. He... also told police that there are many other similar apps being operated by his handlers... using the same modus operandi,” said Bharne, adding the accused used to initially double a few investments to win the trust of prospective investors.The senior police officer said the police now have a list of 25 similar applications available on Google Play Store.“We have taken at least 20 such shadow companies under our radar for suspected fraudulent activities like the above mentioned one. We have received 20 other similar complaints from people in the state and they [the complaints] are under probe,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/china-based-online-money-laundering-racket-using-cryptocurrencies-exposed-cops-101623228591644.html

09-06-2021||Bangalore||Govt to ensure students get access to online studies amid pandemic: Karnataka HC||Karnataka high court said on Tuesday that the state will be violating the fundamental right to education if it fails to give children access to technology, required for online education during the Coved-19 pandemic. It also asked the government to complete a survey on children’s access to gadgets such as mobiles and television by July 5 and report the results to the HC on July 8.The instruction came during a hearing on a petition questioning the state government’s preparation for effective and equitable delivery of online education. While the state claimed that around 20% students in government-run and aided schools don’t have access to electronic gadgets or televisions for online education, the petitioners cited related national government data to claim the number was likely to be much higher.A division bench of justice BV Nagarathna and justice Hanchate Sanjeev Kumar expressed concern and said there was a real threat that children without access to online education could be drafted for child labour, begging or any rather harmful activities. It added that poor girls cut off from online education, particularly in rural areas, could be married off.“If the object of article 21A is to be emphasized, education is to be imparted to children up to the age of 14 years as it is their fundamental fight, and the obligation is on the state to provide access to education by means of technology in absence of [offline] school[ing]… due to [the] pandemic. If such steps are not taken for these children by the state, ….[it]would be a failure on [the] part of the state in ensuring the fundamental rights…,” the court observed.Senior Advocate Harish Narasappa, appearing for petitioner Sanjeev Narrain, said the number of students excluded from online education in Karnataka was likely to be much higher than the estimates provided by the state.“I have attached the report of the National Statistical Office (NSO) of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, 2018, which states that in Karnataka, only a dismal 2% of rural households have access to a computer and only 8.3% have access to internet facilities. For urban households, only 22.9% have access to a computer and 33.5% have access to internet facilities,” Narasappa said.Following this, the bench asked the state to collect data on the availability of necessary gadgets among the children in the state by July 5 and submit the report to the HC on July 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/govt-to-ensure-students-get-access-to-online-studies-amid-pandemic-karnataka-hc-101623224871432.html

The chief minister visited such a vaccination center on this day and remarked that people were very happy about the fact that they can now get a vaccine dose near their residences, where they cast their vote. The campaign focuses on convenience as there is no hassle of online booking and booth officers are coming to people's homes for the vaccination, he said.Also Read: Get vaccinated where you vote, urges Kejriwal, announces door-to-door awareness campaignTaking to his official handle on Twitter on Wednesday, Delhi chief Arvind Kejriwal wrote, "Visited a center started under the "Jahan Vote, Wahi Vaccine" campaign today.

"A new initiative launched in Delhi, 'Jahan Vote, Wahan Vaccination'. People weren't coming in large numbers, so we thought they'll have to be invited.

09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Avert apocalypse, gear up for third Covid wave||The second Covid-19 wave has left our collective consciousness battered and bruised. Images of the living lying alongside the dead in hospitals, near and dear ones trying to administer oxygen out of a cylinder to critical patients on pavements outside overwhelmed healthcare facilities and bloated corpses in the Ganga as if trying to find solace in afterlife are surreal images likely to haunt us for life. After the natural calamity unfolded, we saw gross mismanagement, ineptitude and hubris of those at the helm. Also read: India must procure vaccines in full measure to keep children safe: SisodiaAfter the first wave abated last year, the Centre not only lowered the guard by declaring a premature victory over coronavirus, but also failed to ramp up healthcare facilities, augment oxygen supplies and step up vaccination to fight the second wave, as advised by epidemiologists. The elephant in the room was allowed through super-spreader events such as the Kumbh Mela and election rallies in Bengal. Even with the second wave on an upsurge, Prime Minister Narendra Modi exulting over the size of the election gathering in Bengal and Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar inaugurating three makeshift Covid hospitals in the presence of crowds, throwing Covid protocol to the wind, signify rules are meant only for the public. Administer free universal immunisation In his address to the nation on Monday, Modi made a U-turn on the vaccination policy, declaring that the Centre will now buy 75% of the vaccines, leaving 25% quota of vaccination to the private sector. This rethink seems to have been forced by searching questions asked by the Supreme Court on the vaccination policy for the 18-45 age group. The government was hard put to explain why it had allowed a differential pricing for vaccines for the Centre, states and private sector instead of the Centre using its better economy of scale, leverage for negotiation with international manufacturers; why a 25% quota had been allocated to the private sector that would charge for vaccination instead of free universal immunisation; and how the budgetary allocation of ₹35,000 crore for vaccination had been expended. Unnecessary delay in the vaccination procurement by the Centre could be lethal in combating the next wave. By the commercialisation of the vaccination drive, the Centre has been trying to reinvent the wheel, whereas all vaccination drives, such as BCG/DPT for the eradication of TB, diphtheria, smallpox, measles, cholera, typhoid or polio, had been done through free universal immunisation programmes in the past. Improve health infrastructure in Haryana Based on global patterns, epidemiologists see a third Covid-19 wave in India sometime in the last quarter of this year. If the virus mutant takes on a more lethal form, it could be a catastrophe of apocalyptic dimensions. In this context, the failure of the Haryana government to lay a single brick or make any headway in respect of the Choudhry Bansi Lal Medical College at Bhiwani project, approved for a cost of ₹450 crore during former MP Shruti Choudhry’s tenure, is retrograde and irrational. Equally disappointing is the Haryana government’s failure to ensure the supply of Amphotericin-B injections for black fungus patients. Such patients from Bhiwani are referred to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak, or the medical college at Agroha in Hisar, where they are left to fend for themselves in the absence of medicines or proper treatment protocol. Ramp up vaccination drive We need to gear up better for the third wave. For ramping up the vaccination drive and healthcare facilities, committees of elected representatives from panchayats or municipalities, health personnel and district administration officials should be constituted at the district, sub-division, block and village/ward levels. All citizens should be vaccinated free of cost by the year-end. The vaccination target is stiff but doable if done through panchayats and municipalities. Second, a village-level dispensary has usually a staff of a doctor an ASHA worker in Haryana with a large number of posts lying vacant. Doctors to population ratio in India is 1:1100 for urban areas, while it is 1:12000 in villages. Covid centres for cluster of villages In view of this skewed situation, a cluster of 10 villages/wards can pool their staff at one place by mutual consent, and make a Covid centre operational at a central location so that nobody from the cluster has to travel more than 10km. Medical/paramedical staff should be trained in providing oxygen support to Covid patients, vaccination, conducting RT-PCR and antigen tests. Each such cluster of villages/wards should be provided with a radiologist and a lab technician, testing equipment and an X-Ray machine. Services of retired medical personnel and final year students/interns doing MBBS/nursing courses should be used. Third, the funds should be provided from PM-CARES and budgetary allocations for healthcare/vaccination and reserve funds of the Reserve Bank of India. This will enable our PHCs/CHCs and multi-specialty hospitals to tend to critical Covid patients and non-Covid patients. The costs on the above are not too large, if we take into account the loss of jobs besides disruption to lives and livelihood that a cataclysmic wave of the pandemic can cause.

The concept was developed by the social welfare department.Out of the 40 after care institutions for girls in the state, the majority have been closed due to poor maintenance and management, and at present, only 11 homes for girls, 23 homes for boys and 25 adoption centres are functional.“These too will be closed once the Vrihad Aashray Grihas come into existence. We have decided to close all kinds of homes for children in need of care and protection (CNCP) in the state after Vrihad Aashray centres get ready by 2022. Children of all government care institutions including adoption centres, observation homes, after care homes, homes for children in conflict with law, will be shifted to these Aashray,” Rajkumar, director, social welfare department, said.In Patna, five acre land has been acquired at Bihta for setting up a Vrihad Aashray Griha, which will be developed by the building construction department, Rajkumar said, adding that similar complexes will come up in Siwan, Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Gopalganj, Gaya, Bhagalpur, Purnia, Bhojpur, Sheohar and West Champaran districts.He added that all the street children, orphans, those abandoned and destitute will be given shelter at these centres. “Besides children who have been victims of commercial and sexual exploitation, trafficking, children in conflict with law or those who lose parents due to natural disasters, will also get protection,” he said.Suresh, a social activist, welcomed the move. “The best part of these new homes is the skill development training facility. It will provide children the opportunity to prepare themselves to face the world,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-plans-to-erase-muzaffarpur-shelter-home-blot-with-modern-care-centres-101623222051191.html

09-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police trains youngsters to bolster healthcare services||With the second wave of the pandemic having wreaked havoc on Delhi’s healthcare infrastructure, Delhi Police is now training hundreds of youngsters in general duty assistance and emergency medical services under its YUVA initiative. This project has been conceived to help bridge the gap in the requirement for healthcare professionals in the city, and also keeps in purview the expected third wave of Covid-19. In the health sector, the youngsters are being employed across various hospitals and private firms, to offer services under different categories. “After being trained under YUVA, the youngsters are working in home care services for Covid patients, as emergency medical technicians (EMT) and general duty assistants at hospitals, and also at various path labs as lab assistants,” says Rajeev Kumar, one of the trainers who is imparting knowledge under this programme. “We teach the students at various skill centres provided by Delhi Police, use smart classes, latest equipment and then reach out to companies for employment opportunities. During the pandemic, we conducted classes both online and offline, and many of the trained professionals have now found jobs in the city,” adds Kumar. One of the trained youngsters, Shivam Singh, a 19-year-old, is grateful to have found support from the police department. “I was introduced to the programme by a friend, went to a few classes and fell in love with the process of education and training. In the three month course, I was trained to be a nurse. I’m currently working as a home nurse with a private firm, and taking care of Covid patients in Gurugram’s sector 22. I’m glad to be able to give something to the society, while earning enough to sustain myself,” says Singh.Yamini Sharma, another 19-year-old who was trained as an EMT, is now working at a private hospital in Delhi and assisting in the vaccination programme. “Whenever there is a vaccination drive at private companies, I’m sent to assist the team as a data entry operator and keep the information for the process, manage verification of individuals amid other tasks. Even amid the pandemic, I’m happy that I’m employed and can contribute to my family during this distressing time,” says Sharma.Devesh Srivastava, special commissioner of police (Economic Offences Wing), who is overseeing the programme, says, “It’s important to keep youngsters off the streets and away from bad influences, which is why YUVA trains them. We select youngsters between the age of 17 and 25 years, train them for 3-4 months, and then help them connect to a potential employer. Due to the pandemic, many youngsters lost their jobs and this became a good platform to reskill themselves and join the health sector. We will be bringing more unemployed youth within the purview of the programme and help place them as technicians and assistants in different hospitals and centres after completing their training.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-trains-youngsters-to-bolster-healthcare-services-101623217432313.html

09-06-2021||Mumbai||How India's most crowded city Mumbai beat the odds, and the virus||When Covid-19 arrived in India, few places looked as vulnerable as Mumbai. But a year on, South Asia's most crowded city has surprised many by tackling a vicious second wave with considerable success.Gaurav Awasthi even travelled hundreds of kilometres from his home on the outskirts of Delhi to get his ailing wife a hospital bed there, paying an ambulance more than a thousand dollars to drive 24 hours straight."I cannot ever repay my debt to this city," the 29-year-old told AFP, recounting an ordeal that saw him spend five days fruitlessly searching for a bed across several cities, including Delhi."I don't know if my wife would be alive today if it weren't for Mumbai's health facilities."Bodies in wardsThe bodies began turning up early in India's financial capital during the first wave of infections last year -- a man collapsing on a busy road, a rickshaw driver slumped over the wheel, a corpse lying in the street -- in a grim echo of the 1918 flu pandemic.By May 2020, Abhignya Patra was working 18-hour days at the massive Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, better known as Sion."It was non-stop," the 27-year-old anaesthesiologist told AFP.Patients' relatives described distressing scenes inside packed wards, with one man telling AFP he had to change his sick mother's diapers himself because staff were too overworked.A video shot inside Sion and widely shared on social media showed corpses wrapped in black plastic left on beds in a ward where patients were being treated.Every night, the city helpline fielded thousands of calls from desperate citizens, many with no chance of getting admitted to a publicly-funded hospital: Mumbai had just 80 ambulances and 425 intensive care units for a population of 20 million.'Chase the virus'Something had to change fast, said Iqbal Chahal, a no-nonsense bureaucrat who took over as Mumbai's municipal commissioner last May.New field hospitals added thousands of beds, private facilities handed over their Covid-19 wards to the government and 800 vehicles were turned into ambulances.But these efforts could not combat the swift rise in infections."We needed to chase the virus," Chahal told AFP.A proactive approach focused on 55 slums including India's largest, Dharavi, where a strict lockdown was accompanied by aggressive sanitisation of public toilets, mass coronavirus screening and a huge volunteer effort to ensure that nobody went hungry.All positive test reports in Mumbai were routed through "war rooms" manned by doctors who would triage cases and decide where to send the patient, irrespective of "whether he is a minister, a big shot or a slum dweller", Chahal said.Forward thinkingAs 2020 wore on, it looked like India might have miraculously beaten the pandemic and lockdown restrictions were eased.But in Mumbai, authorities didn't dismantle a single bed in the now-deserted field hospitals.This meant that when cases surged in March, the metropolis was much better prepared than many other Indian cities, where the health care system came close to collapse.In the capital Delhi and elsewhere, patients died outside hospitals and crematoriums were overwhelmed. But not in Mumbai.Despite having a much higher population density than many other cities, Mumbai has seen significantly lower mortality rates.The city still suffered close calls, Chahal said, recalling one night in April when six hospitals faced dire oxygen shortages, putting 168 patients at serious risk unless they were shifted to other facilities.Everyone survived."We always expected a second wave," Chahal said.'Wake-up call'Patra recalls getting calls from colleagues in Delhi desperately searching for medical equipment."As doctors, there is very little we can do in the absence of infrastructure," she said.Ruben Mascarenhas, co-founder of Mumbai-based non-profit Khaana Chahiye, said he would get dozens of messages every morning from people begging for oxygen and drugs -- but as the pandemic wore on, the requests mostly came from outside the city.He was, he says, "pleasantly surprised", but is "very cautious about celebrating yet."He is not the only one.An experienced marathon-runner, Chahal is already preparing for a third wave -- expected to hit children hard -- by stockpiling oxygen, building paediatric field hospitals and expanding capacity at public hospitals."This has been a wake-up call for us," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/how-india-s-most-crowded-city-mumbai-beat-the-odds-and-the-virus-101623213669478.html
09-06-2021||Patna||Advisory panels to run Panchayati Raj institutions in Bihar due to delayed polls||The Bihar government has entrusted the job of running the panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) in the state to the advisory committees, headed by the chiefs of elected gram panchayats, zila parishads and gram kucherys even after the expiry of their five-year term on June 15, officials said.The new mechanism was necessitated since the panchayat elections could not be held on time due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The state government passed an ordinance to amend the Bihar Panchayati Raj Act 2006 on June 2 to allow continuity of the rural institutions.Additional chief secretary of the panchayati raj department Amrit Lal Meena said the terms and conditions governing the functioning of the existing PRIs will remain unchanged, while mukhiyas, chairmen of zila parishads and heads of gram kutcherys lead the advisory committees of their respective bodies till the constitution of new committees after fresh elections.“The government would notify the alternative arrangement for those rural institutions, which do not have elected heads at the time of [the] constitution of the advisory committee. Up mukhiyas, deputy chairmen and up sarpanch of gram kucherys will function as the deputy chief of the advisory committees,” said Meena.Earlier, panchayati raj minister Samrat Chaudhary had said that the approved system will ensure that Central funds don’t remain unutilised and all elected members continue to function in the interim.The Panchayati Raj system was established in accordance with the 73rd Amendment of the Constitution and it is a three- tier structure based on direct elections at the village, block and district levels.Exemption from constituting the intermediate tier is given to states with less than 2 million population.The cabinet chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar also approved the release of ₹456 crore for acquisition of land along the existing Danapur-Bihta road to build a four-lane elevated road under the PM’s package. The national highways authority of India (NHAI) would step in to start the construction once the road construction department (RCD) offered them additional land after the acquisition, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/advisory-panels-to-run-panchayati-raj-institutions-in-bihar-due-to-delayed-polls-101623211130701.html

Mani Khera, Rinkle Khera’s brother, said he met additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, city 1) Pragya Jain and demanded that the investigation should be marked to another officer. He alleged that Waryam is biased and favours Congress councillor Gurdeep Singh Neetu, who is allegedly involved in the murder.Mani added that the ADCP has assured them that she will keep a tab on the progress of the inquiry. Jain confirmed that the family requested a change in the investigating officer, following which she has transferred the probe to ACP north.The matter had taken a turn on June 1 after proclaimed offender Sunny Nai appeared on social networking sites with a confession video and claimed that he had executed the killing at the behest of Congress councillor Gurdeep Singh Neetu and his two sons. Sunny had also raised questions against the special investigation team which had given a clean chit to Neetu.“We have handed over videos of confession by one of the main accused, Sunny Nai, to the ADCP, who has directed the ACP to investigate all those people Nai had named in his confession,” he added. On June 2, Mani filed a complaint with police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal, who had marked a probe to ADCP Pragya Jain.Rinkle Khera was hacked to death by a group of assailants on July 19, 2018. The police had registered a murder case against Gurdeep Singh Neetu, his son Jatinder Pal Singh and six others.

09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Irregularities in purchase of Fateh kits: BJP, AAP accuse Captain govt of committing ₹8-cr fraud||After it rolled back the vaccine stock meant for private hospitals following allegations of profiting, the ruling Congress regime is yet again under fire after the local units of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) accused the government of committing an alleged fraud of ₹8 crore in the purchase of Fateh kits.Both the parties held separate conferences on Tuesday wherein they presented documents and claimed that despite having received a lower bid, the ruling party purchased the Fateh kits at a hefty price, which had caused a loss of ₹8 crore to the government exchequer.BJP leader Anil Sareen and AAP district president Suresh Goyal stated that even though a medical store in Patiala had floated a tender offering to provide the kits at ₹837.76 per unit on April 1, the state government on April 3 issued a purchase order for the first lot of 50,000 Fateh kits at ₹940.80 per unit, the second lot of 50,000 kits at ₹1226.40 per unit and the third lot of 1.5 lakh kits at ₹1,338 per unit, respectively.BJP leader Sareen demanded a CBI probe into the matter. While expressing concern over the issue, Sareen said a small rank employee of the health department would be made a scapegoat while the real culprits will go scot-free. Sareen added that while people were dying due to vaccine shortages and lack of treatment, the government was minting money.Suresh Goyal said that earlier the government had tried to fill its coffers by selling off the Covid vaccines to private hospitals at a premium and now its leaders had indulged in a scam during procurement of kits. “Transfer of Neeraj Singla, director (finance), National Health Mission, Punjab, after the scam is proof that embezzlement had taken place,” said Goyal.The government is already facing flak for purchasing vaccines for ₹400 per vial and selling it to private hospitals at ₹1,060 per unit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/irregularities-in-purchase-of-fateh-kits-bjp-aap-accuse-captain-govt-of-committing-8-cr-fraud-101623183708894.html

The total number of infections since the beginning of the pandemic is 85,704, including 81,553 recoveries.There are 2,110 active cases in the district at present. Currently, 32 Covid patients are on ventilator support in the city.DC rolls out directions for districtA day after the state government announced certain relaxations, Ludhiana deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma rolled out fresh directions on Tuesday.There will be no change in the weekend curfew as all shops have been ordered to remain shut over the weekend. The latest edition of the lockdown allows shops to stay open till 6pm while private offices can function at 50% capacity. Up to 20 people will be allowed to attend gatherings such as weddings and cremations, states the decision taken by the state government. It has also allowed recruitment exams, sports training, and organising of national and international events. Tent dealers’ body seeks reliefThe Punjab Tent Dealers’ Welfare Association met the deputy commissioner on Tuesday and submitted a memorandum demanding relief for the sector. Chief patron Vijay K Singla from Moga said the pandemic has adversely affected the wedding business, while also casting a shadow on related sectors such as catering, marriage palaces, DJ, flower decoration, photography, bands as well as lighting. General secretary Shiv Shanker Rai demanded that the number of guests currently allowed at weddings be increased from 20 so that they can prevent the labourers engaged in this industry from going back to their native states.The representatives also sought that the government should direct the landlords to waive rent of those connected with the industry for this period as their businesses are “doomed”.Meanwhile, the Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal asked the government to allow the shops to open on Sundays. Ruing losses, mandal’s general secretary Sunil Mehra expressed dissatisfaction over the announcement that curfew will continue on Sundays. He pointed out that traders from Punjab and other parts of the country usually visit the wholesale markets of the city and other trading hubs on Sundays and therefore continuing curfew restrictions on Sundays is not “justified”. He urged the chief minister to withdraw the Sunday restrictions as the count of Covid cases has reduced in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/daily-covid-caseload-continues-to-drop-as-only-115-test-ve-in-ludhiana-101623183648208.html

09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Dog sterilisation process resumes in Ludhiana||At a time when stray dog menace continues to haunt locals and the memories of brutal canine attack on a 15-year-old girl in Krishna Nagar are still fresh, the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) on Tuesday restarted the dog sterilisation project, which was halted for over three months, with the opening of a new block of animal birth control facility in Haibowal dairy complex on Tuesday.Inaugurating the facility established at a cost of around ₹1 crore under the Smart City Mission, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said the menace will be brought under control within 18 months. Mayor Balkar Sandhu, senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra, and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal were among others who were present during the event. A Delhi-based firm has been awarded the contract and two teams of 12 members, including veterinarians and dog catchers, will be working to catch and sterilise stray dogs in the city with a target of sterilising 60 animals on daily basis. MC officials said the civic body will pay ₹1,200 to the company for sterilising a dog and the contract has been signed for two years. Under the previous contract, which expired in February, MC used to pay ₹990 to a Hyderabad-based firm.Ashu said the newly established centre has preparation and sterilisation rooms, operation theatre, 22 kennels, including six pre and 16 post-operation kennels. Following the surgery, the sterilised dogs will be kept under observation for five to six days and then left in the same area from where they were caught so that their natural habitat is not disturbed. Before releasing the dogs, anti-rabies shots will also be administered to them.He said, “The sterilisation target will be increased from 60 to 100 dogs per day in the coming time. As per the experts, the menace will be brought under control within a period of 18 months.”The sterilisation project came to the halt on March 1 after the term of the previous contract expired. The MC delayed the process to hire a new contractor and a contract with the current firm was signed in May. On an average, 35-40 dog bite cases are reported at the civil hospital per day.Commenced in 2015, the project was facing roadblocks since last August due to the exodus of labourers amid the pandemic. The officials stated that around 50,000 dogs have been sterilised under the project till now. Covid norms floutedDespite a ban on political gatherings as per the Covid restrictions imposed in the state, over 70 people, including senior Congress leaders and workers, participated in the inaugural event organised at the centre. No social distancing was observed and despite cops’ deployment at the spot for security purposes, many of the participants were seen without masks.

Now, show-cause notices have been issued to 48 junior engineers (JEs) and subdivisional officer-level officials to whom the books were issued initially.MC officials have to mention the measurements of construction projects taken up by the contractors in these books and payment to the contractor is made on the basis of the same. The issue of the missing books is raised after every audit, but no concrete action was taken by the civic body in the past. Complaints have also been submitted with the local bodies department regarding the missing books by RTI activists.Senior officials involved in the inquiry suspect large-scale embezzlement as payments are made to the contractors on the basis of the details mentioned in these books. Development projects worth crores have been taken up by MC since 2013.One of the civic body officials, requesting anonymity, said in many cases, the measurement books are handed over to the contractors by MC staffers and politicians have been patronising the officials in the past.MC additional commissioner Rishipal Singh said, “An inquiry has been initiated and show-cause notices issued to 48 officials to whom the books were issued initially. We are investigating the matter and further action will be taken as per the directions received from the higher authorities.”3 JEs accuse SDO of fraudulently transferring 77 books in their namesAccusing a subdivisional officer (SDO) of forcibly trying to hand over 77 already filled measurement books, three JEs deputed in Zone-C office of the MC have submitted a complaint with the additional commissioner’s office. The JE alleged that the SDO, who was in possession of the books for the last seven to eight years, has fraudulently transferred them in their (JEs) names after an inquiry into the missing books was initiated by the higher authorities. Over a week has elapsed after the books have been transferred to us in the official records, but the same have still not been handed over to us, alleged the JEs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/200-measurement-books-missing-from-ludhiana-mc-records-since-2013-101623183528629.html

09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Sentencing in Kotkhai rape case deferred to June 15||A special court of the Central Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday deferred announcement of the quantum of sentence in the Kotkhai rape and murder case to June 15. The hearing has been deferred for the fifth time since April 28, when the court had held the lone accused, Anil Kumar, alias Nilu, a wood cutter, guilty of rape and murder.The verdict had been announced by special judge Rajiv Bharadwaj after hearing both the defence and prosecution through video conference. The accused could not be produced in court because of the coronavirus curfew. A Class-10 student in Kotkhai town of Shimla district had gone missing on July 4, 2017. On July 6, the victim’s body was found in Tandi forest. Initially, the special investigation team constituted by the state police had arrested six people in the state. The death of one of the six suspects, Suraj Kumar, in police custody after an alleged severe beating, triggered widespread protests in the state. The case was later transferred to the CBI, who arrested the 25-year-old lumberjack after DNA testing on April 14, 2018, which led to the exoneration of the six people arrested by Himachal Pradesh Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sentencing-in-kotkhai-rape-case-deferred-to-june-15-101623181847919.html

State vice-president Pawan Kajal and general secretaries Ashish Butail and Kewal Singh Pathania were also present on the occasion.Mahajan said Union BJP government is guilty of criminal mismanagement of Covid-19. “Vaccination is the only protection amid the raging pandemic but the Modi government’s vaccination strategy has been a dangerous cocktail of blunders and bloopers.” “While other countries had started placing purchase orders for vaccines from May 2020, the Centre and state governments did it only in January 2021. To date, the government has ordered only 39 crore vaccine doses for a population of 140 crore. India has administered 21.31 crore vaccine doses till May 31 but only 4.45 crore people have received both the shots which is only 3.17% of India’s population. In last 134 days, the average pace of vaccination is about 16 lakh vaccine doses per day.

09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Amid downturn in virus cases, J&K experts say no room for complacency||As coronavirus disease cases in Jammu and Kashmir continue their downward trend, experts have asked the public to not lower their guard as it could lead to another upsurge in infections in the Union Territory. Around 4,000 people have died in the UT since the virus outbreak in March 2020. May had proved to be deadliest month with 1,625 deaths and 1,14,382 infections. The lockdown has played a vital role in curtailing the spread, which is being reflected in the hospitals’ reduced caseloads, says Baramulla Government Medical College senior doctor Dr Javeed Iqbal. “We are witnessing fewer cases than what was seen in April,” he said. On June 7, the daily case count of J&K dropped below 1,000. The active cases dropped to 23,524 against the peak of 52,848 recorded on May 13. The overall recoveries reached 2,73,853, prompting the recovery rate to climb over 90% on Monday - after 49 days. SKIMS Bemina senior consultant Dr Abdul Ahad Wani says everybody needs to be extremely cautious. “We cannot lower our guard. The situation vis-à-vis Covid is tense but under control. People need to follow all precautions and not think that the virus is gone.”“Many Covid patients continue to be hospitalised. The situation has improved and so has the need for oxygen concentrators and beds. However, the virus is very unpredictable and any leniency could cause trouble in the coming months,” said Dr Amjid Shah, adding that people should stay masked, avoid crowded places and get the jab. Meanwhile, to determine Covid antibody prevalence, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is conducting the fourth round of the “National sero-survey for COVID-19” later this month in the same 70 districts, in which the first three rounds were conducted. In Kashmir, the survey will be conducted at south Kashmir’s Pulwama district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-downturn-in-virus-cases-j-k-experts-say-no-room-for-complacency-101623181487934.html

The tribunal bench, presided over by NGT chairperson and former Supreme Court judge AK Goel (justice retired), directed UT to ensure that sewage from the city flowing into the Ghaggar River is treated and sought a report within two months.It directed the Punjab chief secretary and UT adviser in coordination with other officials concerned, to take appropriate remedial measures and ensure zero discharge of untreated water out of city. It took serious view of an application filed by lawyer and activist Sunaina, who had told NGT that contaminated water from Chandigarh enters nullahs in Mohali and the river, which is used by nearby farmers for cultivation, thus polluting the entire food chain and jeopardising the health of people and aquatic life. The plea wanted the administration and Punjab to install necessary sewage treatment plants. “If the state itself fails to implement the law, it is nothing but a breakdown of the system itself. Is this tribunal to just remain silent on such gross failure or hold highest authorities accountable by directing their prosecution for their criminal failure and indirectly being party to the crime against the law of the land? We expect answers to these questions from the states,” the NGT bench observed.It further said that for delay and continued violation, realistic compensation has to be recovered from the erring officers, apart from other action or in default, the compensation has to be quantified and recovered. It also sought recommendation from an executive NGT committee in this regard“We hope that the states realise their responsibility to function according to the Constitution and take immediate remedial measures by punishing the guilty of failing to comply with the law and also take prompt measures instead of repeatedly taking the same plea of being engaged in tender process or DPRs. It should not be difficult at this length of time to overcome such procedural requirements and to effectively prevent discharge of the untreated effluents after 46 years of enactment of Water Act and repeated orders of the Supreme Court and other courts,” the bench said.It was in 2019, directions were issued to ensure release of 100% treated water into rivers and nullahs by March March 31, 2020. However, NGT observed that there is hardly any significant improvement. “It is breach of public trust under Public Trust Doctrine. We are left with a feeling that there is no commitment to the rule of law and no concern for the environment and health of the citizens on the part of the authorities concerned,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ngt-pulls-up-chandigarh-admn-over-release-of-untreated-sewage-into-ghaggar-101623181368612.html

The special court has now posted the plea for further hearing on Wednesday. NIA in its application claimed that the possible involvement of a terrorist organisation, Jaish-ul-Hind, and its alleged demand for money from industrialist Mukesh Ambani needs a deeper probe. The agency also sought an extension of the detention period of the five accused – former Mumbai Police personnel Sachin Vaze, Riyazuddin Kazi and Sunil Mane and Vinayak Shinde, and cricket bookie Naresh Gor – for 90 more days. The agency, while seeking extension of their custody, claimed that the accused “will in all possible manner threaten the prosecution witnesses, cause destruction of material evidences/articles, tamper with the evidences collected by NIA, thus, hampering the very purpose of investigation of this case.” On February 25, an SUV was found abandoned near Ambani’s residence Antilia with explosives and a threatening note addressed to the businessman. Hiran, the owner of the SUV, who had reported it stolen on February 17 was found dead on March 5 in a creek near Mumbra. NIA took over the cases and Vaze was arrested in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-case-nia-wants-to-probe-terror-angle-seeks-90-day-extension-for-filing-charge-sheet-101623181127297.html

09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Parents want Mohali, Panchkula schools to put balance sheets online||After the Punjab and Haryana high court upheld Chandigarh administration’s law mandating private unaided schools to upload their balance sheets on their websites, the parents of children studying in Panchkula and Mohali are also asking that the schools here follow suit.The chairman of the Panchkula Parents’ Association, Bharat Bhushan Bansal, said, “In Panchkula, some schools do submit details of their balance sheets to the education department, but we want them to put this information out in public domain. The high court’s decision should also be applicable to schools in the state of Haryana.”President of the association, Manish Banger, added that the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had recently issued instructions regarding mandatory public disclosure by schools on their websites: “We will write to the CBSE authorities soon if these instructions are not followed by the schools here.”RTE, Haryana Education Act also mandate financial transparencyExplaining the legal angle, advocate Pardeep Rapria, former law officer of the Central Information Commission, said, “In Panchkula, all schools follow the Haryana Education Act, according to which the schools are required to present their balance sheets to the directorate of education for each academic year in a suo-moto manner. However, schools don’t do this. Further, as per Section 4 of the Right to Information Act, they are also required to upload the information online so it is accessible by the people.”Speaking about this, district education elementary officer, Panchkula, Nirupama said, “We have received no instructions regarding this. Private elementary schools under my charge haven’t uploaded the details online.”Chandigarh had adopted its rules from the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institution Act, 2016, that has a clause of making balance sheets public; the Independent School Association (ISA) had challenged it in their complaint back in 2018.Clause adopted by UT not applicable in Punjab schoolsThe Act that is applicable in Punjab, however, doesn’t have this clause, as per advocate Charanpal Singh Bagri, who is representing parents in Punjab over the issue of fee for the academic year 2020-2021.“The Justice Amar Dutt Committee in 2013 had recommended that all schools upload their balance sheets online, but this clause was not included in the 2016 Act,” said Bagri, adding that the matter of uploading balance sheets during the pandemic by Punjab schools is currently pending in the Supreme Court.Parents of children studying in Mohali schools are also seeking similar rules. Raman Sidana, who has a son studying in a private school here, said, “Though the classes have gone online, we continue to pay the same fees, which is unjustified. Once the summer vacations are over, parents are sure to object to these.”Another parent with two children studying in two different private schools in Mohali, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Some protests were organised by parents in the beginning of April, too, in demand for more transparency of finances by the schools. However, schools tried to threaten us and as Covid cases went up, the protests also stopped. We will start again when the situation improves.”In Chandigarh, while the UT education department will soon start taking action against schools who haven’t uploaded their balance sheets online, the Independent School Association plans to move the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/parents-want-mohali-panchkula-schools-to-put-balance-sheets-online-101623180769028.html

Each canteen needs to have windows and computers as per the veterans’ strength so that each one of us gets time to visit the canteen twice in a month,” reads the letter written by the NGO.The president of the NGO, Lt Col (retd) SS Sohi, said, “We have received complaints that veterans are facing problems due to the closure of CSD canteens. The canteens should be opened at all places as per the guidelines of the local administration. We also request that there should be an ex-servicemen cell at every station.”Proposal for Sainik Welfare CentreIn the letter, the NGO has also proposed that a piece of land on GT Road between Karnal and Panipat, which was donated by a veteran for defence use, could be used for setting up a Sainik Welfare Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exservicemen-flag-liquor-quota-csd-canteen-problems-in-chandigarh-101623180767946.html
09-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s civic plaints down by 27% in Covid yr: Praja||In the pandemic year, the number of civic complaints from Mumbaiites declined by 27% as compared to 2019, a report by non-government organisation (NGO) Praja has revealed. Civic body officials have declined to comment on the report.In 2019, there were 128,145 civic complaints that went down to 93,774 last year. The report added that roads, water supply, drainage and storm water drains were the departments that saw a major slump in the number of complaints. However, despite this decline, the average number of days taken to close a complaint went up from 30 in 2019 to 39 days last year.According to the NGO, the complaints went down in 2020 as Covid-related activities had to be prioritised, which may also have resulted in the increase in the time taken to address basic civic complaints. The number of closed complaints also fell to 82% in 2020 from 96% in 2019, the report revealed.According to Praja’s data, complaints related to roads fell by 55%, from 15,239 in 2019 to 6,908 in 2020. The closed complaints pertaining to roads also fell in 2020 to 67% from 95% in 2019, while the average number of days taken to solve these complaints increased to 52 days last year, compared to 31 in 2019.The number of complaints related to storm water drains also went down to 1,409 in 2020 against 2,155 recorded in 2019. The average number of days taken to resolve each of these complaints went up to 62 days from 34 days in 2019. In the case of solid waste management department, the complaints went down by 32%, but the days needed to resolve one issue went up to 43 days from 2019’s 19.However, in the pandemic year, plaints related to pest control saw a surge, indicating that citizens were thoughtful about health and hygiene. In 2019, there were 7,501 complaints related to pest control, which shot up to 10,971 last year. Further, the days required to solve issues related to pest control also went up to 26 days from 17 days in 2019. “Ideally, the days taken to resolve the number of complaints should not have gone up as they had declined in 2020. But as the staff was deployed in Covid-19 duties, the days to address the complaints took longer,” said Milind Mhaske, director, Praja.According to the report, 74% of complainants did not use the Councillor’s Code, a method that would have increased accountability of elected representatives. The report also pointed out to an imbalance in water provided to slum and non-slum areas. It further stated that while the civic body claims achieving 100% door-to-door collection of waste as of 2019-20, the NGO found that 34% of all the solid waste management complaints in 2020 were on non-collection of garbage. The NGO also said that only one out of every four public toilet seats is for women.Praja also stated that in wake of BMC’s Covid-19 management, three key areas of successes came to light that can be carried forward in the post-pandemic rebuilding to improve the services at ward level. These included decentralisation of various functions at local level for inclusive decision-making, better quality of services and setting up of the war rooms. “BMC should collaborate with various stakeholders to find innovative solutions for city’s growth. This will not only help with the day-to-day services efficiently but also in becoming a future ready city,” said Praja’s founder trustee Nitai Mehta||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-civic-plaints-down-by-27-in-covid-yr-praja-101623180708498.html

He and his uncle Surinder Singh were booked on the complaint of his father-in-law, Paramjeet Singh, a resident of Nizampura Hawelian village in Amritsar district.In his complaint to the Mohali SSP in February last year, Paramjeet stated that Harjeet and his father, Resham Singh, lived in the US.For a kidney ailment, Paramjeet approached a private hospital in Phase 8, Mohali, where he was advised a transplant.

09-06-2021||Mumbai||Mhada: 21 south Mumbai structures are extremely dangerous||The Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada) on Tuesday said that as per its pre-monsoon survey, of the 14,755 dilapidated buildings in the Island city, 21 are ‘extremely dangerous’. It has asked the residents staying in the 21 structures to immediately vacate their houses. There are 717 tenants (460 residential and 257 commercial) in these buildings, located at Mazagaon, Girguam, Khetwadi, VP Road and Nagpada in south Mumbai. The Mumbai Repairs and Reconstruction Board, an arm of Mhada, looks after the maintenance of old buildings in the Island city and conducts survey of old buildings before the onset of monsoon every year. It then directs the residents (owners and tenants) of buildings, which are in a dangerous condition and may collapse during heavy rains, to vacate the premises. The residents are given free transit tenements built by Mhada. Vinod Ghosalkar, chairman, Mumbai Repair and Reconstruction Board, said, “These buildings can collapse anytime and hence, we requested the residents to move out immediately. We will accommodate these tenants at our transit accommodations,” said Ghosalkar.When asked whether the residents are being reluctant to move out, Ghosalkar said, “I will meet them personally, and I’m sure they will heed to my request. We have the power to forcibly evict, but we’ll exercise restraint.” He said that most of the transit accommodations are in the suburbs.Of these 21 structures, 10 have been repeated from last year’s list. Last year, 18 structures were declared ‘extremely dangerous’.These buildings will be demolished after they are vacated. The landlord and tenants will have to go for revamp by appointing a private builder or Mhada will take up the task. The residents of these buildings are, however, unwilling to move out, stating that they will permanently lose their homes in south Mumbai. “We’ve seen that many of the residents who had shifted in the past few decades never came back and languished in the dirty Mhada transit camps in far off suburbs,” said a 45-year-old homemaker living in a Mazagaon chawl. “Mhada should understand that our lives – jobs, schools and everything else – are based in south Mumbai and we will not be able to sustain in far off suburbs. They should give us transit accommodation here itself,” she added.Ghosalkar agreed that the previous experiences of tenants were not pleasant, but assured that to ensure that they be back in south Mumbai. “We are working on a policy to ensure that these tenants get new houses in south Mumbai itself,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mhada21-south-mumbai-structures-are-extremely-dangerous-101623180467255.html
09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Congress slams BJP-JJP regime for denying tube-well connections to farmers||The Congress on Tuesday criticised the Haryana government for denying tube-well connections to those farmers whose land was in the command area of a canal. Describing the decision as “Tughlaqi’, Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala said the anti-farmer move of the Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janta Party government will adversely affect the farmers.Quoting a May 1 order, Surjewala said this would mean that tubewell connections will no longer be sanctioned in Ambala, Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra, Karnal, Panipat, Kaithal, Jind, Hisar, Fatehabad, Bhiwani, Charkhi Dadri, Mahendragarh, Mewat and Gurugram as in these districts, 80-90 % of the area comes under the flow or lift command area of canal irrigation. “The farmers of northern and southern Haryana will be the most affected by this decision. Does chief minister ML Khattar and his deputy Dushyant Chautala know that canal water is available in most of Haryana for only seven days in a month? In southern Haryana, the availability of irrigation water is even lesser as they get it after 45 days and sometimes after 60 days. So how will the farmer be able to cultivate his land?” Surjewala asked. Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said farmers were facing problems in getting electricity and tube well connections. “Connections will be given to only those farmers who get no objection certificate from the irrigation department. In such a situation, farmers who had deposited the security many years ago are left clueless and wondering what to do next,” said Hooda. The former chief minister said the government is changing the rules and standards time and again to the disadvantage of farmers. “Sometimes, the standards of electric motor are changed while at other times, rules of ground water level are changed. Farmers do not even have the freedom to take the motor of their choice,” Hooda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-slams-bjp-jjp-regime-for-denying-tube-well-connections-to-farmers-101623180347974.html
09-06-2021||Other||After 40 days, Lucknow set for a fresh start today||With the state government extending relaxations in corona curfew to all 75 UP districts after active Covid cases came below 600-mark in each of these districts, shops, temples, government as well as private offices, mandis and restaurants (only for home deliveries) in the state capital will reopen from 7am to 7pm from Wednesday but with strict guidelines, said senior government officials on Tuesday.The state government had imposed partial corona curfew on April 30 for a couple of days after spike in cases in the second wave of the pandemic. However, it kept extending it before relaxations came into effect on June 1 in 55 districts which had less than 600 active cases each. They said government and private offices had also been allowed to function with up to 50% of their staff on rotation. Lucknow divisional commissioner Ranjan Kumar said since active Covid cases had gone below 600-mark fixed by the state government, the ‘corona curfew’ will be lifted in a planned manner from Wednesday.“However, people are expected to follow the Covid protocols of maintaining social distancing and necessarily wearing masks,” he added. Popular city markets like Aminabad, Chowk, Bhootnath, Alambagh and Naka largely wore a deserted look since April 30 when the ‘corona curfew’ was first imposed.Traders expect normalcy will return to markets if people adhere to all guidelines and precautions strictly. President, UP Adarsh Vyapar Mandal, Sanjay Gupta has appealed to traders to strictly follow Covid-19 protocols to keep infection in check in the city. He said although ‘corona curfew’ had been relaxed, corona was very much there and so the traders must maintain social distancing, promote wearing masks among staff and customers as well as keep sanitisers and thermometers.Gupta said it was the responsibility of every trader and shopkeeper as this only will allow their business to return to normal. He said all markets and shops will be functioning on weekdays (Monday to Friday) from 7am to 7pm and will observe weekly closure on Saturdays and Sundays.A senior district administration official said only five visitors at a time will be allowed to enter a temple avoid crowding. He said meat and fish shops will be allowed to open only on the condition that proper cleanliness and sanitisation is maintained there.He said the masks will be mandatory for all people riding two and four wheelers. He said marriage functions and other programmes will be allowed with restrictions of 25 people who will have to follow Covid protocols. Similarly, maximum 20 people will be allowed at a funeral, he added.He also said schools, shopping malls, cinema halls, coaching institutes, swimming pools and bars will stay closed across the state capital till further orders. However, restaurants can operate only for home deliveries across the city as well as roadside (highways and expressways) dhabas, carts, and kiosks will be allowed to function.Lucknow commissioner of police Dhruv Kant Thakur said patrol parties and picket duties will be deployed in market areas to ensure strict adherence of Covid guidelines. In addition, vehicular traffic and maintaining law and order will be our priority, he added.Earlier, the government had announced relaxations in corona curfew on June 1 for the districts having fewer than 600 active cases. The order had highlighted that restrictions would automatically return to any district where active cases went beyond 600-mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-40-days-lucknow-set-for-a-fresh-start-today-101623180288367.html

09-06-2021||Mumbai||Forest dept to focus on 5 key tasks at Aarey||As the state transferred 812 acres of Aarey land to the forest department for safekeeping on Monday, officials will have their work cut out as they take over the area’s administrative responsibilities, which was managed by dairy department.Officials described five major developments that are expected to take place in coming weeks and months: a site inspection by the city surveyor’s office, settlement of rights under the Indian Forest Act (IFA), 1927, creation of a fire management plan for the area, assessing infrastructure requirements and creation of a habitat management plan for wildlife. “There are two things that need to begin on priority. One, we will engage the city surveyor’s office to do field survey so that the final demarcation of the 812 acres can be done on the ground. Once that is done, we can take better steps to protect certain areas if needed, by putting up walls or fences. The other thing that needs to start is settlement of rights of by Forest Settlement officer (FSO). All the relevant documents for this will be provided to the appointed forest settlement officer within a week or so,” said G Mallikarjuna, conservator of forests, Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP).Mallikarjuna also said the forest department will be drawing up a detailed fire management plan for the 812 acres, akin to the one implemented at SGNP. “Fires have been a major problem in Aarey, but as we did not have the land possession, we couldn’t do much. We’ll now be able to create fire lines and use dedicated staff to put out any blaze,” he said, adding that work on this is likely to begin soon after rain.The department is also expected to hold talks with volunteers of various research groups and NGOs to start regular wildlife counts. “There is already a wealth of information available on Aarey’s biodiversity, thanks to citizens and researchers. We will use that and work with volunteers to keep a track of their [animals’] movements and numbers. We’ll also have to prepare a habitat management plan to ensure sustained availability of resources, such as water, all through the year for wildlife,” said Mallikarjuna.The department will also have to assess their infrastructure requirements. “Offices for field staff, lights, barricades, security check posts, watchtowers, vehicles... all that are required for the daily operations will need to be assessed and requisitioned. We have a team of four forest guards and one forester, but if we require more staff then arrangements will be made,” he said.While activists welcomed the steps, they also said the handover has happened too late. “These things should have begun in October itself, when the declaration was notified. The state should complete the resettlement process within a time frame. The final declaration should be expedited before more encroachments come up,” said Stalin D, director, NGO Vanashakti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/forest-dept-to-focus-on-5-key-tasks-at-aarey-101623180228320.html
09-06-2021||Delhi||As stocks run out fast, govt assures free ration to all||A large number of temporary food grain distribution centres set up as a lockdown relief measure by the Delhi government for those who don’t possess a ration card ran out of stocks on Tuesday, forcing officials to turn away people, several beneficiaries HT talked to said.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the scheme on May 18 and it was implemented from June 5. Needy people who don’t possess ration cards, including unorganised workers, migrant workers, building and construction workers, domestic helps are eligible to receive food grains under this relief initiative. The Delhi government estimated 2 million such beneficiaries in the city and identified 280 government schools as distribution centres. In the first phase, the government aims to cover 200,000 people.The Delhi government on Tuesday said the stocks will be replenished soon and grievances raised by several beneficiaries of the scheme will be resolved at the earliest. “We need the ration at any cost. We do not have enough to spend on food grains at this point,” said Pushpa Devi, 43, whose family are migrants from Saran district in Bihar and have their ration cards registered in their home state. Devi reached the Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Narela on Tuesday morning to collect ration but could not get it.Kaushalya Devi, another beneficiary, who too returned home without ration from a centre in north east Delhi’s Seemapuri, said, “We are already troubled by the delay and now we are forced to line up for ration every day. It is extremely painful.”On Tuesday, beneficiaries who queued up at distribution centres operating from government schools in several localities including Hauz Rani, Shahpur Jat, Chirag Dilli, Munirka, Seemapuri, RK Puram, Safdarjung Enclave, New Ashok Nagar and Ber Sarai were reportedly turned away after stocks ran out.Delhi’s food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain said centres ran out of stocks because a large number of people turned up “in excess of what was expected”. “But people should not be concerned. We have placed orders with the Food Corporation of India for more food grains, which will arrive soon,” he said.Over the past two days, there were instances of people being denied ration for not carrying identity documents and not having valid mobile numbers, even though the government order has provision for giving food grains on self-declaration in such cases.Regarding such complaints, Hussain said, “We have taken note of all kinds of grievances reported by the people. We assure you that things will be further streamlined in the coming days to make the entire process smooth and hassle-free. AAP government believes that ration is the right of people.”Anjali Bhardwaj, Right to Food campaigner and a member of Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan, said the centres are running out of stocks since the beneficiaries are way above the government estimates. “The Aam Aadmi Party government has claimed that the situation is not grim this year. But they have capped the total distribution at 200,000 beneficiaries in the first phase, which can extend to a maximum of 2 million -- as against 6.9 million beneficiaries estimated last year. This is the reason why most government schools are out of stock or has not received any food grains. The government should fix this problem at the earliest.”The Delhi government had launched a similar scheme in March 2020 in light of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-stocks-run-out-fast-govt-assures-free-ration-to-all-101623180016320.html

09-06-2021||Delhi||Clear ration scheme in national interest: Kejriwal writes to PM||he Delhi government is ready to make whatever changes the central government will suggest in its long-delayed doorstep ration delivery scheme, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to approve the project in “national interest”.He said his government only aims to provide ration to the poor and does not want any credit.“The centre through the media has also said that the Delhi government will charge money from the poor for doorstep delivery of ration. This is absolutely wrong, sir. We shall not charge a single penny from the beneficiaries for this scheme… I have just one aim — to provide ration to the poor at any cost. You please allow me to implement this scheme. All credit will be yours. I myself will tell the whole world that this scheme has been rolled out by the Prime Minister of India… Till date, I have supported you in all your decisions of national interest… You also support us in this scheme of national interest, sir,” Kejriwal wrote.In his letter, Kejriwal said all governments, for the past 75 years, have forced the poor of the country to queue up for ration.“Do not make them stand in queues for ration for another 75 years, sir. If that happens, they will neither forgive you nor me,” he wrote.“Delhi was supposed to start delivering ration to all its beneficiaries at their homes from next week. Under this scheme, the poor would not have to go from pillar to post for ration. Instead, the government would have hygienically packed the ration and delivered it to the ration card holder’s house. All preparations were done. The tender was also done. The scheme was supposed to start from next week and suddenly it was stopped two days ago. People are asking why did you do this?” Kejriwal wrote.On Saturday, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said that Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal “rejected” the scheme citing lack of Centre’s approval and a pending case in the high court. The L-G office, however, said Baijal did not “reject” the scheme and only “advised for the constitutional scheme of things to be followed in letter and spirit”.This was the second time this year that the scheme was stalled due to differences between the Delhi government and the Centre. The scheme was to be launched on March 25, but the Union food and consumers affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 raising two objections to the scheme — the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and that any change in the delivery mechanism in the NFSA requires an amendment that can be done only by Parliament.In his letter to the PM, Kejriwal said despite not being legally bound to do so, the Delhi government sought Centre’s approval for the scheme five times to avoid any dispute but the Union government did not raise any objection.“Delhi food minister Imran Hussain sent letters on February 4, 2019, March 4, 2020, June 17, 2020, November 19, 2020, and December 3, 2020, informing the central government that the Delhi government was going to implement the Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna. No objection was raised on this from your side even once then,” he said.Kejriwal said the Delhi government even dropped “Mukhya Mantri” (chief minister) from the name of the scheme. “Our aim was not to glorify our name. We agreed to your objection and changed the name of the scheme. We agreed to all your objections and made the necessary changes in the policy. Even after all this you are telling us that we did not take your approval? People are asking if pizza, burgers, smartphones and clothes can be home delivered, why can’t ration be delivered at the doorsteps of the poor?”“The central government has also reasoned that the scheme has been rejected because owners of ration shops have moved the court asking for a stay on the home delivery scheme. Did you reject the scheme for this? When the high court refused to give them (ration shop owners) a stay, how can the central government give them a stay? If the central government stands with the ration mafia, then who will stand with the country’s poor, sir?” Kejriwal wrote.The Union food ministry said the Delhi government can distribute ration the way they want, but it should not tinker with the national food security act (NFSA). “They can do so under any other scheme. The government of India will provide additional ration for the same. As per notified rates. Where is the issue? The Delhi government wants to tinker with the nationally administered programme at the cost of Delhi consumers by charging the cost of milling. etc from them. The government of India had only informed them about the rule position,” the ministry said.Kejriwal said if the Delhi government starts a separate scheme, it will lead to creation of two separate ration distribution mechanisms in the national capital -- one by the Centre, other by the state government.“The central government is also saying that the Delhi government can run its own ration scheme separately, without tinkering with the existing national scheme of the Centre. Sir, since when did we become different? Sir, since when did the central government and the Delhi government become different? Since when did your and our scheme become different? Sir, everything is of this country and everything is for its citizens. Now, will there be two schemes on the same issue - one of the central government and another of the Delhi government. You mean the central government will spend ₹2,000 crore to distribute ration in Delhi and the Delhi government will spend another ₹2,000 crore for the same thing? Is this practical, sir?… The responsibility of stopping the theft of ration is yours as much as it is mine,” Kejriwal wrote.Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said the Delhi government should implement the One Nation One Ration Card scheme instead of pushing its own ration plan. “Kejriwal talks of his own CM ration scheme, but he has done nothing to implement the Centre’s One Nation One Ration Card scheme due to which thousands of workers have not got ration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/clear-ration-scheme-in-national-interest-kejriwal-writes-to-pm-101623179885675.html
09-06-2021||Lucknow||Shahjahanpur suicide: Police probing role of loan shark||A day after a couple along with their two minor children allegedly committed suicide at their Shahjahanpur home, police on Tuesday focused its investigation towards involvement of a loan shark for forcing the family towards the extreme step. Four members of a family, including 43-year-old father, 38-year-old mother, their 12-year-old son and six-year-old daughter were found hanging inside their house in Shahajahnpur city area on Monday.Reportedly the man took a loan from private lender on exorbitant rates to start his business. “It has come to the notice that the father had returned double the principal amount to the loan shark, yet there was a huge interest pending. The father was worried because of it and decided to end his life,” said a senior police official privy to the investigation.Police have recovered three suicide notes from different places in the house. “All the suicide notes were copies of each other and mentioned financial troubles. The three copies were placed in different part of the house probably to ensure that they were recovered by the police,” said superintendent of police of Shahjahanpur S Anand. “The things mentioned in the suicide notes are being verified with the help of friends and family members,” he added.Meanwhile, a police complaint has been lodged against a businessman of Shahjahanpur by a relative of the deceased alleging abetment to suicide. “The allegation in the complaint are also being verified and we will lodge an FIR after preliminary investigation,” said the SSP and added that the post mortem report confirmed death by hanging. According to locals, the family-- a native of nearby Bareilly -- had moved to Shahjahanpur over a decade ago. The father was a retailer of medicines. The family had moved to the house, where they were found hanging, in October last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/shahjahanpur-suicide-police-probing-role-of-loan-shark-101623179927316.html

09-06-2021||Lucknow||As markets reopen, traders demand relief from UP govt||With the state government relaxing ‘corona curfew’ in all 75 districts of the state after over a month, various trader bodies are now demanding a relief package from the Uttar Pradesh government, claiming to have lost business worth over ₹90,000 crore in this period. President of Uttar Pradesh Adarsh Vyapar Mandal Sanjay Gupta said, “Today a trader is expected to pay commercial house tax, commercial power tariff, water, solid waste collection. Besides, even a small shop has to dole out taxes despite the pandemic. We want the government to waive off commercial charges and collect normal house tax, normal power bill. This will come as some sort of relief for the debt-ridden traders of the state.”Trader leader of Uttar Pradesh Udyog Vyapar Mandal Amarnath Mishra said, “We have met chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma and other ministers for waiver in power bill, house tax, water tax, besides giving relief in GST and income tax. The chief minister had praised the contribution of traders in the development of the state. The state government has a sympathetic attitude towards the problems of traders.”The state government had imposed partial corona curfew from April 30 after spike in cases in the second wave of pandemic. However in Lucknow, traders had voluntarily started closing markets from April 14 which they claim to have led to losses worth ₹10,000 crore.They are happy that all markets in the state will be opening from Wednesday as the number of active Covid cases have come below 600 in all the districts of state.Speaking on the issue, Sandeep Bansal, president of All India Udyog Vyapar Mandal claimed that traders of the state capital had suffered the most. Most of the traders have taken loans and they have to pay it back so they need some sort of stimulus from the government. The state saraffa market has recorded loss of around ₹40000 crore in state as marriages have been postponed, the cloth and textile business has lost ₹25000 crore, FMCG has lost ₹15000 crore business besides crores of business of construction material, electronics, automobiles, spare parts, beauty products, hospitality etc has been lost, he said.“The state government must come out with a stimulus package for traders like they have done for big industries and street vendors,” Bansal said.More than 40 lakh traders have been paying crores of rupees as GST to the government in the state and now it was the turn of the state government to give them some relief, said Bansal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/as-markets-reopen-traders-demand-relief-from-up-govt-101623179748462.html

09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana’s diversification push: Don’t grow any crop during paddy season and get ₹7,000 per acre||Determined to push farmers towards switching over to alternative crops in place of water guzzler paddy, Haryana government has linked cultivation of more varieties of pulses and cereals with its financial-incentive driven crop diversification drive. Kheti Khaali – Fir Bhi Khushali is another and newly added lucrative feature of this “push and pull” policy under which ₹7,000 per acre incentive will be given to farmers if they do not grow any crop in their fields during the paddy seasons. Yet another contour of the diversification drive this year is that the government will give ₹10,000 as incentive to farmers adopting agroforestry for three years. If a farmer opts for agroforestry and plants 400 trees on his land, he will be eligible for ₹10,000 (instead of ₹7,000) for three years.The second phase of the crop diversification drive of the Bharatiya Janata Party-Jannayak Janta Party coalition government comes ahead of the start of paddy transplantation on about 30 lakh acres from June 15. For the first time, farmers switching over to an alternative crop in place of paddy were paid ₹7,000 per acre incentive under the ‘Mera Pani, Meri Virasat’ policy launched in May last year. At the heart of this policy is the objective to encourage farmers to choose alternative crops and reduce area under paddy as the cultivation of paddy leads to degradation of natural resources, such as water and soil. The ground water table of Haryana has been declining steadily. “Farmers had cultivated crops other than paddy on 96,000 acres last year. We have included more incentives this year in this scheme to encourage farmers,” said Jai Prakash Dalal, agriculture and farmers welfare minister. Target to diversify 2 lakh acre Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP government had claimed on the floor of the House in Vidhan Sabha that farmers diverted from paddy to cotton, maize and pulses on 38,000 hectares last year. The government has now set a target to diversify two lakh acre this year. According to agriculture and farmers welfare minister Dalal, the target this year is to also promote cultivation of pulses in Southern Haryana under the diversification drive. As the southern Haryana belt is considered conducive for growing pulses and cereals, the government has included a number of alternative crops such as groundnut, arhar, guar, soyabeen, etc. “We have set the target to diversify two lakh acre land this year as there is a huge potential for pulses cultivation in Southern Haryana. I am meeting the stakeholders personally to make this drive a success,” said Dalal while pointing out that patience is the key to convince farmers to accept new initiatives. The state has this year been divided into four zones under the crop diversification drive to make farmers aware about its benefits. In each zone, an additional director rank officer will spearhead the drive. If in north zone, focus will be on maize cultivation, in south zone, pulses will be promoted. Sumita Misra, additional chief secretary (agriculture and farmers welfare), said chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has given approval to enlarge the ambit of crop diversification drive this year. “The number of alternative crops included in the policy this year is much more than last year,” said Misra. Learning from last year’s experience, ACS (agriculture) Sumita Misra has set up committees and fixed deadlines for verification of the diversified land so that the ₹7,000 incentive is released on time to the farmers. While ₹2,000 is given after first verification, ₹5,000 is released at the time of harvesting of the alternative crop. The Mera Paani - Meri Virasat scheme will be linked to Meri Fasal - Mera Byora so that farmers get their payment without any delay. Farmers will have to give detailed information of crop being sowed per acre on Meri Fasal-Mera Byora and Mera Paani-Meri Virasat portal after June 25 when this portal will be opened for public. The verification exercise for release of ₹7,000 per acre starts once the farmer updates information about the crops sown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryanas-diversification-push-don-t-grow-any-crop-during-paddy-season-and-get-7-000-per-acre-101623179687876.html

However, farmers tried to gherao the BJP leader on motorcycles.Later, they staged a protest outside the Barnala family’s residence.BKU Ugrahan local leader Jarnail Singh claimed that the BJP leader came there to hold a meeting with the Shiromani Akali Dal-associated family, but they gheraoed Dhillon on the direction of senior farm leaders.“On one hand the Barnala family claims that they support farmers, but on the other, they are holding meeting with BJP leaders ahead of the upcoming state assembly elections. Surjit Kaur Barnala says Dhillon is her relative. If that is the case, why did Dhillon escape from her residence,” said Jarnail Singh.Former Dhuri MLA and son of ex-CM Barnala, Gaganjeet Singh said that Dhillon is his cousin and he came to meet his mother. “I am recovering from Covid-19. Dhillon came to meet my mother who is his aunt to inquire about my health. There was no official meeting. It is Dhillon’s personal decision whether he wants to work with BJP or any another party,” added Gaganjeet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-hold-protest-gherao-bjp-leader-in-barnala-101623179629921.html

The association has sought quashing of the communication, arguing that the letter should have been issued at the starting of the session so that the schools could have applied for the additional section. This now will cause unnecessary financial burden to the private schools where no such prior notice was ever issued for such enhancement, the court was told, adding that the affected schools are those who are charging fee between ₹500 and ₹900. The court has sought response from the government by July 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/admission-beyond-limit-hc-seeks-reply-from-punjab-on-schools-plea-101623179628888.html
09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM moots research facility to combat Covid-like pandemics||Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday mooted a research facility, under the guidance of national and global healthcare experts, for combating Covid-like pandemics and other serious diseases.The chief minister, while chairing a virtual meeting of the state’s healthcare experts’ group for Covid management, extended his government’s continued and unequivocal support to the medical fraternity in battling this unprecedented crisis till Covid-19 is completely eliminated.Urging people not to be their own doctors but to seek the advice of the medical fraternity at the first signs of the infection, the CM said his government was distributing food packets and Fateh Kits to wean the people away from hesitancy in going for treatment.The video conference was joined by more than 250 health experts from Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh, besides four foreign doctors.Amarinder said Punjab will soon win the fight and succeed in pushing the disease back. The state, he said, was gearing up for a possible third wave and, despite the decline in cases, was not letting down its guard. Earlier, Dr Talwar kicked off the meeting by sharing the objective of the session – one of many over the past year. The aim, he said, was to set treatment protocols, guide doctors, and put in place guidelines for management of Covid patients.He said it was important to ensure capacity building and monitor patients through well-laid-out guidelines as very little was known about the disease, adding that experts from AIIMS and PGIMER as well as from US, UK and other countries, had been participating in these sessions. Expressing concern over the high CFR in Punjab, Dr Talwar said the expert group was analysing all deaths to be ready to deal with future crises. He further said that unlike some other states, Punjab had made no attempt to hide or fudge its Covid death figures.In a brief presentation, Group member Dr GD Puri, anaesthesia and intensive care head at PGIMER, Chandigarh, disclosed that as many as 130 classes, seminars, lectures and key discussions had been held so far. From time to time, the Covid management techniques were updated based on experience of doctors from other countries, who were battling with Covid much before India faced the crisis.Dr Anup Singh, a consultant doctor from New York, said his hospital had shared experience of how it dealt with cases when health infrastructure was collapsing. “We limited use of excessive medicines and even steroids that’s why no cases of black fungus and other complications have been witnessed there,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjba-cm-moots-research-facility-to-combat-covid-like-pandemics-101623179627728.html
09-06-2021||Chandigarh||HC asks Faridkot police to look into protection plea by live-in couple||The Punjab and Haryana high court has asked Faridkot senior superintendent of police (SSP) to look into a protection plea from a married woman and a single man.The high court bench of justice Vivek Puri acted on the plea from the woman and her live-in partner, who had sought directions to the SSP for their protection and safety and appropriate action on their representation in this regard.“...the present petition is disposed of with a direction to respondent No. 2, the Faridkot SSP, to look into the grievance of the petitioners as projected in the representation,” the court said adding that this order is not to be construed as any expression to validate their relationship or upon any civil and criminal proceedings.The petitioners had told court that both have attained the age of majority; the woman got married in 2016 and it is still subsisting, but since 2020, she has been living with her partner who is unmarried. They had apprehended threat and danger to their life and liberty at the instance of the woman’s husband and her relatives.This apparently is the first instance in the recent past when a court intervened into the protection plea from a married woman and unmarried live-in partner.Different benches of the high court have given conflicting judgments on live-in relationships while disposing of pleas for protection filed by runaway couples. On May 11, one of the benches observed that the “entire social fabric of the society will get disturbed” if the plea for protection from a live-in couple is accepted, while another bench termed live-in relationships “morally and socially not acceptable” and dismissed the plea. The decision on the second plea was overturned by the Supreme Court on June 4.These judgments were followed by two other benches ruling the opposite. While a bench on May 18 held that a live-in relationship is not prohibited, another bench observed that such relationships may not be acceptable to all, but could not be termed illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-asks-faridkot-police-to-look-into-protection-plea-by-live-in-couple-101623179567744.html

In lieu of it, the government will be directly transferring ₹250 into the bank accounts of over 11.41lakh families for the purchase of mustard oil and salt from June 1.The decision, however, is being criticised by beneficiaries as the retail price of mustard oil has reached an all-time high of ₹180 per litre. Opposition parties too have condemned the decision to cut government expense by ₹90 per family per month. “Though the government will disburse around ₹28.51 crore every month to the bank accounts of beneficiaries, the move will help the government to save around ₹11 crore every month,” said a senior official from the Haryana social justice and welfare department.Nasib Singh, a beneficiary from Kurukshetra, said, “Mustard oil is being sold at ₹175- ₹180 a litre. How will we buy two litre mustard oil and one kg salt with ₹250?”The government, however, maintains that the distribution has been suspended only temporarily. It was stated that Haryana State Co-operative Supply and Marketing Federation Limited (Hafed) could not procure mustard at minimum support price of ₹4,650 per quintal as the prices of oilseed had reached beyond ₹6,000.Though the government has not announced any date for resumption of the distribution scheme, it stated that beneficiaries will be able to get mustard oil from fair price shops once it is available with Hafed.A mandi manager of Hafed said, “The supply of mustard oil may remain suspended for several months till mustard harvesting in March next year. This year, we were not able to procure sunflower seed also as it was being bought by private players above MSP and farmers sold most of their produce to private buyers instead of Hafed. So, now we do not have much stock even for our sale counters.” Hafed managing director Dusmanta Kumar Behera did not respond to phone calls or text messages about the possibility of resuming mustard oil supply under PDS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-govt-will-save-around-rs-11-crore-a-month-by-stopping-mustard-oil-supply-under-pds-101623179447740.html

Anil Deshmukh after advocate Jaishri Patil sought to be added as a party to the proceedings. She sought to be added as a party respondent on the grounds that the HC’s April 5 order – directing CBI to probe into Singh’s allegations – and the subsequent FIR registered by the Central agency was based on her complaint. She also accused the state of trying to sideline her by not adding her as a party. However, when senior counsel Rafique Dada for the state opposed her request, the division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar told Patil that she should follow proper procedure and it would hear her only if she was added as a party. This infuriated Patil and she informed the bench that she had lodged a complaint against the judges with the HC chief justice and the Chief Justice of India for “insulting and humiliating” her during a previous hearing. Justice Shinde then clarified that his comments were part of a dialogue which happens between the bench and the advocates and the comments were not intended to humiliate or insult her, however, if she was offended, he would like to express regret for the same. Thereafter, solicitor general Tushar Mehta for CBI and special counsel and former additional solicitor general Darius Khambatta appreciated the magnanimity of the bench and requested Patil to withdraw her complaint, which she agreed. The court then said that it would hear Patil’s application, which she had already filed, with or after the petitions of the state and Deshmukh. Mehta assured the court that CBI would not insist on the state government to furnish documents pertaining to offences mentioned in the FIR, which includes the minutes of the police establishment board meeting of June 2020 that had ordered the reinstatement of suspended police officer Sachin Vaze and the documents regarding the allegations made by former commissioner of intelligence Rashmi Shukla, wherein she had complained to her superiors of political interference in postings and transfers of police personnel in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbi-probe-against-ex-maha-minister-jaishri-patil-seeks-to-be-added-as-party-101623179147266.html
09-06-2021||Chandigarh||AAP seeks probe into purchase of ‘Fateh Kits’||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Punjab affairs co-incharge Raghav Chadha on Tuesday wrote a letter to Lokpal, Punjab, demanding an immediate and prompt investigation in the alleged scam by the state government in purchase of ‘Fateh Kits” for Covid-19 patients. In his letter, Chadha alleged that the Congress government purportedly embezzled crores of rupees in the purchase of ‘Fateh kits’ used for the treatment of Covid patients. The alleged massive scam was nefariously executed in the procedure of inviting, acquiring and executing the bids for Covid-19 medical consumables and essential medical equipment kit as numerous overpriced bids were accepted by the government leading to humungous losses to the state exchequer, he alleged. “Under this scam, the price of the medical kits which was supplied to the people during the Covid pandemic was consistently raised in a well thought out manner by repeatedly inviting one tender after another despite the fact the first tender was valid for a period of 180 days,” reads the letter. Chadha claimed that the first tender was awarded at ₹837 per kit, but after ordering only few thousand kits from the vendor at a higher price of ₹940, a new tender was floated and pursuantly allotted the tender to another vendor at ₹1,226 per kit. The vendor did not even legitimately fulfil the criterion of having a medical license but was still chosen to deliver the kits to the government, he said. The AAP leader said the government procured 50,000 “Fateh Kits” as per the price of ₹1,226.40 through the second tender and then another order of 1, 50,000 kits at ₹1,338.40 per kit was placed to the same vendor. The government was evading its accountability, he said, demanding a thorough investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-seeks-probe-into-purchase-of-fateh-kits-101623179089049.html

He sided with the Janata Dal (United) when the Janata Dal split in 1999 but later joined the BJP.Udasi was a close aide of Yediyurappa and the former had left the BJP to join the newly formed Karnataka Janata Party (KJP) in 2012 along with the latter. He, however, lost the 2013 polls.“Saddened to learn about the demise of former Karnataka minister & senior BJP leader C.M.Udasi Ji. His service towards the people of the state is noteworthy. His soft spoken and ever smiling personality will always be remembered. My heartfelt condolences to his family. Om Shanti,” JP Nadda, the national president of the BJP said in a post on Twitter.Udasi then followed Yediyurappa back into the BJP’s fold in 2013 and won in 2018.

09-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra tourism corp hands over 466 acres of mangroves in Gorai-Manori to forest dept||About 466.72 acres of mangrove land, formerly owned by the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) in Gorai and Manori creeks, has now been transferred to the state forest department’s mangrove cell and declared as a reserve forest under Section 20 of the Indian Forest Act (IFA), 1927. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray had met MTDC officials in last September, directing them to expedite the handover. “All claims over the land have now been settled, after initial notification under Section 4 of IFA. The land includes about 460.85 acres in Manori creek and 5.87 acres in Gorai creek. The transfer happened on May 24 under the supervision of the tehsildar,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell). The move is in line with the Bombay high court’s directive to the government, which instructs the latter to hand over all mangrove areas on state land to the forest department for better conservation. Declaring areas as reserved forests grants them legal sanctity and protects biodiversity by outlawing activities such as foraging, hunting and harvesting of natural resources in the earmarked boundaries. As per official estimates, there are 17,090 hectares (ha) of mangrove forests in on government land in the state. Of these, at least 10,632ha have already been brought under the purview of IFA in 2019, 2020 and 2021. A total of 2,066ha of mangroves have been excluded from the purview due to community dependence on the land, officials clarified, while the remaining are under process for declaration. Previously, 916ha of mangroves in Borivli taluka of Mumbai (suburban) district were declared a reserve forest under Section 20, IFA, via a gazette notification on March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mtdc-hands-over-466-acres-of-mangroves-in-gorai-manori-to-forest-department-101623179028342.html

Banks have been instructed not to adjust this pandemic relief support to other loans availed by street vendors earlier,” Yediyurappa said in a post on Twitter.The street vendors were identified through a survey conducted by urban local bodies, according to a statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO). The disbursement of the earlier announced financial package comes at a time when several sections of activists, trade unions and aggrieved people have raised their concerns over the lack of relief provided by the government to compensate for the lack of livelihood.The Congress party, the principal political opposition in the state had lashed out at the Yediyurappa-led government for inadequate relief and demanded that at least ₹10,000 be deposited directly to the bank accounts of all vulnerable people. The chief minister announced two financial packages, totalling to around ₹1750 crores, since the onset of the second wave of infections in March. However, the number of beneficiaries and quantum of relief has come down since the first wave of infections last year, which amounted to around ₹2100 crore.Senior government officials, earlier, told Hindustan Times that the lower number of beneficiaries was because the government could not trace several of them last time.For instance, the government announced relief for 210k auto and cab drivers as against 775k last time, which union workers said was a gross miscalculation of the actual number of people working in these sectors.Several people who spoke to Hindustan Times said that they were yet to receive any financial assistance so far.“A financial assistance of ₹2000 was announced under the special package which was announced on 19-5-2021 for street vendors in the state whose livelihoods have been hit hard because of the lockdown imposed due to Covid-19 second wave. Accordingly, out of 216,439 beneficiaries, ₹38.33 crore have been transferred to 191,684 beneficiaries, whose Aadhar card has been linked to their bank accounts through direct benefit transfer,” according to the CMO statement.Yediyurappa added that banks are directed not to adjust the amount released under the subsidy to any loans availed by the street vendors.“Covid-19 second wave has affected us badly. In these difficult times, a relief package of more than ₹1700 crore has been announced for labourers , farmers, teachers, Asha Workers, priests and others belonging to different sectors who have been hit by the pandemic,” the statement read.The CMO said that cash assistance for construction workers has been disbursed through direct bank transfer. “Action will be taken to disburse the amount to beneficiaries of other sectors under the relief package soon,” the CM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ktaka-grants-2-000-subsidy-to-registered-street-vendors-101623179027788.html

09-06-2021||Mumbai||Travel bookings improve across India||As Covid cases across the country continue to decrease, Indians have started making travel plans. Tourists had stopped travelling for around two months amid the second wave of the pandemic. According to RateGain, a SaaS player (a web application managed by a travel technology provider) bookings are growing at a healthy 20% rate, week on week. Moreover, according to RateGain, around 50% increase in week on week bookings have been seen, in the last fortnight driven majorly by Delhi NCR region. RateGain said thatwhile leisure demand would take some time to come back, demand in Delhi, Mumbai went up as businesses, construction activities and manufacturing picked up again. “In Tier-2 cities, Lucknow saw the sharpest increase which can only be attributed to increased political activity in the city due to the upcoming election in 2022. Shimla and Goa both have started witnessing slight improvement with tourists from Delhi and Mumbai looking to go for staycations as normal life resumes back slowly”, said Kamesh Shukla, EVP and Head for APMEA-RateGain. MakeMyTrip said they have seen a steady increase in searches and bookings for air travel in the past week. “This indicates that more people are planning and booking travel again. Over the past two months, last-minute travel for medical or emergency purposes continued and now as the severity of the crisis reduces in the coming weeks, people will take to travel to meet family or friends, and for business purposes,” said Saujanya Shrivastava, chief operating officer, flights- strategic business units, MakeMyTrip. Cleartrip also said there are very initial signs of recovery with reduced caseloads and relaxation of restrictions by several states. “Traffic and booking volumes have almost doubled from a couple of weeks ago. Share of round trips and advance bookings has also seen an uptick. Both these metrics have been good lead indicators of consumer confidence in the past 12 months or so,” said Rajiv Subramanian, vice president, Cleartrip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/travel-bookings-improve-across-india-101623178969063.html
09-06-2021||Mumbai||HC strikes down Navneet Kaur-Rana’s caste certificate||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday set aside the November 2017 decision of the Mumbai suburban district caste scrutiny committee, validating caste claim of Navneet Kaur-Rana, an independent Member of Parliament from Amravati, that she belonged to Mochi community, a Scheduled Caste. The HC also cancelled the certificate issued by then deputy collector of Mumbai in August 2013 to Kaur-Rana and directed her to pay litigation cost of ₹2 lakh to Maharashtra Legal Services Authority within two weeks. The HC also declared that all consequences of cancellation of the validity and confiscation of the caste certificate will follow, meaning Kaur-Rana, who got elected in 2019 general elections as an independent MP, may lose the seat as it was reserved for a scheduled caste candidate.A division bench of justice R D Dhanuka and justice V G Bisht pronounced the judgment on Tuesday on a petition filed by Shiv Sena leader and former MP from Amravati, Anandrao Adsul. The court also considered the allegations that the committee had failed to verify the authenticity of the documents submitted by Kaur-Rana to prove that she belonged to a Scheduled Caste.Senior advocate CM Korde appearing for Adsul had submitted that Kaur-Rana had started taking steps to create forged and fabricated documents in 2013 with the help of her father as she intended to contest the parliamentary election in 2014 from Amravati.Senior counsel Prasad Dhakephalkar for Kaur-Rana had opposed the allegations and the petition.While pulling up the committee, the bench said, “We are of the firm view that Scrutiny Committee did its job rather sloppily and shirked the obligations imposed on it by the provisions of the Act…”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-strikes-down-navneet-kaur-rana-s-caste-certificate-101623178907124.html
09-06-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan cabinet shuffle likely in July to pacify disgruntled leaders||A much-awaited cabinet reshuffle in Rajasthan is likely to take place next month as the Congress leadership has begun the exercise amid rising dissent in the state unit, a senior party leader familiar with the development said on Tuesday.At present, Rajasthan has 21 ministers, including the chief minister. The state with 200 assembly constituencies can appoint a maximum of 30 ministers. On Tuesday, Hindustan Times reported that last year’s crisis in the state that the Congress papered over by setting up a committee to address the issues raised by then deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot against chief minister Ashok Gehlot have resurfaced with the former expressing his displeasure at the lack of action.Pilot told Hindustan Times that the Congress high command had failed to deliver on the promises that were made to him when he along with 18 legislators returned to the party after a month-long drama.A senior leader familiar with the development said the leadership has initiated the process of reshuffling and efforts are being made to pacify the disgruntled faction by inducting some new faces.The leader added that while the issue could be resolved in a day or two, demanding appointments on the basis of faction wasn’t justified and was also a cause of concern for the party.What the party high command suggested was appointing and proposing names on the basis of merit after discussions, the leader said. “All efforts are at present focused on building consensus among the state leaders,” he said.Everyone in the Congress, the leader said, understood that any further delay would lead to more damage to the party and demoralise workers and MLAs, be it via political appointment or cabinet reshuffle.“The party after the political crisis last year had included names from the Pilot faction in the state executive. Similarly, three to four ministers as suggested by him (Pilot) would be finding space in the cabinet. It is expected that after Rahul Gandhi’s appointment as the party chief, the cabinet expansion would be done in July,” the leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-cabinet-shuffle-likely-in-july-to-pacify-disgruntled-leaders-101623178783291.html
09-06-2021||Mumbai||PM Modi-Uddhav Thackeray meeting raises eyebrows in Maharashtra||Eyebrows were raised in Maharashtra’s political circles as Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a one-on-one meeting with Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at the former’s official residence in Delhi on Tuesday. The meeting took place after a Thackeray-led delegation met Modi over Maratha reservation and various other issues.Thackeray, along with his deputy Ajit Pawar and public works department minister Ashok Chavan, met Modi in Delhi on Tuesday over a number of issues, including Maratha and other backward classes (OBC) reservation, goods and services tax (GST) compensation, among others.After the meeting, Modi had a separate meeting with Thackeray. Though Thackeray admitted to having held an in-person meeting with the PM, he did not divulge any details about it. According to a senior Shiv Sena leader, the meeting lasted for half-an-hour, in which Thackeray spoke about political issues. He also sought Modi’s intervention to resolve the issue of nomination of 12 members to the Legislative Council, which Governor BS Koshyari has not cleared for eight months.“Yes, we had a separate meeting. We may not be politically together, but that does not mean that we have snapped our relationship. I did not go to meet Nawaz Sharif. There is nothing wrong in meeting Modiji in person. Tomorrow, even tell my colleagues and go to meet him,” Thackeray said.“The appointment of 12 members from ruling parties to the Council or amicable solution in the car shed land parcel are political battles between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the ruling parties in Maharashtra. Both these issues can be resolved immediately if the Centre wants to. It may be recalled that the solution on the nomination of Thackeray to the Council was drawn immediately after he spoke to Modi last year. This time, too, Thackeray’s diplomacy may work in his favour,” said the Sena leader, seeking anonymity.Another party leader said the CM would have discussed the issue of the action by central agencies against leaders from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi.“Central agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and enforcement directorate have been investigating cases against former home minister Anil Deshmukh and Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik. There is a buzz of similar inquiry against Sena leader and minister Anil Parab. The CM may have had a word on it with the PM. Thackeray’s meeting with Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar on Monday had significance in the backdrop of the PM-CM meeting,” said the leader.He also added that CM may have expressed his displeasure over the way the state unit of the BJP targets the MVA government.Leader of opposition in legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis said that one-on-one meeting between the PM and the CM was not unprecedented. “I had been the chief minister of Maharashtra and would have a separate meeting with the PM whenever we went as a delegation to meet him. I am not aware of any such meeting, but I wish it would work in favour of the state.”Fadnavis, however, slammed the state government for raising issues with the PM, saying the state needed to act first.This was Thackeray’s second visit to Delhi after becoming the chief minister. He, along with son and state minister Aaditya Thackeray, had paid a visit to Modi and other key leaders across party lines in February last year.Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “By meeting PM separately, the CM has tried to keep a check on his ruling partners and the Opposition leaders too. Thackeray shares good relations with Modi and seldom attacks him personally. By meeting him in person, he has sent out a message to BJP leaders in the state too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pmcm-meet-raises-eyebrows-in-maha-101623178848277.html
09-06-2021||Mumbai||BJP core panel plans for elections||The core committee of the Maharashtra Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday discussed various issues in state politics and chalked out a strategy to take them forward ahead of the ensuing local body elections. The meeting was attended by party’s general secretary and state-in-charge CT Ravi, organisational secretary BL Santosh and core committee members, including leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and state unit chief Chandrakant Patil, among others. The leaders discussed forthcoming local body elections including polls to five municipal corporations and strategy to win maximum of them. The strategy was also discussed to corner the state government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on reservation to Marathas and other backward classes, handling of Covid 19 pandemic etc. “The reservation to Marathas and political reservation to OBCs was struck down due to the inefficient handling by the state government. We will stand by these communities in their fight for the reservation. We want to stand by the general public during the challenging times of the pandemic to extend them a helping hand. We will raise these issues in the forthcoming monsoon session of the state legislature. The state unit will design a programme based on the strategy chalked out today,” said party leader Ashish Shelar.Elated after the victory in Pandharpur bypoll last month, the party has decided to concentrate on the local body elections. “The party fared well in the gram panchayat polls last year and won Assembly bypolls last month. The central leadership had expressed its unhappiness over our performance in Council polls early last year. We have been asked to fight the forthcoming elections with full strength and win maximum of them,” said a core committee member, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-core-panel-plans-for-elections-101623178847729.html
09-06-2021||Bangalore||Govt plans CET score for science admissions||Bengaluru The Karnataka government on Tuesday said that it is deliberating if the Common Entrance Test (CET) should be a base for admission into all science courses and not just for professional streams like engineering and medicine.“It has been in consideration about making marks obtained in CET as the common basis for all science based courses including B.Sc.(bachelor of science) and registration process for the CET-2021 will begin on June 15,” Dr CN Ashwath Narayan deputy chief minister of Karnataka said.The statement comes at a time when the Karnataka government has cancelled exams for second year pre-university college (PUC) students on account of the Covid-19 pandemic that continues to remain a potent threat in the state.The state government, however, has decided to hold two papers, which will include all six subjects, for Class 10 students in order to help them decide their stream of choice for further studies.Narayan, who is also the minister for higher education, said that the minimum eligibility marks which was set as a criterion for writing CET has been relaxed for the current academic year and the department of higher education is mulling to consider CET marks as the common base for admission into all science-based courses for the academic year 2021-2022.“Minimum eligibility marks of 45%(40% for SC/ST/OBC) to secure in PCM (physics/chemistry/mathematics) subjects in 2nd PUC examination which was considered as a criterion all these years to write CET will not be applicable for this year. For professional courses including agricultural science, pharmacy, veterinary, engineering, medical courses current academic year and only CET ranking will be taken into account,” he said.The cancellation of exams has added to the prevailing confusion of grading of children without conducting proper evaluation. According to the primary and secondary education department minister, S Suresh Kumar, the grades obtained by the student in their first year PUC will be used to grade them for their second year PUC.Narayan said that the suggestion given by Kumar to use CET ranking as a parameter for admission into professional courses has been considered.With competitive cut off percentages in all leading colleges, it remains to be seen how the admission process will be taken forward by these institutions.“Ranks for admission to engineering courses will be awarded on the basis of the marks obtained in PCM subjects of the CET examination only. The earlier method of considering the PCM marks obtained in the annual exams and CET in equal proportions will not be applicable for this year, he pointed out.“This year the number of students who pass out may increase by 30% and this would result in about 2,00,000 more students seeking admission for degree courses. Accordingly, measures will be taken to accommodate these increased numbers of students in government and private colleges,” Narayana added.“CET-2020 will be held on August 28, 29, and 30th as scheduled earlier; CET for maths & biology will be held on 28 & physics & chemistry on 29th of August and each paper will carry for 60 marks,” he added. The language test for students from other states and border regions will be held on August 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/govt-plans-cet-score-for-science-admissions-101623178847094.html
09-06-2021||Mumbai||Allocate one-fourth of mucormycosis drugs to Maharashtra: HC to Centre||The Bombay high court (HC) has suggested that the Central government should allocate one-fourth of the Amphotericin B injections available with it, from time to time to Maharashtra, given the spike in the number of active black fungus cases. The suggestion was made after the court was informed that though the in-house manufacturing at Haffkine Institute in Mumbai would yield about 40,000 vials by June 10, the injection was insufficient to treat 6,200 active cases. The state held that as each patient required four-five injections per day for a period of three-four weeks, the court should direct the Centre to meet its demands for allocation of more injections, in light of a higher number of cases in Maharashtra compared to other states. The bench also sought details of the state-wise distribution of injections from Centre. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation filed by advocate Sneha Marjadi and others, was informed by the state through advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that situation concerning procurement and distribution of oxygen and Remdesivir was taken care of, and the focus of the state was now on combatting mucormycosis. He said that while in the previous hearing it had submitted data of around 4,000 active cases, the same had gone up to beyond 6,000, hence the state was trying to procure more Amphotericin B injections. Advocates Rajesh Inamdar and Atharva Dandekar for the petitioners informed the bench that there was an alarming rise in the number of cases and sufficient steps needed to be taken to inform the masses of the precautionary measures and treatment just like it was done for treating Covid-19. Additional solicitor-general Anil Singh informed the bench that while the centre was cognizant of the situation in Maharashtra it was trying to allocate injections as per the state-wise requirement. He added that the Centre would have around 2.7 lakh vials to distribute as it had allowed private manufacturers to start producing the injection. He said that the states with maximum cases were being allocated the larger chunk of the injections available with it. The bench suggested that as the number of cases was increasing in Maharashtra, the Centre should allocate one-fourth of the injections available with it from time to time. Bench also directed the state to create awareness of the precautionary measures, treatment regime and hospitals among masses and posted a hearing of the PIL on Thursday, June 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/allocate-one-fourth-of-mucormycosis-drugs-to-maharashtra-hc-to-centre-101623178787733.html
09-06-2021||Bangalore||Under 5% of Karnataka’s homeless inoculated, reveals govt data||Even though declared a vulnerable section of the society who require vaccine on priority, the Karnataka government doesn’t have a plan to vaccinate the homeless in Bengaluru city. As per the government data, less than 5% of the city’s homeless, the majority of whom are above the age of 60 years have been vaccinated.SG Raveendra, special commissioner (welfare), Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), said that at present the vaccines are being provided only to those homeless persons lodged at the nine homeless shelters across the city.“At present, we have 218 homeless persons at our centres, out of which 137 have received the first dose of the vaccine and 10 have received the second. We are in process of getting everyone at our centres vaccinated soon,” said Raveendra.In a letter dated May 13, 2021, the government had said that homeless persons are one of the vulnerable sections of the society and hence, should be provided vaccine on priority. However, Narasimhappa TV, a member of the Supreme Court-appointed Independent Impartial Committee (IIC) on urban homeless, said that the number of people at homeless centres is only a fraction of the total homeless persons in the city.“As per a survey conducted in 2019, there are around 4,200 homeless persons in the city. Even this number is not precise. This was the result of a headcount conducted in the main areas of the city. If a thorough survey is conducted, then the numbers could be more than 10,000,” he said.Talking about the vaccination drives, Narasimhappa said that the lack of identity cards also becomes a problem for the homeless in the city. “At present, the city doesn’t have enough shelters to take care of the homeless in the city. In such a case, someone who is not in the shelter has to go to a vaccination centre to get the dose. Most of all don’t have any identity cards. So, if the government is going to focus only on those who are in the shelters, a large number of homeless will not get the vaccination,” Narasimhappa added.Over the past year, 24 persons staying in these shelters have tested positive for Covid-19 and two have succumbed to the virus, as per the BBMP figures. That raises concerns over several more infections and deaths among homeless persons.Asked about the plan for vaccinating the homeless as the government order to give them vaccination of priority, Raveendra said that there any homeless person can avail vaccination at the centre. “At the same time, we are working with NGOs to identify the vulnerable groups and to get them vaccinated. We will ensure that those identified will be brought to the shelters, where they will be vaccinated,” said Raveendra.An NGO based in Bengaluru, working with the homeless people, said that no reach out has taken place in Bengaluru as claimed by the BBMP. “We are working with several groups providing them food. From nomadic families, waste pickers, daily wage workers and employees of small eateries there are several homeless persons in the city whom we help. From our interaction, there has been no effort by the authorities to approach them for vaccination,” said the NGO worker, who didn’t want to be named.“What is concerning is that the central government has issued a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), which asks the state to create a district task force to identify such persons. But no one has done this so far,” the NGO worker said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/under-5-of-karnataka-s-homeless-inoculated-reveals-govt-data-101623178787146.html

09-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 situation is improving with every week, but danger not over||Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded 10,891 Covid-19 infections, pushing the count to 5,852,891. The tally of active cases further dipped to 167,927 as 16,577 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours.The state saw 295 casualties, taking the toll to 101,172. Kolhapur reported the highest toll with 32 deaths. The district recorded 28 deaths, while the city reported four fatalities. It was followed by Ratnagiri and Satara with 27 and 26 casualties respectively. Mumbai reported 682 cases, taking its tally to 712,055. It also recorded seven fatalities, taking the toll to 15,006.The Covid-19 situation in Maharashtra is improving. For the past five days, it is reporting fewer than 15,000 cases and the average daily cases of the past week (June 1-7) have also dropped to 13,586. In the previous week (May 25 to 31), it was recorded at 20,696 cases. whereas the average daily cases of May was 36,820, according to figures released by the state health department. In the past eight days, it has reported 105,999 cases and 2,340 casualties.However, experts are of the view that the danger is yet to pass as the lockdown restrictions have been relaxed and people are not following Covid-appropriate protocol. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, state advisor on Covid-19 and former director-general of health services, said if the existing decline in daily infections is not maintained till the end of this month, then the state will be in trouble“To be in a safe zone, we have to either vaccinate 60% to 70% of the total population and if that is not possible, then the entire population should wear masks and follow Covid-appropriate protocol diligently. In our case both are not happening. Since the past two days, people are behaving as though the coronavirus has died and they are crowding in public places,” Dr Salunkhe said.“The state government has given relaxations as the number of daily cases is going down, but this has to be maintained till June-end. If not, then we are in trouble. This is because if Pune, for example, is reporting 700 to 800 cases a day then it means daily 7,000 to 8,000 new people are getting infected there as it is believed that one patient infects around ten people. We need to be very careful,” he added.Experts have already predicted the possibility of a third wave that is likely to hit the state by July or August. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has also directed the local administrations to be prepared for a possible third wave, considering the shortage of oxygen and medical facilities.From June 7, the state government has imposed a fiv- level unlock plan and districts and cities are given relaxations based on the positivity rate and oxygen-bed occupancy. Those areas coming under level one are free of all restrictions. In the past 24 hours, the state had tested 211,042 samples and had a positivity rate of 5.16%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 15.86%, according to data issued by the state health department on Tuesday||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-covid-19-situation-is-improving-with-every-week-but-danger-not-over-101623178667687.html
09-06-2021||Mumbai||Near-to-door vaccination is good, consider door-to-door as well: HC to Centre||The Central government on Tuesday informed the Bombay high court (HC) that the National Expert Group for Vaccine Administration of Covid-19 (NEGVAC) had unanimously opined that “near-to-door” vaccination was an appropriate solution for the elderly and specially-abled persons than door-to-door. However, after the petitioner pointed out that the expert group had failed to address the issue of bed-ridden persons, HC asked the Centre to consider door-to-door vaccination as well. The Central government on Tuesday informed HC that till May 28 in all 25,309 adverse events following immunization (AEFI) were reported, of which 1,186 were serious and severe, and 475 post-vaccination deaths were reported across country. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing public interest litigation (PIL) filed by city-based lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, seeking directions to the Centre, the state and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to provide door-to-door vaccination to those aged over 75, the specially-abled and bed-ridden.During the course of the hearing on PIL, the bench was informed by additional solicitor general Anil Singh, that the NEGVAC had convened a meeting of experts at Delhi following the court directions on May 20. The affidavit filed through Satyendra Singh, under-secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) stated, “NEGVAC agreed that since the specially-abled and bed-ridden elderly persons have limited mobility due to their physical conditions, there is a need to increase access by bringing vaccination services closer maintaining all necessary precautions.” Singh submitted that all members in May 25 meeting unanimously agreed that vaccines cannot be given at home due to the risks cited by the expert committee, which include addressing AEFI in an effective manner and maintaining protocol of observation of every beneficiary for 30 minutes after vaccination, maintaining the cold chain and ensuring low vaccine wastage. The affidavit stated near to home vaccination centres strategy for the elderly and specially-abled was flexible, people-centric and followed a community-based approach and sessions can be conducted at facilities near home, such as schools, old age homes, Resident Welfare Association (RWA) office, sub-health centres, panchayat ghar etc. On her part, Kapadia pointed out that some civic authorities and societies had undertaken door-to-door vaccination and there were no adverse effects reports. She also pointed to the data provided by the Centre wherein out of the 20 crore Indians vaccinated there were only 1,186 serious cases and 475 deaths which showed that the apprehensions of NEGVAC were over-cautious. Thereafter, the court asked the Centre that while it appreciated the near-to-door policy suggested by NEGVAC and in light of the affidavit, why it could not consider taking a step further and visit homes of beneficiaries who are unable to visit vaccination centres. Court then posted the hearing of PIL to Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/neartodoor-vaccination-is-good-consider-door-to-door-as-well-hc-to-centre-101623178667142.html
09-06-2021||Mumbai||State govt may scrap tendering process to get vaccine doses||With the supply of vaccine doses back with the Centre, the Maharashtra government is set to stop its plan to buy vaccines from manufacturers for the 18 to 45 age group. The state will also scrap the tendering process to get vaccine doses from manufacturers which had not materialised. On Monday, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi announced that the Union government is again centralising the vaccine procurement and the Centre will supply free vaccines for the 18-45 age category. Senior officials informally said that the announcement by PM Modi has taken the load off of the government.“The [tendering] process was not moving forward as the bidders weren’t able to provide any connection between them and the [vaccine] manufacturers. It will be formally scrapped after a discussion with the health minister and senior bureaucrats,” said official requesting anonymity. The matter could be discussed in the state cabinet meeting scheduled to be held on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the state is awaiting the revised guidelines from the Centre. “Though the announcement has happened, so far we have not got the guidelines. We expect it in a few days. Till then our vaccination drive will go on as it is,” said DN Patil, state immunisation officer. Maharashtra could go past another landmark by surpassing the 25 million mark on Wednesday. So far, the state has administered 24,725,242 doses. About five months into the vaccination programme, nearly 22% of the state’s 91,435,000 eligible population has been covered with the first dose, while 5.30% have taken two doses. As per the data on the Co-Win portal, Maharashtra has administered 19,792,475 first doses till 8pm on June 8. “We have been at the top in the country for a long time. In a day or two, we will go past 2.5 crore (25 million) doses of which nearly two crore (20 million) are first doses. The pace is good and we want to cover maximum population in the first dose,” said Patil.Even though the Maharashtra government has suspended the inoculation of the 18-45 age category since May 13, the inoculation in the category has seen nearly a three-fold jump. On May 13, the number of doses administered in the category was 634,570, which reached 1,804,173 on June 7, as per the state health department’s data. Health department officials said that the drive for the category was going on at the private hospitals and through the drives taken up by corporates, which tied up with private hospitals to give shots to their employees. As of June 7, 51,459 beneficiaries in the 18-45 age category are fully vaccinated. Patil said that around 3.15% of the eligible population in the 18-45 age bracket have been administered doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-govt-may-scrap-tendering-process-to-get-vaccine-doses-101623178607122.html

Citizens can call on 8657402090/ 02226594176 to lodge their complaints.“The primary role of the control room will be to take up monsoon-related complaints, follow them up, coordinate and interact with the state government, civic corporation and other disaster control agencies. The objective of this control room is to avoid any inconvenience to pedestrians and motorists due to the several ongoing projects of MMRDA. The officials will keep a watch on unusual threats and the dangers that lie ahead,” stated a press release by MMRDA.“The Mumbai Monorail will be monitored separately from its 24x7 central control room (OCC) at Wadala depot,” it added.MMRDA officials says that some of the most vital jobs would be to ensure that barricades are proper and do not hinder motorists, the damaged roads are repaired, and dirt is removed from the streets. SVR Srinivas, MMRDA commissioner, in order to prevent waterlogging, has directed contractors to install water pumps where there is no connectivity at drains and reservoirs.BMC being ruled by Shiv Sena for decades always saw MMRDA as a rival, as it is a department of the state, which was ruled by the Congress-NCP for many years. As the three parties have now come together, this is an attempt to build coordination between the two agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mmrda-starts-24x7-control-room-to-look-at-rain-related-complaints-in-mumbai-101623178547129.html
09-06-2021||Mumbai||No plans for water cut in Mumbai, says BMC||With monsoon around the corner, the seven lakes that supply drinking water to the city have water stock that can last for around 50 days, and with forecast for sufficient rain, there are no plans for water cuts, according to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). According to the data, the water level in the seven lakes supplying drinking water to the city is 12.84%, which is 185,864 million litres, of the total capacity of 1,447,363 million litres. The level was 14.25% in 2020 and 8.30% in 2019. Vihar Lake and Tulsi Lake that are located inside Mumbai are 38.75% and 35.34% full, respectively. Vihar was 24.66% full last year at this time, while Tulsi lake was 32.53% full. Further, Bhatsa, which supplies 55% of the total annual water requirement, is at 12.40%, compared to 14.08% last year.In case of Upper Vaitarna, the water level is 0%, as of Tuesday, same as last year. Modak Sagar has 31.87% water compared to 38.81% last year. In case of Tansa lake, the water level is 12.27% compared to 13.33% last year, 12.60% in Middle Vaitarna dam compared to 13.65% last year. The city had experienced 20% water cut in August 2020 amid the Covid outbreak owing to low level of water in the lakes. Last year, BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal had also prepared a backup plan to bring water to Mumbai from Bhandardara dam in Ahmednagar, if required. A BMC official from the hydraulics department said, “The forecast of rainfall for this year is good, and it looks like there might be no need for any water cut. However, we are monitoring the situation. A decision will be taken in the next one month depending on the rainfall and water stock.” The seven lakes are bifurcated into two systems – the Vaitarna system that supplies to the western suburbs and the island city, and the Bhatsa system supplies to the eastern suburbs. The lakes are situated in Mumbai as well as neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. The civic body supplies 3,850 million litres of water daily against the city’s demand for 4,200 million litres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-plans-for-water-cut-in-mumbai-saysbmc-101623178307025.html

The bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy passed this order in response to the petitioners –workers of Renault Nissan in Oragadam – who had approached the court against the employer not complying with Covid-19 protocols, particularly social distancing in the assembly line. The court directed senior representatives of the Directorate of Industrial Safety to make further visits to the Renault-Nissan manufacturing facility as well as other automobile manufacturing units in the vicinity so that uniform guidelines can be imposed everywhere. “...and if a departure from the uniform is necessary, indicate the special reasons, therefore,” the court said. “It must also be borne in mind that the conditions prevailing in a certain manufacturing the facility may not be identical to those prevailing in another manufacturing facility and oranges and apples may not be dealt with merely by the numbers.” In the previous hearing, the court had ordered a government official to inspect the facility on June 1 and if required, to help the workers and manufacturers reach a consensus. The state government has exempted these industries from the ongoing lockdown as they are ‘continuous process industries’ that have export commitments. The workmen submitted on Tuesday that in a lockdown situation, where only essential production is permitted, it is unreasonable for the management to continue production at the same rate by citing export orders. The management contended that it cannot be singled out for following certain norms because its workmen desire, so a submission was made for uniform guidelines for all assembly line production of passenger vehicles. “Pursuant to the initial disagreement between the petitioning workmen and the management at the Renault-Nissan manufacturing facility in Oragadam, production is now going on upon a tentative modus operandi on a trial basis being put in place under the aegis of a senior official of the Directorate of Industrial Safety,” the court said in its orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/need-uniform-protocol-for-auto-units-operating-amid-curbs-madras-hc-101623178247064.html

Chahal undertook a high-level meeting with ward officials, along with officials from other agencies. The civic chief directed that manholes in all 24 wards are checked and closely monitored to prevent any untoward incidents, especially in areas where there is heavy waterlogging.Apart from senior Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, authorities from BEST, Mumbai Police, Central and Western Railways, Mhada, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), and Mumbai Metro were also present.Further, the BMC on Tuesday also said that it removed around 324,000 tonnes of silt from the city’s drains, adding that it has completed desilting works in the city before the monsoon. The BMC had planned to remove around 311,00 tonnes of silt, but it ended up removing 324,000 tonnes.According to BMC officials, of the total silt removed, 43,766 tonnes was removed from the island city and remaining was removed from the eastern suburbs and western suburbs. It took 11,004 truck trips to transport all this silt from the drains to sites outside the city.In a statement, the BMC said, “The BMC chief has ordered to immediately remove the silt from outside drains after cleaning and has asked to move it to the designated places. In all, the above 24 wards, teams of tackle water logging are deployed. Also, dewatering pumps have been installed in all the areas where water is being drained at low speeds and adequate stock of diesel are being ensured from time to time to run the pumps. Mock drills have also been conducted in all the wards on the use of these pumps.The statement further added that hospitals should not be affected due to heavy rain in the city. It noted, “Last monsoon, Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central and JJ Hospital in Byculla were flooded. It was observed that some water was stagnant in these two important and big hospitals. In view of this, the municipal commissioner also directed to ensure that the drainage system at both these hospitals is functioning properly.”The BMC has also directed Metro authorities to ensure that there is no waterlogging wherever there are barricades installed for Metro works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/heavy-rain-bmc-chief-directs-officials-to-take-all-precautions-101623177827864.html

According to police officials, an interaction session was organized at the shelter home in Sector 12/22. “During the session, apart from her parents’ name, the girl told us her village’s name as Salarpur which falls under Sector 39 police jurisdiction. Her information was shared immediately with the authorities but no output came. When we asked for more information, she said that her brother studied in Dadri. We then used Google Maps to find another Salarpur in the Jarcha area,” said Devendra, inspector at the anti-human trafficking unit (AHTU) of the Noida police.The officials then reached out to the village pradhan who confirmed that the girl had gone missing the previous week. No missing person report was registered at Jarcha police station, police said, adding that the girl’s maternal uncle confirmed her disappearance and told officials that she had left home following a fight and eventually got lost. The officials said that the girl was handed over to the family after getting clearance from the child welfare committee. This is the second such incident to occur in a week. On June 2, a 16-year-old specially-abled boy, who was staying in the same shelter for nearly three months, got back to his family in the Sambhal district. “The boy had said that he was from a village in Aligarh district. When we tried verifying the village location, it turned out to be in the Sambhal district. The boy’s photo was sent to the village head and the family came to Noida on June 2 to take him back,” said a police spokesperson.The shelter home in Sector 12/22 has about 60 children, police said.The officials said that the AHTU team organises frequent interaction sessions at shelter homes and helps such children reunite with their families. “Sometimes missing children come directly to police and sometimes they reach shelter homes. Our AHTU team is trying to counsel many such children and help trace their families,” said Vrinda Shukla, deputy commissioner of police (women and child safety), who also heads the AHTU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-cops-help-missing-girl-reunite-with-family-101623177649627.html

No one had been arrested till the filing of this report.The unit allegedly ran from a rented space in a factory. Police said they were questioning the landlord to trace the suspects.According to police, they acted on a tip on unlicensed production of medicines from the area.“A similar case was busted in Maharashtra last week, based on that another racket was busted in Meerut on June 6 and following that, the raid was conducted today,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Ankur Aggarwal, adding that police partnered with the drugs department and administration in the raid.Police said they found sacks of substances marked antibacterial and antivirals, along with packaging material and machines. “We also obtained empty packets labelled Fabiflu (a drug used to treat Covid-19). Some of the packets carried a ‘Made in Solan, Himachal Pradesh’ tag and ‘For sale in government hospitals only’ warnings,” said the officer.Police estimate the haul could have cost ₹50 lakh. “The unit in Greater Noida is an extension of a much more extensive racket,” said a police official. “When we questioned workers at other nearby units, they said that there had been no production here in the last few days. Most probably the helpers had gone underground when the operations in other cities were busted.”The substances found at the unit were sent for forensic examination. Based on the complaint of the drug inspectors, a case will be registered at the Ecotech 3 police station soon under relevant sections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/illegal-medicine-manufacturing-unit-busted-in-greater-noida-101623177588280.html

RK Singh, newly appointed district magistrate of Ghaziabad, on Tuesday formed nine teams headed by senior administrative officers from different departments. He said that the teams were formed so that different works related to tackle the Covid-19 situation are streamlined. “Each team is headed by a senior officer. The teams have also been given an option to rope in more officers or specialists who may help them discharge assigned works. This will also ensure that there is no shortage of staff. The review of works will be taken up on a daily basis,” Singh said. The officials said that the teams comprise at least 77 officers from different departments, like police, municipal corporation, UP Jal Nigam, local bodies, and health department.One of the teams headed by chief development officer has 11 officers and the team is tasked to make availability of ICU and oxygen beds, ensuring adequate manpower in hospitals and streamlining of vaccination process, among others, the officials said.Another team headed by the additional district magistrate (finance) is tasked to ensure ambulance services; ensure availability of life-saving drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab, besides ensuring proper home quarantine to patients and making availability of free medical kits to patients. Similarly, a team headed by additional district magistrate (executive) is tasked to set up coordination with the state administration on different aspects, besides ensuring inter-departmental coordination. “The idea is to ensure that all Covid-19 related works go on smoothly. This will ensure that overall work is streamlined, and we will be able to tackle any likely wave of Covid-19,” the DM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/nine-teams-formed-to-handle-covid-19-situation-in-ghaziabad-101623177586992.html

The Noida traffic department hopes to fine tune its response after the lull.“We have had online meetings with office bearers of residents welfare associations (RWAs) and apartment owners’ associations (AOAs). Traffic sub-inspectors have been instructed to ]interact with them too and understand specific issues. Every locality has its specific problem, and we would like to work on them out as soon as possible,” said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Ganesh Saha.Citizens felt that unorganised gathering of local vendors and unauthorised parking are also major concerns.“Traffic violations by public are a serious issue. But we also need traffic personnel to manage traffic during weekly markets. In addition, the routes and number of passengers in auto and e-rickshaws also needs to be monitored. Illegally parked buses and vehicles also create nuisance for the sectors,” said Sanjeev Kumar, president, sector 51 RWA.Traffic officials said that despite the unlock Covid protocols such as regulating the number of passengers in autos, e-rickshaws and private cars remained and that the traffic department will creating awareness about them among the public.“However, multiple violations of Covid protocols will result in challans,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-traffic-dept-invites-suggestions-from-public-as-city-unlocks-101623177528356.html
09-06-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Trans-Hindon residents battle pandemic without govt hospital||The decade-old demand for a government hospital in the trans-Hindon region of Ghaziabad continues to be stuck in limbo with the district health department wanting land free of cost, but the land-owning agency offered a plot for ₹140 crore.The trans-Hindon areas comprise of localities like Indirapuram, Kaushambi, Vaishali, Vasundhara, Prahlad Garhi, Jhandapur and Sahibabad, among others. During the ongoing pandemic, and particularly the receding second wave that hit in April, residents had no option but the more expensive private facilities.The two nearest government hospitals, MMG district hospital and Sanjay Nagar combined district hospital, are located almost 10 - 12 kms from Vasundhara.“We have demanding a government hospital for the past 10-12 years. Apart from high-rises and plotted development areas, the trans-Hindon also has a large population of people from lower income group who cannot afford private treatment,” said U B Garg, president of ‘Vasundhara Vikas Samiti’ that is spearheading the issue.As per the official records, localities like Indirapuram (1,397 cases), Sahibabad (1,237) Vaishali (746) and Vasundhara (782) suffered in May.“The situation was scary. We families running from pillar to post, day and night, in order to get oxygen and beds. Had it not been timely effort by the Gurudwara in Indirapuram (that offered free oxygen), casualty count would have been more,” said Mohan Sangwan, general secretary of Confederation of trans-Hindon RWAs. “A multi-specialty and super specialty hospital with 200 could have been useful.”“The land at Vasundhara has been earmarked for a hospital. If it is not available free-of-cost, does it mean that hospital will not be constructed?” asked Garg.That seems to be the stand of the Ghaziabad health department and UP Avas Vikas Parishad.Where the proposal is stuckLast October, the health department was offered two plots in Vasundhara- 5,000 square metre (sqm) in Sector 3 as residential quarters for the staff of the proposed hospital, and 7,500 sqm in Sector 6 for the main building with 100 beds. “The estimated land cost given to us was about ₹140-150 crore, but headquarters rejected last year,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.While the UP Avas Vikas refused to officially comment on the matter, a senior official, on the condition of anonymity, said they did not have the power to offer land free-of-cost.“Both plots are reserved for a hospital. We have done our part and now the decision rests with the health department,” said the officer.Government officials familiar with the development said that only the UP cabinet had the power to direct allotting land free-of-cost for a hospital in Ghaziabad.Sahibabad MLA Sunil Sharma said that he had taken up the matter with the government.“UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath knows about it. Even the land for his dream project of Kailash Mansarowar Bhawan in Indirapuram was given by the Ghaziabad development authority at a price. The pandemic has hit the people badly and so too the government coffers. Once the situation improves, a decision is likely to be taken up,” said Sharma.The district has about 500 beds available in different government facilities and is likely to increase to 580 with upcoming hospitals in Loni and Bamheta.“However, there will still be shortage of about 300 beds considering the 4.5-5 million population of the district,” said an officer from the district health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-trans-hindon-residents-battle-pandemic-without-govt-hospital-101623177527747.html
09-06-2021||Noida||Post-Covid complications: MIS-C cases reported among children in Noida and Ghaziabad||Noida/Ghaziabad: Amid a decline in Covid-19 cases in Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad, post-Covid complications are coming to the fore. Nearly 70 cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been reported at various hospitals in both the districts in the past three weeks. Experts said that all the MIS-C patients, who are usually in the age group of six months to 15 years, have had a history of Covid-19 infection in their families. The MIS-C is a condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs, the experts said, adding that most common symptoms are respiratory and abdominal issues.Dr Rakesh Gupta, director of the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), said that two cases of MIS-C have been reported at the hospital so far. “Two children aged six and seven years were admitted at GIMS with a moderate case of MIS-C last week. Both were discharged after a week of treatment. They both had a history of Covid-19 infection and had been positive a month back,” he said.At Fortis Hosital Noida, there have been 15 mild to moderate cases of MIS-C in the age group of six months to 13 years in the past three weeks. Dr Ashutosh Sinha, head of department of paediatrics at the hospital, said that an antibody test is carried out to confirm Covid history in such children.“It is not necessary that the child got Covid and then developed MIS-C. In majority of the cases, children were asymptomatic of Covid and have tested negative in RT-PCR test as well. However, since their parents or someone in family had the infection, the children developed antibodies against Covid and tested positive for the same in IgG antibody test,” Sinha said.At Felix Hospital in Noida, two such cases have been reported in the past two weeks where one child was two years old and another seven years old. “Parents need to be very alert and suspicious of early signs of this disease among their children, especially if they have a history of Covid infection in their house. If it is not diagnosed at the earliest, it can prove dangerous as well,” said Dr Rashmi Gupta, child and neonatology specialist at the hospital.Gupta said that doctors can use medicines such as intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids and other anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce the inflammation in such patients.If the cases are identified early on, doctors are able to discharge the patients within four to six days, said Dr Ramalingam Kalyan, director and HoD (paediatrics), Max Hospital’s Vaishali and Noida branches.“We are getting at least one case a day for the past three days. About 25-30% of such cases are being managed in the out-patient department. The mild stage of MIS-C is called ‘febrile inflammatory state’, in moderate state, the syndrome presents features of Kawasaki disease and at the highest level, toxic shock syndrome is reported,” said Dr Kalyan.He also said that it is important to vaccinate the parents in order to avoid such complications in kids. “MIS-C is reported 4-6 weeks after the onset of Covid symptoms in the parents. Hence, the after effects of a possible third wave among adults will be borne by children since they may not get infected directly, but may develop post-covid complications. Therefore, it is vital that apart from following all Covid protocols, parents are vaccinated,” said Dr Kalyan.At Yashoda Hospital, Nehru Nagar in Ghaziabad, there have been 19 cases of MIS-C, with the youngest one being a five-day-old baby. “The mother of the baby had contracted Covid-19 in her seventh month. When the child was born, it started vomiting and had fever. After an antibody test, the baby was diagnosed with MIS-C,” said Dr Sachin Dubey, primary paediatrician at the hospital.At the Yashoda Hospital in Kaushambi too, about 20 cases of MIS-C were reported in the past two weeks. “70% of the cases reported at the hospital had inflammation of cardiac region that resulted in coronary abnormalities. Other cases were of subacute intestinal obstruction where the child had abdominal problems like diarrhoea, vomiting or loss of appetite,” said Dr Vidya Ghosh, head of paediatric intensive care unit at the hospital.Dr Sumit Gupta, paediatrician at Columbia Asia Hospital, Ghaziabad, said that in the past two weeks, seven cases between 2 years and 13 years of age have been reported at the hospital. “Paediatricians in Ghaziabad are seeing a rise in cases of MIS-C in the last one month. The common symptoms include cold, fever, gastroenteritic issues like vomiting, diarrhoea, pain in the abdomen, or rashes. Younger children below six years of age are having more abdominal symptoms while in older ones fever is the main symptom,” he said.When asked, GB Nagar chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that the district health department is not keeping a record of MIS-C cases. “Most of such patients reported in the district have recovered. Moreover, a very small number of MIS-C cases have been reported in the district so far,” he said. Ghaziabad CMO Dr NK Gupta couldn’t be reached for a comment despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/postcovid-complications-mis-c-cases-reported-among-children-in-noida-and-ghaziabad-101623177348145.html

The incident affected the hospital’s out-patient services.Police identified the dead man as auto-rickshaw driver Aman Sharma who suffered a blow to the head in the accident in Sahibabad and was referred to the hospital early morning. “After nearly 20-25 minutes of treatment, the man died. His injuries were severe. As soon as the doctors declared him dead, people who had come along with him went on a rampage and vandalised the hospital and also beat up staff. A ward boy and a nurse were injred,” said Dr Anurag Bhargava, chief medical superintendent of the hospital. “The incident was also captured on the CCTV system. We have given a police complaint.”After the attack, the hospital staff abstained work and demanded the immediate arrest of the suspects and invoking section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against them. Dr Bhargava said that the out-patient services was held up for one hour until the police were able to assuage the staff. Police registered an FIR under IPC sections 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and section 427 (causing damages) along with section 34 (common intention). “We added IPC section 307 to the investigation and also levied provisions of Uttar Pradesh Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (​Prevention of Violence And Damage to Property) Act, 2013. Two persons were also arrested and more will be identified soon,” said Nipun Agarwal, superintendent of police (city 1). Police identified the suspects as Mohammad Adil, resident of Pasonda in Sahibabad, and Rahul Kumar, resident of Vaishali sector-1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/staff-assaulted-after-25-year-old-succumbs-at-mmg-hospital-in-ghaziabad-101623177347589.html

09-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Dusty winds push air quality into poor zone, rain likely from June 12||After experiencing a long spell of good air days, courtesy the Covid-19 lockdown, the effects of two cyclones and numerous western disturbances, Delhi’s air quality slipped into the ”poor” category on air quality index (AQI) on Tuesday with dust carrying south-westerly winds sweeping across the city at speeds ranging from 30-40 kmph.India Meteorological Department (IMD) said such dry and dusty conditions are likely to continue on Wednesday and Thursday as well. But some relief is likely from June 12, when a fresh western disturbance is expected to trigger rain in the city.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the overall air quality in Delhi on the AQI scale was 205 or ”poor”, a step-up from Monday’s AQI of 180 or “moderate”. On a scale of 0 to 500, a reading between 100-200 is considered moderate, while that between 200 and 300 is considered poor.A senior IMD official said dry and dusty conditions are expected to prevail over the entire north-west India till June 10. “Winds carrying dust from the Thar Desert are blowing over Delhi, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh. Through satellite images, we can see a layer of dust hanging low over the region. Similar conditions are expected till June 10, which means that pollution levels, especially the levels of PM10 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 micrometres), are likely to deteriorate further in the next two days,” the official said, asking not to be named.As dusty winds continued to impact Delhi’s air quality throughout Tuesday, the average reading of PM10 was 244.2ug/m3 at 4pm, as compared to 160ug/m3 on Monday evening. Localised recordings from Delhi localities also showed that the predominant pollutant in most areas was PM10.CPCB’s hourly average recordings show that around 7pm, the pollution levels at two monitoring stations -- Chandni Chowk and ITO -- had already touched the “very poor” zone (a reading between 300 and 400 on AQI scale), with the PM10 readings breaching the 300ug/m3 mark, as against the national permissible limit of 100ug/m3.Delhi experienced a long spell of good air, thanks to the Covid-19 lockdown, the impact of two major cyclonic storms and the higher than normal western disturbances. CPCB data shows that before Tuesday, Delhi witnessed ”poor” air quality on May 23, when the average AQI had dipped to 237.IMD forecast also said after a spell of dry and dusty weather, Delhi is likely to receive another bout of rain from June 12 under the impact of a western disturbance. “On June 12, we might receive light rain in isolated pockets, but on June 13 most parts of the city are expected to get rain,” the IMD forecasters said.Delhi on Tuesday recorded a maximum temperature of 41.7 degrees Celsius at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official marker for the city. The minimum temperature was 28.6 degrees Celsius.“We have a forecast of the temperatures rising further tomorrow (Wednesday) and reaching around 42 degrees Celsius. But after June 12, the temperature will start dropping and we are expecting it to go below 40 degrees Celsius,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.Despite the high-temperature forecast, Met officials said Delhi is unlikely to record a heatwave this season. In the plains, heatwave days are recorded when two things happen – when the maximum temperature crosses 40 degrees Celsius, and when the day temperature exceeds the region’s normal maximum temperature by 4.5 degrees Celsius. A severe heatwave is declared when there is a departure of 6.5 degrees Celsius or above from normal temperatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-dusty-winds-push-air-quality-into-poor-zone-rain-likely-from-june-12-101623175426812.html
09-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt goes extra mile in Covid-19 vaccination drive||Groups of booth level officers (BLO) and their teams comprising civil defence volunteers spread across Burari locality in north Delhi on Tuesday afternoon. As they navigated the narrow lanes, visiting shops and knocking on doors of residents, they engaged with a large number of people aged above 45 years who are yet to be take their Covid-19 vaccine.“I have recently recovered from Covid-19. I do not have to take the vaccine for at least three months now,” said Aman Tyagi, a property dealer, as the group of officers approached him at his office in the locality. While Tyagi had a legitimate reason, his neighbour Brij Tripathi showed some hesitance without citing a proper reason.During the conversation, Tripathi opened up. He told the officers that he had heard somewhere that the vaccines have led to a large number of cases of glaucoma. The officials convinced him that it was a myth and booked a vaccine slot for him in the nearest government school – where people in the locality cast their votes during elections – for Thursday.These teams are part of a government initiative – Jahan vote, wahan vaccination – aimed at increasing vaccine coverage against Covid-19 among the 45+ age group in four weeks. It was launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday.According to government records, Delhi has around 5.7 million people who are aged above 45, of which around 2.56 million have taken one dose of Covid-19 vaccines and more than 860,000 have taken a second dose.On Tuesday, several Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs joined the initiative and accompanied door-to-door drives in their respective assembly constituencies.“I appeal to representatives of RWAs, youth groups, women’s groups, market associations, NGOs and religious organisations to do their bit in encouraging citizens aged 45+ to get vaccinated at local polling booths in their assembly constituency,” said Delhi’s food minister Imran Hussain, who was one of the AAP MLAs who joined the drive in his constituency, Ballimaran, on Tuesday.AAP MLA from Kalkaji, Atishi said, “In the 45+ group, Delhi’s vaccine coverage touched 50% with a sharp rise in the graph which eventually plateaued. During the drive today, we have come across a lot of cases in which people aged 45+ have not taken the vaccines because they have recently had Covid-19. But then there were people too who were hesitant. We are sure that setting up vaccine centres closer to their residences will help increase turnout and more vaccine coverage in the coming days.”Kejriwal said on Monday that the Delhi government has activated all its 13,000 booth level officers (BLOs) for this drive. Delhi has around 280 wards. Under the initiative, 70 wards will be chosen every week. On Monday, the government started with wards located in assembly segments that include Kalkaji, Ballimaran, Timarpur and Burari. Under the initiative, temporary vaccine centres are to be set up in polling booths of localities chosen every week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-goes-extra-mile-in-vaccination-drive-101623175367413.html
09-06-2021||Gurugram||Illegal arms suppliers held, 20 guns and 50 cartridges recovered||The police on Sunday night arrested two men on charges of smuggling and selling illegally made weapons to criminals in Delhi-NCR, and recovered at least 20 illegal pistols, 11 magazines and 50 live cartridges from their possession.The police said that the demand for illegal weapons is on the rise and since January, they have recovered more than 300 illegal weapons and arrested at least 50 persons in connections with crimes. The police said the guns are manufactured in Uttar Pradesh, and over 200 pistols and magazines were set to be sold in Gurugram.The suspects were identified as Kuldeep alias chief minister (27) and Mukesh Kumar (24) of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that these suspects have been associated with gangs supplying illegal weapons for the last four years. “They have attended a training camp, where they are taught how to carry illegal weapons, and the process of dealing and supplying to other criminals. They are part of a 20-member gang that buys illegal weapons from Uttar Pradesh and sells them in Haryana, Delhi-NCR, Rajasthan, and Punjab. They motivate unemployed people to join them and later train them,” he said.According to the police, the suspects revealed during questioning that they used to run training camps for people who wanted to engage in crimes. “Apart from weapons training, they also taught people on ways to conduct robberies, how to cover their faces and identify victims, directing them only to target pedestrians to avoid being caught,” said Sangwan.The police said the gang members bought illegal firearms for ₹5,000- ₹20,000 and sold them for nearly ₹50,000.Narender Chauhan, the in-charge of the Sector 17 crime investigation unit, said that they were tipped off about the movement of the suspects and arrested them from Sohna. “This was their first visit to Gurugram. They have supplied illegal weapons in Delhi, Punjab and Rajasthan. We are yet to identify the receiver. We are questioning them and have taken their call detail records,” he said.According to the police, this is one of the largest consignment of illegal weapons recovered in Gurugram. Also, the arrested persons were close associates of a manufacturer based in Uttar Pradesh.Sangwan said the smugglers used various social media platforms to establish a wide network of contacts in Delhi-NCR, Rajasthan and Haryana. These suppliers target gangsters who are lodged in jails and their aides, who are struggling to run operations without weapons, the police said.Sangwan said that they are conducting a detailed investigation to unravel the entire weapons manufacturing, smuggling and supply chain, as well as identify the physical and financial flows associated with the recovered weapons.A case under sections 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act was registered against the duo at Sohna police station and raids are planned at more than 10 locations to arrest more suspects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/illegal-arms-suppliers-held-20-guns-and-50-cartridges-recovered-101623172306957.html
09-06-2021||Pune||Supply-demand gap leads to shortage of mucor injection in Pune||PUNE A shortage of the Amphotericin (Ampho) B injection, required to treat Mucormycosis, has continued in Pune district. As of June 7, there are 586 “black fungus” patients undergoing treatment in Pune district. There were 538 patients under treatment on June 1. Health officials said that the shortage of Ampho B is because supply is still lower than demand. On the other hand, as the number of Covid cases have reduced, the demand for Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, has drastically dropped. Ampho B is distributed to hospitals in the district through the office of a civil surgeon. Whereas other medicines such as Posaconazole tablets, injections, and liquids required to treat Mucormycosis are distributed by the control room at the Collector’s office. Civil surgeon Dr Ashok Nandapurkar said that the supply of Ampho B is still not in proportion to demand. “The supply of Amphotericin B is not adequate as per the number of cases. There are currently 586 cases of black fungus in the district. The number of patients undergoing treatment keeps fluctuating because of discharges and deaths. Pune gets patients from outside the district as well,” said Dr Nandapurkar. Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune, said that there is no shortage of Posaconazole tablets, and also the demand for Remdesivir has reduced. “The distribution of Ampho B is done from the office of the civil surgeon in Pune. Other injections and tablets are distributed by the FDA. The demand for Remdesivir has been reduced now to 300 injections per day,” said Pratapawar.On June 7, 86 strips of Posaconazole tablets, 50 vials of Posaconazole injections, and five bottles of Posaconazole liquid were distributed to private hospitals in the district. Dr Varsha Doiphode, additional civil surgeon in Pune, said that the Ampho B is supplied to hospitals as stock becomes available. “On Monday, we distributed Ampho B to 10 hospitals. The fresh stock was not received until Tuesday afternoon. Available stock is distributed to government and private hospitals,” said Dr Doiphode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shortage-of-key-injection-to-treat-black-fungus-because-supply-not-meeting-demand-health-officials-101623170386015.html

The police tracked down the girls through their cellphone numbers to a house in Birsanagar late Sunday night. The girls told the police that Thapar and the other men used to sexually harass them while Tirkey used to beat them up. They were students at a girls’ school who were sent to the home after the school closed during the lockdown.Thapar and his wife called the charges motivated and said they were ready for a fair probe. Tirkey also submitted a memorandum to the police on Monday evening.There was already a pending complaint against Thapar, his wife and a few others, filed by a woman who alleged that her husband, a panchayat ward member, was falsely implicated in a case of sexual harassment of a minor girl by Thapar and his wife and sent to jail. In her complaint to the Jamshedpur senior superintendent of police, the woman also alleged that Thapar and his associates were demanding ₹15 lakh to settle the matter.Thapar’s shelter home made news for the wrong reasons on Monday too when a video showing girl inmates working in garbage dumps and other menial tasks went viral, forcing the district administration to take notice. A four-member team of the district labour department led by labour superintendent Avinash Thakur spoke with the children regarding this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/childrens-home-director-4-others-booked-for-sexual-harassment-of-two-minor-inmates-101623166545416.html

It was locked from outside. There is a pathway inside which leads to the mosque, the gates of which were found open. The explosion has caused extensive damage to the seminary building,” Gupta told news agency PTI.A preliminary probe suggested the presence of gunpowder or explosives at the site of the explosion, said Shresthan Kumar, assistant director of the Forensic Sciences Laboratory at Bhagalpur.The madrasa, which had close to 200 students, was shut on May 5 due to the Covid-induced lockdown. The deceased, identified as Mohammad Abdul Sattar Mobin, was from Jharkhand‘s Madhupur district and resided at the seminary as a caretaker.Not a single person, including the imam of the mosque could be traced when a police party reached the spot, added Gupta.Mobin’s body was recovered just outside Navtolia locality. Preliminary investigations revealed that the injured imam died on the way to the hospital, following which his aides abandoned the body in the car and fled, said police.The explosion was so powerful that people staying one kilometre away could hear the sound, said Bibi Rukhsana, who lives in the neighbourhood.Deputy inspector general (Bhagalpur range) Sujeet Kumar said a team of forensic experts and a dog squad are examining the site of explosion to ascertain the cause of the blast. Officials familiar with the developments in the Bihar Police headquarters said the investigating officers will also probe a terror angle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/imam-killed-in-blast-at-bihar-mosque-101623166426155.html
09-06-2021||Pune||Pirangut industrial estate with over 200 firms has no fire station||Pune: The major fire incident at SVS Aqua Technologies that claimed 17 lives on Monday has exposed the severe lack of fire safety measures in the industrial zone of Pirangut-Ghoatawade, around 40 kilometres from Pune. The Pirangut area that houses over 200 small and medium industrial units with at least 10 of them engaged in producing chemicals does not have a fire station. Locals said that fire tenders had to be called in from other stations and it delayed the dousing exercise. They claimed that the blaze in the chemical manufacturing firm could be controlled only after two hours. The victims, including 15 women, were charred to death . “There is no allocated space right now (for the fire station) and we have demanded it from the district collector. There was a provision for a fire station in the DP (development plan), but we have to demanded it from the district on an urgent basis. We have identified one location, but it was taking time. After yesterday’s incident, everybody wants a fire station so we will ask for that land,” said Suhas Diwase, chief executive officer, Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), under whose jurisdiction the area comes. PMRDA depends on three fire stations with latest one being Wagholi, and two others at Marunji and Nanded City. The nearest PMRDA fire station to the Pirangut-located SVS Aqua Technologies is the Life Republic fire station in Marunji. However, geographically, the nearest fire station is one at Hinjewadi Phase 3 under Pimpri-Chinchwad fire department. Six fire brigade vehicles helped in the rescue operation, including units sourced from Hinjewadi Phase 3, Wagholi, Marunji, and MIDC. Around 50 officials were involved in the four-hour operation to douse the fire. “The fire started around 3:30pm and the fire brigade arrived around 4:15pm. I managed to run out of the company, but my wife could not,” said Baban Margale (34), who lost his wife Mangal Margale (29) in the blaze. The committee report pointed out various shortcomings in the company’s operation, including lack of NOC from the fire department and fire safety measures at the production unit. Pirangut industrial zone has many small and medium size industrial units. Though the Pirangut Industry Association could not give an exact number, but the association’s general secretary Raman Govitrikar said that the Pirangut-Ghotawade Phata industrial zone has 10-15 chemical units among 200-250 small and medium sized industrial units. “A fire on a large scale had broken out at Vulkan Tech in March 2020, but no casualty was reported.

09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Drugs case: Axed Patti SHO gets interim bail, asked to join investigation||The Punjab and Haryana high court has granted interim bail to a former Punjab Police inspector absconding in a drug case for the last two months.The court has asked Baljit Singh, former station house officer (SHO) of Patti Sadar police station, to join investigation being conducted by deputy superintendent of police (DSP-narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances) Sukhdeep Singh. Baljit, along with assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Davinder Singh, who was posted in Amritsar judicial complex, allegedly released Malkit Singh, alias Palta, and his brother-in-law Bau Singh on March 31. They alleged drug peddlers were arrested from the Tarn Taran city police station jurisdiction with 1kg of heroin. Baljit was dismissed from the service after he went underground. Davinder was also placed under suspension and a departmental probe was ordered against him. Earlier, a local court had dismissed the bail applications of both the cops.A case under Sections 21-29-59-61-85 of the NDPS Act, 7 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, (amended as 2018), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered against the inspector, ASI, smugglers and one Jasbir Singh on April 13 at the city police station.The case was registered on the complaint of ASI Jatinder Singh of city police station. He said Baljit and Davinder had released Malkit and Bau after taking ₹3.5 lakh bribe. Jasbir played a middleman in striking the deal between the accused and the cops, it was alleged. According to Tarn Taran police, the seized contraband is with the former inspector.Baljit approached the court through counsel pleading “this kind of vague allegations can be levelled against anyone”. His lawyer told the court that the petitioner, who has an unblemished service record, has been falsely implicated.“The petitioner shall join the investigation and would be present as and when called for and in the event of arrest. He shall be admitted to interim bail on his furnishing personal and surety bonds to the satisfaction of investigating officer,” noted justice Manoj Bajaj, while issuing notice of motion to Tarn Taran police for September 22. Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale confirmed the bail order and said the former cop has not joined the investigation yet. “We have adequate evidence against Baljit. ASI Davinder Singh has already confessed to the crime. We have yet to recover 1kg heroin that was seized from the drug peddlers,” said a senior police official, who didn’t wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drugs-case-axed-sho-gets-interim-bail-asked-to-join-investigation-101623158084432.html
09-06-2021||Chandigarh||Discontent brewing in Kangra’s tea gardens||The Covid-19 pandemic and erratic rainfall have hit the Kangra tea industry for the second consecutive year. Once in demand in Europe, Central Asia, Australia and Afghanistan, Kangra tea is already facing a crisis due to the shrinking area under cultivation, high input cost and tough market competition. According to the economic survey, the total area under tea in 2019-20 was 2,314.71 hectares with a production of 1,002 tonnes. The number of tea growers has come down from 5,000 to 1,100 since 2010, while the area under cultivation has declined from 4,000 hectares in the early ’80s to 2,300 hectares today. Nearly 1,000 small tea growers of Kangra and Mandi have reported losses. In 2020, even though the produce was good, the tea growers suffered losses due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19. This year, the erratic weather had a major impact, while the state imposed a lockdown to deal with the second wave of the pandemic. Erratic rain ruins 70% of first flush pluck Gokul Butail, the spokesperson for the Kangra Tea Planters’ Association, said” “Erratic rainfall pattern and hailstorm destroyed the first flush of Kangra tea. A first flush is the first round of leaf buds coming out of the tea bush in the harvest season. First flush, plucked in April, teas are often the best, as the year’s first harvest— rich in aroma, quality, flavour and value. Each additional flush produces a different flavour and aroma as the growing season for that tea plant progress season. “At least 70% of the first flush crop tea produce, which fetches the highest price (around ₹600- ₹700 per kg) in the market was destroyed this year,” said Butail. Temperatures were comparatively higher in winter, while rainfall, which is must for plant growth, was low. In summer, when it should be warmer, hailstorm and untimely rainfall ruined the yield. “The estimated first flush production in Kangra would be around 200 tonnes but the production this year was only 60 tonnes,” he said. Delayed transportation, labour shortage The tea industry was further hit by problems in transportation due to the lockdown amid rising Covid cases in April. Though the government had given relaxation to the agriculture sector, but fear of the virus caused problems in getting transport. “This led to delay in the tea reaching the market. There was a lockdown in Kolkata and the wholesale tea market, which impacted the auction,” said Butail. If there is delay in auction, the tea loses its moisture content, aroma and flavour, fetching a low price. Another tea grower, Sachin Butail, said the retail market has also been hit hard due to the Covid-19 lockdown. “People are afraid of going anywhere and there has been negligible tourist footfall. The tea industry is also facing labour shortage which has slowed down the plucking that continues till October,” he said. Sachin said most of the labour engaged in tea plucking comes from Jharkhand. “They left for home last year and not even half of them have returned,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/discontent-brewing-in-kangra-s-tea-gardens-101623153407145.html
09-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi lost over 300 trees in three weeks. Experts explain what needs to be done||The spell of rain and squalls triggered by cyclonic storm Tauktae and multiple episodes of western disturbance over the last month made the Delhi summer less harsh this year. But the good weather extracted its price.Since May 19, when Delhi witnessed the season’s first big storm, data from the three municipal corporations shows that at least 215 trees fell in the capital. Additionally, according to the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) that looks after the British-era avenue trees, another 95 were uprooted in the last two squalls alone.Officials and experts HT spoke to pointed at a range of factors, from the rampaging winds to poor canopy management and weakened roots that brought down so many trees.Ashish Priyadarshi, director, horticulture at North Delhi Municipal Corporation blamed the unusually strong winds. “The fallen trees couldn’t withstand the cyclonic wind, which had higher intensity and was circular in motion. Also, because of higher buildings and existing roadside trees, there was also this tunnelling effect in the streets, which increased the speed of the wind,” he said.Also Read | How Centre will vaccinate all 940 million adults against Covid by DecemberOthers were unanimous that a large number of trees in Delhi have been decaying from concretisation, disease and termite attacks, even as they underlined the urgency to save the surviving ones, which remain the city’s best health insurance against atmospheric and noise pollution, water-logging, groundwater depletion, and heat islanding.Specialised care To ensure better survival of trees in Delhi, experts emphasised engaging services of specialists in urban tree management.“The forest department will do forestry, the horticulture will look after parks. For urban trees, we need good managers who are trained arboriculturists,” said CR Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems at Delhi University.Agreed Suhas Borker of Green Circle of Delhi, a voluntary group that has been collaborating with NDMC in restoring uprooted trees. There is so much injury inflicted on trees because agencies in charge lack the knowledge of tree architecture and tree conservation, he added.S Chellaiah, director (horticulture) at NDMC, underlined the importance of a focussed approach. “All agencies that manage trees are multi-tasking. If we have trained arboriculturists for tree care management, they can take charge of the tree’s health — from pruning canopies to treating disease and decay,” he explained.Canopy management A large number of trees that got uprooted this season were lacking in balance. Their stability was compromised by a combination of the heavy canopy and shallow, narrow root base.“This happens when trees are not pruned regularly. The weight of the canopy increases disproportionately to the size of the root zone, which is anyway shallow due to heavy concretisation around the base. Such trees lack balance and get uprooted easily,” explained Babu.Pruning is an important part of canopy management and needs to be done scientifically. Maintained regularly, trees can grow in a sustainable manner. “But we often see lopping of large branches, which happens because trees are not pruned for years on end,” said Babu.Root anchorage A large number of urban trees are encased in cement or buried under construction waste, which starves them of water, air and essential nutrients. In 2013, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) made it mandatory to leave one-metre space around the trunk of a tree unpaved, but violations are rampant in Delhi.For structural stability and cushioning, tree roots do not just need to go deep, they also need to spread horizontally. “But when we have an asphalted road with layers of tar running deep into the ground on one side and shops and buildings on the other, and pavements that have been fully concretised, the roots have nowhere to go,” said Babu.The result is altered root patterns. “The deeper roots don’t get water and dry out. The shallow roots survive but are not strong enough to provide anchorage. Rain and strong winds just uproot them,” explained Chelliah.Also Read | Industries cannot operate without prior environment clearance, says NGTRoots are also damaged by frequent digging of pavements by various agencies providing utilities. Also, wheel traffic and overflowing wastewater have a compacting effect on the topsoil that prevents nutrients and water from reaching the roots.“Recently, we put back six Neem trees that had fallen in Lodhi Garden. They seem to be doing fine. We have also restored a mango tree near Pandara Road but we are not sure of its survival since its roots were not breathing because of concretisation,” said Borker.Diseased trunks Termites make root systems and stems hollow, making trees topple easily.The problem is particularly acute among the older trees in Lutyens’ Delhi, said Chellaiah. The majority of the trees that have fallen in the last few years in the NDMC areas are Neem, susceptible to both termite and Ganoderma fungal intrusions, and the growth of gall or tumour-like growth caused by insects laying eggs are also weakening a lot of trees in Delhi.“Many silver oak trees in Nehru Park have also been infested with the Ganoderma fungus. If it is in the advanced stages of infestation, it is difficult to save these trees,” said Chelliah.Therefore, periodical inspection, early detection and timely treatment is the only strategy to control termite and fungal attacks, said experts. To do that, Delhi needs to monitor its trees.Tracking trees The Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, notified in 1994, mandated a tree count but the first city-wide census is yet to be conducted. In 2007, the NDMC along with Forest Research Institute-Dehradun did survey the health of trees in the VIP zone. It also got itself a tree ambulance, the only such facility in Delhi. Another census with geo-tagging of trees in the NDMC area has been completed and the data is awaited, said Chellaiah.Having long waited for the government, residents of Sarvodaya Enclave conducted their own tree census in 2012. They followed it up with another census between 2018 and 2019 and recorded a loss of at least 77 trees. A few other South Delhi neighbourhoods including Gulmohar Park and Vasant Vihar also initiated their own tree health surveys.Also Read | CSE study identifies 14 new pollution hot spots in Delhi-NCRPadmavati Dwivedi, an environmental activist who spearheaded the census in Sarvodaya Enclave, said any long term strategy for tree care management has to start with a census and it was time the government conducted one covering the entire city.“In the absence of a city-wide tree census, there’s only firefighting happening in the name of tree care. Only when we have the data, we know which trees are infested with termites, which ones have gone hollow, which ones have been impaled with nails or wires, which ones have been concretised etc. It is then we can follow up with the agencies and seek remedial action,” said Dwivedi, urging the residents to get proactive and begin their own tree count.While native trees have far better survival rates, most of the species planted in Delhi’s neighbourhoods are monoculture, some of which are not suited for Delhi’s micro-habitat, she added.“As the way forward, we need to plant more indigenous species. Also, instead of saplings, we are now planting young trees — six feet in height — because they establish easily, and we don’t need tree guards to save them from trampling,” said Priyadarshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-lost-over-300-trees-in-three-weeks-experts-explain-what-needs-to-be-done-101623129401475.html

The vote has to be rubber-stamped by EU nations, but that’s a formality. Starting July 1 for a year, all EU countries must recognise the vaccine certificate. They will be issued free and certify that a person has either been fully vaccinated against the virus, has recently tested negative or has recovered from the disease.47,381 wild animals sold in Wuhan from 2017-19A scientific paper in China has found that over 47,000 live wild animals were sold from wet markets in Wuhan between 2017 and 2019 before the first cases of Covid-19 were reported from the city. Researched by international scientists, the paper says 47,381 animals from 38 species were sold in 17 markets between May 2017 and November 2019, including 31 protected species.US secretary of state Antony Blinken cast doubt on the methodology of a report on the origin of Covid-19 that reportedly concluded the virus may have leaked from a Wuhan lab.

09-06-2021||World||US unveils strategy to counter rising China||The US has initiated major steps to better address the security challenge from China, which has been called the “number one pacing challenge”, including steps to “streamline and strengthen” cooperation with allies especially in the Indo-Pacific.Secretary of defence Lloyd Austin announced these initiatives on Wednesday, based on the recommendations of the China Task Force, which was announced by President Joe Biden in February to provide a “baseline assessment” of existing steps and measures and to chalk up priorities.Based on the recommendations, most of which will remain classified, secretary Austin issued a directive initiating several major department-wide efforts to better address the security challenges posed by China as the United States’ “number one pacing challenge”, said the Pentagon.These measures are designed and intended to “focus processes and procedures and better help department leaders contribute to whole-of-government efforts to address the challenge from China”. They were developed through inter-agency consultations involving the agencies and departments working on China.“Many are intended to streamline and strengthen cooperation with US allies and partners, particularly in the Indo-Pacific,” the defence department said.India-US cooperation and partnership is a crucial part of the increasing centrality of the Indo-Pacific region for America, and through bilateral efforts and those with multi-lateral cooperation such as the Quad, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, with Japan and Australia.“The initiatives I am putting forward today are nested inside the larger US government approach to China and will help inform the development of the national defence strategy we are working on,” said secretary Austin. The four-year review and update of the national defence strategy is currently under way, as required by US Congress.“The efforts I am directing today will improve the department’s ability to revitalise our network of allies and partners, bolster deterrence, and accelerate the development of new operational concepts, emerging capabilities, future force posture, and a modernised civilian and military workforce,” he added.The statement said many of the initiatives will remain classified, but among those they mentioned, will one that establishes secretary Austin’s “intent to directly oversee the department of defence’s China-related policies, operations, and intelligence as the task force’s recommendations are incorporated into ongoing reviews and department-wide processes”.Biden had announced the task force just weeks after his inauguration as the world looked for clues to the new American president’s thinking on China. It was tasked with two specific aims: “to conduct a baseline assessment of China-related programmes, policies, and processes at the department of defence; and to provide the secretary with a set of top priorities and recommended courses of action for the department”.The task force delivered their initial assessment to the defence secretary in April, and then the full set of recommendations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unveils-strategy-to-counter-rising-china-101623261849775.html

During a weekly press briefing, PAHO director Carissa Etienne said that almost 1.2 million new Covid-19 cases and about 34,000 related deaths were reported in the region last week, highlighting that four of the five countries with the highest death counts - The United States, Brazil, Mexico and Peru - are in the Americas."If current trends continue, the health, social and economic disparities in our region will grow even larger, and it will be years before we control this virus in the Americas," Etienne said.PAHO serves as a regional office for the World Health Organization (WHO) and its member states include all 35 countries in the Americas. The US has been the worst-hit nation in terms of coronavirus-related deaths, followed by Brazil and India, as per the official figures. While the US has taken control with an aggressive vaccination drive, Brazil continues to report hundreds of deaths due to the infection every day.Also Read | 25% global Covid-19 deaths occurred in Americas, says Pan American Health OrganizationEtienne thanked the US, Canada, and Spain for promising to donate millions of vaccine doses or funding for the fight against Covid-19, but stressed that more needs to be done. "We hope other countries – particularly those with excess doses – and global financial institutions will follow in their footsteps to provide the support we need," Etienne said. "Vaccine donations are essential in the short-term," she added.Just around 10 per cent of the population in Latin America and the Caribbean have been fully vaccinated, making it vulnerable to fresh Covid waves. The rapid spread of new variants could make the situation even worse in lower- and lower-middle-income countries of the Americas.Ahead of the kick-off of the Copa America soccer tournament in Brazil, PAHO's Director of Health Emergencies, Ciro Ugarte, warned that countries hosting mass events should consider postponing if the risk of Covid-19 cannot be controlled.

09-06-2021||World||IS-linked group says Boko Haram leader in Nigeria, Abubakar Shekau, is dead||The leader of Nigerian extremist group Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, has killed himself, according to a jihadi organization linked to the Islamic State group.An audio recording purportedly from Abu Musab al-Barnawi, the leader of the Islamic State West Africa Province, or ISWAP, said Shekau detonated explosives killing himself after a battle between the two groups.The audio message follows media reports last month that Shekau, one of Africa’s most wanted men, blew himself up to evade capture by ISWAP fighters.Neither Nigerian authorities nor Boko Haram have confirmed Shekau's death.There had been several false reports about Shekau’s death in the past, with Shekau later appearing in videos to refute them.Al-Barnawi, a son to the founding leader of Boko Haram, the late Mohammed Yusuf, made the statement in an audio message heard this week by The Associated Press in the native Kanuri language.The audio message, which last about 28 minutes, had what is reportedly al-Barnawi's voice, lacing his speech with quotes from the verses of the Quran. The audio was obtained from a former jihadist who provides intelligence to the government and is familiar with al-Barnawi’s voice.“He never thought this would happen to him even in his dream, but by the power of God we destabilized him; he became confused and fled to forest where he spent five days, wandering and stranded,” he said. “We followed him again where we faced him with heavy fire. He ran away, then our troops called on him to surrender so that he would be punished.”Shekau was asked to surrender in order to be pardoned or reinstalled as a leader.“We kept assuring him that we were not out to kill him, but he refused. To him it’s better to die than to surrender,” he said.He went out to describe Shekau as “a defiant and corrupt leader” whose fighters were celebrating instead of mourning his death.“This was someone who committed unimaginable terrorism. How many has he wasted? How many has he killed? How many has he terrorized?” he said.ISWAP broke off from Boko Haram in 2016 following a dispute between Shekau and al-Barnawi. Both jihadi groups have also been fighting each other over territory since they fell out.The Nigeria-based Boko Haram has been waging a bitter war against Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad since 2009.Boko Haram under Shekau’s leadership has carried out numerous suicide bombings targeting markets, crowded bus stations, churches, mosques and media houses. A Boko Haram bombing in 2011 at the U.N. building in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, killed 21 people and wounded 60 others.Boko Haram attacks on towns and villages mainly in northeast Nigeria have left tens of thousands of people dead and displaced more than 2.3 million others.In February 2014, Boko Haram killed 59 male students in an attack at the Federal Government College Buni Yadi. Two months later, the group shocked the world when it abducted 276 teenage schoolgirls from the Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, Borno State. Shekau appeared in a video saying that the girls would be forced into marriage because girls as young as 9 are suitable for marriage. While many of the girls have either escaped or been released, 112 of them are still missing.The Boko Haram leader was notorious for using underage boys as child soldiers, while underage girls and young women have been used as suicide bombers in recent years.Some gruesome Boko Haram videos have shown captives, including security personnel, aid workers and others, executed — sometimes by beheading.Shekau had bounties on his head, with a reward of up to $7 million offered by the United States in 2012.If indeed Shekau, the driving force behind Boko Haram, has died, that will likely weaken Boko Haram and make it possible for ISWAP to take over vast territories under Boko Haram control in Nigeria’s northeastern states of Yobe, Borno and Adamawa.A stronger ISWAP will be bad news for the Nigerian military, as the group appears to constitute a greater threat against the Nigerian army, carrying out attacks on highly fortified military bases.Many attribute ISWAP’s recent successes to new tactics of buying over the local population with food and money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islinked-group-says-boko-haram-leader-in-nigeria-abubakar-shekau-is-dead-101623254784529.html

The armed forces ministry said that the French government is also freezing about 10 million euros in budgetary support for the landlocked African nation."A number of commitments made by the Central African authorities vis-à-vis France have not been kept," the ministry told news agency Reuters, which includes stopping the online campaigns meant to undermine French influence.France has a history of military interventions in the Central African Republic, a former French colony, and diplomatic wrangling over influence in the mineral-rich nation has heightened the tension. French influence has been undermined by Russia after Moscow sent hundreds of military instructors to help arm and train CAR's government troops to fight rebels.In the past, the Central African Republic has faced deadly interreligious and inter-communal violence. A peace deal in 2019 failed to curb the violence after the constitutional court rejected former CAR president Francois Bozize’s effort to run for president again last year.President Faustin Archange Touadera won re-election in December 2020 but continues to face opposition from rebel groups linked to Bozize. In January, the rebel forces tried to attack the capital city Bangui, underscoring the serious threat faced by CAR's military.Around 160 French troops were providing operational support in Bangui and training Central African forces to support the government on the security front. While the international missions, including a European Union training deployment, will continue, soldiers working directly for the French military will no longer cooperate with the Central African Republic's military. The decision to freeze aid and military cooperation will impact France's operational support in the capital Bangui and training Central African forces.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-freezes-aid-military-support-for-central-african-republic-101623252233038.html

A spokesperson for Prince Harry and Meghan on Sunday announced that the second child of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Lilibet “Lili” Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, had been born at a hospital in Santa Barbara in California on Friday morning.When Queen Elizabeth II was a toddler, her grandfather, King George V, would affectionately call her Lilibet while imitating her failed attempts to say her name. The nickname stuck and came to be used by close relatives. A BBC report, citing an unnamed Buckingham Palace source, had earlier stated that Harry and Meghan never checked with the Queen whether they can use the moniker before naming their child.Also Read | Meghan Markle releases debut kid's book 'The Bench' on father-son relationshipA spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said that Prince Harry spoke with the Queen before announcing his daughter’s name and the monarch was supportive of the decision, reported CNN."The Duke spoke with his family in advance of the announcement. In fact, his grandmother was the first family member he called," CNN quoted the spokesperson as saying. "During that conversation, he shared their hope of naming their daughter Lilibet in her honour. Had she not been supportive, they would not have used the names," the spokesperson added.The baby’s middle name, Diana, is in honour of her grandmother and Harry’s mother, who died in a car crash in 1997 while being chased by paparazzi on motorcycles.Also Read | 'She wasn't crazy': Prince Harry reveals how Meghan Markle overcame suicidal impulsesDuring an explosive interview with iconic talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Harry and Meghan had first revealed they were expecting a daughter.

The Duchess of Sussex refused to explicitly name the person, saying it would be “damaging” to them. However, Prince Harry later clarified that Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were never part of those conversations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harry-and-meghan-deny-report-that-they-didn-t-ask-queen-to-use-lilibet-name-101623245243555.html

This phenomena is witnessed when the Moon moves between the Sun and the Earth and blocks the Sun's light from reaching the Earth.This particular eclipse is an annular one. In an annular eclipse, the Sun is not entirely covered and a thin boundary of it is visible, which is called the ‘ring of fire.’The celestial event, also called Surya Grahan in India, will take place for 3 minutes and 51 seconds.Here is a list of places where the eclipse will be witnessed:Experts advise enthusiasts to take precautions while watching the eclipse. They should never look directly at the sun as this could cause harm to their eyes. They should use solar viewing or eclipse glasses, a box projector, or a telescope if they are planning to watch the sun during the eclipse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/solar-eclipse-2021-list-of-countries-that-will-witness-the-ring-of-fire-101623241484863.html
09-06-2021||World||China defends cultural links with Japan amid online nationalist fury||The Chinese foreign ministry defended the value of cultural exchanges with Japan on Wednesday after Chinese intellectuals came under heavy attack from nationalists online for attending events sponsored by the Japanese government over many years.The ministry's mild tone contrasted with the hardline "wolf warrior diplomacy" it has often favoured on international issues, especially those concerning Japan, whose brutal wartime occupation of China is a touchstone for Chinese nationalists.Some prominent Chinese scholars and writers came under fire last week after nationalistic netizens noticed their names among a list of 144 Chinese intellectuals who had been sponsored by the Japan Foundation to visit Japan from 2008 to 2016.Two netizens, operating under the pseudonyms Diguaxiong Laoliu and Guyan Muchan, who each have more than six million followers on their Twitter-like Weibo accounts, accused the intellectuals of currying favour with Japan for financial gain.They joined an online "name and shame" campaign to brand the intellectuals as traitors.Asked about the controversy at a regular press conference on Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said government-supported people-to-people interaction had contributed positively to relations between China and Japan."We hope to achieve more understanding, trust and deeper friendship through continual healthy and stable interaction among Chinese and Japanese people," said Wang.Wang's comment comes a week after President Xi Jinping told senior Communist Party officials that they should improve the way they communicate with the rest of the world."We must focus on setting the tone right, be open and confident but also modest and humble, and strive to create a credible, lovable and respectable image of China," Xi said, according to Xinhua news agency.Some Chinese diplomats and commentators have taken up hardline positions on social media in recent years, appealing to nationalist passions among their online followers.But this has contributed to friction with Western and Asian countries, encouraging them to reevaluate ties with an increasingly assertive China, the world's second biggest economy.Relations with China will be on the agenda of the Group of Seven leading industrial democracies when they meet this week for a summit in Britain. The G7 groups the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-defends-cultural-links-with-japan-amid-online-nationalist-fury-101623242003028.html

Two children were among 13 killed in Israel by Gaza militant rocket fire, which sent thousands of Israeli families running for bomb shelters where they cradled their children for hours on end.Also Read | Israel claims Hamas tried to hamper Iron Dome rocket defense from destroyed Gaza buildingSuzy's home was struck in a wave of Israeli attacks on Gaza City on May 16 that Gaza health officials said killed 42 people, including 10 children.Israel said those strikes targeted an underground tunnel system used by Hamas to transport weapons, and that the houses collapsed as a result of the tunnel network crumbling.The Israeli military said the civilian casualties were unintentional, and that it does all it can to avoid civilian harm.Psychologists have paid Suzy regular visits to help her process her trauma. At an art therapy session on Sunday, she sat silently as she and her cousins painted their names on paper.Alongside her name, Suzy painted two large hearts, in red."She was taken from her family's lap, from her mother's lap ... she survived death with a miracle," said psychologist Samar Awad, who oversees Suzy's case.Also Read | UN agency for Palestinian refugees withdraws director from Gaza after threats'When will the next war be?'Around half of Gaza's two million population are under 18.

You (feel like) you have nothing. You (feel) helpless, hopeless, worthless," he said.Owaida said that as a result of trauma, many Gaza children wet their beds, stutter, have nightmares and refuse to eat.The sense of hopelessness can be overwhelming, Owaida said."The question of many children now - they ask when the next war will be ... what will we do, where will we go?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/she-screams-when-someone-comes-near-gaza-children-in-trauma-after-israel-airstrikes-101623242009072.html
09-06-2021||World||Solar eclipse 2021: When and how to watch from India, US, and other countries||People across the northern hemisphere will have a chance to witness an annular or partial solar eclipse on Thursday, June 10, when the moon moves between the sun and Earth. The Moon will cast a shadow on Earth while revolving around the planet, causing a full or partial blocking of the sun’s light in some areas.The upcoming solar eclipse, dubbed as “ring eclipse”, is getting a lot of attention due to the distance of the Moon from Earth. The Moon will be far enough from Earth that it will appear smaller than the sun. In some areas, the moon will look like a dark disk on top of a larger, bright disk, creating what looks like a ring of fire around the moon.According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), people in parts of Canada, Greenland, and northern Russia will experience the annular eclipse. Much of Canada and parts of the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, and northern Africa will experience a partial solar eclipse.Also Read | Solar eclipse 2021 to occur on June 10: Timing, how to watch 'Ring of Fire'In the United States, the partial solar eclipse will be visible along with parts of the Southeast, Northeast, Midwest, and in Northern Alaska. While the eclipse will not be visible from India, some reports claim that some parts of Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh will be able to experience a partial solar eclipse.How to safely watch a solar eclipse?Solar eclipses last only a few minutes and eclipse enthusiasts are advised to never look directly at the sun, even if the sun is partly or mostly obscured. Individuals watching a partial solar eclipse or annular solar eclipse must wear solar viewing or eclipse glasses throughout the entire eclipse if they face the sun. Solar viewing or eclipse glasses are different from regular sunglasses which are not safe for viewing the sun. An alternate indirect method of projecting sunlight onto a surface can be used to experience the solar eclipse. Pinhole projectors shouldn’t be used to look directly at the sun.Also Read | Solar eclipse to occur on June 10, some regions to witness 'ring eclipse'How to experience the solar eclipse from countries like India where it won’t be visible?People in India and other countries where the solar eclipse won’t occur can see it via a live webcam. Weather permitting, Nasa will live stream a view of the partial solar eclipse on its YouTube channel and on its website nasa.gov/live. The live stream will start at 5am EDT (2.30pm IST), however, the steam will be dark until sunrise, 5.47am EDT (3.17pm IST).Nasa said that the eclipse will be nearly at maximum, with around 90 per cent coverage, at sunrise, so viewers can watch the sun reappear as the Moon moves out of the way. The stream will show the partial, not annular, solar eclipse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/solar-eclipse-2021-when-and-how-to-watch-from-india-us-and-other-countries-101623240558037.html
09-06-2021||World||Thousands of live animals sold in Wuhan markets before Covid-19 began: Study||More than 47,000 live wild animals were sold from wet markets in the central Chinese city of Wuhan between 2017 and 2019 before the first cases of Covid-19 were officially reported from the city, a new scientific paper says.Researched by international scientists including from China, the paper said that as many as 47,381 animals from 38 species were sold in 17 markets in Wuhan between May 2017 and November 2019, including 31 protected species.The animals were kept in cages with poor welfare and hygiene, raising health risks.The Chinese government says the first Covid-19 cases were detected in Wuhan in early December, the infection at that time described as a kind of pneumonia.Many of the earliest cases of human Covid-19 infection were linked to Wuhan’s Huanan seafood market, initially identified as where SARS-CoV-2 first jumped to humans through a zoonotic process, but a similar number of cases were associated with other markets as well.The new paper, written by researchers from China, Britain and Canada and published in the open access journal Scientific Reports on June 7, said there was no evidence that live bats or pangolins were sold in Wuhan, but mink, raccoon dogs, squirrels and foxes were all available. “We note that no pangolins or bats were traded, supporting reformed opinion that pangolins were not likely the spillover host at the source of the current coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic,” the authors wrote in the report.The experts added, “While we caution against the misattribution of Covid-19’s origins, the wild animals on sale in Wuhan suffered poor welfare and hygiene conditions and we detail a range of other zoonotic infections they can potentially vector.”The traded species were capable of hosting a wide range of infectious zoonotic diseases or disease-baring parasites, the researchers found.Following the outbreak and its rapid spread, the Chinese government temporarily banned all wildlife trade on January 26, 2020, three days after Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million, was locked down.The government permanently banned eating and trading terrestrial wild (non-livestock) animals for food on February 24, the same year. “These interventions, intended to protect human health, redress previous trading and enforcement inconsistencies, and will have collateral benefits for global biodiversity conservation and animal welfare,” the paper said.The authors said the study showed the range and extent of wildlife exploitation in Wuhan markets, prior to new trading bans linked to the Covid-19 outbreak, along with the poor conditions under which these animals were kept prior to sale.“Circumstantially, the absence of pangolins (and bats, not typically eaten in central China; media footage generally depicts Indonesia) from our comprehensive survey data corroborates that pangolins are unlikely implicated as spill-over hosts in the Covid-19 outbreak. This is unsurprising because live pangolin trading has largely ceased in China.”A joint study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and China in 2021 and published in March said it could not be verified if wild animals were sold at the Huanan market.“The WHO sent an investigative team to Wuhan, from 14 January-10 February 2021, to try to retrospectively ascertain what wildlife was being sold in local wet markets in this region. Their findings were inconclusive, with markets having been closed down completely at that point for 4 months; however, they did recommend that pangolins should be included in the search for possible natural hosts or intermediate hosts of the novel coronaviruses.”Incidentally, the experts collated the data from monthly surveys of wet markets unrelated and prior to the outbreak.The two-and-half years survey was intended to identify the source of the tick-borne (no human-to-human transmission) Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS) following an earlier outbreak in the province, the researchers said in the paper.There is ongoing speculation that SARS-CoV-2 could have been leaked from a high-security Wuhan bio laboratory that researched coronaviruses.The disease, however, is widely believed to have originated in bats with the closest natural match found in a cave in Yunnan in southwestern China..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-live-animals-sold-in-wuhan-markets-before-covid-19-began-study-101623239047439.html

Here’s the list||New Zealand and Australian cities dominated the Global Liveability Index 2021 published by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), owing to their strong response to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The data for the liveability survey was collected from February 22, 2020, to March 21, 2021, the period that witnessed multiple waves of pandemic across the world. According to the EIU report, the overall global average liveability fell by seven points as compared with the pre-pandemic score.Auckland has been ranked the best on liveability rankings due to the ability of New Zealand city to contain Covid-19 faster, leading to the early lifting of restrictions than other cities around the world. According to the EIU survey, six of the top 10 cities are in New Zealand and Australia, where tighter border controls from the early days of the pandemic allowed residents to live a relatively normal life.The report also noted a decline in liveability in many European cities as they battled the second Covid-19 wave by closing schools and restaurants, and restructuring cultural and sporting events. As the pandemic hit healthcare hard in most cities around the world, cities concentrated in western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region were least affected.Also Read | Mumbai slips 2 spots to 119 in global liveability indexJapanese cities of Osaka and Tokyo grabbed second and fourth place on EIU’s Global Liveability Index 2021, while two Swiss cities, Zurich and Geneva, were ranked seventh and eighth respectively.

"The Tokyo 2020 Olympics is galvanising huge international attention to how this country is going to address LGBTQ issues," said Gon Matsunaka, head of Pride House Tokyo, a community hub recognised as part of the Olympic programme. The renewed push for long-term changes in favour of the protection of gay rights in Japan comes amid the backdrop of the country's parliament mulling over an anti-discrimination bill and growing support among the younger population for LGBTQ-friendly laws.The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, while originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, was eventually postponed as a result of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Now, the much-awaited global games are slated to be held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo.The fact that the games were pushed back this year comes with revamped global attention. Speaking with reporters at the Foreign correspondents' club of Japan, Gon Matsunaka detailed the LGBTQ campaign's plan to use the heightened international spotlight to push for gay rights. "By utilising this huge momentum, we aim to do two things: first, to create change inside Japan's sports industry, and second to create change in society itself," he said.Japan's handling of LGBTQ rights is chequered with controversies. While the country has some protections for sexual minorities, it remains the only G7 nation that does not recognise same-sex unions, and many couples say they can struggle to rent apartments together and are even barred from hospital visits.The situation is equally arduous for Japanese athletes. It is "very difficult" for LGBTQ sports figures in Japan to be honest about their sexuality, said Fumino Sugiyama, a former athlete who was on the national women's fencing team before coming out as a transgender man. Athletes are afraid they will disappoint their fans and families, or that they will face discrimination from their sports association that could hinder their career, Sugiyama explained.Japan's proposed anti-discrimination law has been under discussion for years and gained traction after a group of lawyers began working on it in 2015. During one debate in May, a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmaker -- a member of the conservative ruling party -- sparked outrage by reportedly saying same-sex relationships threaten "the preservation of the species".However, things do have the potential for change, LGBTQ activists believe. Yuri Igarashi, director of the LGBTQ rights group J-ALL, told reporters there was still time for the proposed law to be passed before the parliament session ends next week. "We would like them to fulfil their promise to the people of this country," she said, citing a 2019 election pledge by the LDP to "promote understanding" of LGBTQ issues.At the UN, Japan has supported an anti-discrimination resolution, Igarashi added, while prime minister Yoshihide Suga recently spoke out against prejudice and discrimination. An increasing number of local governments and private companies are also introducing more inclusive policies, and a recent landmark court verdict called the failure to recognise same-sex marriage unconstitutional.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lgbtq-activists-in-japan-plan-tokyo-olympics-as-turning-point-for-gay-rights-101623233000009.html
09-06-2021||World||Bill Gates drove to office in Mercedes, left in Porsche to meet women: Report||After Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates announced their divorce last month, the reputation of the principal founder of Microsoft Corporation has come under media scrutiny due to his alleged extramarital affairs. A report published by Vanity Fair suggests that Gates’s inappropriate workplace relationships were an open secret in his broader professional and social circles.A former employee who had signed a non-disclosure agreement said that Bill Gates would drive to the office in his Mercedes and security personnel would show up with a golden-brown Porsche for the American business magnate to drive away, reported Vanity Fair. “We all assumed that it was when he was with women...I knew there were many offsite meetings that were not on his calendar,” the former employee was quoted by Vanity Fair as saying.Also Read | Gates marriage 'irretrievably broken' since 2019 over Epstein link: ReportQuoting two people familiar with the relationship situation between Gates and Melinda, Vanity Fair reported that someone in Melinda’s circle hired a private investigator, leading to the divorce filing. The claims were dismissed by a spokesperson for Melinda, calling the claim “completely false.” “Neither Melinda nor anyone at her direction ever hired a private investigator,” Vanity Fair quoted the spokesperson as saying.According to a New York Times report, Gates pursued women in the workplace when he was the chairman of Microsoft. He reportedly emailed a Microsoft employee to ask her out to dinner. He also told a woman, who was employed with Gates Foundation, that he wanted to take her out to dinner while they were on a business trip, reported Times.Melinda Gates had been working with a divorce lawyer for over a year before the duo announced it last month, partly because of her husband’s dealings with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to the Wall Street Journal. In a Times report, concerns were raised about Gates’ several meetings with Epstein, which were dismissed by a spokesperson for Microsoft Corporation as meetings centred around philanthropy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-drove-to-office-in-mercedes-left-in-porsche-to-meet-women-report-101623232091097.html
09-06-2021||World||WTO should punish Chinese economic coercion: Australia||The World Trade Organization should penalize “bad behaviour when it occurs,” Australia's prime minister said Wednesday ahead of a Group of Seven leaders' meeting in Britain where he hopes to garner support in a trade dispute with China.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia would be “working with others to buttress the role of the World Trade Organization and to modernise its rulebook where necessary.”“In my discussions with many leaders, I've taken great encouragement from the support shown for Australia's preparedness to withstand economic coercion in recent times,” Morrison said in a speech delivered in the Australian west coast city of Perth before leaving for the G7 meeting in Cornwall.The Australian government announced in December it would ask the WTO to intervene in its dispute with China over barley and expects other nations to become involved in the case.China effectively ended imports of Australian barley in May 2020 by putting tariffs of more than 80 per cent on the crop, accusing Australia of breaching WTO rules by subsidizing barley production and selling the grain in China at below production cost.Trade in Australian seafood, wood, beef, wine and coal has also been disrupted since Australia angered China by requesting an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.The Geneva-based WTO, which makes rules governing international trade, is facing calls for restructuring and reform as it struggles to forge a long-awaited world trade pact.“A well-functioning WTO that sets clear rules, arbitrates disputes objectively and efficiently penalizes bad behaviour when it occurs. This can be one of the most powerful tools the international community has to counter economic coercion,” Morrison said.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month the United States will not leave Australia alone to face coercion from China and that such behavior toward US allies will hamper improvement in relations between Washington and Beijing.Morrison said in his speech the most practical way to address economic coercion would be to restore the WTO's binding dispute settlement system.“Where there are no consequences for coercive behaviour, there is little incentive for restraint,” Morrison said.The G-7 meeting “provides an opportunity to point a way forward” at a WTO ministerial conference on trade reforms in November, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wto-should-punish-chinese-economic-coercion-australia-101623224446459.html
09-06-2021||World||'This IS INSANE': Africa desperately short of Covid-19 vaccine||In the global race to vaccinate people against Covid-19, Africa is tragically at the back of the pack.In fact, it has barely gotten out of the starting blocks.In South Africa, which has the continent's most robust economy and its biggest coronavirus caseload, just 0.8 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated, according to a worldwide tracker kept by Johns Hopkins University.And hundreds of thousands of the country's health workers, many of whom come face-to-face with the virus every day, are still waiting for their shots.In Nigeria, Africa's biggest country with more than 200 million people, only 0.1 per cent are fully protected. Kenya, with 50 million people, is even lower. Uganda has recalled doses from rural areas because it doesn't have nearly enough to fight outbreaks in big cities.Chad didn't administer its first vaccine shots until this past weekend. And there are at least five other countries in Africa where not one dose has been put into an arm, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The World Health Organization says the continent of 1.3 billion people is facing a severe shortage of vaccine at the same time a new wave of infections is rising across Africa. Vaccine shipments into Africa have ground to a “near halt,” WHO said last week.“It is extremely concerning and at times frustrating,” said Africa CDC Director Dr John Nkengasong, a Cameroonian virologist who is trying to ensure some of the world's poorest nations get a fair share of vaccines in a marketplace where they can't possibly compete.The United States and Britain, in contrast, have fully vaccinated more than 40 per cent of their populations, with higher rates for adults and high-risk people. Countries in Europe are near or past 20 per cent coverage, and their citizens are starting to think about where their vaccine certificates might take them on their summer vacations.The US, France and Germany are even offering shots to youngsters, who are at very low risk of serious illness from Covid-19.Poorer countries had warned as far back as last year of this impending vaccine inequality, fearful that rich nations would hoard doses.In an interview, Nkengasong called on the leaders of wealthy nations meeting this week at the G-7 summit to share spare vaccines — something the United States has already agreed to do — and avert a “moral catastrophe.”“I'd like to believe that the G-7 countries, most of them having kept excess doses of vaccines, want to be on the right side of history,” Nkengasong said. “Distribute those vaccines. We need to actually see these vaccines, not just ... promises and goodwill.”Others are not so patient, nor so diplomatic.“People are dying. Time is against us. This IS INSANE,” South African human rights lawyer Fatima Hasan, an activist for equal access to health care, wrote in a series of text messages.The Biden administration made its first major move to ease the crisis last week, announcing it would share an initial batch of 25 million spare doses with desperate countries in South and Central America, Asia and Africa.Nkengasong and his team were in contact with White House officials a day later, he said, with a list of countries where the 5 million doses earmarked for Africa could go to immediately.Still, the US offer is only a "trickle” of what's needed, Hasan wrote.Africa alone is facing a shortfall of around 700 million doses, even after taking into account those secured through WHO's vaccine program for poorer countries, COVAX, and a deal with Johnson & Johnson, which comes through in August, two long months away.Uganda just released a batch of 3,000 vaccine doses in the capital, Kampala — a minuscule amount for a city of 2 million — to keep its program barely alive.There and elsewhere, the fear is that the luck that somehow enabled parts of Africa to escape the worst of previous waves of Covid-19 infections and deaths might not hold this time.“The first COVID was a joke, but this one is for real. It kills,” said Danstan Nsamba, a taxi driver in Uganda who has lost numerous people he knew to the virus.In Zimbabwe, Chipo Dzimba embarked on a quest for a vaccine after witnessing Covid-19 deaths in her community. She walked miles to a church mission hospital, where there were none, and miles again to a district hospital, where nurses also had nothing and told her to go to the region's main government hospital. That was too far away.“I am giving up,” Dzimba said. “I don't have the bus fare.”South African health workers faced similar disappointment when they crowded into a parking garage last month, hoping for vaccinations and ignoring in their desperation the social distancing protocols. Many came away without a shot.Femada Shamam, who is in charge of a group of old-age homes in the South African city of Durban, has seen only around half of the 1,600 elderly and frail people she looks after vaccinated. It is six months, almost to the day, since Britain began the global vaccination drive.“They do feel very despondent and they do feel let down,” Shamam said of her unvaccinated residents, who are experiencing “huge anxiety” as they hunker down in their sealed-off homes 18 months into the outbreak. Twenty-two of her residents have died of Covid-19.“It really highlights the biggest problem ... the haves and the have-nots,” Shamam said.As for whether wealthy countries with a surplus of vaccine have gotten the message, Nkengasong said: “I am hopeful, but not necessarily confident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-is-insane-africa-desperately-short-of-covid-19-vaccine-101623221746639.html

New Zealand's elimination of Covid-19 within its borders through lockdown measures helped by its geographic isolation, however, gave its cities a big boost."New Zealand's tough lockdown allowed their society to reopen and enabled citizens of cities like Auckland and Wellington to enjoy a lifestyle that looked similar to pre-pandemic life," the EIU said in a statement.The EIU generally does not make the full ranking public. The last time Auckland was in the top 10 was in 2017, when it came eighth, a position Melbourne shared with Geneva this year. Vienna fell to 12th.Illustrating New Zealand's advantage this year, Wellington also entered the top 10. It came fourth behind Osaka, which rose two spots to second place, and Adelaide, which leapfrogged its compatriots Sydney and Melbourne to third place from 10th.The latest ranking is from 2019 as last year's was cancelled."The Covid-19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on global liveability," the EIU said."Cities across the world are now much less liveable than they were before the pandemic began, and we've seen that regions such as Europe have been hit particularly hard."The European Union struggled to get its vaccination campaign off the ground and many member states including Austria imposed more lockdowns than they had hoped to, hurting their cities' scores in the measure of 'culture and environment'. The four other categories assessed are stability, healthcare, education and infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-propels-auckland-to-top-of-eiu-s-most-liveable-cities-ranking-101623215195157.html

It is part of our culture, of our art of living, that we are going to reacquaint ourselves with," he said.Tables of up to six will be permitted at cafes and restaurants while gyms can also reopen for clients indoors.In virtually all of France however, masks however remain obligatory even out of doors until further notice.Vaccine campaign acceleratingBut the latest figures suggest the health situation is improving.The numbers in intensive care are down to 2,394 compared with 6,000 in late April.And as of Tuesday, more than 28 million people had had at least one vaccine shot -- nearly 43% of the population, and 55% of the adult population.Despite the closures, France over the last half-year endured less severe lockdowns than its neighbours -- notably avoiding major school closures -- in what was seen as a major gamble by Macron.Its vaccine campaign got off to a wobbly start but is now seen as a success, with 700,000 jabs being given on some days.Travel to France is also becoming easier, with France from Wednesday fully opening its borders to EU residents.Visitors from the EU will not have to provide a negative antigen or PCR test if they have had a full course of one of the four vaccines authorised by the bloc.Travel from other zones including the US and Britain are subject to tighter restrictions but visitors will no longer have to prove a compelling reason for a visit, so long as they have had the full course of vaccinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-starts-relaxing-covid-19-curbs-shortens-night-curfew-101623214428989.html

Globally, as many as 774 people died in the epidemic that reached nearly 30 countries.While the current pandemic death toll has exceeded Singapore's death toll from the SARS outbreak, the city-state still has one of the world's lowest Covid-19 fatality rates.Singapore authorities had said at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic that the experience dealing with SARS meant they were more prepared for the Covid-19 outbreak.So far, Singapore has reported 62,219 Covid-19 infections since January last year, while it recorded 238 SARS cases between March and May 2003.The 34th Covid-19 death in Singapore was an 86-year-old woman who had not been vaccinated against Covid-19 and had a history of comorbidities including diabetes and hypertension, Singapore's health ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapores-death-toll-from-covid-19-tops-casualties-in-sars-outbreak-101623213645497.html

09-06-2021||World||'Motivated by hatred': Trudeau denounces truck attack targeting Muslim family||A pickup truck attack that killed four members of an immigrant family has shaken Canada, a country where immigrants are largely accepted, and drew denunciations Tuesday from Canada’s prime minister, who called it a hate crime directed at Muslims.The victims — two parents, two children and a grandmother — were on an evening walk when the driver of the truck struck them at an intersection in London, Ontario. The sole survivor was a 9-year-old boy, who was hospitalized.“This was a terrorist attack, motivated by hatred, in the heart of one of our communities,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told Parliament. “If anyone thinks racism and hatred don’t exist in this country, I want to say this: How do we explain such violence to a child in a hospital? How can we look families in the eye and say “Islamophobia isn’t real”?The victims’ extended family issued a statement identifying the dead as Salman Afzal, 46; his wife Madiha, 44; their daughter Yumna, 15; and a 74-year-old grandmother whose name was withheld. The hospitalized boy was identified as the couple’s son, Fayez. Friends said the family immigrated to Canada 14 years ago.Many Canadians have been enjoying evening walks to get fresh air after long days at home during the pandemic, Trudeau said.“But unlike every other night, this family never made it home,” Trudeau said. “Their lives were taken in a brutal, cowardly and brazen act of violence. This killing was no accident. ... Canadians are outraged by what happened on Sunday. And many Muslim Canadians are scared.”Trudeau said words matter and in part blamed rhetoric, disinformation and extremism online and in politics.“They can be a seed that grows into an ugly, pervasive trend. And sometimes, they lead to real violence,” the prime minister said.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Twitter that the attack revealed the growing Islamophobia in Western countries.A 20-year-old suspect, Nathaniel Veltman, was arrested in the parking lot of a nearby mall. He was facing four counts of first-degree murder. Police were inside the suspect’s London apartment on Tuesday.Police said Veltman did not know the victims. Detective Supt. Paul Waight said it was not clear if he belonged to any specific hate group, but that local police were working with federal authorities to investigate potential terrorism charges. He said the attack was planned.Veltman worked part time at an egg farm in nearby Strathroy, Ontario. The chief executive of Gray Ridge Eggs Inc., William Gray, gave no details about Veltman’s job. He said the company was “shocked and saddened” by the attack, and he expressed sympathy for the victims’ relatives and the Muslim community.Arman Moradpourian, a friend who worked with Veltman, called Veltman a very devout Christian and said he was home schooled. Moradpourian said Veltman didn't have a problem with him being Persian and raised Muslim.“He never judged me,” Moradpourian told The Associated Press. “He would give his shirt off his back for you.”Moradpourian said Veltman helped him with rides to grocery stores and helped him mediate family issues. He said Veltman deleted his social media years ago and remade it a few months ago. He said he used the same name but said it was deactivated after he was arrested. He said Veltman was into video games and fishing.Everyone who knew the Afzal family knew “the model family they were as Muslims, Canadians and Pakistanis,” the statement from the extended family said. “They worked extremely hard in their fields and excelled. Their children were top students in their school and connected strongly with their spiritual identity.”A fundraising webpage said the father was a physiotherapist and cricket enthusiast and his wife was working on a doctorate in civil engineering at Western University in London. Their daughter was finishing ninth grade, and the grandmother was a “pillar” of the family, the page said.Thousands of mourners including Trudeau and the leaders of all of Canada’s political parties attended a vigil Tuesday night at the mosque the family attended. Pandemic restrictions were eased to allow mourners to attend the outdoor vigil.“There are no words that can ease the grief of having three generations murdered in their neighborhood,” Trudeau told the crowd. “There are no words that can undo the pain and yes the anger of this community. There are no words that can fix the future of that little boy who has had his future taken away. But know this: You are not alone. All Canadians mourn with you and stand with you.”Imam Abd Alfatah Twakkal of the London Muslim Mosque said he hoped the vigil would be a pivotal moment for his community and country in the fight against the scourge of racism and discrimination.“Every single one of us need to do our part,” he said.Rauf Ahmad and three friends earlier watched the growing tribute at the intersection in the day.“I didn’t think there was racism in Canada, and I felt very safe when I came here two years ago, but I do not feel safe now,” Ahmad said. “Humanity is first. We should not care about whether someone is a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian.”Near the crash scene, Zahid Khan, a family friend, said through tears: “They were just out for their walk that they would go out for every day. I just wanted to see.”Mayor Ed Holder said flags would be lowered for three days in London, which he said has 30,000 to 40,000 Muslims among its more than 400,000 residents.Canada is generally welcoming toward immigrants and all religions, but in 2017 a French Canadian man known for far-right, nationalist views went on a shooting rampage at a Quebec City mosque that killed six people.“Canada is not immune to the kind of intolerance and division we have seen elsewhere in the world,” Trudeau said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/motivated-by-hatred-trudeau-denounces-truck-attack-targeting-muslim-family-101623207480839.html
09-06-2021||World||Australia's 5 million in Melbourne exit two-week coronavirus lockdown||Five million Melbourne residents will exit lockdown Thursday after Australian authorities said their adherence to strict rules had "changed the course" of a coronavirus outbreak in the city.After two weeks under stay-at-home orders, the toughest restrictions in Australia's second-biggest city will be lifted from 11:59 pm Thursday, after just one new virus case was recorded on Tuesday."This is a good day. Everyone should be absolutely proud of what we have all achieved together," Victoria state acting Premier James Merlino said Wednesday.He said collective efforts had steamed the outbreak in the city, which has seen more than 80 people test positive for either the Kappa or Delta strains that originated in India."But we know this isn't over yet, and until we have widespread vaccination across Victoria and across our country, the virus will still be with us," Merlino said.Melbourne residents still cannot travel more than 25 kilometres (16 miles) from their homes or have visitors over, but may gather in groups of up to 10 outside.Schools, cafes and beauty salons can reopen, but gyms and nightclubs must remain closed for at least another week.Brett Sutton, Victoria's chief health officer, said there could not be a "snap back" to no restrictions as the situation remains "reasonably volatile"."We have to move by increments, safely, but with the minimum restrictions that we know will continue to control this," he said.Australia is one of the few countries globally without endemic transmission, recording 30,000 Covid-19 cases and fewer than 1,000 deaths in a population of 25 million.The border remains closed to most travellers -- with the exception of those from New Zealand -- and authorities are quick to impose restrictions when cases are detected.The virus is believed to have leaked out of Australia's makeshift hotel quarantine facilities up to 18 times in six months, prompting tough scrutiny of the system in recent weeks.Outbreaks in Taiwan and Japan have also underscored how initial success in containing the virus can quickly erode without widespread vaccination.Australia had administered about 5.2 million jabs as of Monday, but only a small fraction of people are fully vaccinated.hr/arb/qan||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-5-million-in-melbourne-exit-two-week-coronavirus-lockdown-101623207467281.html
09-06-2021||World||US, Japan Covid aid counters China's rising influence in Indo-Pacific: Taiwan||The United States and Japan Covid-19 vaccine support to Taiwan is intended as a countermeasure to China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, Taiwan News reported citing a political scientist.As Taiwan faces the spike in Covid-19 cases, the US and Japan stepped forward and provided the vaccine against the infection to the island. The move has irked China which considers Taiwan as its own territory.Japan's donation of over 1.2 million Covid-19 doses to Taiwan last week was followed by a visit by three American senators who announced the US has pledged 750,000 vaccines to the country as part of its program to distribute unused vaccines worldwide.While the relief was interpreted by some as reciprocating Taiwan's assistance to the two countries in the past, the moves also demonstrate Washington and Tokyo's determination to check Chinese political manoeuvring aimed at sowing discord in Taiwanese society, said Lin Wen-cheng, distinguished professor at National Sun Yat-sen University's Institute of China and Asia-Pacific Studies (ICAPS).ICAPS professor Kuo Yu-jen reckoned that the speedy assistance from the US and Japan suggests the two nations are including Taiwan in their collaborative strategy toward China.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US, which has been repeatedly opposed by Beijing. China has threatened that "Taiwan's independence" means war.A US delegation travelled to Taiwan to announce the donation of 750,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses.Reacting to the visit, the Chinese defence ministry on Tuesday said the trip had seriously damaged the foundation of China-US ties and the stability of the Taiwan Strait, calling it "extremely irresponsible", South China Morning Post reported."If anyone dares to separate Taiwan from mainland China, the People's Liberation Army will hit back and be determined to protect national unity and territorial integrity at all costs," ministry spokesman Wu Qian said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-japan-covid-aid-counters-china-s-rising-influence-in-indo-pacific-taiwan-101623197159028.html

09-06-2021||World||Israeli lawmakers to vote Sunday on coalition formed against PM Netanyahu||After weeks of political wrangling the Israeli parliament is set to vote Sunday on whether to install a "change" coalition and end Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's record 12 consecutive years in power.Announcing the date for the confidence vote, speaker Yariv Levin, a Netanyahu ally, said on Tuesday "a special session of parliament" would debate and vote on the fragile eight-party alliance, after the country's fourth inconclusive election in two years back in March.Later in the day, the prime minister's office announced that a march by Jewish nationalists through Jerusalem would go ahead in a week's time, potentially re-escalating tensions with Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group which went to war with the Jewish state for 11 days last month.Israeli right-wing groups had the day before cancelled plans for the controversial march, originally due to take place this Thursday, citing Israeli police restrictions, and as Hamas warned that the route could spark new violence.Divisive incumbent Netanyahu has dominated Israeli politics for more than a decade, pushing it firmly to the right.If Sunday's crunch parliamentary vote hands a majority to the coalition, which is united only by hostility to Netanyahu's rule, it would spell the end of an era.Since the nascent coalition was announced last week, Netanyahu has lived up to his reputation as a ruthless political operator, piling pressure on right-wingers within its ranks to reject this "dangerous left-wing government".The anti-Netanyahu bloc includes three right-wing, two centrist and two left-wing parties, along with an Arab Islamic conservative party.On paper it commands a wafer-thin majority, but Netanyahu has urged his supporters to shame right-wing lawmakers into walking away from the prospective alliance.Hamas warningThe Israeli political drama is playing out as tensions with the Palestinians smoulder, with police cracking down on demonstrations over the threatened eviction of Palestinian families from homes in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem to make way for Jewish settlers.Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Tuesday that cabinet had approved a decision to hold the so-called March of the Flags next Tuesday, adding that it would go ahead in a format to "be agreed by police and organisers".The decision had been agreed by both the prime minister and his defence minister Benny Gantz, before it was put to the cabinet, the premier's office said.The event had previously been due to proceed through flashpoint areas of east Jerusalem that have seen repeated clashes recently between Israeli police and Palestinians.A top Hamas official, Khalil al-Hayya, had warned Israel Monday "against letting the march approach east Jerusalem and the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound"."We hope the message is clear so that Thursday doesn't become (a new) May 10," he said, in reference to the start of the 11-day war which Hamas launched in response to tensions at the mosque compound, Islam's third-holiest site, which is also revered by Jews.Netanyahu had convened a late-night meeting Monday with senior government officials to discuss alternatives that could allow the march to proceed -- a move that saw his opponents accuse him and his allies of working to ratchet up tensions as his grip on power grows increasingly shaky.Labor MP Gilad Kariv, a supporter of the coalition, called the move "another chapter in the outgoing government's attempt to leave a scorched earth".'Let go'If the new government is confirmed, Netanyahu's right-wing opponent Naftali Bennett would serve as premier for two years, after which the "change" coalition's centrist architect, Yair Lapid, would take over."The unity government is on the way and ready to work on behalf of all the people of Israel," Lapid, a former television presenter, said in a statement following the announcement of the vote.Netanyahu, who faces corruption charges that could result in jail time, has refused to go without a messy fight.Bitter recriminations within the Israeli right and far right prompted Israeli security services to issue a rare warning against incitement online, which Netanyahu's opponents say was a warning to the prime minister.Alarm has grown over angry rallies by supporters of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party, including protests outside the homes of right-wing lawmakers accused of "betrayal" for joining the coalition. Security has been stepped up for some of the MPs.The 71-year-old prime minister has rejected allegations of incitement, saying "there is a very thin line between political criticism and inciting violence".Bennett, who served as Netanyahu's aide before turning against him, has urged his former boss to "let go".Should 11th-hour defections torpedo the fledgling coalition, Israel would likely have to return to the polls for a fifth election in just over two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-lawmakers-to-vote-sunday-on-coalition-formed-against-pm-netanyahu-101623183950888.html
09-06-2021||World||UK urges EU to show 'pragamatism and common sense' in post-Brexit talks||The UK's chief negotiator called on the European Union to show “pragmatism and common sense,” instead of threatening to retaliate, as the two sides meet to resolve differences over the deal that was supposed to keep trade flowing after Brexit.David Frost made the comments after his EU counterpart said the bloc was ready to act “firmly and resolutely” if the UK fails to honor its commitments under the divorce agreement. The two men are scheduled to meet Wednesday in London amid rising tensions over implementation of the deal in Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK that shares a land border with the bloc.Central to the talks are provisions of the deal that effectively created a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, angering many pro-British residents of the island. While Britain has called for compromise, the EU says the new rules are needed to protect the bloc's single market.Both sides fear the tensions could fuel a return to violence in Northern Ireland.“Further threats of legal action and trade retaliation from the EU won't make life any easier for the shopper in Strabane who can't buy their favorite product,” Frost said, referring to a town in Northern Ireland. “What is needed is pragmatism and common sense solutions to resolve the issues as they are before us. This work is important, and it is ever more urgent.”The divorce deal, which took effect on Jan. 1, included a number of grace periods that gave Britain time to put in place new systems to check a variety of goods coming into Northern Ireland to ensure they comply with EU rules. Those grace periods are now ending, causing headaches for businesses and consumers in Northern Ireland.The UK angered Brussels earlier this year when it unilaterally extended the grace period covering many supermarket items, delaying the required inspections for six months. The EU has threatened legal action over that decision.The Daily Telegraph, a British newspaper, reported Tuesday that the UK may also extend the grace period covering chilled meats such as sausages and ground beef, which is scheduled to end at the end of this month.Maros Sefcovic, the EU's chief negotiator, cautioned against such action, saying the two sides should strive to achieve “mutually agreed compliance paths.”“If this does not happen, and if the UK takes further unilateral action over the coming weeks, the EU will not be shy in reacting swiftly, firmly and resolutely to ensure that the UK abides by its international law obligations,” Sefcovic wrote Tuesday in the Telegraph.While Sefcovic didn't specify what those actions might be, the Times of London quoted an unidentified EU official as saying the bloc was ready to impose trade sanctions and retaliatory tariffs.Sefcovic described the so-called Northern Ireland protocol as an opportunity that will give the region access to more than 500 million customers in both the UK and European Union.But Frost said compromise is needed to make this a reality. The UK has sent 10 papers to the EU offering solutions to many of the issues that divide the two sides, but has received no written responses from the bloc, he said.“When I meet Maros Sefcovic later today my message will be clear: time is short and practical solutions are needed now to make the Protocol work,” Frost said.Britain accused the EU of taking an unnecessarily “purist approach” to the new rules.“There's no case whatsoever for preventing chilled meats from being sold in Northern Ireland,” said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman, Max Blain. “We are working very hard to try and resolve these issues consensually,”“Time is starting to run out and solutions are urgently needed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-urges-eu-to-show-pragamatism-and-common-sense-in-post-brexit-talks-101623183589827.html

"I would say the situation inside the country is concerning. And the situation is continuing to get worse. I think we are looking at all scenarios."Myanmar has been in turmoil since a Feb. 1 military coup, with daily protests in towns and cities and fighting in borderlands between the military and ethnic minority militias, some of which have only existed for a few weeks.The United Nations said on Tuesday an estimated 100,000 people in Myanmar's Kayah state had been displaced by fighting that included "indiscriminate attacks by security forces" in civilian areas.Campbell noted that Myanmar's coup leader Min Aung Hlaing had admitted in an interview aired on military-owned television he had not anticipated the level of civil unrest.Campbell said Washington, which has imposed sanctions on the coup leaders and their economic interests, had supported efforts of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and others to try to begin a process of moving Myanmar back to democracy and was urging countries isolate the generals diplomatically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/undeniable-that-violance-is-spiraling-us-govt-s-top-asia-official-on-situation-in-myanmar-101623181673931.html

The AP said it has not seen evidence to support the claim.Ambassador Gilad Erdan issued his statement a day after meeting the AP's president and chief executive, Gary Pruitt, and Ian Phillips, vice president for international news, at the AP's New York headquarters.The Israeli air force bombed the 12-story al-Jalaa tower on May 15, roughly an hour after ordering all occupants to evacuate. No one was injured, but the building was destroyed. The building was home to offices belonging to the AP, the Al Jazeera satellite channel as well as dozens of families.The airstrike came during an 11-day war between Israel and Gaza’s ruling Hamas militant group.In a statement on Twitter, Erdan said he told AP executives that the building was used by Hamas to disrupt the Iron Dome, which intercepted hundreds of incoming rockets fired by the militant group during the fighting.Erdan said the airstrike did not intentionally target journalists.“AP is one of the most important news agencies in the world and Israel does not suspect its employees were aware a covert Hamas unit was using the building in this way,” he said.“I reaffirmed that Israel upholds the importance of press freedom and strives to ensure the safety of journalists wherever they are reporting. Israel is willing to assist AP in rebuilding its offices and operations in Gaza,” he added.The meeting with Erdan "was a positive and constructive conversation,” the AP said in a statement. The agency expressed its appreciation for his pledges to help rebuild an AP bureau in Gaza.The AP renewed its call to see evidence backing Israel’s claim that Hamas militants were operating in the building.“Israeli authorities maintain that the building housing our bureau was destroyed because of a Hamas presence that posed an urgent threat," the AP said. "We have yet to receive evidence to support these claims. AP continues to call for the full release of any evidence the Israelis have so that the facts are public.”The AP has repeatedly urged Israel to share any evidence supporting its claims of Hamas activity in the building. It also has urged an independent investigation into the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-claims-hamas-tried-to-hamper-iron-dome-rocket-defense-from-destroyed-gaza-building-101623180604763.html

CEO Joseph Blount Jr. said at Tuesday’s hearing.Blount’s appearance before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee comes as Congress readies its response to the hack, which affected 45% of the East Coast’s fuel supply, driving up gasoline prices and sparking shortages at filling stations after the company shut the roughly 5,500-mile pipeline on May 7.The senators’ questions for Blount were direct but relatively gentle. Blount was contrite -- and sometimes vague -- on some details about the company’s cybersecurity protections. When asked about Colonial’s cybersecurity budget, for instance, he said they had spent $200 million on information technology over five years without specifying how much was defending against hacks.Blount said responding quickly to contain the threat and swiftly communicating with the government were among the most important lessons he learned from the incident.The hackers, who the FBI said have been linked to a group known as DarkSide operating in Russia, were able to breach the company’s computer system April 29 using a virtual private network -- or VPN -- account, an encrypted internet connection that allowed employees to remotely access the company’s computer network. Blount testified that the VPN account only had single-factor authentication.The “legacy” network “was not intended to be in use,” said Blount, who took over as Colonial CEO in 2017. He added that the company is still trying to determine how the hackers gained the needed credentials to exploit it.Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio and the ranking member on the committee, called out this failure. “Mr. Blount you’re a victim, and we understand that,” he said, but added, “this account apparently didn’t use multifactor authentication, which again is just a basic cybersecurity hygiene item that companies should have in place, making it harder for people to gain access.”Blount was asked repeatedly about his decision to pay the hacker’s ransom, an action that is discouraged by the FBI because it encourages others to attempt cyberattacks. He described it as “the hardest decision I’ve made in my 39 years in the energy industry.”“I believe with all my heart it was the right choice to make,” Blount told the committee. After it was over, he told reporters, “I’d do it again under the same circumstances.”Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, asked Blount to consider the alternative. “How much worse could it have been had you not made that very difficult decision to bite the bullet so you could get your pipelines up and operational?” Johnson asked.Blount responded, “That’s an unknown we probably don’t want to know.” But he said that even after paying the ransom, it still took the company six days to get the pipeline back up and running. The remediation at Colonial is ongoing, Blount said, including bringing seven affected financial systems back online this week.The Department of Justice announced Monday it had recovered the majority of the payment Blount made to the perpetrators in cryptocurrency after law enforcement identified a virtual wallet used in the ransom payment. Because of the declining value of Bitcoin since the ransom was paid, the US seizure in late May amounted to $2.3 million, just over half the $4.4 million paid weeks earlier after the ransom was demanded.The ransomware attack on Colonial is part of a rising trend of such acts against critical infrastructure that is posing an early test of President Joe Biden’s administration. It was among a wave of ransomware attacks that included JBS SA, the largest meat producer globally, which forced the shutdown of all its US beef plants, halting output at facilities that account for almost a quarter of American supplies.US intelligence and law enforcement officials say stopping hacking attacks has become a national security priority. Congress is also considering a legislative response that could include cybersecurity mandates that energy and pipeline companies have spent years opposing.Speaking to reporters after the hearing, Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan and chairman of the committee, said the committee is working on comprehensive cybersecurity legislation that would address information sharing by the private sector with government during cyberattacks. “The private industry has to be very forthcoming. They have to let us know what they know so that information can be shared with other companies. We’re going to be putting a mechanism to do that,” he said.Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire, expressed concern that Colonial didn’t have a specific plan in place for ransomware attacks prior to the breach. “I have small school districts in New Hampshire that are more prepared than Colonial Pipeline appeared to be, and that’s really concerning,” she told reporters.“It really speaks to the importance of understanding that when critical infrastructure is run by a private entity, that there needs to be some rules and frameworks to make sure that interests of the American people are served,” Hassan added.Johnson endorsed a response led by the private sector, saying he wasn’t convinced that government could issue standards and keep them up-to-date given its struggles to pay for top talent.Meanwhile, Senator James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma, said the Colonial pipeline shutdown and resulting fuel shortages demonstrated the need to build more pipelines to provide redundancy in the case of outages.The Colonial shutdown, he said, is “the ghost of Christmas future for the entire country if we don’t continue to maintain our pipelines, increase capacity of pipelines, if we don’t continue to expand, have a duplication of pipelines in spots.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-are-deeply-sorry-colonial-pipeline-s-ceo-tells-us-senate-panel-on-impact-of-ransomware-attack-101623180218700.html
09-06-2021||World||Data shows trade between Beijing, New Delhi grew in 5 months of 2021||Trade between India and China soared by around 70%year-on-year to at least $48 billion in the first five months of 2021, latest data from Chinese customs showed Monday.Publicly available data from India too showed a healthy growth, although the numbers differed from those put out by Chinese state media. According to the Indian data, trade grew 55.83% in the first five months of the year.The reason for the discrepancy in the data isn’t known; both countries denominate the trade in dollars. Calling it a “spectacular growth”, Chinese state media interpreted the increase in bilateral trade as a sign of resilience in trade ties between the two countries despite serious conflict at the border and political differences.“Trade between China and India soared 70.1 % in US dollar terms in the first five months of this year to $48.16 billion, according to Chinese customs data released on Monday. Specifically, Chinese exports to India grew 64.1% year-on-year from January to May, while imports surged 90.2%,” the nationalistic tabloid, Global Times reported.According to the Indian data, imports from China rose 59.13% to $33.49 billion, while exports to China rose 46.09% to $10.41 billion.The trade volume between the two countries was higher than the trade China conducted with other trading partners in this period, the Global Times report said. The latest statistics were released by China’s General Administration of Customs (GAC) on Monday.As per Chinese data, the trade – or specifically Chinese exports to India – rose sharply between April and May. The rise could be attributed to the increase of exports of Chinese medical goods and equipment by Indian companies to fight the surge in Covid-19 cases in the last couple of months. “If anything, these extraordinary growth rates show that China-India trade has largely shrugged off the impact of the political tensions caused by the border friction last year...,” the state media report said.India-China trade in 2020 declined by 9.1% to $77.66 billion, though China still overtook the US to become India’s largest trading partner in 2020.Those numbers are for the calendar year. India, follows an April to March financial year and according to government data, Indian exports to China saw a 27.53% jump in 2020-21 , while China’s imports saw a 0.07% contraction. Total India-China trade in the financial year was $86.4 billion, with a $44 billion trade balance in favour of China, a significant 30.15% drop from about $63 billion in 2017-18.According to the Indian embassy in Beijing, though bilateral trade between the two countries grew exponentially overall – notwithstanding a fall last year because of the Covid-19 pandemic -- India continues to be saddled with a big trade deficit.“The growth of trade deficit with China can be attributed to two factors: narrow basket of commodities, mostly primary, that we export to China and market access impediments for most of our agricultural products and the sectors where we are competitive in, such as pharmaceuticals, IT/IteS, etc. Our pre-dominant exports have consisted of cotton, copper and diamonds/ natural gems,” the Indian embassy says on its website under the section “India-China Trade and Economic Relations”.India’s Commerce ministry did not respond to an email query on this matter.According to an Indian official who asked not to be named, the spurt in trade in 2020-21 signified a jump in Indian exports to China and a sharp decline in Chinese imports. “This is a grand success of Make in India and Make for the world aided by competitiveness of Indian industry,” the official said requesting anonymity.To be sure, some analysts also point to the contraction of the Indian economy as the main reason for the fall in Chinese imports last year, although some bit of it was also on account of the situation at the Line of Actual Control.As for the first five months of this year, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the numbers likely reflect the spike in imports of medical equipment from China to cope with the second wave of Coronavirus infections. The people, however, added that this shouldn’t be perceived as “business as usual” against the backdrop of the dragging border standoff.In a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on April 30, external affairs minister S Jaishankar highlighted the importance of transport corridors and cargo flights remaining open and speedy logistics support from the Chinese side to facilitate the procurement of Covid-19 related products and raw materials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/data-shows-trade-between-beijing-new-delhi-grew-in-5-months-of-2021-101623179540344.html

"Easing of restrictions will be focused on Canadians who are fully vaccinated."Trudeau did not give details and did not mention what would happen to Americans who had two doses, saying only that restrictions would remain until more people had received their second doses of vaccine. Canadian officials say Ottawa and Washington are in constant contact over the issue.Canadian officials have previously said the border should stay partially closed until 75% of the population has received their first shots and 20% their second, and that could happen in mid-July, according to projections based on planned vaccine deliveries.A source familiar with the talks said Canadian Public Safety Minister Bill Blair had told US Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas that Canada could theoretically be able to admit fully vaccinated Americans by August.The mayors of some border cities said on Monday they expected Canada to move as early as June 21, the next deadline for a possible rollover of restrictions.The US and Canadian chambers of commerce and other business groups said in a joint statement on Tuesday that the two governments should allow fully vaccinated travelers to cross the border starting June 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-soon-say-how-covid-19-curbs-at-us-border-would-be-eased-for-fully-vaccinated-pm-trudeau-101623178746633.html

He has asked for a report in 90 days.The US has said it is determined to “get to the bottom” of the pandemic and, along with several other countries, has urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to launch a comprehensive probe, going beyond its earlier report, which had found the lab leak theory “extremely unlikely”.The May 2020 study was conducted by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s intelligence wing ,“Z Division”, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the study, and it was based on a genetic analysis of the virus that causes Covid-19.The report, dated May 27, 2020, was sent to the state department in October and it sought more information.A factsheet released by the state department in January 2021 listed out several reasons why the pandemic might have been caused by an accidental leak from the Wuhan lab. It said, “The US government has reason to believe that several researchers inside the WIV became sick in autumn 2019.”The WSJ has reported based on US intelligence assessment that three researchers from the Wuhan virology lab were taken to hospital, and it was in November 2019, well before the first case was reported by China in December 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-report-concluded-covid-19-lab-leak-theory-plausible-101623178968573.html

Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced a “strengthened package of support” in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, including more testing and door-to-door visits to encourage vaccine take-up. Residents were advised to minimize travel, though officials insisted it’s not a local lockdown.Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham urged the government to send the region more vaccine doses.The move highlights the deep concern in government about the spread of the delta variant, which was first identified in India, and its potential impact on coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the coming weeks.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is weighing whether to ease England’s remaining Covid-19 restrictions as planned on June 21, with an announcement due on June 14. Ministers have said no decisions have yet been made on whether to push the date back a few weeks until more people receive two vaccine doses.Easing the rules would allow nightclubs to reopen, sports stadiums to fill to capacity, queuing for drinks in bars, and large weddings and conferences to resume. Johnson is under pressure from businesses and Conservative Party colleagues to stick to the date they have dubbed “Freedom Day.”But the latest data is heading in the wrong direction for the government. A further 6,048 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported on Tuesday, up from 5,238 last week. NHS England data showed there were 879 coronavirus patients in hospitals, up from 776 in a week.In Parliament, Hancock said “conclusive” data on the effectiveness of vaccines against the delta variant would be available in the next “couple of weeks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-sends-military-to-covid-19-hotspots-in-northern-england-to-tackle-delta-variant-s-spread-101623177366634.html
09-06-2021||World||US CDC eases travel recommendations on over 110 countries including Japan, Canada||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has eased travel recommendations for more than 110 countries and territories, including Japan just ahead of the Olympics.The CDC's new ratings were first reported by Reuters and posted on a CDC website on Monday, include 61 nations that were lowered from its highest "Level 4" rating that discouraged all travel to recommending travel for fully vaccinated individuals, the agency confirmed on Tuesday.Another 50 countries and territories have been lowered to "Level 2" or "Level 1," a CDC spokeswoman said. Countries ranked lowest for Covid-19 risks now include Singapore, Israel, South Korea, Iceland, Belize and Albania.Among those now listed at "Level 3," are France, Ecuador, Philippines, South Africa, Canada, Mexico, Russia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Honduras, Hungary, and Italy.A US State Department official said it was in the process of revising its travel advisory to reflect the CDC changes.As of early Tuesday, the State Department had lowered its ratings on more than 90 countries and territories, including for Japan.On May 24, the State Department had urged against travel to Japan, citing a new wave of coronavirus cases before the Tokyo Olympics are set to begin July 23.The State Department warning raised concerns and prompted the White House to reaffirm its support for Tokyo's plan to hold the Games this summer and for US athletes competing there despite a new wave of infections and low vaccination rate in the host country.Foreign spectators have been banned, and organizers are expected to make a decision late this month on domestic spectators.The CDC said the change comes after it revised its criteria for travel health notices. The CDC said it has also revised its rating for the United States to "Level 3" from "Level 4."The agency said the new criteria for a Level 4 "avoid all travel" recommendation has changed from 100 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 to 500 cases per 100,000.The agency added that many countries have lower ratings "because of the criteria changes or because their outbreaks are better controlled." The CDC said it expects more countries to get lower, more favorable travel ratings.Other countries being lowered to "Level 3" include Honduras, Indonesia, Jordan, Libya, Panama, Poland, Denmark and Malaysia.Many of the countries that now have lower ratings remain on the US government's list of countries subject to severe travel restrictions - and most have been subject to the restrictions since early 2020.The United States bars nearly all non-US citizens who have within the previous 14 days been to China, the United Kingdom, Ireland, India, South Africa, Brazil, Iran and the 26 Schengen nations in Europe without border controls.Asked why the United States is maintaining the warnings even though some countries now have low infection rates subject to the restrictions, while others with high rates are exempt, CDC Director Rochelle Wallensky said on Tuesday the issue is subject to "an interagency conversation, and we are looking at the data in real time as to how we should move forward with that."The United States also has been in discussions with Canada and Mexico - both of which had recommendations eased on Tuesday - on how to eventually lift or revise restrictions at US land borders that bar non-essential travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-eases-travel-recommendations-on-over-110-countries-including-japan-canada-101623173181994.html

Shringla had a “productive meeting” with Smith on India-US relations, regional issues and cooperation at the UN, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said in a tweet. They also discussed the Covid-19 situation, supply of vaccines and cooperation in combating the pandemic, Bagchi said without going into details. The people cited above said on condition of anonymity that the issue of travel by Indian students vaccinated with the indigenously developed Covaxin vaccine, which hasn’t been authorised by the World Health Organization (WHO), was raised by Shringla. The people added that Smith indicated India’s concerns would be conveyed to US authorities. Covaxin and Covishield are the two main jabs being used in India’s vaccination programme. Covishield, which is the AstraZeneca vaccine made in India, has been granted an emergency use listing by WHO, and is accepted under the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for entry of foreign travellers. With many US universities opening up to international students and planning in-person classes from autumn, students are required to be fully vaccinated. According to guidelines posted on the CDC website, foreign travellers are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the second dose of a two-dose vaccine such as the Pfizer or Moderna jabs, or two weeks after a single-dose vaccine such as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. “If you don’t meet these requirements, you are NOT fully vaccinated,” the guidelines state. Of the vaccines being used in India, the CDC approves only the AstraZeneca jab. Indian students planning to join campuses in the US and European countries, where too Covaxin isn’t approved, have raised this matter with the government, especially the external affairs ministry. Bharat Biotech, the makers of Covaxin, intends to provide additional documentation needed for WHO’s emergency use listing of the vaccine by June. The status of the application for emergency use listing of Covaxin by WHO was assessed at a virtual meeting late last month that was joined by Shringla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/problems-of-students-vaccinated-with-indigenously-developed-covaxin-raised-with-us-101623263289835.html

If he is located, we will ask Interpol and local law enforcement agencies there to arrest him”, said an officer, requesting anonymity.Mishra, through his lawyers, filed an affidavit in the Calcutta high court on Monday, saying he left the country in September 2020, much before investigation into the cases had even begun. He also said that he has already renounced his Indian citizenship in December 2020, which has been accepted by the Indian consulate.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Mishra, said on Wednesday: “There is no question of fleeing here because he left India before the probe started. In fact, he is pleading that he wants to come back. But he fears that he will be caught if he travels.”Mishra, said to be close to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee, has sought to appear before the agencies through video conferencing owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-searches-for-ex-tmc-leader-with-interpol-help-101623263024435.html
09-06-2021||India||More girls may have been sexually abused at J’khand shelter home: Police||An investigation into the alleged sexual abuse of two minor girls at a children’s home run by a state government-approved NGO, Mother Teresa Welfare Trust (MTWT), has found that more girl inmates were being abused there for over four years, Jamshedpur senior superintendent of police Dr M Tamil Vanan has said.Police said they have expanded the scope of the investigation in the light of the findings.Police on Tuesday said an FIR under Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and sections of the Indian Penal Code was lodged on the complaint of the two rescued girls against Harpal Singh Thapar, director of the home, his wife Pushpa Rani Tirkey, who is also the chairperson of East Singhbhum district child welfare committee (CWC), warden Geeta Singh, her son Aditya Singh, and another staff member Tony Singh. All the accused are on the run.Vanan said that the two girls, aged 16 and 17, have given video-recorded statements in which they have reiterated all the charges made in their statements to the special Pocso court. The girls said they were physically and mentally tortured at the home and made to give in to the sexual demands of the perpetrators.Police said the details are horrifying. “Investigation has found that Thapar allegedly had physical relations with the 19-year-old daughter of the warden, and he, along with others, used to sexually abuse and exploit the woman on a regular basis,” said Dr Vanan.The girls said they were in the children’s home for the past four years, but no action was taken despite repeated complaints to Tirkey, the CWC chief, the SSP said, adding that the police were looking at the involvement of some other suspects as well.The death of a three-and-a-half-year-old girl due to brain tumour in the home 25 days ago is also being investigated. “This little girl was the daughter of a rape survivor who didn’t want to keep her. Thapar and his wife didn’t inform the police or the district administration about the death, which they were legally bound to,” SSP Dr Vanan stated in his report to the Jamshedpur deputy commissioner, Suraj Kumar.Police are still awaiting medical reports of the two rescued girls to determine if they were raped.MTWT is a Jharkhand-government-approved NGO. It has no links with Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity. The shelter home located at Shamsher Tower in Kharangajhar had 23 girls in two rooms on the second floor, while the warden lived in another room on the same floor with her daughter and son. Thapar and Tirkey lived on the first floor, while 22 boys lived on the ground floor.Police has recommended to the district collector to act against MTWT and CWC chief Tirkey, and to rehabilitate the girls. Twenty-one girls are being taken care of by the Seraikela-Kharsawan CWC for the time being.Vanan said police were also probing allegations that Thapar and Tirkey used to transfer government funds and private donations into their personal accounts. “The girls told us that they took away the money donated to them by many people for clothing, food and other items. All the five named accused will be arrested soon as different teams are raiding possible hideouts,” he said.In a similar case at a shelter home in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur, which came to the fore in three years ago, 12 people, including main accused Brajesh Thakur, were sentenced to life imprisonment in February 2020 by a Delhi court, which heard the case following orders from the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-girls-may-have-been-sexually-abused-at-j-khand-shelter-home-police-101623261969095.html
09-06-2021||India||Need union of states to take on Centre: Mamata||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said that in a federal structure, there should be a union of state governments to take on the Centre if any state is harassed.Banerjee, whose third term in office began on a confrontational note with the Centre, was speaking after meeting delegation of farmer leaders led by Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU) Rakesh Tikait at the state secretariat, Nabanna. In it, Banerjee, who is also the Trinamool Congress supremo, extended her support to the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three controversial farm laws.“We are ready to support the ongoing farmers’ protest till the time the demands are met. They (farmer leaders) have requested me to speak to other chief ministers (of non-BJP ruled states) so that together we could hold a virtual conference with the farmers. I will surely speak to chief ministers so that we can send a letter unanimously. This will give them some strength before the Lok Sabha polls,” Banerjee said .“She urged every chief minister of states not ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to stick together. “I would urge every opposition party to unite (against the BJP) to save democracy,” Banerjee said.The chief minister lashed out at the Centre for its vaccination policy and the spiralling fuel prices and said in a federal structure, it isn’t right for the Centre to try to bulldoze the states.“The Prime Minister need not take credit for giving free vaccines. This is not BJP’s money. It is people’s money. Even the Supreme Court has directed the Centre to give more importance to the states and the federal structure. But still the Centre hasn’t come up with any guidelines,” she said.The Bengal CM also renewed her demand that the Centre should withdraw the three farm bills — The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.In a joint press conference held after the meeting, Tikait requested Banerjee to extend her support to the farmers’ protest.“We have urged Mamata Banerjee to turn West Bengal into a model state where farmers get the maximum benefits by doing away with the middlemen who siphon off all the profits. Other states may follow the model. The farmers have been hit during the pandemic,” Tikait said.The farm agitation has been on for over six months now.TMC had recently announced that it would expand its footprint beyond West Bengal. Abhishek Banerjee, the party’s general secretary and the CM’s nephew, had said on Monday that the party would come up with a national plan within a month.The BJP-led central government has defended the new farm laws and held 11 rounds of talks, the last being on January 22, with the unions to end the farmers’ protest over the laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-union-of-states-to-take-on-centremamata-101623261729046.html

The decision was one of the several taken at a day-long meeting of chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who holds the home portfolio, with superintendents of police at Kaziranga. “Assam police will have 10 new commando battalions. They will be stationed at critical places including the Assam-Nagaland border where we have a boundary row, the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) etc. They would be a special unit comparable to NSG,” Sarma told the media after the meeting. As part of introducing reforms in the state police, the meeting decided to introduce two-shift duty in all police stations and start a new recruitment drive to implement that. “Sometimes policemen have to be on duty 24 hours. So, ideally we need three shifts, if not two-shifts in a day. We will start a new recruitment drive this year to implement this,” said Sarma. Free health check-up and one month of compulsory leave in a year for policemen posted in police battalions are some other decisions taken. The meeting also decided to set up seven new forensic laboratories in the next six months in order to handle the large number of cases registered as part of the police drive against illegal drugs. “We will work to ensure that Assam doesn’t act as a transit route for illegal drugs and also bring down its consumption. Smuggling of cattle to the state from other states will not be allowed. Our response on these two issues will be very aggressive. There will be zero tolerance and we will strike at the root (of these problems),” the CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-to-raise-10-commando-battalions-on-lines-of-nsg-to-fight-crime-border-issues-101623260529643.html

The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) under the union ministry of health and family welfare, issued the new guidelines. It also said that the usage of steroids in treating asymptomatic and mild cases of infection is harmful.Also, usage of steroids was recommended under “strict supervision” only for hospitalised moderately severe and critically ill Covid-19 cases. “Steroids should be used at the right time, in the right dose and for the right duration. Self-medication of steroids must be avoided,” the DGHS said.Remdesivir, an emergency use authorization drug, is not recommended for treatment of children, the new guidelines also said. “There is lack of sufficient safety and efficacy data with respect to Remdesivir in children below 18 years of age,” according to the guidelines. The drug has been used to treat Covid-19 patients and its demand ballooned during the second wave of Covid-19 in India.Also read | If Covid-19 trends continue, it will be years before virus is controlled: PAHOSuggesting only a rational usage of high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan for knowing the extent and nature of lung involvement in Covid-19 positive patients, the guidelines said “However, any additional information gained from HRCT scan of the chest often has little impact on treatment decisions, which are based almost entirely on clinical severity and physiological impairment. Therefore, treating physicians should be highly selective in ordering HRCT imaging of the chest in Covid-19 patients.”Meanwhile, the new guidelines also noted that antimicrobials have no role in the prevention or treatment of uncomplicated Covid-19 infection, which is a viral infection. However, the guidelines also noted that antimicrobials should not be prescribed for moderate and severe cases unless there is clinical suspicion of a superadded infection. It also clearly said that antimicrobials are not needed for treatment or prophylaxis in asymptomatic and mild cases.Covid appropriate behaviour and a nutritious diet were suggested for asymptomatic infection in children while no specific medications were mentioned in the guidelines. For mild infection in older children and adolescents, paracetamol dose every four to six hours for fever and throat soothing agents and warm saline gargles for cough have been recommended. However, initiating immediate oxygen therapy has been recommended for moderate infections.The guidelines also said that if acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in severe Covid-19 infected children, then necessary management needs to be initiated. It also recommended a six-minute walk test for those above 12 years of age under the supervision of parents or guardians. "It is a simple clinical test to assess cardiopulmonary exercise tolerance and is used to unmask hypoxia.

He introduced himself as Raj. Between August and April, he was always texting me but I replied to him once a month,” she had earlier said in an interview to ANI.Mehul Choksi, currently in custody in Dominica, went missing from Antigua earlier on May 23 and was eventually caught after the Antigua police launched a manhunt. Police in Dominica had charged Choksi with illegal entry into the country, following his escape from Antigua in his possible attempt to avoid extradition to India.In his complaint to the police commissioner in Antigua, Choksi had claimed that he was allegedly attacked by eight to ten men when he was on his way to meet Barbara Jabarica, with whom he claimed he has ‘friendly terms,’ according to a news report by ANI.A week ago on June 2, Priti Choksi had said that Choksi’s rumoured girlfriend was known to him and his other acquaintances. “The woman was known to my husband and to his other acquaintances. She walked with my husband periodically when she was visiting Antigua. From what I have understood from people who have met her, the woman shown on media channels is not the same woman that they knew as Barbara,” she had said following Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne had said that Choksi went on a ‘romantic trip’ to Dominica with his ‘girlfriend’ while he was caught.The Antigua government had also asked for the direct extradition of Choksi from Dominica to India, where he is accused in the Punjab National Bank fraud case worth ₹13,500.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barbara-jabarica-says-mehul-choksi-first-to-approach-and-befriend-her-101623259553003.html
09-06-2021||India||Minority affairs ministry to counter vaccine hesitancy among communities||The Union ministry of minority affairs has begun a pan-India campaign to tackle concerns and myths about the inoculation drive that have resulted in vaccine hesitancy among minority communities. According to an official aware of the details, a national level awareness campaign has been organised especially in areas that have a high percentage of minorities and where people have shown reluctance to take the vaccines to prevent the Covid-19 infection. “In some areas the ministry is relying on women’s self-help groups to drive away misconceptions about the vaccines. The ministry has also reached out to religious and social organisations to help remove doubts and fears about the vaccines,” said the official quoted above. More than 3.84 lakh women, who have been provided training under Nai Roushn scheme, and Women Self Help Groups associated with them have been running the campaign to create awareness about the Covid-19 pandemic and are now being roped in to create awareness about the benefits of the vaccine. Citing an example of areas with vaccine hesitancy, the official said administration in several districts of Uttar Pradesh such as Sultanpur, Amethi, Aligarh and Moradabad and in Haryana’s Mewat has reported reluctance towards vaccines based on dogmas, religious reasons and rumours. “In Moradabdad because of locals not turning up for vaccines, we found people from the cities showing up for inoculation. Since the administration is making efforts, vaccine hesitancy is slowly ebbing. It also helps that Islamic countries have said they won’t allow entry without vaccines. Even for performing Haj, pilgrims will need to be vaccinated and should not have been hospitalised six months prior to travel,” the official said. The official said in some areas such vaccine hesitancy was promoted by the statements of some opposition leaders who raised doubts about the Indian vaccines. “In Amethi and Rae Bareily some people said since the Congress leaders have not taken the vaccines, they too were skeptical of taking the shots,” the official said. The BJP has accused SP leader and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav of promoting vaccine hesitancy by dubbing the Indian vaccines as “BJP vaccines”. Union minister Prahlad Joshi told news agency ANI, “When we started vaccination in January, Congress leaders raised questions on vaccine efficacy. Now, they’re taking the vaccine. As per my knowledge, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi haven’t taken the vaccine. They don’t have confidence in the Indian vaccine.” The ministry is also using NGOs, engaged in running various healthcare programmes under the Garib Nawaz Self Employment Scheme, Seekho aur Kamao etc, to assist the administration in carrying out tests and spreading awareness about Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in rural areas. “The campaign is regularly being monitored by a task force comprising of senior officials of the ministry,” said the official. The ministry will also focus on training of health care workers. “In the past 2 years, we have provided health sector training to 1.12 lakh youths. These skilled and trained youths are working in various hospitals and other healthcare centres and assisting in the treatment of Covid-19 affected people,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/minority-affairs-ministry-to-counter-vaccine-hesitancy-among-communities-101623259749516.html

Around 24.46% of the country’s geographical area covered by forests and trees.However, the report released by New Delhi-based public research and advocacy group said the extent of vegetation in the Indo-Burma hotspot has been reduced from 2,373,057 square kilometre to a mere 118,653 square kilometre, pegging a loss of 95%.ALSO READ: Experts fear biodiversity loss in Andaman, Nicobar IslandsThe report, titled State of India’s Environment in Figures 2021, shows at least 25 species have also gone extinct in these hotspots. The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List monitors 1,212 animal species in India and have tagged 12% as endangered.“There is drama in numbers, especially when these numbers give you a trend on things getting better or worse. It is even more powerful when you can use the trend to understand the crisis, the challenge and the opportunity,” CSE director general Sunita Narain said.The CSE report points out that 16 states – including Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand – have witnessed a significant rise in number of forest fire alerts.“India has seen a drastic rise in forest fires since the start of 2021. As of May 1, the number of fire alerts recorded by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is 433,581. This is quite a jump, even though the official forest fire season of the country is from February to June. Forest fires are influenced by temperature and rainfall in the preceding monsoon. The year 2016, the hottest on record when India’s annual temperature rose 0.71°C above the annual average of 25°C, saw 541,135 forest fires -- the most in a decade,” the report read.ALSO READ: Oil palm push in the northeast may impact biodiversity, water table, say experts“At a time when we are witnessing an alarming fall in the timber and non-timber forest produce services in Indian forests -- implying overuse of resources -- climatic cycles are combining with other factors to result in a dramatic rise in forest fire alerts. We must learn to connect the dots,” said Richard Mahapatra, the managing editor of Down To Earth magazine published by the CSE.The report adds: “Rainfall during the 2015 monsoon was 765.8 mm, 14% less than the normal 880mm, as per the India Meteorological Department. In 2021, too, India sees unusually warm weather along with 8.7% surplus rainfall last monsoon that leaves adequate humidity for fires to spread.”India experienced warmer than usual winter, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons in 2020, which was also the eighth warmest year on record, with 2016 being the warmest, followed by 2009 and 2017. The annual mean land surface air temperature for India in 2020 was 25.78°C, which was 0.29°C above the 1981-2010 period average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/90-of-india-s-biodiversity-hotspots-lost-shows-new-statistical-analysis-101623258048532.html

Appreciate his insights on developments in the region and beyond. Thanked him for the support and solidarity in India’s fight against Covid.”Jaishankar embarked on a three-day visit to Kuwait on Wednesday, carrying a message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah on ways to boost bilateral ties. He is scheduled to travel from Kuwait to Kenya.Hours after Jaishankar’s stopover in Doha, senior Qatari officials held separate meetings with Khalilzad, the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, and a team of Taliban negotiators.Mutlaq bin Majed Al Qahtani, the Qatari foreign minister’s special envoy for counter-terrorism and mediation in conflict resolution, met Khalilzad and his delegation and discussed the “peace process in Afghanistan and ongoing talks in Doha between the Afghan parties”, Qatar News Agency (QNA) reported.Qahtani held a separate meeting with Sheikh Abdul Hakim, who was last year appointed the Taliban chief negotiator by the group’s chief Hibatullah Akhunzada last year. This meeting too reviewed the peace process in Afghanistan, QNA reported.Khalilzad and an US inter-agency delegation, including the National Security Council, department of defense and USAID, began a visit to Afghanistan, Qatar and the region on June 4 to give a boost to the stalled Afghan peace process amid the rapid drawdown of American forces in Afghanistan.The delegation will “underscore enduring US support for Afghanistan’s development and a political settlement that will end the war”, the state department said in a statement ahead of the visit. In Qatar, Khalilzad will “continue to encourage both sides to make tangible progress towards a political settlement that protects the gains of the last two decades”, the statement added.While in Kuwait, Jaishankar will thank the country’s leadership for supporting India’s response to a second wave of Coronavirus infections by supplying a large quantity of medical oxygen. This is his first visit to Kuwait as foreign minister and follows a trip to India by his Kuwaiti counterpart Ahmed Nasser Al-Mohammad Al-Sabah in March.Under an air and sea bridge arrangement, Indian Navy ships have transported 425 tonnes of liquid oxygen from Kuwaiti ports to India. Kuwait has supplied more than 5,000 oxygen cylinders, 66 oxygen concentrators, 11 ventilators and other materials such as medicines, oximeters, masks and gloves to India.Kuwait is among the largest suppliers of oil for India and also home to nearly 900,000 Indian expatriates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-minister-s-jaishankar-s-surprise-stopover-in-doha-to-meet-qatari-nsa-101623257829250.html
09-06-2021||India||Bangladeshis, Rohingyas involved in Bengal’s post-poll violence, says Suvendu Adhikari||Infiltrators from Bangladesh and Rohingyas from Myanmar are involved in post-poll violence in Bengal, alleged Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvendu Adhikari after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Wednesday. “I told Modi Ji about the atrocities BJP workers are facing in the state. As many as 25 women have been raped. Bangladeshis and Rohingyas are involved in these crimes. Thousands are homeless. At Ausgram (in East Burdwan district) 26 families are hiding in a jungle,” Ghosh, who is the leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly, told the media in Delhi. He was scheduled to meet Union home minister Amit Shah for the second consecutive day. The BJP has been alleging for a long time that Rohingya refugees were given shelter by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government but the ruling party always denied such claims. Adhikari said he will take part in the state-wide agitation that Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh announced on Tuesday after a meeting of state office bearers. “We will meet the President with our petition,” said Adhikari. After meeting Shah and BJP president JP Nadda on Tuesday, Adhikari said he personally feels that the situation in Bengal is much worse than what is required to enforce Article 356 but his party has not taken a formal stand on this issue. Under Article 356 of the Constitution of India, the Union government can take direct control of the state machinery if a state government is unable to function according to Constitutional provisions. Questions were raised about Adhikari’s absence at the office bearers’ meeting when Ghosh said he was not aware why Adhikari had been called to Delhi. “There are no differences between us. I am part of the decision taken by Ghosh. We will carry out agitations from June 23,” Adhikari said on Wednesday. During the day, three BJP Lok Sabha MPs from Bengal, Arjun Singh, Saumitra Khan and Nisith Pramanik flew to Delhi to meet national leaders regarding law and order situation in the state. “There is no rule of law. Police are not accepting complaints. On Sunday, when a man was murdered at Jagaddal in North 24 Parganas, some shops were looted in the local market but no action was taken,” said Singh, who is the local MP. Dismissing Adhikari’s allegation, Bengal cabinet minister Firhad Hakim said, “Adhikari is trying to save himself from the ire of BJP leaders. The BJP thought inducting him would automatically ensure its victory in the Bengal polls. Adhikari is now trying to pacify the party bosses.” Adhikari joined the BJP in December last year and defeated Mamata Banerjee in the recent assembly polls at Nandigram, the seat he held in East Midnapore district. His father and younger brother are TMC Lok Sabha MPs from the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladeshis-rohingyas-involved-in-bengal-s-post-poll-violence-says-suvendu-adhikari-101623255789083.html

We undertake many programmes as a party organisation, he will discuss that. He will hold meetings with the booth, mandals, and state party officials,” Tanavade said. Goa is expected to vote early next year before the 40-member assembly’s term expires in March.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said there was no rift.“There are no differences between me and the health minister. There is no misunderstanding. We may have different views on issues, but when it comes to the cabinet, when it comes to the government, when it comes to the state, it is one,” Sawant said. Sawant and Rane were once leaders of rival political parties before Vishwajit Rane crossed over from the Congress to the BJP in April 2017 and became health minister in the government led by Manohar Parrikar. Pramod Sawant went along with Rane when he became chief minister but the two are not believed to be on the best of terms.Their perceived differences widened when Covid-19 cases were rising in the state. Vishwajit Rane was seen to obliquely blame Sawant for not imposing restrictions in the state that led to a spike in Covid cases. When deaths linked to oxygen supply disruptions were reported at the state’s premier Goa Medical College and Hospital ran last month. Chief minister Pramod Sawant made it a point to emphasise that the problem wasn’t shortage of oxygen but ‘mismanagement’, a remark that was seen aimed at the health minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bl-santhosh-on-routine-goa-visit-amid-talk-of-rift-between-goa-cm-minister-101623253448853.html

09-06-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee’s new proposal to counter Centre is a union of state govts||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said that in a federal set-up there should be a union of state governments, which would unanimously take on the Centre if any state was harassed. “In a federal structure, there should be a union of state governments. If any state is harassed then other states would fight for it. Every chief minister (of non-NDA ruled states) should stick together. I would urge every opposition party to unite (against the BJP) to save democracy,” she said. The Bengal chief minister, who has extended her party’s support to the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s three controversial farm laws, met a delegation of farmer leaders led by Rakesh Tikait, at the secretariat during the day. “We are ready to support the ongoing farmers’ protest till the time the demands are not met. They (farmer leaders) have requested me to speak to other chief ministers (of non-NDA ruled states) so that together we could hold a virtual conference with the farmers. I will surely speak to the chief ministers so that we can send a unanimous letter. This would give them some strength before the Lok Sabha polls,” she said while renewing her demands that the Centre should withdraw the three farm laws. In a joint press conference held after the meeting, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader requested Banerjee to extend her support to the farmers’ protest. “We have urged Mamata Banerjee to turn West Bengal into a model state where farmers get maximum benefits by doing away with middlemen who siphon of all the profits. Other states may also follow the model. Farmers have been hit hard during the pandemic,” he said. The Trinamool Congress has recently announced that it will expand its footprint beyond West Bengal. Abhishek Banerjee, the party’s general secretary who also happens to be the chief minister’s nephew, had said on Monday that the TMC will come up with a national plan within a month. Taking a swipe at the Centre over its vaccination policy and the steep hike in fuel prices, the chief minister also said that it was not right on the Centre’s part to try to bulldoze the states every time in a federal structure. “The Prime Minister need not take credit for giving free vaccines. This is not BJP’s money. It is people’s money. Even the Supreme Court has directed the Centre to give more importance to states and the federal structure. But still the Centre hasn’t come up with any guidelines,” she said, while adding that the BJP had promised even before the Bihar assembly elections that the Centre would provide free vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-s-new-proposal-to-counter-centre-is-a-union-of-state-govts-101623252548683.html

The two new national parks are Dihing Patkai and Raimona. Assam already has five national parks—Kaziranga, Manas, Dibru-Saikhowa, Nameri and Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park. “With the new notifications, Assam will have the third highest numbers of national parks in the country after Madhya Pradesh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands,” Assam forest and environment minister Parimal Suklabaidya said. Located in Kokrajhar district of the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) in lower Assam, Raimona national park will be spread across 422 sq km. With Phipsoo wildlife sanctuary in Bhutan to its north, Buxa tiger reserve in West Bengal to its west and Manas national park in Assam to its east, Raimona is located in a 2300 sq km trans-boundary landscape which is essential for long-ranging animals like elephants and tigers. Raimona is home to elephants, tigers, golden langurs, clouded leopard, wild buffalo, spotted deer, over 150 species of butterflies, 170 species of birds including the white bellied heron and nearly 380 species of plants. “Conservation of this area will provide water security to more than 2 million people downstream in Kokrajhar and Dhubri districts, will open opportunities for community-based tourism and focused wildlife management,” said a state government release. Falling in Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts in upper Assam, the Dihing Patkai national park will be spread over 234 sq km. Known earlier as the Dihing Patkai rain forest, it used to have an area of 111 sq km and was considered the “last remaining stretches” of the Assam Valley tropical wet evergreen forests.

Its phase 3 trial data will be published in July, the company said, after which it will apply for full licensure.Covaxin versus CovishieldWhile the Centre has said that these two vaccines can not be compared as they are made differently, researchers have not stopped finding out the answer to the question: which vaccine is better between Covaxin and Covishield. A pre-print study, which is yet to peer-reviewed, has recently claimed that both the vaccines showed a good immune response after two doses. But Serum Institute of India's Covishield produced more antibodies than Covaxin.Bharat Biotech versus researcherOpposing the reporting of the study, Bharat Biotech's business development head Dr Raches Ella took to social media and said the study has its limitations.Dr Aswadhesh Kumar Singh, one of the researchers, pointed to the fact that the "whole country is getting vaccinated even without a preprint phase 3 result — lest forget published one".Brother, whole country is getting vaccinated even without a preprint phase 3 results - lest forget published one. We owe a sincere gratitude to Bharat Biotech but that doesn’t mean one should raise finger on others effort. Of course we will produce published results finally! 🙏🏽😊The company officially issued a statement on Wednesday against the study. "A recent comparative report on an evaluation of immunogenicity responses to spike protein after the first and second dose of Indian manufactured vaccines study had lots of flaws. The journal that stated the comparative report said more antibodies produced by Covishield than COVAXIN®[?]. This is not a peer-reviewed publication, nor do it a statistically and scientifically designed study. The study design and conduct reflect an ad hoc analysis, rather than a predetermined hypothesis," the company said.Phase 3 data to be out in JulyThe company on Wednesday said that the data will be out by July. First, the data will be submitted to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, followed by peer-reviewed journals. Then Bharat Biotech will apply for full licensure, the company said.So far, the vaccine's overall efficacy on 78 per cent and its efficacy against hospitalisation is 100 per cent.The 4th phase trials will be also be conducted to ensure that Covaxin met every rigorous standard, the company said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-row-bharat-biotech-says-it-will-conduct-phase-4-trial-of-covaxin-phase-3-data-to-be-out-in-july-101623243679048.html

According to reports, Nikhil has already filed for an annulment of his marriage with Nusrat, which Nusrat said was never legal in India. "I have never commented or will not comment anything on what she has said. The matter is subjudice. The civil suit in courts is in process. They are doing their job well," Nikhil told Hindustan Times.Amid rumours of Nikhil-Nusrat marriage falling apart, reports of the Trinamool MP dating actor-politician Yash Dasgupta started doing the rounds ahead of the West Bengal election. The rumours took a backseat after Yash's defeat in the election from Chanditala constituency by Trinamool candidate. A few days ago, reports claimed Nusrat and Yash are expecting a child.On Wednesday, the MP issued a statement and without taking any name, she clarified that she won't require a divorce as the marriage was never validated under the Special Marriage Act. In 2019, the duo tied the knot in Turkey as per Turkish Marriage Regulation. But in India for an interfaith marriage to accepted, it requires validation under the Special Marriage Act which, according to Nusrat, never happened. So, it was a live-in relationship, which ended a long time ago, she said.The duo was last seen together in October 2020.In her statement, Nusrat has accused Nikhil of withdrawing money from her bank accounts illegally, even after the separation. The MP also said her clothes, bags, accessories are still with Nikhil's family. Even all the family jewellery that was gifted to Nusrat by her parents, friends and other family members are "illegally" held back by Nikhil's family. "Being rich does not always give a man the right to act as a victim and belittle the woman alone in this society. I have made my own identity by my sheer hard work; thus I would not allow anyone not related to me to share the limelight or a title or followers, based on my identity," the MP said.After Nusrat's statement, social media was awash with reactions with some people pointing out that Nusrat's marital status in Parliament records is married and she also took the oath in the Lok Sabha as Nusrat Jahan Ruhi Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nikhil-jain-won-t-comment-on-trinamool-mp-nusrat-jahan-s-statement-explains-why-101623240036462.html

It also added that the government will be improving the automatic train protection mechanism in India by installing the collision avoidance systems in the trains for the safety of passengers. “Until now the railways were using optical fibres for communication but now this modern spectrum will bring radio communication to railways and with the help of such setup, real time communication can be established. This will increase safety to a great extent and will transform the railways greatly...,” Union minister Prakash Javadekar said, while addressing a press conference.He added that the signalling system for the trains is being renewed as well.Also Watch | Petrol in Delhi over ₹95/litre, above ₹100/litre in six statesJavadekar added that automatic train protection is also being strengthened in Indian railways by the introduction of collision avoiding systems.“The matter of pride for India is that these collision avoiding systems for railways have been designed by four Indian companies. This is a beautiful brainchild of the Make in India campaign,” he added.Javadekar said that both these decisions are aimed at increasing the safety of passengers and making more trains available. “By speeding up train signalling, more trains will be running on the tracks now,” he said.Defining a timeline for these projects, Javadekar said that all this work will be completed in the next five years. “Ninety-six per cent of total traffic in India runs on these 34,000-kilometre-long railways lines and [this is] where such communication and signalling set up will be installed over the next five years,” he said.He added that the total expected expenditure on these projects is around ₹25,000 crore.Meanwhile, referring to a subsidy scheme for fertiliser companies, Javadekar said that the Union government had decided to enhance the production of urea in the country, large quantities of which had to be otherwise imported earlier. Telangana-based fertiliser manufacturing firm Ramagundam Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited was granted the benefit of this subsidy scheme, which had ceased to exist in 2019. Javadekar said that the firm is projected to produce over 1,200,000 metric tons of urea annually.“This too is a step towards Aatmanirbhar Bharat as this factory will reduce the burden of urea import,” he said, adding the government was looking to establish more such factories through more subsidy schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4g-spectrum-for-indian-railways-gets-cabinet-nod-101623239227438.html

09-06-2021||India||Govt hikes MSP for kharif crops, skews them toward scarce items||The Union Cabinet has raised minimum support prices (MSP) of summer-sown crops, increasing them by 1.8% and 6.7%, in keeping with a policy to offer farmers at least 50% returns over the cost of cultivation, farm minister Narendra Singh Tomar said Wednesday.The new rates come amid ongoing protests by farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, who want the government to scrap three agricultural laws passed in September 2020 and offer a legal backing for MSPs. The MSPs announced Wednesday are geared toward nudging farmers to shift away from plentiful cereals, by setting higher prices for oilseeds and pulses, whose output and supply are relatively scarce. For instance, India imports up to two-thirds of its vegetable oil to meet domestic demand.“We have been saying all along that there should be no doubt over MSP. The MSP system has been there and will be there,” Tomar said. The new rates will offer returns of between 50% and 62% over cost of cultivation, he said.MSPs are federally-fixed floor prices for crops aimed at avoiding distress sale by farmers and signaling a benchmark rate for private traders.Also Read: Govt’s 7 years of NDA report to list govt’s achievementsThe agriculture minister said the government has not closed the doors on negotiations with protesting farm unions. “We are willing to talk and are committed to farmers’ welfare. We had 11 rounds of talks. We have appealed to the farmers to point out specific objections in the legislation. Neither any opposition leader in the house (Parliament) nor the protesting farmers have come up with any specific objection,” Tomar said. The government buys large quantities of cereals from farmers at MSP rates and distributes them to beneficiaries through the public distribution system at subsidized rates. This is primarily how farmers benefit from the MSP system.Also Read: Farm sector unscathed by 2nd Covid waveFarm economist KS Mani, a former faculty with The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, said he broadly agreed with the pricing differential between produce that are abundant and those in short supply. “The underlying aim is crop diversification. This will work if the government also buys oilseeds and pulses in sufficient quantities.” Among key crops, the MSP for paddy has been raised from ₹1868 to ₹1940 a quintal, a hike of 3%. The rates for coarse cereals jowar and bajra were hiked by ₹118 or to stand at ₹2738 and 2250, which translate to a raise of 21% and 5% respectively. The prices of urad, a lentil, has been increased sharply by ₹300 to stand at ₹6300 a quintal.The highest increase over the previous year was for sesamum, an oilseed, whose MSP was raised by ₹452 a quintal, to stand at ₹7307 a quintal, up from ₹6855.The next largest increase was for two lentils, tur and urad, whose MSPs were increased by ₹300 a quintal each. Prices of groundnut and nigerseed have been increased by ₹275 per quintal and ₹235 a quintal respectively. In all, prices were raised by up to 62%.To fix MSP, the government uses a measure of cost, called A2 + FL, which refers to the cost of cultivation plus the value of family labour.Farmers have been demanding a legal guarantee for MSP that is calculated using a broader and more comprehensive measure of costs called C2, which includes the assumed cost of capital invested, including machinery, and rent on land.“Across crops, the increase in absolute numbers doesn’t even match the inflation rate,” said Kavitha Kuruganti, a farm activist.“The government is doing its usual trickery on farmers. First, they did not use the C2 cost concept and used A2+FL. In maize, the increase is as low as ₹20 per quintal, compared to last year. MSPs are meaningless if the government cannot ensure that all farmers get at least this price. That is where the demand for a legal guarantee comes in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-hikes-msp-for-various-kharif-or-summer-sown-crops-by-up-to-62-101623236047457.html

Instead, she welcomes 5G technology and her petition was only to seek the government's certification that 5G is safe, she said in the video. "In the hullabaloo of the past few days, I could not hear myself and the main message got lost," she said."We are not against 5G. We are welcoming it. Please bring 5G. All we are asking is that the authorities should certify 5G safe. That's what we are saying... that please publish your research in the public domain.

In the plea, filed by Juhi, Veeresh Malik and Teena Vachani, it was said that if the 5G technology comes to fruition, no person, animal, bird, insect and plant on earth will be able to avoid exposure.The Delhi high court on June 4 dismissed the plea and slapped a fine of 20 lakh on Juhi Chawla and the co-petitioners and said that the plea was only for publicity. The court noted that this plea was a "textbook case of how not to draft a plaint". That the actor shared the hearing link on her social media account, which led to several disruptions on the day she joined the hearing, also proves that it was for popularity, the court noted.After the petition was dismissed, the Cellular Operators' Association of India said that 5G in India is safe.

An inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152 is currently rolled out under the national COVID-19 vaccination program in India. The neutralization potential of the BBV152 has been already studied with the B.1, B.1.1.7, B.1.1.28.2, B.1.617.1 and found to be effective against these variants,” the study further added.In order to conduct the evaluation of how Covaxin performs against these variants, the researchers at ICMR-NIV collected sera from 20 recovered patients and 17 people who had received the Covaxin Dose number 2, 28 days earlier.ICMR-NIV isolates another 'variant of interest'Earlier on Tuesday, scientists at the ICMR-NIV said that they have isolated the B.1.1.28.2 variant of SARS-CoV-2. The researchers believe that immunisation with Covaxin will help individuals against this variant which showed an increased disease severity when tested in hamsters.The World Health Organisation (WHO) classified the variant as a ‘variant of interest’ and the researchers from ICMR-NIV Pune also highlighted that there is need for screening the current vaccines for their efficacy against this variant. The variant was isolated from two travellers in December and January who returned from the UK and Brazil respectively.These two samples of B.1.1.28.2 variant are the only ones of its kind isolated by Indian labs so far, according to a report by news agency PTI. Researchers highlighted that this variant induced body weight loss, viral reproduction in the respiratory tract, lung lesions, and caused severe lung disease in the hamsters which were tested. Researchers also pointed out that the variant currently does not pose a public health problem for the nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-effective-in-neutralising-delta-beta-variants-of-covid-19-study-101623233592645.html

With this, another high-profile young Congress leader has left the party.Congress insiders and people close to Jitin Prasada said he was increasingly unhappy with the state of affairs in Uttar Pradesh, where assembly polls are due next year, and particularly Shahjahanpur, his home turf. “He told us that he was hardly consulted for UP [Uttar Pradesh] matters and what irked him was the change of guard in the Shahjahanpur district Congress unit without his knowledge,” said a person aware of the matter, pleading anonymity.Also Read | Congress leader Jitin Prasada joins BJP, says ruling party best suited to serve peopleA leader, who worked closely with Jitin Prasada, said: “He would often allege that former SP (Samajwadi Party) leaders who joined the Congress in Shahjahanpur were given more importance than people who served the party for years.”Jitin Prasada, who was a Union minister in the previous Congress-led government, won Lok Sabha elections in 2004 and 2009. He lost the 2014 and 2019 elections while continuing to be Congress’s prominent Brahmin face in Uttar Pradesh. He was also among the 23 Congress leaders who wrote to Sonia Gandhi last year demanding sweeping changes in the party’s functioning.Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who worked with Jitin Prasada closely during the March-April Bengal polls, said he knew the latter as a good person. “He was a prominent Brahmin face for our party.

He has left the party when Gandhi is expected to return to the helm in a few months. Jitin Prasada’s exit comes months ahead of the party’s organisational election. He focused on West Bengal as the in-charge of the party in the state. But there too, he hardly campaigned and virtually had no say in the matters related to alliances, campaign, and poll management.“He held a series of meetings in Delhi to strategise the poll campaign and pick an agency run it. Eventually, all his plans gathered dust as Bengal veterans of the party started controlling everything,” said another Congress leader.In 2020, another prominent young leader, Jyotiraditya Scindia, left the Congress to join the BJP.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who also defected to the BJP from Congress, welcomed Jitin Prasada to his party. “The wrecked and rudderless ‘Titanic’ continues to sink!

He called his move a new chapter in his political life and a well-thought-out decision. “Our family has been associated with the Congress for three generations, but during the last 8-10 years, I felt that if there is any national party, it is the BJP,” he said. Prasada, who earlier met Union home minister Amit Shah, added other parties have been reduced to individuals or regional entities. He said if a party cannot be of help to people, then there is no point in continuing with it.Union minister Piyush Goyal praised Prasada for continuing to help the people of his constituency despite no longer being their representative in Parliament. Prasada, a two-time Congress member of Parliament, lost the 2014 elections to BJP’s Rekha Sharma.Also Read | Congress to hold nationwide protest on June 11 against fuel price hikeThere was speculation about the possibility of Prasada joining the BJP ahead of the 2019 elections. But he dismissed it then saying he would not address “hypothetical questions” about crossing over to the BJP.Prasada, a Brahmin, hit the headlines in 2019 when he claimed his community was facing persecution and being largely ignored by the Yogi Adityanath-led government in Uttar Pradesh. He also started a Brahma Chetna Samvaad to reach out to the community and offer a platform to give voice to the community’s aspirations.Brahmins account for around 13% of Uttar Pradesh’s voters and are considered electorally influential in the state. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which has a strong cadre drawn from the Dalit communities, and Samajwadi Party have also reached out to Brahmins. In 2007, of BSP’s 206 lawmakers, 20 were Brahmins. The party also altered its poll slogan to Haathi nahi, Ganesh hai; Brahama, Vishnu, Mahesh hai to woo the so-called upper castes.BSP chief Mayawati and the Samajwadi Party have made overtures towards the Brahmins by promising grand statues of Lord Parshuram ahead of the polls due in the state next year.Last year, Congress leader Kapil Sibal, who was among the signatories to a letter to party chief Sonia Gandhi seeking organisational changes, alleged Prasada was being targeted in Uttar Pradesh and called it unfortunate. Prasada was also a signatory to the letter. He did not find a place in Congress’s committees formed for the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. In 2020, the Lakhimpur Kheri district Congress unit passed a resolution seeking action against Prasada for alleged anti-Gandhi family stance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-jitin-prasada-joins-bjp-101623229251490.html

09-06-2021||India||Nusrat Jahan says her marriage was not valid in India, 'No comment,' says Nikhil Jain||Trinamool MP Nusrat Jahan on Wednesday issued a statement saying her marriage with Nikhil Jain was never valid as an interfaith marriage in India requires validation under the Special Marriage Act, which never happened. As the marriage was not legal, valid and tenable, there is no question of divorce, she clarified. "Our separation happened long back, but I did not speak about it as I intended to keep my private life to myself," the Basirhat MP said.Actor-turned-politician Nusrat Jahan got married to businessman Nikhil Jain in Bodrum of Turkey in 2019 after she made her political debut, winning the Lok Sabha Elections in the same year. A reception was also held in Kolkata which chief minister Mamata Banerjee attended. The wedding ceremony was done as per Turkish Marriage Regulation, the MP clarified.Of late, speculations of a rift in the marriage have been rife as reports claimed Nusrat started dating fellow actor-politician Yash Dasgupta, who was a BJP candidate in the 2021 election in Bengal. A few days ago, rumours of Nusrat expecting Yash's child started doing the rounds in media and on various social media platforms to which writer Taslima Nasreen commented in a long Facebook post, where she said if the rumour is true, then Nusrat should get divorced from Nikhil.Nusrat Jahan, TMC MP, dances as husband plays ‘dhaak’ on Durga AshtamiWhile Nusrat's statement clarifies her stance on the "marriage", without naming Nikhil, she accused him of mishandling her money. "The one who claims to be “rich” and “been used by me” has been taking money from my account by accessing my bank accounts illegally and by illegitimate means at odd hours of the night, even post-separation. I have already taken this up with the concerned banking authority and a police complaint shall be filed shortly. In the past, details of all family accounts were handed over to him, upon his requests and none of me or my family members was aware of any instructions given to the bank via our accounts. He has also been mishandling my funds from various accounts without my knowledge and consent. I am still battling it out with the bank & if need be, would release proof of the same," the statement read. The MP also alleged that his family members have illegally held back her assets, the jewellery given to her by her patents."I would never speak up about my personal life or anyone I am not related to. Thus, people who call themselves “normal people” must not entertain anything which is not related to them," Nusrat said.Nikhil Jain is a Kolkata-baed businessman and the duo met in Kolkata during an event, a year before they got married. Recently, as the rumours of Nusrat's pregnancy spread, some news channels contacted Nikhil who said he was not aware of Nusrat's pregnancy as they were not in contact for many months.On being asked to comment on Nusrat's statement, Nikhil Jain on Wednesday said the matter is subjudice. "I have never commented or will not comment anything on what she has said. The matter is subjudice in court. The civil suit in courts is in process. They are doing their job well," Nikhil told Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trinamool-mp-nusrat-jahan-says-marriage-with-nikhil-jain-was-never-valid-101623224282807.html

09-06-2021||India||Same-sex love: The family abuse that led to the Madras HC order||Two university students, whose plea for police protection in the Madras high court (HC) resulted in a landmark order on Monday, suffered months of family harassment and abuse and even a concerted violent bid before approaching the judiciary, conversations with the petitioners, lawyers and their activists revealed.The two women – aged 20 and 22 — met in 2019 and fell in love but battled fierce disapproval from their conservative families who lived in the rural parts of Tamil Nadu’s Madurai district. Facing increasing strictures, they ran away from home in February 9 this year to Chennai.In Chennai, they tried to live independently and reached out to lawyers to file a petition in the high court. But back in Madurai, both sets of families filed missing person FIRs in two separate police stations, prompting policemen to travel to Chennai to track them down.Also Read | When a judge learns — and teaches“This is a common tactic used by families to force queer people to come back, and intimidate them,” said Manuraj S, the petitioners’ lawyer.The family response Things came to a head in the second week of March, when both sets of parents, along with roughly 10 policemen showed up in cars in the locality where the two women were living. “They caught hold of the women and threatened them to go back,” said Manuraj.After a heated altercation, the women escaped and approached the International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care’s (PCVC) safe home in Chennai. But despite the bitterness, the petitioners said they are ready to stay with their families if accepted with dignity and tolerance.“We are ready to live with our parents but if only they accept us and our love and feelings,” said the 22-year-old petitioner, who declined to be named because her safety continues to be a concern. “We have been insulted by everyone but now we need to grow and succeed in life, and live our life in front of everyone,” she added.But such reconciliation may be difficult because the court-mandated counselling failed to break any ice with the parents.Psychologist Vidya Dinakaran, who counselled the families, found that both sets of parents felt a great amount of shame, fear and social disdain upon them because of their daughter’s same-sex relationship.“Both parents felt let down that their daughters have not paid heed to their sentiments and belief. Both parents expressed concern over the safety, security and future of their children. However, they also expressed their belief that their daughter’s homosexual relationship would cause damage to their future,” the court order read.“Among the queer and trans people we work with, many want families to not cut them off, but eventual reconciliation is not possible because the parents refuse to see same-sex relationships as anything but abnormal and fear that it will isolate them from immediate social circles and bring shame,” said Swetha Shankar, director of client services at PCVC.During the court hearings, the parents met the women on two separate occasions but without any success. “It was very emotional, they were trying to change our minds, but we were strong in our love,” said the petitioner.Where prejudice collides with law Such predicament is common for queer people in India, who continue to live in fear of social censure and violence despite the decriminalization of homosexuality by the Supreme Court three years ago. Since 2018, same-sex couples have approached high courts in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Bengal, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan, seeking protection from their families.In all cases, the courts have sided with the couples. But this hasn’t always meant the end of hardships for couples.Rekha Bairwa knows it only too well.The 24-year-old Dalit woman from Rajasthan’s Dausa district approached the high court in February 2019 to seek protection for herself and her partner, Usha Bai Mahavar. Bairwa and Mahavar met six years before in their native village, Gudha Ashikpura, and slowly fell for each other.After the apex court struck down Section 377, they went to a local temple and got married. Almost immediately, they started receiving threats from both families and local families. Both their relatives warned that they would be killed for their transgression, and the local police refused to interfere into what it saw as a family matter.When their petition came up on February 26, justice Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia noted that both the women were adults and asked the police to provide protection. “The case was a landmark for us too because we had never argued such a unique case. The women were very happy with the order,” said Bhim Sain Bairwa, their lawyer.But two years on, little has changed for the Dalit women. Bairwa and Mahavar are still apart and find no way to live together due to social censure and family hostility. They are not financially sound enough to run away.“We see each other once in a while, whenever I can find time from my NREGS shifts. Some villagers call us slurs and abuse me when I go out; they are forcing Usha to marry, but we still love each other,” said Bairwa over phone.Two thousand kilometres away, the two women petitioners are aware that their fight isn’t over. Manuraj said they are still worried about their protection and safety, and the women haven’t left the safe house yet. But they have big dreams: of jobs and a home together. “We want to...live our life in front of everyone. And help others like us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/samesex-love-the-family-abuse-that-led-to-the-madras-hc-order-101623223971438.html
09-06-2021||India||'New chapter of my political life': Congress leader Jitin Prasada joins BJP||Congress leader Jitin Prasada on Wednesday joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in New Delhi in presence of Union minister Piyush Goyal.The development came shortly after BJP spokesperson and Uttarakhand MP Anil Baluni announced the "joining of an eminent personality" into the party's fold on micro-blogging site Twitter.Terming his exit from Congress and induction in BJP as a fresh chapter, Prasada said that there is only one national party in India. "In the last 8-10 years, I have felt that if there is one party that is truly national, it is the BJP. The other parties are regional but this is a national party," Prasada said, addressing the media at BJP headquarters.Prasada said that his decision to leave the Congress comes after a lot of deliberation, adding that his connection with the party spans three generations."The question today is not which party I am leaving, or which party am I coming from. I have joined BJP today with the intention of contributing to the new India that PM Modi is building," the former Union minister said.Alleging that he was not allowed to work in Congress, Prasada said, "I felt that what is the relevance of staying in a party if you cannot work for your people or protect their interests."I felt I was unable to do that at Congress. I thank people in Congress who blessed me all these years but now I will work as a dedicated BJP worker," Prasada said.Before switching to the saffron party, Prasada reached Union minister Piyush Goyal’s residence in Delhi and met him.The 47-year-old, a former Union minister, was among the signatory dissenter in the Congress party who sent the letter to high command seeking an active and full-time party president. Prasada is also a special invitee to the Congress Working Committee (CWC).After Prasada dissented, the Lakhimpur Kheri District Congress reportedly passed a resolution demanding action against him, a leader from Uttar Pradesh, and accused his family of being against the Gandhi family. Jitender Prasada, the father of Jitin, had also unsuccessfully contested for the post of Congress president against Sonia Gandhi in the past, the district Congress committee reportedly said.Prasada's last assignment was to handle the West Bengal elections where the Congress performed poorly. His party has set up a committee to look into the reasons behind this loss, however, the Bengal post-mortem is pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-jitin-prasada-set-to-join-bjp-in-delhi-101623221085530.html

The water levels are expected to rise because of the monsoon and the spring tides linked to the new and full moon on June 11 and June 25 respectively.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has directed the district administration of South 24 Parganas to carry out the evacuations from the low-lying areas of Mousuni and Sagar islands before the tides hit.A state irrigation department official said while embankments have been breached in around 317 places, around 50% of them could be plugged. “A stretch of 7.5 km in Mousuni and Sagar islands cannot be repaired till July-end. The water during the tides could gush in through these breaches. Hence people need to be evacuated,” said the official, requesting anonymity.The state undertook one of the biggest evacuations drives ahead of cyclone Yaas, which hit the neighbouring Odisha on May 26, and evacuated around 1.5 million people to 14,000 relief camps.Also Read | Suvendu Adhikari meets PM Modi, a day after meeting Shah, NaddaAs the water levels have receded, people are returning to their homes to reconstruct them. But an area under over 60 village panchayats in 14 blocks in the coastal districts and Sunderbans are still inundated.“Over and above this if the river and sea waters gush in, because of the monsoon and spring tides of the new moon and full moon on June 11 and June 25, then once again the villages would get flooded,” said an official of the state disaster management department.The tidal height at Sagar may reach up to 5.67m on the morning of June 25. During a normal high tide, the water level rises up to around 4.5m.The water levels during spring tides (on the new moon and full moon) remain at least 1m-1.5m higher than the daily high tide level. Cyclone Yaas triggered a storm surge that was 2m-4m high over and above the spring tide level.“We have suffered more damage this time because of the inundation and flooding than the damage caused by cyclone Amphan in May 2020,” Banerjee said at a review meeting last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-to-evacuate-20k-people-ahead-of-new-moon-full-moon-tides-101623222891216.html

The deal has been closed to supply at least 750 Covid-19 vaccine freezers to various hospitals and institutions across the country; 500 of these being specifically for Sputnik V. Dr Reddy’s earlier tied up with the Russian Direct Investment Fund that markets Sputnik V globally, to distribute first 250 million doses of the vaccine.On May 14, Dr Reddy’s announced a limited pilot soft launch of the Sputnik V vaccine in India, ahead of the commercial launch later in June to test, among other things, cold chain facilities for storage. The freezer plays a critical role in the safety of vaccine and its potency. Sputnik V vaccine requires a temperature of -18°C to remain stable and potent. Also Read | India Covid-19 tally up by 92,596 fresh infections, 2219 new deaths recordedAccording to Rockwell, it develops freezers as per the WHO PQS (World Health Organisation - Performance, Quality and Safety) standard, and those can handle various harsh usage conditions, in rural locations too, and maintain desired temperature range, thus breaking the vaccine cold chain hurdle. “This is a huge endorsement for our Covid-19 vaccine freezer. Our technology ensures that Sputnik V’s storage management at vaccine centres meets the stringent refrigeration standards set forth by Sputnik V manufacturers,” said Ashok Gupta, managing director, Rockwell Industries Ltd. In addition, Rockwell will provide end-to-end logistics and after sales service support for the vaccine freezers across India “Rockwell is working closely with Dr. Reddy’s to develop & provide wireless IOT based controllers and data loggers which can give access to real time data of temperature and performance for the Vaccine Freezers assuring the vaccine storage conditions in each location across the country” said Prateek Gupta, director Rockwell Industries Ltd. Many hospitals, such as AIG Hospitals, Apollo, Omega and Care Hospitals, are already using these vaccine freezers for storage and many more hospitals and institutions are likely to do so in coming weeks as the Sputnik V vaccine is launched commercially in India. “We have a capacity to manufacture about 1,000 machines per day. We are in the process of exporting our Vaccine Freezers to various developed countries including an initial pilot deal with Japan,” added Prateek.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dr-reddy-s-ties-up-with-rockwell-for-750-freezers-to-store-sputnik-v-vaccine-101623222471454.html

09-06-2021||India||Outbreaks originating in big cities likely to spread faster across nation: Paper||Distance is not a good predictor of the infection spread with outbreaks in bigger cities such as Delhi and Mumbai likely to affect Bengaluru in just 2.38 days while those in a closer place like Tirupati are likely to reach there in 5.06 days, according to a model developed by researchers at Pune’s Indian Institute of Science, Education, and Research. The model is part of a paper, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, and is based on mapping of air, train, and road travel patterns from cities with over 10,00,00 population.Most of the models to date have used air travel as an indicator for the infection spread. But in the Indian context, other modes of travel are equally important as a significant proportion of the population travels by trains.Also Read | India must procure vaccines in full measure to keep children safe: Sisodia“Remarkably, even in a heterogeneous country like India, where air travel is by far the least popular mode of transport, accounting for less than 1% of all mobility, the linearity holds good,” says the paper. The paper explains that this is because air transport has the largest reach.“If only the mobility by air is considered with Bangalore (Bengaluru) as an outbreak city, then even the farthest cities like Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai display high hazard values. In comparison, if train mobility alone is considered, most of the high hazard cities in the Top-10 list are located within south India. It must be noted that cities like Mumbai and Delhi would still have significant hazard values, but they do not figure in the Top-10 list,” the paper says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/outbreaks-originating-in-big-cities-likely-to-spread-faster-across-nation-paper-101623218750965.html
09-06-2021||India||Low-income frontline workers burned by rising fuel prices||Rizwanudeen, a 37-year old worker who delivers food in the southern Indian city of Chennai, struggles to pay his rent and loan instalments at the end of every month as he has been hit by the double whammy of higher fuel prices and fewer food orders.Millions of weekly wage earners like Rizwanudeen who make their living ferrying goods or people throughout India have been hit hard by record high fuel prices which are among the highest in Asia, having risen by a third in the 15 months since the coronavirus first struck the country.The average cost of a litre of gasoline in Mumbai has risen above 100 rupees ($1.37) this month, 50 to 70% more than in Bangkok, Hanoi and Manila. State and federal taxes, which have doubled since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, account for more than 60% of India's retail fuel price.With the federal government facing ballooning healthcare costs tied to its ongoing battle with Covid-19, and committed to vast farm and other subsidies, a finance ministry official said there was little scope for a meaningful tax cut that might ease the pain on low earners."I used to spend 1,500 rupees ($20.58) a week on petrol before the pandemic, now I spend 2,000 rupees. I am already earning less due to fewer orders due to lockdowns," Rizwanudeen lamented, saying a third of his earnings went on fuel.For an Indian earning the average national wage, a litre of gasoline would take up a quarter of their daily income, according to Reuters calculations. Federal government fuel tax revenues have risen 80% to 2.55 trillion rupees over six years ending 2019/20, P.T.R. Palanivel Thiagarajan, the finance minister of southern Tamil Nadu state said in a meeting on taxes in May.But tax revenues shared with the states have declined by over 200 billion rupees over that period, he added, echoing a common gripe among state officials over fuel tax allocations.With total federal tax collections hit by the industrial slowdown caused by coronavirus-induced lockdowns, New Delhi has been reluctant to lower fuel taxes, even after oil prices collapsed to multi-year lows last year.State authorities, which have faced soaring healthcare costs this year due to the pandemic, have blamed the federal levies for the higher prices. The federal government in turn has said it would only cut taxes if states-level taxes are cut.INFLATION WARNINGSDespite the standoff over who should move first to lower tax rates, the country's central bank governor Shaktikanta Das acknowledged last week that surging fuel prices posed a threat to the broader economy and required coordinated action by central and state governments.His warnings came after India's wholesale price index surged 10.49% year-on year in April.Further key cost increases are on the way. Rental rates of trucks, which deliver everything from perishable produce to machine parts in India, could rise by 10% this month on the back of higher fuel costs, said SP Singh, senior fellow at Indian Foundation of Transport Research & Training."In May, rentals declined as truckers saddled with monthly instalments for vehicle purchases were absorbing fuel prices in the absence of business. Now, as lockdowns are easing, freight rates are firming up," Singh said.RBI Governor Das also said that while federal and state governments may be inclined to tackle high fuel prices, their options may be limited by their already-tattered budgets.For Selva Murugan, a 35-year old former driver around Chennai for car service Ola, the damage has already been done."I was able to pay my loan dues when diesel cost about 65 rupees a litre. After that, I started feeling the crunch and around the time it touched 75 rupees I decided to sell my car," Murugan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lowincome-frontline-workers-burned-by-rising-fuel-prices-101623217421137.html

He also stressed on the need to improve paediatric healthcare ahead of a possible third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The second Covid-19 wave is more or less under control in Odisha with cases declining by 0.5- 1% daily.Patnaik reviewed the Covid situation in the state on Tuesday evening and asked the health department to create separate paediatric healthcare wings at existing Covid hospitals keeping in mind that isolation of paediatric Covid-19 cases was not possible in general wards. All district hospitals and sub divisional hospitals have been asked to earmark 10 beds for isolating suspected paediatric Covid cases.Of the 10,736 general beds and 4,072 ICU (intensive care unit) and HDU (high dependency unit) beds in Covid hospitals, at least 15% beds will be reserved for paediatric cases with the aim to make at least 2,850 general beds and 150 ICU beds available anticipating 10,000 daily infections in the third wave, as per the projections made by a government appointed task force.The government said it will also train 1,114 doctors and 1,036 nurses in paediatric Covid care. Currently, there are 454 paediatric specialists employed with the state government apart from 94 doctors, who are pursuing post graduate studies in paediatrics.The government also discussed modalities of lifting the lockdown from districts with low Covid test positivity rate (TPR) after June 17. Though the daily TPR in the state has climbed down to 8.5%, the weekly TPR continued to be high in at least 17 districts with Bhadrak’s TPR at 31.83%. Five districts including Bolangir reported TPR of less than 5%.Odisha’s director of Health Services Dr Bijay Kumar Mohapatra said if the trend of 0.5% to 1% daily fall continues, then the TPR would drop below 5% in 7 to 8 days.On the grim side, the daily Covid-19 fatality count reached 45 on Tuesday, the highest so far.“Many patients are admitted in the ICUs and are on ventilators. The recovery rate of patients on ventilators is very low and that is the reason for [the] rising [number of] fatalities,” said Mohapatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-plans-to-vaccinate-3-lakh-persons-a-day-ahead-of-3rd-covid-wave-101623217910370.html

At least 10 grocery shop owners have agreed to offer a 5% discount on the purchase of groceries. As some vaccine hesitancy still persists, we hope this would lead to community participation in [the] vaccination drive,” Manoranjan Sahu, the executive officer of Hinjili Municipal Council, said.Several local administrators are coming up with innovative ideas to break vaccine hesitancy, which is proving to be a big hindrance in the fight against Covid-19, especially in rural areas. A district collector in Arunachal Pradesh is currently giving out 20kgs of rice to residents if they come forward to get vaccinated. Information drives are also being carried out across the country to counter rumours and falsities that deter people from getting vaccinated.Sahu, however, clarified that the civic body will not compensate shop keepers for any losses incurred in the process. “It is part of an initiative of community participation to boost the vaccination drive against Covid-19,” Sahu said.In Ganjam district, around 5 lakh residents above 45-years of age have taken the first dose of Covid vaccine while 1.06 lakh have taken both the doses. In Odisha, 8.5 million doses have been given so far including more than 6.91 million first doses and more than 1.59 million second doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/traders-in-odisha-town-offer-5-discount-on-groceries-to-fully-vaccinated-people-101623216950901.html

"In Madhya Pradesh, BJP has a permanent government and there is no chance of any change in the leadership," the agriculture minister was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.When asked about the comments being made by some Congress politicians about leadership change in the state over alleged Covid-19 mismanagement, Tomar said, "There is a BJP government in MP and it will decide who will be its chief minister. The party has already decided that Chouhan is a chief minister...Congress has no right to talk about the BJP's CM," the news agency further quoted the central minister as saying."Madhya Pradesh government is handling the Covid-19 situation properly," he added.Earlier on Monday, BJP's general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya rejected the rumours and said Madhya Pradesh will continue to run under the leadership of Chouhan.The BJP took over Madhya Pradesh in March 2020 under Chouhan's leadership after the Congress government led by Kamal Nath collapsed.A series of meetings among senior BJP leaders including the one between Vijayvargiya and state home minister Narottam Mishra led to speculation about the change in leadership i Madhya Pradesh which battled the worst wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.However, after nearly two months, the situation in Madhya Pradesh seems to be improving as the state maintained a positivity rate of less than 1% for the last seven consecutive days. Experts have said that the rate of Covid-19 infection has come down due to the lockdown and people's cooperation.On Tuesday, Madhya Pradesh reported 535 Covid-19 cases and 36 deaths, taking the state's tally to 7,86,302 and the toll to 8,405, the health department said.

09-06-2021||India||Govt to digitally integrate PDS granaries across country||The Union government is likely to begin work on a new, centralised system of food storage, digitally integrating state-run granaries and silos across the country, which store and distribute subsidised cereals to nearly 800 million beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act, according to officials of the food ministry.The need for a plan to integrate and technologically upgrade grain storage was revealed by Union food minister Piyush Goyal during a review on Tuesday.The Food Corporation of India (FCI), the country’s main grain handling agency, is the world’s largest stockholder of foodgrains.The FCI, which buys grain from farmers at a state-set guaranteed price, has bought a record 41.3 million tonne of winter-sown wheat so far in the financial year 2021-22, an increase of 12.3%. The food agency also bought 80 million tonne of paddy during 2020-21.Ever-increasing procurement stocks in government-run granaries have posed storage problems in the world’s largest wheat producer after China. Most of the stock is stored in a covered-and-plinth system, which refers to covered storage on raised platforms in godowns. These are frequently fumigated.Also Read | Foodgrain stock highest since 2016: Govt dataUnder the procurement system, the government buys foodgrains from farmers at assured prices and distributes it at subsidised prices to the poor, selling wheat and rice at ₹2 and ₹3 a kg respectively.However, India has fewer modern silos, which are state-of-the storage highly secure facilities that prevent rotting or contamination. According to official data, not more than 0.006% of stored food goes waste in storage, which officials say is well within accepted norms.“Although in percentage terms, this appears small, the absolute amount can be worth a lot,” said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.In the review meeting, the Union food minister asked key policymakers and officials to come up with a “master plan” for storage facilities and land.“Environment should be created for boosting public-private partnerships and investment,” a statement quoted the minister as saying.The minister called for a “single, technologically modern storage management infrastructure”. He said that they must think in terms of convergence and aggregation of all storage infrastructure in the country.Representatives of the ministry of food processing industries said the ministry was working with the private sector on 228 pre-cooling and chilled storage projects for perishable farm commodities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-digitally-integrate-pds-granaries-across-country-101623212810802.html

According to a person aware of the matter, at least 84 master trainers have been trained for the purpose and more ITI students will be identified for taking over the running and maintenance of these plants at the district levels.In May, the Union health and family welfare ministry asked all states and private hospitals, where the PSA oxygen plants will be set up, to ensure that they have trained personnel to handle their operations.The Prime Minister’s Office in April announced the allocation of funds from the PM-Cares Fund for 551 PSA medical oxygen generation plants to augment the availability of oxygen to hospitals. The new plants are in addition to the earlier sanctioned 162 plants. They will be set up in government hospitals at district headquarters.Also Read | India Covid-19 tally up by 92,596 fresh infections, 2,219 new deaths recordedA leakage at a storage plant in a civic hospital in Maharashtra’s Nashik in April that killed 22 patients following an interruption in the supply of oxygen highlighted the need to have trained personnel. A similar tragedy in Maharashtra’s Parbhani district was prevented after trained staff managed to shift 14 patients on oxygen support to another hospital when the supply was disrupted by leakage in the pipeline. The instances of leakage coincided with a shortage of medical oxygen when the second Covid-19 wave overwhelmed the country’s healthcare system.“The health ministry has issued instructions that PSA plants should be operated by trained technical manpower. Each hospital had to identify at least 2 to 3 people who are well trained in the operation of the PSA plant and depute them for operating these. The states and Union territories were asked to identify up to 5 master trainers who could in turn train people for employment at the district and hospital level. The skill development ministry... has trained master trainers in collaboration with IIT [Indian Institute of Technology] Kanpur and Naval Dock, Vishakhapatnam...,” said the person, requesting anonymity.Hospitals have also been asked to ensure bedside cylinders for non-critical patients. The ministry will also train staff in the use of concentrators and oxygen cylinders for use in hospitals as well as for home care.“The PSA plant operators will be trained to handle routine maintenance aspects and minor faults such as electrical or technical problems so that they can fix the problems on-site,” the person said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-train-iti-grads-to-run-maintain-oxygen-plants-at-hospitals-101623212210602.html

Choksi, wanted in a major banking fraud in India, claimed earlier this week that his "friend" Barbara Jabarica was instrumental in his abduction from Antigua and filed a police complaint in this regard. Days after the allegation was raised, Jabarica has now come forward with her statement, debunking Choksi's claims, and clarifying her position.Also Read: Mehul Choksi names mystery woman, abductors; claims he was told an Indian politician will meet himIn an interview with news agency ANI, Barbara Jabarica said that it was "impossible" to kidnap anyone in the Jolly Harbour area in Antigua and Barbuda. She clarified that Choksi had introduced himself to her with a fake name when she met him while staying at a rented accommodation near his residence."No one contacted me. There was no sign of abduction. I said this in other interviews, for people who know the Jolly Harbour area, it's impossible to kidnap anyone there. It's the safest place and in a family area," Barbara Jabarica told ANI when asked if any other Indians, besides Mehul Choksi, was in touch with her.#WATCH | I made this clear in a few interviews that I wasn't his (Mehul Choksi_ girlfriend & he's not my sugar daddy or anything like that.

He introduced himself as Raj. Between August to April, he was always texting me but I used to reply to him once a month," she said. "Then closer to date, like April-May this year, we had weekly conversations. We conversed about opportunities to do business together. When I was on the island at that time, we used to have daily conversations," she added.Clarifying her position, Barbara Jabarica said, "I would like to clarify. I made this clear in a few interviews that I was not his girlfriend and he's not my sugar daddy or anything like that. I have my own income and business. I don't need his cash or support, hotel booking, fake jewellery or anything like that.""I am a European. I live in Europe and I don't follow Indian news. I also did not follow the list of fraudsters, so I was not aware of his (Choksi's) real name and background until last week. I believe this would be the case with most people in Antigua. I don't think anyone knew his name or background," Jabarica said.She said that anyone visiting the Caribbean for holidays would not have been able to identify Mehul Choksi as the fugitive businessman from India, since he had changed his appearance. "I saw all these pictures, I can see how he looked before and I think he lost a lot of weight and he looks very different. I don’t think someone is walking in the Caribbean on a holiday and he would spot out that he is the same Mehul Choksi that I read in Indian news," Barbara Jabarica told ANI.Choksi had alleged that Jabarica, who had developed "friendly terms with him" over the past year was an "integral part" of his abduction purportedly orchestrated by musclemen claiming to be Antiguan Police and mercenaries looking like Indians.

All the medical support from Kuwait came to India from May 4 to June 8.Qatar, which is the largest supplier of LNG and LPG to India, also proved to be the new logistic and transportation hub to the western India. It maintained the flow of passenger flights under the air bubble arrangement since August 2020, especially over the past weeks when many other airlines from the Gulf region closed. In the current situation, we may see Doha becoming a new transit hub for the Indians once the dust of pandemic settles down.On April 27, Qatar Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani called up PM Modi and expressed his country's solidarity with India and conveyed that Qatar would provide all possible support to India. The Prime Minister conveyed that the Indian Ambassador in Doha would coordinate in the matter with his office. The Emir immediately issued directions to his foreign office to ascertain what was required by India and assist in the matter.On April 29, one of the world’s largest cargo operators, Qatar Airways, announced that it would carry essential humanitarian medical cargo free of charge from around the world to India. Qatar Airways provided important air logistics to ferry international medical aid to India. On May 3, Qatar Airways sent three cargo flights - one each to Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai - carrying 300 MT of medical supplies aggregated from around the world. It included ventilators, CPAPS, oxygen concentrators and PPEs.Qatar also played an important role in supplying liquid medical oxygen to supplement India's domestic production.

09-06-2021||India||Annular solar eclipse on Thursday, to be visible before sunset in parts of India||This year's first solar eclipse will occur on Thursday, June 10. It will not be visible in India, except in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh, a few minutes before the sunset.The astronomical phenomenon of annular solar eclipse is seen when the Sun, Moon and the Earth come in a straight line and almost on the same plane. But bue to its elliptical orbit, the Moon doesn't cover the Sun entirely, leaving the Sun's visible outer edges to form a "ring of fire".The eclipse will be seen in its complete glory from a vast region of North America, Europe and Asia.For viewers and enthusiasts in India, the sighting appears difficult as the path of the eclipse will just be seen in the North-Eastern extremes of the country in Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh, Director of M P Birla Planetarium, Debiprasad Duari told PTI.In Arunachal Pradesh, Duari said, people will see the eclipse just before the sunset.The sighting will have a minuscule fraction of the Sun covered by the Moon, that is also very low in the horizon, lasting at the most 3-4 minutes depending upon the position, Duari said.In Ladakh, the eclipse will be seen for a short duration but at a comparatively higher altitude."On the northern borders, in Ladakh, a sliver of land in the border region can experience the last phase of the partial eclipse, again for a short duration, but relatively at a higher altitude than the eastern part of the country," he said.A very small part of the solar eclipse from the vicinity of Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh at around 5:52pm, the official said. In the northern part of Ladakh, where the sun will set at around 6.15pm, the last phases of the phenomenon can be seen at around 6pm.First, the partial eclipse will start at around 11:42am Indian Standard Time and the annular eclipse will appear to occur from 3:30pm and will continue up to 4:52pm, though for different intervals for a particular region, depending upon one's geographical location.The partial eclipse will end at around 6:41pm IST, he said.Live coverage of the eclipse is being arranged by various organisations around the world.Dubbed as 'ring eclipse', the upcoming solar eclipse is getting a lot of attention since people wait to watch Sun appear in a very bright ring surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.A total solar eclipse also requires the Moon and the Sun to be in the direct line of the Earth. However, it is visible from a small area since people who see the total eclipse are in the centre of the Moon's shadow when it hits Earth.An annular eclipse differs from a total eclipse based on the distance of the Moon from the Earth. It occurs when the Moon is farthest from Earth, which makes it look smaller than usual and does not block the entire view of the Sun.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/solar-eclipse-june-2021-annular-solar-eclipse-is-almost-here-to-be-seen-before-sunset-in-parts-of-india-101623202601269.html

All you need to know||The Telangana government, led by chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, on Tuesday extended the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-necessitated lockdown in the state by ten more days till June 19. The decision was taken keeping in view the number of Covid-19 cases in a few districts of the state. The extension of the pandemic-induced restrictions will come into effect from June 10. Moreover, some relaxation has also been made in the lockdown timings.Here's all you need to know about the Covid-19 lockdown extension in Telangana:Why was Covid-19 lockdown in Telangana extended?Telangana decided to extend the coronavirus disease-induced restrictions keeping in view the rising number of Covid-19 cases in some districts — more specifically, the assembly segments of Miryalguda, Munugode, Nalgonda, Satthupalli, Devarakonda, Nagarjuna Sagar, and Madhira.The Telangana cabinet said that the spread of Covid-19 in the aforementioned regions "is not under control" and therefore it has been decided that the lockdown will be extended. Moderation in Covid-19 curbsAlthough the Covid-19 lockdown in Telangana was extended till June 19, some moderation in the timings has been made to allow citizens some relaxation.Covid-19 curbs in Telangana will remain relaxed each day between 6am to 5pm during the lockdown, the state cabinet said. Earlier, the relaxation period was between 6am to 1pm. Thus, the state government has extended the relaxation period by four more hours in its latest directives.Moreover, the Telangana government has also allowed an additional one-hour grace period for people to reach home from their offices, once the lockdown comes into effect. So, when shops and other business establishments close down by 5pm, people will be allowed till 6pm to reach home from their offices."Shops and business establishments will be closed by 5 pm and the remaining one-hour grace period is to ensure that people reach home by 6 pm," the state government said.Covid-19 situation in TelanganaTelangana clocked as many as 1,897 new Covid-19 cases and 15 fatalities in the last 24 hours, the state health department informed on Tuesday. This takes the state's cumulative infection tally to 595,000, the data showed.Moreover, the fatality from the coronavirus disease in Telangana has been recorded at 0.57% and the recovery rate at 95.34%, with over 2,982 new recoveries clocked in the preceding 24 hours, the state government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-extends-covid-19-lockdown-till-june-19-all-you-need-to-know-101623202678823.html

Earlier, he met Union home minister Amit Shah and party chief JP Nadda on Tuesday to discuss various issues concerning the state, including post-poll violence.The meeting comes as BJP is stepping up its campaign against the post-post violence in West Bengal after facing a defeat in the state elections that were held in April-May.On Sunday, Jaiprakash Yadav, a labourer, who the party claimed was a BJP supporter, was killed by a crude bomb in the Jagatdal area of North 24 Parganas district. The BJP alleged that with Yadav’s death, the number of party workers killed since the announcement of poll results on May 2 touched 27.Shortly after Banerjee's Trinamool Congress (TMC) secured a third term in West Bengal, multiple incidents of violence were reported in the state. After being sworn in on May 5, Banerjee claimed that the clashes are taking place in areas where BJP won the elections. A day later, Banerjee said that at least 16, mostly of the BJP and the TMC, have lost their lives in post-poll violence in the state. She also claimed that most of the 16 deaths were reported till May 3 when the law and order were under the Election Commission of India.Meanwhile, BJP has been raising the issue of post-poll violence relentlessly, not just in Bengal but other states as well. On Sunday, the issue was discussed at a meeting held at the Delhi residence of Nadda.On Tuesday, West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said that the party has plans to petition President Ram Nath Kovind over post-poll violence. He said that the party has started sit-ins at the district level to protest against alleged violence on the BJP workers, police inaction and politics over-vaccination.Ghosh also announced the party's plans for a state-level protest on June 23.Suvendu Adhikari was a minister in the last Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government. He switched from Banerjee's TMC to BJP in December last year. He defeated the chief minister from Nandigram in a closely fought battle.After the meeting on Tuesday, Adhikari and Nadda spoke to reporters and called the West Bengal situation "very grim". The leaders also alleged that BJP workers are facing a continuous threat in the state. Assuring support to BJP workers, Nadda said that the party stands firmly with its workers and will do everything possible for their well-being.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suvendu-adhikari-to-meet-pm-modi-today-expected-to-discuss-post-poll-violence-in-bengal-101623202914446.html

In a post on Twitter, Nilekani said that the company "regrets these initial glitches" and assured that the system will stabilise in a few days. "The new e-filing portal will ease the filing process and enhance end user experience. Sitharamanji, we have observed some technical issues on day one, and are working to resolve them," Nilekani wrote on the micro-blogging site."Infosys regrets these initial glitches and expects the system to stabilise during the week," he also said.This came after many users flooded the Twitter timeline with complaints regarding the new Income Tax portal that was launched on Monday for e-filing. Paying heed to the complaints, the Union finance minister tagged Nilekani on Twitter asking him to ensure taxpayers do not face difficulties while filing their income tax returns on the new portal. "I see in my TL (timeline) grievances and glitches. Hope Infosys and Nandan Nilekani will not let down our taxpayers in the quality of service being provided," she had said.In 2019, Infosys received a contract to develop the next-generation income tax filing system to reduce processing time for returns from 63 days to one day and expedite refunds. The new portal (www.incometax.gov.in) went live on Monday evening. It replaced the earlier income tax portal, www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in.The new e-filing portal introduced several new features including free return software, a centralised dashboard for viewing uploads and interactions and a new call centre with chatbots and videos to help taxpayers.The new system will also help taxpayers to make payments on the tax filing website itself so that the amount reflects in the returns. The new system will also be expanded to bring debit cards, credit cards, net banking and the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in its ambit to further help taxpayers. It will also be operable in regional languages.The multinational IT company has also developed the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Network (GSTN) portal, used for payments and return filing. The software major had faced flak for the slow functioning of the GSTN portal at the time of the launch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/regret-initial-glitches-nanadan-nilekani-responds-to-sitharaman-on-new-tax-website-101623202099457.html

This was Thackeray’s second visit to Delhi after taking over as the chief minister in 2019.Deputy chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar and Congress leader Ashok Chavan accompanied Thackeray on the visit. While the delegation met the PM, Thackeray also had a one-on-one interaction with Modi.“Issues related to the Maratha reservation, Metro car shed, GST compensation were discussed with the Prime Minister. There were 12 issues that were discussed,” the Maharashtra CM said after the meeting. The Prime Minister’s Office did not issue a statement on the meeting. He said PM Modi assured them that he would look into the issues. “We, all three, are satisfied (with the meeting) because during our meeting there was no political agenda. Whatever issues we raised, he listened to us. I believe there could be some way out,” Thackeray said.Pawar said the delegation also asked Modi to direct Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari to approve the nomination of 12 members to the state legislative council, as decided by the state cabinet. He said this has been pending for eight months.The delegation met the Prime Minister for more than one-and-a-half hours at his official residence in the Capital.

09-06-2021||India||Centre orders 440 million more Covid-19 vaccine doses||The Centre on Tuesday placed fresh orders for 440 million additional doses of Covid-19 vaccines – 250 million doses of Covishield and 190 million of Covaxin – a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Union government was taking back the responsibility for procuring vaccines and distributing them for free to states.These 440 million doses, to be procured from August onwards, are in addition to an advance order of 300 million doses placed with Hyderabad-based Biological E’s vaccine and will be delivered by December, the Union health ministry said. To be sure, the Biological E vaccine has just entered Phase 3 trials.“Following PM’s announcement on change in vaccine policy, we have placed purchase orders for 25 crore (250 million) doses of Covishield with the Serum Institute of India, and for 19 crore (190 million) vaccine doses with Bharat Biotech... So, we have placed an advance order for 44 crore (440 million) doses from August onwards, for which we will be releasing 30% payment in advance,” Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, said at the Union health ministry’s Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday.Paul did not specify the price at which Centre will be procuring the doses in the latest order. Officials familiar with the development, who did not wish to be identified, said there is a possibility that the ₹150 per dose cost of vaccine may no longer be applicable, and that the Centre may have to pay more.The Centre last week announced that it placed an advanced order of 300 million doses for Biological E’s RBD protein sub-unit Covid-19 vaccine, which is in clinical trials. “We are hopeful that this innovative vaccine that is being developed with central government’s assistance, will be available by September, and ₹1,500 crore has already been paid to the company in advance. So, 74 crore (740 million) doses have been secured for the national programme,” Paul said.The orders for the 740 million doses are in addition to the 536 million doses of vaccine for which procurement has been arranged till the end of July, he said. To be sure, the 536 million number includes the total doses administered across the country so far. Till Tuesday morning, according to government data, 236 million doses have been administered across the country.This means that including Tuesday’s orders and the 300 million doses ordered of the yet-to-be-approved Biological E vaccine, the country has now administered, procured or placed orders for nearly 1.3 billion doses – 536 million doses administered or procured for July end, 300 million shots of the Biological E vaccine, and 440 million in latest purchase order.The vaccine order placement comes a day after the Prime Minister , in an address to the nation, announced that the Union government was taking over the responsibility for procuring vaccines and would then distribute them free of cost to states, in response to a rising chorus from the states, sharp criticism by the Supreme Court, and amid increasing concerns that supply shortages and the insistence of foreign vaccine makers that they would only deal with the Union government.The latest developments in the vaccine policy change have come close on the heels of a hearing in the Supreme Court on the Covid-19 situation and the state of vaccination in the country. In the latest hearing, the apex court said the Centre’s vaccination policy that put the onus of giving doses to adults in the below-45 years age group entirely on states and private hospitals was “prima facie arbitrary and irrational”.On Tuesday, Paul said that the shift back to the largely centralised vaccine procurement policy was based on feedback over the past month from chief ministers of at least a dozen states. “We respect the Supreme Court’s guidance and concern , but the government was evaluating the implementation of the decentralised model since May 1.”The states that requested for the central procurement are Punjab, Kerala, Sikkim, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, Tripura and Maharashtra, along with the Union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.“We believe, based on specific requests of chief ministers, the new guidelines will go a very long way in galvanising India’s vaccination programme,” he said. “The PM reviewed India’s vaccination progress in two meetings, on May 15 and 21, and directed us to prepare an alternate model. On May 24, a high level expert team, including myself, reached out to the manufacturers... Other teams reached out to states to know their mind and finally we chalked the new roadmap that was presented to the PM who approved it,” said Paul.Experts, however, said steps taken by Centre now should have come much earlier.India has so far administered 236 million vaccine doses to 189 million people since January 16, 2021, when the national Covid-19 vaccination drive was launched. A total of 143 million people have received one dose, while 47 million people have been fully vaccinated. Under the free vaccine doses, the central government has distributed 246.5 million doses so far to states, according to the government data. “A total of 11,946,925 Covid vaccine doses are still available with the states/UTs to be administered,” said Union health ministry in a statement issued on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-orders-440-million-more-covid-19-vaccine-doses-101623181445131.html

09-06-2021||India||Two women army officers selected to train as combat pilots||Two women army officers have for the first time been selected to train as helicopter pilots at the force’s premier Combat Army Aviation Training School at Nashik in Maharashtra, officials familiar with the development said on Tuesday.The development comes months after army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane cleared a proposal for allowing women officers to opt for the army’s aviation wing. While women officers in the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy fly helicopters, the Army Aviation Corps only inducted male officers until now. Pilots have to go through a stringent selection process.“Fifteen women officers volunteered to join army aviation. But only two were selected after the Pilot Aptitude Battery Test (PABT) and medicals,” said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named.The two women are among the 47 army officers who began their training at the Nashik training school on Monday, said a second officer. They will join front-line flying duties on completion of their training in July 2022.Until now, women officers were assigned only ground duties in the Army Aviation Corps.Raised in November 1986, the Army Aviation Corps operates the Dhruv advanced light helicopter, Chetaks, Cheetahs and Cheetal helicopters. It carries out an important role in supporting the army’s deployment in high altitude areas, including the Siachen Glacier.The headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the last six years, with more avenues being opened to them at a steady pace, government figures show.There are 9,118 women currently serving the army, navy and air force, with the services giving them more opportunities for career progression, the government told Parliament in February 2021.“It’s wonderful to see the armed forces open new avenues for women. It will encourage more women to join the military,” said Rajeshwari Kori, deputy controller of Civil Defence (Maharashtra) and a former lieutenant commander who was part of a short-lived Indian Navy experiment to deploy women on warships in 1997.One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when IAF decided to induct them into the fighter stream. Earlier this year, the Indian Navy deployed four women officers on warships after a hiatus of almost 25 years. India’s only aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya and fleet tanker INS Shakti are the warships that have been assigned their first women crews since the late 1990s.In May 2021, the army inducted the first batch of women into the Corps of Military Police, the first time that women joined the military in the non-officer cadre. Women have been serving as officers in select branches of the three services since the early 1990s.Tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992Excluding the medical wing in which women have been serving for decades, the army as of February 2021 accounted for 6,807 women officers, the IAF (1,607) and the navy, 704. In percentage terms, women still form a small part of the military -- 0.56% of the army, 1.08% of the air force and 6.5% of the navy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-women-army-officers-selected-to-train-as-combat-pilots-101623180458434.html

09-06-2021||India||Leadership row in Karnataka’s volatile political turf||Bengaluru: For at least the last two decades, the political leadership in Karnataka’s all three major parties — Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S) — has largely hinged on B S Yediyurappa, Siddaramaiah and H D Deve Gowda, respectively.Known for their astute political acumen and coalition-building skills, these three leaders have used their strengths to rise to power or remain well in control of their respective parties, irrespective of being in power or in opposition.But this consolidation of power has also led to a leadership crisis of sorts within at least the BJP and the Congress, analysts believe, with no real succession plan in place. Smaller but ambitious leaders have seen their attempts to challenge Yediyurappa or Siddaramaiah in their respective parties fade not for the lack of intent but possibly not measuring up in political skill, according to political analysts.“That’s the thing about some of these old politicians. They never fade away and it becomes a way of life for them,” said a Bengaluru-based political analyst, requesting not to be named. Despite the national leadership of the BJP indicating its intent to remove Yediyurappa from the chief minister’s post, the 78-year-old has managed to retain the top chair, thwarting attempts from within his own party, both at the state and central level.“Yediyurappa has made it clear (to the party and high command) that he has the strength of 66 MLAs,” a Bengaluru-based political analyst said, requesting not to be named.The analyst added that Yediyurappa has the ability, as shown in the past, to sabotage the chances of a party.Shortly after his taking over as chief minister for a record fourth term in 2019, Yediyurappa was faced with dissent while picking his cabinet. This exacerbated when most of the turncoats and others were placed in the cabinet while seniors and core-party legislators were left out, sowing the seeds of disgruntlement against the 78-year-old. In recent months, more voices have come up against Yediyurappa over the handling--or the lack of it--of the covid-19 pandemic, corruption, non-performance and allegations that his son, BY Vijayendra was running a parallel administration at the behest of the chief minister. Several legislators have since met national leaders seeking the ouster of the chief minister. A senior BJP national leader told Hindustan Times that Yediyurappa has been surviving on “bonus time”. “Yediyurappa has been given three major concessions: He was reinstated to the post of chief minister despite leaving the party, his age and finally his weakness have all been overlooked. So every day after he became chief minister is a bonus,” said a senior BJP leader, requesting not to be named.M P Renukacharya, a BJP legislator and political secretary of Yediyurappa, on Monday said he had the signatures of at least 66 MLAs from the party who are with the chief minister, indicating that the 78-year-old had the support of a large section of legislators.Moreover, the gag order of the BJP on Monday, restricting any legislator from speaking against the chief minister, has upset a few leaders within the party who have sought for a forum to air out their grievances against what they consider “a faulty system”.“Remarks coming in the media in the last three days are not good for the interest of the party. Few comments from a few people are not the same as that of all MLAs and party workers. We cannot tell our opinion to the media, so we request party leaders to provide us a platform to hear us,” Sunil Kumar, a three-time BJP legislator from Karkala, said in a post on Twitter, tagging senior party leaders like CT Ravi, Arun Singh and Nalin Kumar Kateel.Yediyurappa’s resistance is in many ways unique compared to his counterparts in other states who have rarely challenged the national leadership and towed the party line.Analysts say that both Siddaramaiah and Yediyurappa assumed the role of “local chieftains” when their respective central leadership was not very powerful at different points of time.The situation is similar in the Congress where Siddaramaiah and D K Shivakumar, two of the tallest leaders within the party, have locked horns and their dislike for each other is no secret.Shivakumar has long nursed dreams of being considered for the top job but was denied even a spot in the cabinet in 2013 when Siddaramaiah became chief minister. It is only after the intervention of the top leadership that Shivakumar was inducted into the cabinet in the following year.Shivakumar, as Congress president, has tried to take control of the party but with little success as Siddaramaiah continued to thwart any attempts that appeared as a challenge to his hold, people aware of the developments said.On Tuesday, Shivakumar said the Congress will triumph in the 2023 assembly elections.But even a candidate nominated by Shivakumar for the post of state youth Congress was challenged by Siddaramaiah and other leaders, the people cited above added, indicating the power struggle within the Grand Old Party.Shivakumar brushed aside any reports of a rift within the party.“Joining together is (the) beginning, thinking together is progress and working together is key to success. One person fighting alone cannot succeed but when party leadership and workers put their best foot forward and work in coordination, we all succeed as a team,” Shivakumar said.Shivakumar visited Siddaramaiah at the latter’s residence on Tuesday after the former chief minister, who was suffering from high fever, was discharged from hospital on Monday. The JD(S), helmed by 88-year-old former prime minister H D Deve Gowda, remains an important stakeholder in the state as it is the only party that has allied with both the BJP and Congress. H D Kumaraswamy, Gowda’s son, has been the chief minister both by allying with the BJP and the Congress. However, the family-run party has its own challenges as the BJP continues to make inroads into the Old Mysuru region, a stronghold of the JD(S). Adding to this is the bitter family feud within the Gowda household with the turbulent relationship between Gowda’s two sons, Kumaraswamy and H D Revanna.Karnataka’s volatile political climate has brought down governments but the leadership somehow tends to brave the storm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leadership-row-in-karnataka-s-volatile-political-turf-101623178967219.html

It was locked from outside. There is a pathway inside which leads to the mosque, the gates of which were found open. The explosion has caused extensive damage to the seminary building,”  Gupta told news agency PTI. A preliminary probe suggested the presence of gunpowder or explosives at the site of the explosion, said Shresthan Kumar, assistant director of the Forensic Sciences Laboratory at Bhagalpur.The madrasa, which had close to 200 students, was shut on May 5 due to the Covid-induced lockdown. The deceased, identified as Mohammad Abdul Sattar Mobin, was from Jharkhand‘s Madhupur district and resided at the seminary as a caretaker.Not a single person, including the imam of the mosque could be traced when a police party reached the spot, added Gupta. Mobin’s body was recovered just outside Navtolia locality. Preliminary investigations revealed that the injured imam died on the way to the hospital, following which his aides abandoned the body in the car and fled, said police.The explosion was so powerful that people staying one kilometre away could hear the sound, said Bibi Rukhsana, who lives in the neighbourhood.Deputy inspector general (Bhagalpur range) Sujeet Kumar said a team of forensic experts and a dog squad are examining the site of explosion to ascertain the cause of the blast. Officials familiar with the developments in the Bihar Police headquarters said the investigating officers will also probe a terror angle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/severe-blast-destroys-bihar-madrasa-imam-found-dead-101623178187039.html
09-06-2021||India||28 elephants in TN’s Mudumalai reserve tested for Covid||Chennai: The swabs of 28 elephants from Theppakadu camp in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve were collected on Tuesday and sent for Covid-19 testing , days after a lioness died and eight others in the pride tested positive for the infection at a zoo outside Chennai. The samples of 26 adult elephants, five of whom were in the musth stage, and two calves were collected from their trunk and rectum and sent to Indian Veterinary Research Institute at Izatnagar in Uttar Pradesh for testing. “Five of them were in the musth stage so it was difficult but we managed to collect two swab samples from each of the elephants,” Dr K Rajesh Kumar, forest veterinarian, Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, said. “The elephants cooperated and only with some of them, we had to spend some extra time. This is a screening process and none of them are suspected to have the virus,” Kumar said, adding that the jumbos did not have to be sedated for the process. “That would have caused a huge strain on the animal.”The feeding time of the elephants has been staggered as they are being fed separately. The caretakers for the elephants are allowed to enter only after getting their temperature checked. As many as 52 mahouts and 27 kavadis (assistants to mahouts) are present in the camp and are being vaccinated on a priority basis. “Twelve out of 52 mahouts have been vaccinated so far,” K K Kaushal, field director, Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, said. Forest minister K Ramachnadran had instructed forest officials to collect samples from Theppakadu camp as well as Kozhikamuthy camp in Top Slip at Anamalai Tiger Reserve.“The minister launched a special vaccination drive for tribals living in the surrounding areas,” Kaushal said. On June 3, one lioness died while eight lions tested positive for the virus at Arignar Anna Zoological Park or Vandalur zoo outside Chennai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/28-elephants-in-tn-s-mudumalai-reserve-tested-for-covid-101623178128346.html
09-06-2021||India||Sonia, Rahul don’t trust Indian vaccines, yet to take jabs: Pralhad Joshi||Parliamentary affairs minister and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Pralhad Joshi on Tuesday alleged that Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her son and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi haven’t got themselves inoculated against Covid-19 because they distrust Indian vaccines. The minister told news agency ANI, “When we started vaccination in January, Congress leaders raised questions on vaccine efficacy. Now, they’re taking the vaccine. As per my knowledge, Sonia and Rahul Gandhi haven’t taken the vaccine. They don’t have confidence in Indian vaccine.”Joshi’s reference is to the unprecedented approval given to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, in the absence of any data from Phase 3 trials. Subsequent interim data did show the vaccine to be highly effective. The company is yet to publish final data. Responding to Joshi, the Congress spokesperson steered clear of commenting on whether the Gandhis had taken the shot. Party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala instead accused the BJP ministers of “resorting to diabolical propaganda to divert attention from abject failure of the Modi government to ensure universal free vaccination”. Later, Surjewala spoke with Hindustan Times and said the Prime Minister and his government have endangered the lives of millions of Indians by changing the vaccination policy three times in six months. Joshi’s allegation comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi , in an address to the nation, announced that the Union government was taking over the responsibility for procuring vaccines and would then distribute them free of cost to states, in response to a rising chorus from the states, sharp criticism by the Supreme Court, and amid increasing concerns that supply shortages and the insistence of foreign vaccine makers that they would only deal with the Union government.Last week, Congress launched a campaign for free universal vaccination. As part of it, Rahul Gandhi tweeted a video with the hashtag #SpeakUpForFreeUniversalVaccination, asking people to upload videos demanding free vaccination for all. But unlike other Indian politicians, the Gandhis haven’t made their vaccination status public. A Congress leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that the family felt this was a private matter. In April, Rahul Gandhi tested positive for Covid-19, which had kept him out of the Congress Working Committee meeting on May 10. In the event he had not been vaccinated by then, he will have to wait till mid-July to take a shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-rahul-don-t-trust-indian-vaccines-yet-to-take-jabs-pralhad-joshi-101623178127706.html
09-06-2021||India||Children’s home director, 4 others booked for sexual harassment of two inmates||htjharkhand@hindustantimes.comJamshedpur: The director of a children’s home, his wife who is also the chairperson of East Singhbhum district child welfare committee, and three other people have been booked for the sexual exploitation of two minor inmates, police said on Tuesday. Jamshedpur assistant superintendent of police Kumar Gaurav said all five have been booked under various sections of Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and the Indian Penal Code. The FIR has named Harpal Singh Thapar, director of Mother Teresa Welfare Trust, his wife Pushpa Rani Tirkey, caretaker Deepa Singh, her son Aditya Singh and his friend Tony Singh.ASP Singh added that the survivors have recorded their statements under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the special Pocso court of an additional sessions judge.The girls escaped from the children’s home on Saturday, following which Thapar went to the police to file a missing complaint. The police tracked down the girls through their cellphone numbers to a house in Birsanagar late Sunday night. The girls told the police that Thapar and the other men used to sexually harass them while Tirkey used to beat them up. They were students at a girls’ school who were sent to the home after the school closed during the lockdown. Thapar and his wife called the charges motivated and said they were ready for a fair probe. Tirkey also submitted a memorandum to the police on Monday evening. There was already a pending complaint against Thapar, his wife and a few others, filed by a woman who alleged that her husband, a panchayat ward member, was falsely implicated in a case of sexual harassment of a minor girl by Thapar and his wife and sent to jail. In her complaint to the Jamshedpur senior superintendent of police, the woman also alleged that Thapar and his associates were demanding ₹15 lakh to settle the matter. Thapar’s shelter home made news for the wrong reasons on Monday too when a video showing girl inmates working in garbage dumps and other menial tasks went viral, forcing the district administration to take notice. A four-member team of the district labour department led by labour superintendent Avinash Thakur spoke with the children regarding this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/childrens-home-director-4-others-booked-for-sexual-harassment-of-two-inmates-101623178127139.html
09-06-2021||India||Sudhakaran takes over as Kerala Congress chief||Thiruvananthpuram: The All India Congress Committee (AICC) on Tuesday appointed K Sudhakaran, a member of Parliament from Kannur (north Kerala), as president of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee after intense deliberations. The party high command picked the 73-year old leader for the top post replacing Mullappally Ramachandran after long discussions in the state and in New Delhi.“I know it is a big challenge. My first priority is to strengthen the party at the grassroots level. I am sure the party will be in the reckoning soon bypassing recent setbacks,” Sudhakaran said in Thiruvananthapuram. Sudhakaran told reporters that party leader Rahul Gandhi informed him about the new responsibility over the phone.Soon after the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) suffered a mauling in the recently concluded Assembly polls from the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) and settled with just 41 seats, there had been a clamour for leadership change in the state unit of the Congress.Following the humiliating defeat in the state elections, leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala and PCC chief Mullapally Ramachandran had resigned. Senior leader VD Satheesan was later appointed as the opposition leader in the assembly, but the selection of the PCC chief was delayed due to pressure from different groups. Meanwhile, after the elevation of the new PCC president, three new working presidents were also appointed by the AICC -- MP Kodikunnil Suresh, and legislators PT Thomas and T Siddique. The present working president, K V Thomas, has been removed from the post, said the release issued by AICC general secretary (in-charge of organisation) K C Venugopal.Senior party leaders including former chief minister Oommen Chandy, Chennithala and VM Sudheeran hailed his elevation and said his selection will give a right message to the party rank and file. “It is a welcome move. We will all work together to strengthen the party,” Chandy said.An opponent of faction politics, Sudhakaran (73) wields good support among young cadre of the party. Known for his strong position against the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Kerala, the senior Congress leader survived two attempts on his life. He is generally considered as one of the few Congress leaders who are strong enough to take on the ruling CPI(M) in their citadel. According to party insiders, Sudhakaran, who came from grassroots level, always stood with party workers in thick and thin. According to party insiders, the two powerful groups in the Congress in Kerala, one led by Chandy and the other by Ramesh Chennithala, were not in favour of Sudhakaran, but party leader Rahul Gandhi, also an MP from the state, threw his weight behind him. “I will try to take everyone in the party together and seek their support and cooperation to revive the party. The Congress will surely regain its strength and will make a strong comeback in the state,” Sudhakaran said on Tuesday.He started his political career with the Janata Party in 1970s and later joined the Congress at the initiative of veteran leader K Karunakaran. A four-term legislator from 1996 to 2009, Sudhakaran was also a minister in AK Antony cabinet. He was elected twice from Kannur parliamentary seat. Even in his 70s, Sudhakaran is known for his fitness regime.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sudhakaran-takes-over-as-kerala-congress-chief-101623178067545.html
09-06-2021||India||ICMR study finds Covaxin effective against Covid variants||The indigenously developed Covaxin vaccine is effective against variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, including the delta variant that was first sequenced in India, a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research has found. The research, which is yet to be peer reviewed, also discovered that the vaccine is thrice as effective in creating antibodies as a previous Covid infection. To be sure, other research has shown that a previous infection does confer stronger immunity . The research found out that Covaxin creates 2.7 times less neutralising titre against the delta variant and three times less neutralising titre against the beta variant of the virus first reported from South Africa. The neutralising titre refers to the level of antibodies created. But the vaccine remained effective against both strains. “Our study demonstrated that despite a reduction in neutralisation titres with BBV152 (Covaxin) sera against B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.617.2 (delta), its neutralisation potential is well established. Lastly, the broad epitope (large number of binding sites) coverage of an inactivated vaccine decreases the magnitude of reduced neutralisation against emerging variants,” the study concluded. Dr Pragya Yadav, senior scientist at the National Institute of Virology-Pune and the lead author of the paper, said, “Although there is a minor reduction in the neutralisation titre, it (Covaxin) will still be able to protect the vaccinated individual and eventually lessen the severity of the disease.”Epidemiologist and vaccine expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya said the antibody titres are not predictive of the efficacy of a vaccine. “Even if the antibody level is 1, the person is thought to be seroconverted and protected from the infection. That is what the researchers have shown: despite the reduction in antibody titres, the vaccine works,” he said.  Lahariya said that one likely impact of the lower titres could be that the antibodies might diminish sooner. “But, with Covid-19, protection against the virus is complex. Studies have shown that even after the decline in antibody levels, there is T-cell immunity. A study from the University of Washington has said that this immunity might be life-long for those who had mild infection.” Covaxin, which was developed by Bharat Biotech in association with ICMR, is one of the three vaccines that have so far been approved for Covid-19 immunisation in India, the other two being Covishield made by Serum Institute of India and Sputnik V of Russia. Covaxin uses an inactivated whole virus to elicit an immune response.Covaxin accounts for at least 11% of the vaccine shots given in the country so far, according to data on the government’s CoWIN platform. The company is in the process of scaling up its production, including by licensing its technology, and is likely to contribute a higher share of immunisation in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmrstudy-finds-covaxin-effective-against-covid-variants-101623178067041.html
09-06-2021||India||Centre caps price of jabs sold by private players||The Union health ministry on Tuesday capped the prices of coronavirus vaccines being administered at private vaccination centres, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that private hospitals can procure 25% of the doses manufactured in the country and administer them at the manufacturer’s price of the jabs and up to an additional ₹150 as service charge.An office memorandum issued by the ministry fixed the maximum price per dose of Covishield at ₹780, for Covaxin at ₹1,410, and for Sputnik V at ₹1,145, which is as per the prices disclosed by the vaccine manufacturers at the moment.“The revised guidelines for implementation of National COVID Vaccination Programme issued on 8th June provide that – ‘the price of vaccine doses for private hospitals would be declared by each vaccine manufacturer and any subsequent changes would be notified in advance. The private hospitals may charge up to a maximum of ₹150 per dose as service charges. State governments may monitor the price being so charged,” said the order issued by Vikas Sheel, additional secretary, Union health ministry.“In view of the above, based on the prices currently declared by the manufacturers for the three vaccines currently being administered under the national vaccination drive following price caps are applicable: Covishield: ₹600 (price per dose as declared by manufacturer), ₹30 (GST at 5%), ₹150 (maximum service charge per dose), ₹780 (maximum price that can be charged by the private vaccination centre); Covaxin: ₹1200 (price per dose as declared by manufacturer), ₹60 (GST at 5%), ₹150 (maximum service charge per dose), ₹1,410 (maximum price that can be charged by the private vaccination centre); Sputnik V: ₹948 (price per dose as declared by manufacturer), ₹47.40 or 47 (GST at 5%), ₹150 (maximum service charge per dose), ₹1,145 (maximum price that can be charged by the private vaccination centre)…,” said the order.The Serum Institute of India (SII) locally manufactures Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine under the brand name Covishield; Bharat Biotech manufacturers Covaxin and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories has entered a partnership with Russian Direct Investment Fund to distribute first 250 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine.CoWIN, the digital platform that is the backbone of the Covid-19 vaccine delivery management system, is being currently tweaked for the purpose, and required validations are being put in place to ensure that the prices declared by various private Covid vaccination centres do not exceed the maximum prices indicated by the central government, people with knowledge of the matter said.Since the prices have been capped based on the rates currently declared by each vaccine manufacturer, they are open to review in the future in case the manufacturers change the selling price, they said.The order issued to state administrative heads also directs that prices charged to beneficiaries at private vaccination centres should be closely monitored, and strict action be taken if any centre flouts the order and is found overcharging.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday announced that the Union government was taking back the responsibility for procuring vaccines and distributing them to states, in response to a growing chorus of demands from the states, sharp criticism by the Supreme Court, and amid increasing concerns that supply shortages and the insistence of foreign vaccine makers that they would only deal with the Union government could derail India’s vaccine drive.The Union government will continue to allow private hospitals to buy up to 25% of vaccines made in India, although it has capped the service charge they can levy on these at ₹150 a dose. The details of India’s new vaccine policy will be worked out in consultation with the states in the next two weeks, and it will be launched on June 21, Modi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-caps-price-of-jabs-sold-by-private-players-101623178007556.html
09-06-2021||India||Stalin seeks moratorium on loan, writes to 12 CMs||Chennai: Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Tuesday wrote to his counterparts in 12 states urging them to write to the union finance minister and the Reserve Bank of India on the need for moratorium on loan repayment for MSMEs and small businesses. The letter was addressed to chief ministers of mostly non-BJP ruled states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana and West Bengal. Stating that he had taken up this issue with the Union government, Stalin requested the 12 states to write to the union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Shaktikanta Das, on the issue. Stalin, who has been in office for a month, urged his counterparts “to prevail on them to offer moratorium on repayment of loans for at least the first two quarters of 2021-2022 to all small borrowers with outstanding up to ₹5 crore in view of the lockdowns induced by the second wave of Covid-19.” The MSME industries have demanded extension of loan moratorium for a period of one year as they have not been able to re-pay the loans or installments in the past one year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Industrial associations of Tamil Nadu had written to finance minister Sitharaman on May 28 seeking extension of the moratorium saying they would not be able to repay the loans by June 30, till the existing moratorium continues. Citing the example of how the states’ collective effort in asking for vaccines to be procured centrally and distributed free of cost to states led to the union government to revise its position accordingly on Monday, Stalin urged for states to come together once again. “We need to show our collective strength at this hour of great need,” Stalin said in his letter. Earlier, chief minister of Kerala, Pinarayi Vijayan on May 31 had written to 11 non-BJP ruled states including Tamil Nadu put up a joint effort to get vaccines from the union government and Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik too followed suit. Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had written to Vijayan urging states to speak in a single voice regarding the vaccines. During April-May last year when the union government had announced the nationwide lockdown, a moratorium was offered on repayment of loans for such borrowers. “However, in April-June, 2021 when lockdowns are being imposed based on local conditions by the respective states similar relief to borrowers is not being provided for,” Stalin said, adding that the absence of such relief measures would force many businesses to close leading to economic distress. “These MSMEs and small businesses are the mainstay of our economy and employment generation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-seeks-moratorium-on-loan-writes-to-12-cms-101623178008183.html
09-06-2021||India||UP probes if Agra hospital cut oxygen supply on purpose||The Uttar Pradesh government sealed a private hospital in Agra on Tuesday and ordered a probe into allegations that hospital authorities turned off oxygen for five minutes on April 26 to see which patients would survive, and left 22 people gasping for breath.The allegations are related to a video that surfaced on Monday where Shri Paras Hospital owner, Arinjay Jain, is heard saying that he conducted a “mock drill” at 7am on April 26 during an acute oxygen shortage in the city and 22 people were “eliminated” after they “turned blue”.Jain denied the allegations on Tuesday and said such an exercise was not done.“An inquiry has been ordered into the oxygen supply incident at Paras Hospital in Agra. The hospital has been sealed. The inquiry committee has been directed to submit its report to the state government. On the basis of the report, further action will be taken,” said state health minister Jai Pratap Singh.Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh ordered that Jain be booked for violating the Epidemic Diseases Act, creating false alarm under the disaster management act and disobeying official orders under the Indian Penal Code. Singh also denied that 22 deaths occurred on April 26.“Shri Paras Hospital had enough oxygen and it is not true that 22 patients died there due to oxygen shortage. However, the video that is being circulated will be examined and the required action will be taken,” he said.All 55 patients currently admitted to Paras hospital will be shifted out, he added.Agra chief medical officer (CMO) Dr RC Pandey said he ordered a probe by two additional CMOs and the report will be submitted within two days.The video, whose authenticity HT could not independently verify, was shot on April 28, at the height of the second wave in the country. At the time, Uttar Pradesh was posting a daily average of 34,000cases and several cities, including Agra, reported an acute shortage of oxygen and medicines.The video doesn’t show Jain but he is purportedly heard telling a gathering of people that in the last week of April, oxygen stocks had dwindled and he asked patients to shift out because suppliers had given up.“Then, I thought of conducting a mock drill to find out who would survive and who would die without oxygen. On April 26, at 7am, we stopped the supply of oxygen for five minutes as part of the “mock drill”. No one came to know …twenty-two patients were eliminated, they turned blue and were gasping without oxygen,” he was heard as saying.In the clip, it is unclear whether Jain meant the 22 people were killed.On Tuesday, Jain denied the exercise but admitted that it was his voice heard in the video clip.“There was no mock drill as such, nor any supply of oxygen stopped for patients. The 22 were those who had high dependency on oxygen and oxygen supply to them could not be compromised,” said Jain“There was an oxygen shortage and we were asked for judicious and rational use of limited oxygen in the third week of April. We thus thought of categorising patients as to how many of 96 patients admitted required high flow,” he said.Officially, four Agra residents died at Paras hospital on April 26 but the reason of death was not oxygen scarcity, said Singh. He added that the toll could be higher if people from other districts admitted in the hospital were considered.Singh said the hospital was supplied adequate oxygen from April 25 to 27, contradicting Jain, who admitted to a shortage.Singh said the administration supplied 149 cylinders to Paras Hospital on April 25, 121 on April 26, and 117 on April 27 with 20 as back-up. “The hospital had no shortage of oxygen and no deaths took place because of scarcity of oxygen at Paras Hospital,” the district magistrate said.This is not the first time Paras Hospital is in the news. The facility was sealed for three months last year after it was found that hospital authorities admitted patients without official authorisation. At the time, a case was registered against Jain and the hospital manager, NAME. But the hospital was designated as a Covid hospital in April, when the second wave of Covid hit the country.Family members of some patients who died on April 26 confirmed that the hospital suffered an oxygen scarcity.Ashok Chawla, 43, said he was told by Jain on April 26 to arrange an oxygen cylinder for his 71-year-old father, who was admitted to Paras Hospital on April 12. He said Jain informed him that the hospital had run out of oxygen.“I managed to get a cylinder but 15 minutes later, Jain said that my father was no more. My brother’s wife died the next day because of laxity of hospital authorities,” said Chawla, a local contractor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agra-hospital-sealed-over-o2-mock-drill-101623178007053.html

The girl’s grandmother, too, fainted due to the heat and was rescued, they added. According to Raniwada Station House Officer, Padma Ram, the incident took place on Sunday morning when Sukhi Devi, 60, and her granddaughter Anjali decided to cover the 15km distance from a relative’s house in Sirohi district to their residence in Dungri village of Raniwada region on foot. After covering about seven kilometres within five hours in 40 degrees Celsius weather, the girl and her grandmother felt thirsty, but with no water to drink and no one around to help, the girl’s condition deteriorated and she passed away crying for water. Her grandmother, too, fainted. A shepherd passing by spotted the two and informed the local village chief. Later, police arrived at the spot and rushed them to the hospital, where Anjali was declared dead. Police said the girl died due to dehydration and cardiac arrest. “The two made the mistake of not carrying water, and choosing to walk through the desert,” said Ram.The incident triggered a war of words between the state government and the Opposition. “It is the misfortune of Rajasthan that an incompetent and corrupt Congress government has transformed it into a land of starvation, unemployment, chaos and mafia raj,” tweeted Rajasthan BJP chief Satish Poonia.Hitting back, Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said the incident was unfortunate and the local administration will probe the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5yearold-dies-of-thirst-in-rajasthan-desert-101623177827072.html
09-06-2021||India||Pune firm owner arrested after 17 die in factory fire||Pune: A day after a major fire inside a local industrial plant at Pirangut claimed 17 lives, Pune police on Tuesday arrested owner of the firm Nikunj Shah for negligence. In the FIR lodged at Paud police station, 39-year-old Shah, one of the directors of SVS Aqua Technologies, has been booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Shah is among the three partners in the firm with other two being his father and brother, who live abroad at present.Shah was arrested following the probe committee constituted by Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh under sub-divisional magistrate Sandesh Shirke highlighted several lacunae in its preliminary report submitted within 24 hours of the incident. As many as 17 workers, including 15 women, were charred to death in a major fire that broke out inside the industrial plant at Urawade village near Pirangut, around 40 km from Pune. Following the tragedy, Deshmukh constituted a four-member team headed by Shirke to inquire into the cause of fire along with safety related aspects. The committee found negligence on part of SVS Technologies on various counts, including absence of fire safety mechanism despite combustible material being produced at the medium-size plant. The committee highlighted a total of 12 points in its report, which was also accessed by Hindustan Times. “The firm did not follow norms needed to be adhered in the industrial estate. This included fire safety, building permission related norms along with provision of entry-exit point and open space needed to be allotted. The committee also found that SVS Technologies did not take necessary precaution especially when it was producing combustible material like chlorine dioxide,” Pune superintendent of police Abhinav Deshmukh said, adding the report will now be part of the investigation against Shah and his firm. According to eyewitnesses who survived the blaze, there were sparks in the machine used for processing chlorine dioxide, which the firm was using to make powder used for purifying water. The committee also recorded statements of the eyewitnesses, which will also part of police investigation. Before his arrest, Shah had denied his company was producing any inflammable material. “The firm is involved in manufacturing chemicals required for purification of water. This chemical is not inflammable, and we suspect a short circuit as the cause of the incident,” Shah had said on Monday. Police also ruled out that the company was producing sanitisers, as alleged by relatives of victims. “Although we found some barrels of sanitisers, but they were in small quantity and possibly brought for the use of workers during Covid-19,” police said. Earlier in the day, Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse-Patil visited Pune and ruled out short circuit as the cause of fire. Meanwhile, the administration revised the death toll in the fire tragedy to 17. “Due to the blast inside, some bodies were found in parts… Initially it seemed like there were 18 victims. However, we have cross checked with company officials and found only 17 missing. Everyone else is accounted for. Therefore, the death toll is 17,” police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pune-firm-owner-arrested-after-17-die-in-factory-fire-101623177766995.html
09-06-2021||India||‘Covaxin effective against Covid-19 variants’: ICMR study||The indigenously developed Covaxin vaccine is effective against variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, including the delta variant that was first sequenced in India, a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research has found.The research, which is yet to be peer reviewed, also discovered that the vaccine is thrice as effective in creating antibodies as a previous Covid infection. To be sure, other research has shown that a previous infection does confer stronger immunity .The research found out that Covaxin creates 2.7 times less neutralising titre against the delta variant and three times less neutralising titre against the beta variant of the virus first reported from South Africa. The neutralising titre refers to the level of antibodies created.But the vaccine remained effective against both strains.“Our study demonstrated that despite a reduction in neutralisation titres with BBV152 (Covaxin) sera against B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.617.2 (delta), its neutralisation potential is well established. Lastly, the broad epitope (large number of binding sites) coverage of an inactivated vaccine decreases the magnitude of reduced neutralisation against emerging variants,” the study concluded.Dr Pragya Yadav, senior scientist at the National Institute of Virology-Pune and the lead author of the paper, said, “Although there is a minor reduction in the neutralisation titre, it (Covaxin) will still be able to protect the vaccinated individual and eventually lessen the severity of the disease.”Epidemiologist and vaccine expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya said the antibody titres are not predictive of the efficacy of a vaccine. “Even if the antibody level is 1, the person is thought to be seroconverted and protected from the infection. That is what the researchers have shown: despite the reduction in antibody titres, the vaccine works,” he said.Lahariya said that one likely impact of the lower titres could be that the antibodies might diminish sooner. “But, with Covid-19, protection against the virus is complex. Studies have shown that even after the decline in antibody levels, there is T-cell immunity. A study from the University of Washington has said that this immunity might be life-long for those who had mild infection.”Covaxin, which was developed by Bharat Biotech in association with ICMR, is one of the three vaccines that have so far been approved for Covid-19 immunisation in India, the other two being Covishield made by Serum Institute of India and Sputnik V of Russia.Covaxin uses an inactivated whole virus to elicit an immune response.Covaxin accounts for at least 11% of the vaccine shots given in the country so far, according to data on the government’s CoWIN platform. The company is in the process of scaling up its production, including by licensing its technology, and is likely to contribute a higher share of immunisation in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-effective-against-covid-19-variants-icmr-study-101623177465603.html
09-06-2021||India||India keeps an eye on PLA movement in Ladakh theatre||India is keeping tabs on Chinese military manoeuvres, including land and air drills, in the Ladakh-Tibet theatre even as the two sides are negotiating a complex disengagement process to pull back their front-line troops and weapons from friction points in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the developments said on Tuesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity.The Indian military has tracked recently conducted air drills that involved a squadron-plus Chinese fighter jets (over 18 aircraft), an exercise carried out last month, and is also keeping a watch on Chinese training areas that are at a depth of 1,000 km to 1,500 km from the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), said one of the officials cited above.“The Chinese military has been carrying out training drills and activities in their depth areas. We also carry out training activities on our side,” said another official.On May 28, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said his soldiers were on high alert as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) continued to base its troops and mechanised elements in its “immediate depth” across the LAC from where they could be deployed to forward areas at short notice. (Immediate depth in the context of the Ladakh sector refers to a distance of 150 km to 200 km from the LAC.)Both armies have 50,000 to 60,000 troops each in the Ladakh theatre and the deployments have not thinned after the disengagement in the Pangong Tso sector.The air forces of both countries also remain deployed in the Ladakh-Tibet theatre just as they were when the border row was at its peak last year, as reported by Hindustan Times on April 1.The Indian and Chinese armies began negotiations to resolve the border row more than a year ago, but the two sides have only had limited success in hammering out an agreement for disengagement of rival soldiers deployed at friction points.The Indian Army and the Chinese PLA have held 11 rounds of talks between corps commander-ranked officers since June 6, 2020, to reduce tensions along the disputed border.The only significant outcome of the military dialogue has been the disengagement of front-line troops and weaponry from Pangong Tso in mid-February after the ninth round of talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-keeps-an-eye-on-pla-movement-in-ladakh-theatre-101623177527058.html
09-06-2021||India||House panel meetings to resume from June 21||After a gap of more than two months, Indian parliamentary committees will resume their meeting from June 21, authorities involved in the planning said on Tuesday.“The chairpersons of the standing committees have been informed that they can resume panel meetings from June 21,” said a senior MP who heads a panel.Officials maintained that June 21 was chosen keeping in mind the ongoing lockdown in some states. Authorities expect that by June 21, the remaining restrictions will be lifted amid an improving Covid situation in large parts of the country.On June 21, the government will also switch to the centralised vaccine programme, in which the Union government will provide free vaccine to the states. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Monday that the states will not have to pay for the vaccines and all adults can receive free vaccines organised by the Centre.When the second wave of Covid hit India in March, leaving the Capital and large parts of the country reeling, many House committees had to cancel their meetings and no new meeting were planned.Indian Parliament could work for only 34 days since the pandemic hit Indian shores in March 2020. The entire winter session of 2020 had to be cancelled while last three other sessions were cut short.The Labour panel, led by Biju Janata Dal member Bhartruhari Mahtab, had planned to meet on April 23 on cotton plantations and scheduled a study tour in April. “We had to cancel both. In my panel, at least 15-16 members are in the NCR [national capital region] or UP and can travel by road to attend any panel meetings. But some of those members were reluctant to come for meetings,” said Mahtab.The panel will now meet on June 23.Earlier, a meeting of the agriculture committee was similarly cancelled, officials said. Another meeting of the IT panel, led by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, had to be cancelled. Usually, three to four meetings of various parliamentary committees are scheduled in a week.Officials said while Covid situation was preventing some lawmakers living in other states to travel to Delhi, many parliamentary officials too, were not attending office and working from home. “So, even if a panel wants to meet, proper arrangement for that meeting might be a challenge,” said a senior official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-meetings-to-resume-from-june-21-101623177468681.html
09-06-2021||India||‘Ulterior motive’: Rajasthan opposes Asaram plea in SC for treatment in Haridwar||New Delhi: The Rajasthan government told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that self-styled godman Asaram Bapu’s request to suspend his sentence so that he can get medical treatment in Uttarakhand’s Haridwar was prompted by an “ulterior motive” and should be rejected.The state government affidavit said Asaram, 83, is admitted to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Jodhpur but “is not cooperating with the doctors for his ulterior motive of shifting the venue of his custody…Such change (of venue) is an abuse of process of law.”The Supreme Court has asked Asaram to respond to the state by Friday.Asaram alias Anshumal is serving a life term in a Jodhpur jail for raping a minor at his ashram in 2013. He was convicted in April 2018 and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in jail.The self-styled godman, who faces a second rape case in neighbouring Gujarat, approached the Supreme Court to seek suspension of his jail term to allow him to get treatment at Haridwar’s Prakash Deep Institute of Ayurvedic Science. On Friday, the Supreme Court asked the Rajasthan government to outline its stand on Asaram’s request that cited his complicated medical condition, advanced age and a complete distrust of allopathic treatment.The Rajasthan government said Asaram can get Ayurvedic treatment in Jodhpur as well. Jodhpur is one of those “rare” places famous for its excellent treatment of both allopathic and Ayurvedic treatment at Ayurveda Hospital, Jodhpur and AIIMS, the government said.Asaram, who filed his petition through advocate Saurabh Ajay Gupta, has contended that neither Jodhpur nor Rajasthan has proper Ayurvedic treatment and it would not be possible for him to be treated as long as he is in Jodhpur jail.To be sure, Asaram had made a similar plea before the Rajasthan high court which relied on the report prepared by AIIMS doctors who found him “stable and fit”.The state government affidavit also underlined that Asaram refused to take medicines prescribed by doctors at AIIMS or undergo medical processes for his cardiac treatment.He suffered from gastrointestinal bleeding for which HC observed that treatment was available at MDM Hospital in the state.The Rajasthan government said Asaram was trying to shift out of the state since he wanted to delay “the pending trial at Gandhi Nagar (Gujarat) and Jodhpur, by malafidely raising such a plea when he is stable and fit.”In the high court, Asaram said he does not want to take the allopathic line of treatment and should be allowed to undergo ayurvedic treatment at his Jodhpur ashram.After considering all aspects, the high court noted that his release on bail will affect the pending trail in Gujarat. It also noted that whenever the convict is taken out of prison for attending court during trial, his followers would form huge congregations resulting in a law and order situation that would increase the risk of spreading the Covid-19 infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ulterior-motive-rajasthan-opposes-asaram-plea-in-sc-for-treatment-in-haridwar-101623177467558.html
09-06-2021||India||Aadhaar-linked voter rolls among reforms being pursued by ECI||The Election Commission of India is pushing for at least five key electoral reforms including making paid news an electoral offence, linking Aadhaar numbers to the electoral roll , and increasing the punishment for filing a false affidavit (to two years of imprisonment), and has written to the government in this regard, officials familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.ECI has written to the law ministry urging it to “expeditiously” address electoral reforms that are pending with the government, which also includes multiple registration dates in a year for new voters, the official added. There are nearly 40 proposals pending with the ministry.Elections in the states of Goa, Manipur, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh are due next year.ECI has been considering a wide range of electoral reforms to usher in digitisation, removing duplication of voters and enabling remote voting for non-resident Indians (NRIs), even migrant workers within the country. “The commission on May 17, sent a reminder to the law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to revisit the reforms,” the official cited in the first instance said.Political leaders and experts argue that while some of the reforms mentioned are good, the focus should instead be on countering hate speech and bringing transparency to the electoral bond process. ECI, however, has highlighted these five reforms in its letter.One, it has proposed that the voters who turn 18 should be able to register more than just once in year. At present, only those who turn 18 as of January 1 are eligible to register as voters. “This causes many people to lose out an entire year where they do not get to vote,” the official said. “The Commission has proposed four dates, January 1, April 1, September 1 and December 1 as prospective registration dates instead.”A second EC official familiar with the matter said that the first time a recommendation on multiple dates of registration was made was in the 1970s (when the voting age was 21).Two, ECI wants to get tough on false affidavits. At present, candidates who furnish false information can be punished with up to six months of imprisonment. The Commission has suggested increasing this to two years. “The present jail term does not result in the disqualification of the candidate,” the first official said. “An increased term can lead to the candidate being disqualified for six years.” A historic Supreme Court judgement in 2013 ruled that a lawmaker sentenced to prison for at least two years will lose membership of the house, be disqualified for the period of the sentence, and for six years after that period as well.Three, ECI wants to make paid news an electoral offense.Four, it has also suggested that advertisements in print media (newspapers, journals) be barred during the silent period, wherein candidates are not allowed to campaign.Five, ECI wants to link Aadhaar data to the electoral roll , part of its plan to eliminate duplication of voter ID cards. “It will also ensure that when a person moves to a different state, their voter ID card does not have to be issued from scratch. It can just be transferred,” the first official said.All the proposed reforms will require amendments to the Representation of People’s Act, 1951.BJP MP Rakesh Sinha said that such reforms are essential to strengthen Indian democracy. “There is need to curb fake and bogus voters and the best way is to link voters with their Aadhaar card,” he said. “This will end the prevailing ailment. Anyone contesting election has moral and constitutional responsibilities to reveal required information but deliberate anomalies are blot on democracy. Such representatives cannot be truthful to their constitutional obligations . Therefore, the move of the EC is just .”Congress MP Manish Tewari, however, argued that the Commission was paying “lip service” and should instead focus on regaining its credibility.. “The EC has absolutely lost the credibility and the confidence of the Indian people,” Tewari said. “It is seen as another arm of the government and before it starts pontificating about reforms, it must work to regain its credibility.”Tewari added that ECI needs to be cognizant that the Madras High Court went to the extent of observing that its officials should be tried for murder because of the “cavalier nature” of formulating the election schedule even as the second wave of the pandemic hit. “It has no credibility for the simple reason that any autonomous institution needs to speak truth to power and only then can they inspire confidence. These reforms are nothing but lip service to try and regain its demolished credibility.”RJD MP Manoj Jha said that the Commission was going for low hanging fruit. “The most important electoral reform needed as of now is total transparency in electoral bonds,” he said. “That should be a priority area for the EC.”He added that the Commission has also not done anything substantial to counter hate speech and polarizing speeches.But former CEC SY Queraishi said that these are long pending reforms. “These have been around for a long time,” he said. “I would be happy if a sixth is added that appointment of election commissioners is by a collegium and elevation to CEC is by seniority so that the two (other election) commissioners do not feel that they are on probation.”According to a former chief election commissioner who did not wish to be named, every CEC tries to push through the reforms, but without much success. “What is more important that the Commission remain autonomous,” the former CEC said.“These reforms are neither major nor significant. Linking of voter id numbers with Aadhaar is particularly dangerous and was even quashed by the Supreme Court. Increasing the punishment is okay but one needs to see how many convictions for false affidavits have been made so far. Paid news will be impossible to define and even harder to prove. What is needed is laws that are implementable,” Jagdeep Chhokar of Association for Democratic Reforms, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-urges-centre-to-expedite-pending-electoral-reforms-101623177347012.html
09-06-2021||India||In a huge shift, India opens channels with Afghan Taliban factions and leaders||India has for the first time opened channels of communication with Afghan Taliban factions and leaders, including Mullah Baradar, against the backdrop of the rapid drawdown of US forces from Afghanistan, people with knowledge of the development have said.The move marks a significant shift from New Delhi’s position of not engaging with the Afghan Taliban in any way and comes at a time when key world powers are veering around to the position that the Taliban will play some part in any future dispensation in Kabul.The outreach is largely being led by Indian security officials and has been limited to Taliban factions and leaders that are perceived as being “nationalist” or outside the sphere of influence of Pakistan and Iran, one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. The outreach has been underway for some months, though it continues to be exploratory in nature, the people said.In the case of Mullah Baradar, the co-founder of the Afghan Taliban and one of the group’s main negotiators, the first person cited above said messages were exchanged by the two sides though there was no confirmation of a meeting. There have also been conversations with other Taliban factions despite a lack of trust on both sides, the people said.Also Read: In Afghanistan, India must embrace the role of peacemakerThe outreach to Baradar is significant as he signed the deal with then US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in February 2020 that paved the way for the current withdrawal of American troops. Baradar held various posts when the Taliban was in power during 1996-2001. He was captured by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in Karachi in February 2010 after he began negotiations with the Hamid Karzai government in Kabul. Baradar was freed by Pakistan in 2018 and became the head of the Taliban office in Doha.India is the largest regional contributor to Afghanistan’s reconstruction and development efforts with pledges of $3 billion but has lagged behind other regional players such as Russia, China and Iran in establishing contacts with the Taliban, largely because of the group’s long-standing links with the Pakistani military establishment. However, the perception that the Taliban is no longer a monolithic organisation and some factions may not be completely under the sway of Pakistani generals has gained ground in recent years.“We have tried the earlier option of not engaging the Taliban and putting all our efforts into the Northern Alliance,” said a second person, referring to the united front created by Tajiks and other ethnic groups that was backed by India, Russia and Iran in its campaign against the former Taliban regime in the late 1990s.“But there has been a huge shift since then and there are some who think it might be better to have a line of communication with some Taliban leaders,” the second person said. The people made it very clear that India’s outreach didn’t include the Haqqani Network or members of the Quetta Shura, who are seen as proxies of the Pakistani military.There was no formal response from the external affairs ministry on these developments.The people made it clear the outreach to Taliban leaders was proceeding in parallel with New Delhi’s engagement with different segments of the Afghan leadership, including President Ashraf Ghani’s government and key leaders such as former president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the High Council for National Reconciliation.A visit to Kabul last month by joint secretary JP Singh, the external affairs ministry’s point person for Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, was part of the continuing engagement with Afghan leaders. “Singh engaged with various groups and made an assessment of the situation on the ground and got a first-hand sense of things,” the first person cited above said.The people also said sharp differences remained between India’s position on matters such as preserving the gains made in Afghanistan under a democratic system, including the rights of women and minorities, and the Taliban’s insistence on establishing an Islamic emirate. “However, it appears that some Taliban leaders realise that there will need to be some accommodation of India’s role in Afghanistan and such an understanding will also fit in with the Taliban’s efforts to project themselves as a group that the West can work with,” a third person said.As the latest report by a monitoring committee of the UN Security Council pointed out, the Taliban hasn’t cut its ties with al-Qaeda or foreign groups such as the Haqqani Network, and this continues to be a worry in New Delhi. However, the feeling in the Indian capital is that things are better now than last year, when it appeared that India had very little say in the Afghan peace process driven by the Trump administration.“There are worries about the pace of the US withdrawal and the general feeling is that it will be completed well before the September 2021 deadline. But the position isn’t as hopeless as last year when it seemed as if India was being kept out of all the crucial discussions,” the third person said.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about how the situation in Afghanistan will pan out after the withdrawal of US troops. “But what’s certain is civil war and a Taliban takeover of Kabul in months, if not weeks, without a political settlement. Therefore, it appears India is moving to protect its interests by opening a dialogue with the Taliban,” he said.“Moreover, by shedding its traditional reluctance to talk to the Taliban, India is maintaining its relevance in the Afghan peace process. This is the only way by which India can reduce the adverse impact of a deterioration in Afghanistan’s security situation,” Patil said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-india-opens-communication-channels-with-afghan-taliban-factions-101623165405972.html
09-06-2021||India||Will consider bail if you eat client’s food: SC to lawyer in adulteration case||A lawyer arguing for the anticipatory bail in a food adulteration case was left befuddled on Tuesday when the Supreme Court said it will consider allowing his plea if he and his family were willing to eat what his clients were selling. As the lawyer, Puneet Jain, took time to reflect and the court said that it was not inclined to give anticipatory bail in a case like this, he chose to withdraw the petition.“Will you or your family eat this food? We will consider allowing the bail if your answer is a yes,” a bench of justices Indira Banerjee and MR Shah told advocate Jain. The court asked Jain why it was difficult for him to answer such a basic question. “Or is it that let other people die? Why should we bother?”Jain’s clients Prawar Goyal and Vineet Goyal moved the court seeking pre-arrest bail in the case registered against them in December in Madhya Pradesh’s Neemuch district.Jain pressed for their anticipatory bail, saying the charges pertaining to food adulteration were bailable and therefore, it will not serve any purpose to arrest his clients first. He added only the charge of cheating was non-bailable for which his clients were required to secure bail from a trial court. But no such offence was made out as per the First Information Report, he added.The two are accused of selling wheat after polishing it with non-edible golden offset colour. Several thousand kilograms of polished wheat was confiscated from their premises after a raid in December. The two have been charged under the Indian Penal Code sections related to food adulteration and sale of noxious food items.Last week, another bench of the court refused to grant anticipatory bail to an accused in a food adulteration case, observing that these offences were against the entire society.“You are trying to kill not just one person but the entire society by selling spurious food. Such offences cannot be taken lightly,” the bench of justices BR Gavai and Krishna Murari commented while refusing bail to one Dibyalochan Behera.Behera’s lawyer argued on June 4 that the ghee he was accused of adulterating was not meant for eating since it was being supplied only to the temples for lighting lamps.Amused by the submission, the bench retorted: “This is just so good. And what was your chilli sauce for? Was it for decorating the deity or for abhisheka (consecration) of the idols? Not a single product of yours is unadulterated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-you-and-your-family-eat-this-sc-asks-lawyer-in-food-adulteration-case-101623154905037.html
09-06-2021||India||Govt looks at shorter monsoon session in July, deferment to August||The government and Parliament authorities are exploring the possibilities of holding the monsoon session of Parliament for a shorter duration in July or deferring it to August-September, depending on the Covid-19 situation, functionaries familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.The last three Parliament sessions had to be cut short due to the same reason, with the winter session in both Houses being skipped altogether. The monsoon session is usually held in July.“According to the Constitution, a session must begin within six months of the previous one. So, the government has time till September 24 to call the monsoon session,” said a senior official, adding that no formal discussion on the matter has started.A senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader said that the party has informally discussed the possibility of holding a short session, perhaps in the first half of July. “The numbers have only now started to go down so we will have to wait and watch for some time. There was a suggestion that the session could be held in July so that if there is a third wave in September, which is being anticipated, then Parliament would meet for a fortnight at least,” said the leader, requesting anonymity.Another BJP functionary said the session’s duration will depend on factors such as pending legislative business and the ability of outstation MPs to attend the House. “In some states, the (number of) daily infections are still high so the MPs might not find it easy to travel,” this leader said, asking not to be named.Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad recently told Hindustan Times in an interview that the government is keen to push the data protection bill in the upcoming session, Covid permitting.When asked whether their party has had any internal discussion of whether they will attend the session, a Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP said there has been no official communication from the government so far. “But we got a sense that if numbers come down in June across the country, there might be a shorter, 15-day session in July- August and then another short session in November,” the BJD MP said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-looks-at-shorter-monsoon-session-in-july-deferment-to-august-101623094512282.html
09-06-2021||India||Panel has failed to resolve issues: Sachin Pilot||Last year’s crisis in Rajasthan that the Congress papered over by setting up a committee to address the issues raised by then deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot against chief minister Ashok Gehlot have resurfaced, with the former expressing his displeasure at the lack of action.“It has now been 10 months. I was given to understand that there would be swift action by the committee, but now half of the term is done, and those issues haven’t been resolved. It is unfortunate that so many of the party workers who worked and gave their all for getting us the mandate are not being heard,” said Pilot, refusing to elaborate on his next move. One of his key supporters, MLA Hemaram Choudhary, resigned suddenly last month.HT learns the central leadership of the Congress is trying to work out a cabinet reshuffle in Rajasthan.Pilot told Hindustan Times that the Congress high command has failed to deliver on the promises that were made to him when he along with 18 legislators returned to the party after a month-long drama.In July last year, Pilot and his supporters left Jaipur to camp at a secret location in Haryana, threatening the stability of the Ashok Gehlot government. Pilot was removed as Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president, and it was only when the Gandhis intervened and set up a committee under general secretary Ajay Maken that he returned to the fold. However, the dilemma for the central leadership now is to find a solution that is acceptable to both chief minister Gehlot and Pilot.“It is not the right time for me to speak,’’ said Maken when contacted by HT. “However, there are vacancies in the Rajasthan government, and they are likely to be filled soon,” he added.A cabinet reshuffle isn’t a straightforward solution. There are nine vacancies in the Rajasthan cabinet as there can be 30 ministers but only 21 currently. Of the nine vacancies, three were created when Pilot supporters were sacked last year for the rebellion. Now, Pilot may want more of his supporters to find a place in the cabinet, but Gehlot is pitching for independents and former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) legislators who saved his government during the floor test last August.“Just like Pilot may have been promised that his grievances will be heard, these independent legislators were also promised they would be accommodated if they supported the Congress. This cannot be ignored ,” said a Congress leader on condition of anonymity.The leader quoted above said that they appreciated Pilot’s contribution which led to a consolidation of Gujjar votes for the Congress in the state, but the chief minister had also proved himself by winning the recent bypolls. He attributes the 10-month delay to the death of senior leader Ahmed Patel , as he was the crisis manager working out the details of Pilot’s return. But the January reorganisation of the state party unit accommodated Pilot’s team . For example, of the eight general secretaries, at least three are Pilot’s candidates and one of his team members has also been made vice president, this leader added.“Ashok Gehlot is the senior most Congress person that we have right now as he is a three-time chief minister and was a Union minister before that. He also got 10% more votes in the bypolls than he did in 2018, so how can we not go with him?” asked this person.However, there is agreement within the party that a solution acceptable to Pilot will have to be found, and that might mean that one of the two leaders takes on a bigger role in the central organisation. The chief minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.‘’The only way to sort things out will be a genuine commitment of both of them to work with each other, which is easier said than done. Gehlot has to show a large heart and accommodate Pilot who must — on his part — be comfortable to contest the 2023 election under Gehlot’s leadership. Till a public announcement of this kind is made, these exercises of cabinet reshuffle will be cosmetic and in fact, will end up creating more problems for both camps,’’ said political commentator Sanjeev Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-has-failed-to-resolve-issues-sachin-pilot-101623089773631.html
09-06-2021||India||More nominated members joining parties now: RS data||In the long history of the Rajya Sabha, its nominated members have periodically joined political parties — with the trend becoming stronger in recent years, during which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has seen the most nominated MPs join it.Since 1952, 28 of 138 nominated members have joined either the Congress or the BJP and given up their nominated status, according to data available with the Rajya Sabha secretariat; 15 of them joined the Congress and 13 joined the BJP. The numbers stack up in favour of the Congress given its long stints in power.In the last seven years, 9 nominated members joined the BJP including Sonal Man Singh, Shakal Ram, Gopi Suresh, Rakesh Sinha and Raghunath Mohapatra. During the previous NDA government headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, 3 MPs, Hema Malini, Narayan Singh and Dara Singh, joined the party.Even Navjot Singh Sidhu, who is now in the Congress, was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in April 2016 and subsequently chose to join the BJP -- but he quit the Rajya Sabha in July after he parted ways with the BJP.The Indian Constitution says 12 people “having special knowledge or practical experience” in respect of such matters as literature, science, art and social service shall be nominated by the President in the Upper House of Parliament. The Constitution also allows any nominated MP to join a political party.The tenth schedule of the constitution says, “...in any other case, be deemed to belong to the political party of which he becomes, or, as the case may be, first becomes, a member before the expiry of six months from the date on which he takes his seat after complying with the requirements of article 99 or, as the case may be, article 188”.This March, nominated member Swapan Dasgupta resigned from the House as he didn’t opt to join the BJP during the window of six months but stood as the party’s poll candidate in the West Bengal assembly election. He has subsequently been nominated as a Rajya Sabha MP again; there is nothing in he rules against members of a party being nominated.Joachim Alva, a prominent Christian leader involved in India’s freedom movement was the first nominated member who joined political party after coming to Rajya Sabha. He became a Congress member in 1968.The Upper House of Parliament has seen stalwarts such as painter MF Husain, mathematician Satyendra Nath Bose, actor Prithviraj Kapoor, writer Amrita Pritam, lawyer Ram Jethmalani, journalist Khushwant Singh, boxer Mary Kom and film-maker Shyam Benegal as its nominated members. These MPs enjoy same privileges as other parliamentarians but they can’t vote in Presidential elections as they are nominated by the President .While a nominated member is free to join a political party, experts say this is not a a healthy trend for parliamentary democracy. “The Constitution says that people of eminence in certain fields will get represented in the House. The system was created to allow these experts to give their free opinion on various policies and legislation,” said former secretary general of Lok Sabha P Sreedharan.“But if they join political parties, they too, would be bound by the party’s views and whip and their freedom would be curtailed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-nominated-members-joining-parties-now-rs-data-101622919565338.html
09-06-2021||Today's||For the diaspora, ties that bind — and divide||One of the most heartening aspects of India’s heartbreaking struggle with the deadly second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has been the outpouring of support from the Indian diaspora.In the United Kingdom (UK), an independent Gofundme campaign organised by British Indians exceeded its initial goal of raising £160,000 to purchase 200 oxygen concentrators in just one day. The India Philanthropy Alliance — comprising 14 diaspora groups in the United States (US) working toward humanitarian and development goals in India — has raised millions of dollars in Covid relief. Such stories, from a range of countries where Indian immigrants have settled in large numbers, are legion.Our research on Indian-Americans, now the second largest immigrant group in the US, suggests that the ties that bind the diaspora to their homeland are resilient, even among members of the second generation who may lack the direct connection of their parents to their ancestral homeland. But these feelings of solidarity simultaneously coexist with forces that can increase estrangement — including some that originate from within India itself.In a previous column in these pages (On India, a fracture in the diaspora; February 10), we warned that the Indian-American community is increasingly divided on political, religious, and generational lines. Political polarisation in India had not stopped at the water’s edge; it has been exported to the US.In our most recent study — drawing on the findings of the Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS), a nationally representative survey of Indian-Americans we conducted in September 2020 — we dig deeper into the social realities of Indian-American diaspora. Once more, the warning signs of polarisation are evident. Fortunately, at an individual level, religious polarisation among diaspora members of different faiths is less pronounced than one might fear. But partisan polarisation linked to political preferences both in India and the US is rife.Individuals associated with opposing political camps are much less comfortable fraternising with one another than with members of their own “tribe”. Interestingly, this polarisation is asymmetric: Indian- Americans who identify as Democrats are much less comfortable having close friends who are Republicans than the converse. The same is true of Congress supporters vis-à-vis supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). How much of this has to do with structural factors as opposed to transient forces such as the leadership of Donald Trump and Narendra Modi remains an open question.While nearly 30% of Indian-Americans indicate that domestic politics in India is exacerbating divisions within the Indian-American community, this remains a minority view. A plurality (40%) of Indian-Americans does not believe that domestic politics is dividing the Indian diaspora in the US, and one-third does not have an opinion.For those who perceive that polarisation in India is negatively impacting the diaspora, religion, political leadership, and political parties are identified as the primary culprits (figure 1). Many of these factors are inextricably linked. For Indian-Americans who view the rise of Hindu majoritarianism in India sceptically, for example, it is unclear how they might apportion blame given that religion, leadership, and political parties are all deeply intertwined.Where does this leave the Indian-American community and its role in promoting US-India relations? Divisions in the community are manifest and are often linked to political disputes in India, potentially weakening the diaspora’s cohesion. However, recent events suggest that while we should be clear-eyed about the fissures within the Indian diaspora and the manner in which India’s raucous politics may be fuelling them, we should not overstate the nature of the threat.Large majorities of both foreign and US-born Indian-Americans say being Indian is important to them. For more than two decades, the Indian diaspora in the US has been a critical bridge-builder between the two countries. Indeed, the community remains bullish about the future: 70% state that they think that the Indian-American community has a positive impact on US-India relations.In fact, it is worth noting that many of the same diaspora leaders in America, including progressive Members of Congress such as Pramila Jayapal and Ro Khanna, once vilified by some in the Indian government for their criticism of the Modi regime, have been among the most forceful in urging the Joe Biden administration to come to India’s aid.Diaspora leaders who oppose many of the present Indian government’s policies have picked up the phones, badgered their elected representatives, and catalysed tweetstorms urging the US government to act. Many Indian-Americans are nervous about India’s political trajectory — slightly more Indian-Americans believe the country is on the wrong track than those who believe it is headed in the right direction — but their anxieties are not reflective of a broader anti-India sentiment. The vast majority of IAAS respondents state they are both pro-India and critical of the government’s policies. To quote Abraham Lincoln, “he has a right to criticize, who has a heart to help.”Therein lies an important lesson, for home and abroad. Treating disputes based on policy or politics as indicative of animosity toward India is not only inaccurate, it is unwise — continuing down this path risks creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.

09-06-2021||Today's||Laws and criminal justice: Where the Indian elite can’t secede||It is extremely important that the Supreme Court is re-examining colonial era sedition laws, which were repealed in the United Kingdom (UK) itself, but which no government in India has revoked, and in fact, each has used to stifle dissent. Sedition laws, however, are at the apex of a mountain of laws that need to be examined with fresh societal eyes.Most of us believe we are good, law-abiding citizens. We have faith that laws are made with the highest public and private good in mind. We try to obey all the laws that we know of. By doing so, we participate in a society that is justly governed by the rule of law. We don’t worry much about going to jail or about the state of our prisons. We cannot imagine anything we do that could land us behind bars. And if we got caught by mistake, surely there would be a way around the problem? Jail is for others.Is it time to revisit all these assumptions?Many of our laws, when examined even cursorily, do not appear to propose punishments or jail sentences proportionate to the crime. Many also shift the burden of public order from the State and its apparatus to the individual citizen and his actions. These kind of laws can turn ordinary citizens into criminals with one deadly strike. Sadly, many have been passed without any legislative debate. Nor has there been widespread public discourse on things that should keep us all awake at night.Also Read | Before PM Modi changed Covid vaccine policy, a nudge from the Supreme CourtFor example, did you even know that you could get arrested if you did not properly walk your dog? The maximum sentence is three months. Did you realise that flying a kite with banned thread can lock you up for two years? That driving an uninsured vehicle could get you three months in jail?These are just a few examples. Yet, most citizens have found it difficult to apply themselves to issues of law-making or criminal justice.Apart from all the harsh, even draconian, laws that have been around for decades and even centuries, there have been new laws and rules that give sweeping powers to the State. Mercifully, there has been a lively public debate on recent laws around free speech and privacy. In one such victory, Section 66A of the IT Act was struck down as unconstitutional. Other regressive speech laws still exist, but partly because of the ubiquitous use of social media, more citizens are realising the chilling effect on their lives.Let’s take another recent example. The government invoked the Disaster Management Act of 2005, for the proper management of the pandemic. But some of the rules pertaining to Covid-19 could potentially make millions of citizens susceptible to sentencing, if they were to be strictly implemented. The spreading of fake news about Covid -19, including forwarding WhatsApp messages which are later found false, could attract up to a year in prison. Technically, not wearing compulsory face masks, without reasonable cause, could also put you in jail for up to one year.Some of these laws are simply unimplementable or may not be on the radar of the officers of the State, who have the powers to make arrests under them.But the point is that they are still on the books. And circumstances could turn in a way that someone could get into more trouble than is warranted by an unintentional infringement. All the laws I mention above have actually resulted in arrests.Also Read | Doctors move SC seeking postponement of AIIMS INI-CET examShould such laws with such disproportionate punishment even exist? Should they be better understood before they are passed? Do they even serve the purpose and intent with which they are framed – usually public order and safety?There is not enough evidence to show that severe punishment acts as the deterrent it is meant to be. Research shows that imprisonment under harsh conditions often results in a greater rate of more violent recidivism. On the other hand, there is encouraging data emerging from restorative justice systems, including the open jails in India. Can we use such evidence to re-imagine our retributive justice system to be more just, more humane and more effective at reducing crime?So far, we, the elite, have not participated in serious public discourse on law-making and prison reform. The series of lockdowns caused many of us to experience a pale yet frightening imitation of what an actual incarceration might feel like.Is this an opportunity for society, samaaj, to participate more vigorously in debating laws that criminalise too easily? And from there, to become more involved in the broader issues of criminal justice, including the human rights infringements in our overcrowded prisons, with 70% of inmates being potentially innocent undertrials?The Supreme Court has now turned the spotlight on sedition. The pandemic has thrown light on the Disaster Management Act. It’s time for deeper conversations with parliamentarians and state legislators — our law makers, on how better laws can lead to a better society. In the case of Section 66A of the IT Act, such a dialogue led to its annulment.India’s elite has managed to secede from every common public service — be it education, healthcare, transport, or energy. Pollution and the pandemic awakened us to the rude reality that we cannot secede from bad air and bad germs. Well, we cannot secede from bad laws either.Rohini Nilekani is chairperson, ArghyamThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/laws-and-criminal-justice-where-the-indian-elite-can-t-secede-101623237487107.html
09-06-2021||Today's||The four dimensions that will shape Quad||Three months after its virtual summit on March 12, the Quad — composed of the United States, India, Japan and Australia — is attaining greater consolidation, even as its challenges acquire a sharper edge. The coalescing of four maritime democracies in the Indo-Pacific to address the China challenge compels global attention.Quad has begun planning for its first in-person summit, to be held in Washington. The goal is to strengthen “The Spirit of the Quad” (the title of the summit’s joint statement) through expansion of partnership in vaccines, climate and critical technologies. Cooperation for infrastructure development, supply chain resilience and maritime security are also emerging as priorities.In this context, Quad’s four dimensions merit a close look.First, India-US ties received a boost during external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s substantive discussions in Washington in late May. His interactions with key figures of the administration, Congress and corporate America focused attention on advancing cooperation in the fight against Covid, fine-tuning the strategy to deal with China, and deepening of bilateral security, defence, and economic relations.His informal meeting with Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, underlined the vital significance of intelligence-related cooperation in countering terrorism, the dynamic in Afghanistan after US troop withdrawal, and China’s aggressive postures in eastern Ladakh and the Indian Ocean. These consultations have resulted in a closer convergence, which is good news for Quad.Also Read | US has to revitalise alliances and partnerships, outcompete China: BlinkenSecond, the European dimension in the geopolitical matrix has assumed special significance. Leading European countries — France, Germany, United Kingdom and the Netherlands — have been working on their Indo-Pacific policies. This was followed by the European Union (EU) announcing its Indo-Pacific strategy in April. EU is set to “reinforce its strategic focus, presence and action” in the region, based on the promotion of democracy, rule of law, human rights and freedom of navigation.However, EU made it clear that its Indo-Pacific strategy was “not anti-China.” India helped its own case with the historic India-EU Summit (on May 8), aiming to expand its relationship with an important global player.Third, the ASEAN dimension represents the Quad’s vulnerability. ASEAN nations have been largely silent on the Quad’s assertiveness. While China’s continuing aggression is ignored, Quad’s will to constrain it is seen as a new cold war.Despite daily provocations ranging from harassment of Philippine fishermen to Malaysian air space violations, Chinese measures are underplayed, partly out of fear and partly economic temptations.A major ASEAN grievance is the Biden administration’s delay in connecting with ASEAN capitals at the highest political levels. Another is the Quad’s relative silence and inaction on Myanmar, even as ASEAN’s mediation initiative has received public support from China.Four, the Pacific dimension goes beyond the US working closely with Japan, South Korea and the Philippines to enhance maritime security coordination concerning China. It relates to a promising turn for the Quad in the South Pacific.Also Read | India throws weight behind Quad groupAgainst the recent background of public differences on China between Australia and New Zealand, Prime Ministers Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern held cordial discussions in Queenstown on May 31. A common way forward to address the China challenge was crafted. In their joint statement, they expressed “serious concern” over developments in the South China Sea as well as human rights violations in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Beijing reacted adversely by expressing its “firm opposition” to the joint statement.Two additional policy suggestions may help. First, as unlikely as it is at the moment, despite a deep-seated hostility towards Russia, the US administration needs to initiate a rapprochement with Moscow. The Joe Biden-Vladimir Putin Summit in Geneva on 16 June offers an opening. Will American policymakers remember how the Richard Nixon-Henry Kissinger team executed a strategic breakthrough in 1971, by weakening China’s alliance with Soviet Union? Today, Russia needs to be weaned off China.Second, Quad’s conflict with China is not only about maritime security and rule of law, but also about economy and new technology. A comprehensive plan is necessary for both facets.Rajiv Bhatia is distinguished fellow, Gateway House and a former ambassador to MyanmarThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-four-dimensions-that-will-shape-quad-101623237190236.html
09-06-2021||Today's||Reflecting sunlight with pollutants will not save the planet||In the midst of rising annual temperatures, it is difficult to imagine freezing weather in Chennai. Incredibly, there are reports that the mercury plummeted across much of the Indian subcontinent (including Chennai) in 1815 (though to what extent is debatable). The cause of that dip over two centuries ago is now being investigated as a solution to the climate crisis.In 1815, Mount Tambora erupted in Indonesia. This was the largest volcanic eruption in human history. Around 100,000 died in the immediate aftermath. Global weather patterns were disrupted. The following year was known as “The Year Without a Summer” because of the drop in temperatures globally.Incidentally, Mary Godwin conceived of Frankenstein that year while she was stuck near Lake Geneva due to bad weather (as part of a ghost-story writing game with Lord Byron and Percy Shelley).Also Read | India may have lost 3% of its GDP due to global warmingMore recently, in 1991, Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines gave scientists a chance to examine the fallout on weather. Scientists who measured the effects of the eruption calculated that the Earth was half a degree Centigrade cooler for the next 15 months.These volcanic eruptions have given credence one of the main ideas behind “solar geoengineering”. Solar geoengineering is a broad term used to refer to emergency measures to lower temperatures on earth by reflecting sunlight back into space. It sounds like science fiction, except it is very real and it and it could have major consequences.Solar geoengineering measures that have been floated include launching gigantic mirrors into space. A more realistic measure is marine cloud brightening which involves injecting chemicals from ships to low-lying clouds to enhance their sunlight reflecting ability. The effects of these measures are, however, regional and temporary.Scientists have been debating another method as well. Injection of large amounts of sulphate aerosols into a part of the atmosphere known as the stratosphere has been proposed. We know this might lower temperatures from studying volcanic eruptions. Up in the stratosphere, sulphate aerosols reflect sunlight causing cooling below. Scientists have calculated that a 1-degree drop in temperature might be possible by releasing aerosols from airplanes for as little as a few hundred million dollars annually. This is much cheaper than decarbonising the economy.Solar geoengineering by releasing reflective sulphate aerosols offers the promise of a cheap, and effective solution to the climate crisis, but beneath the surface it is not a true solution. The effects of solar geoengineering are temporary.Aerosolised sulphates fall out of the stratosphere over a few years and they leave greenhouse gases in the air.Solar geoengineering does not solve the problem created by emissions or ocean acidification. Since the measures are temporary and the underlying causes remain, ceasing to pump sulphate aerosols might have even more pronounced climate effects. No one knows how long we would have to pump pollutants into the stratosphere, and breaks due to global war or disagreements could be catastrophic.In addition, we simply do not know what global or local effects might result from solar geoengineering using sulphate aerosols. Small-scale experiments and computer modelling have been proposed but they may not capture the full range of effects — from drought to catastrophic monsoon failure to ozone-layer damage. The tint of the sky might change from blue to white. Blocking out sunlight might also reduce photosynthesis everywhere, disrupting agriculture and ecosystems.Modern history is replete with examples of how meddling with the environment has led to unpredictable outcomes. Chlorofluorocarbons were considered harmless but their use led to the hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica. Timely detection and a ban on the use of these chemicals averted a bigger catastrophe.Finally, there are moral and behavioural concerns with releasing sulphate aerosols from airplanes. Who decides when to use it? Some parts of the world might end up with more favourable temperatures than others. In such a scenario, it is easy to imagine a dystopian climate arms race with one country trying to cool the environment with sulphate aerosols and another trying to increase temperature by increasing their greenhouse gas emissions.The only true solution to the climate crisis is to decarbonise the global economy. If we put off addressing the problem because we think we have other options, we raise a moral hazard. We may feel we have insurance to push the problem into the future, but the truth is we are at a tipping point now. The irony of trying to change the climate by releasing large volumes of pollutants into the atmosphere is that we would be doing what precipitated the climate crisis in the first place.The longer we wait, the more the Earth will warm. And as this happens, the scenarios that are forecast are bleak — rising sea levels, severe weather, prolonged droughts, and famines. But as we head towards the doomsday scenario, countries may also be willing to gamble on untested ideas.Research on solar geoengineering might be necessary in the future, but it should be considered only after other options have been exhausted. Ultimately, I agree with Erle Ellis in Anthropocene that “solar geoengineering using stratospheric sulphates is a shining example of solving one problem by creating an even bigger one.”Anirban Mahapatra, a microbiologist by training, is the author of COVID-19: Separating Fact From Fiction These are his personal views||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/reflecting-sunlight-with-pollutants-will-not-save-the-planet-101623225291252.html
09-06-2021||Today's||For Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh, a test on Indian defence||The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) gave the long awaited green signal on June 4 for the acquisition of six conventional submarines for the Indian Navy (IN) as part of Project 75 I. More than 60% of the IN’s conventional boats (as submarines are referred to) are over 30 years old and there is a steady decline in the total number of fully operational submarines. Hence, this approval is welcome even if the commissioning of the first fully ops submarine is a decade away.The long and complex process of acquiring a major platform for the Indian military will begin with the issue of a request for proposals (RFP) and prospective Indian suppliers of the new boat will make a bid for what is estimated to be a ₹43,000 crore (US $5.9bn) order. In the process, they would have to form a “partnership” with one of the five shortlisted foreign manufacturers.Also Read | In the digital era, the rise of techno-feudalismThis approval has the potential to give a much needed fillip to warship-building in India and, if managed successfully, it will provide substance to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s objective of India becoming a credible interlocutor in the maritime domain that now is a key area of Quad’s focus.However, there are a few caveats related to India’s submarine building experience in general, and some characteristics about 75 I in particular, that merit notice. The submarine project is one of four that have been placed in the strategic partnership (SP) basket of the MoD’s Defence Acquisition Policy (DAP) 2020 — the other three big ticket items being fighter aircraft, helicopters and armoured vehicles. India has modest indigenous design capability in these sectors and whatever is manufactured in India is either assembled or manufactured under license.Arriving at a final DAP has been a long and convoluted process for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, which has prioritised indigenisation of military inventory since 2014. Finalising a comprehensive blueprint, let alone meaningful indigenisation, remained elusive for Modi 1.0. PM Modi was handicapped in his first term by not being able to have the same minister for a full five-year term as Raksha Mantri (RM). This has been redressed by the appointment of the current incumbent — the highly regarded Rajnath Singh.The success of the P 75 I project, or lack thereof, will have a bearing on the other three major SP projects and India’s resolve to acquire atmanirbharta, or self-reliance, in this domain. There is thus a need to accord high priority to how this project unfolds in the years ahead.India has had a chequered past with submarine-building projects. Towards the end of the Cold War, India acquired four submarines from the then West Germany, with a provision to build a line in India at Mazagon Docks, Mumbai and progressively acquire indigenous submarine building capability. Regrettably, a financial transgression was reported in this deal, as also in the Bofors artillery gun acquisition of the late 1980’s and aspersions were cast against the then PM Rajiv Gandhi. The HDW submarine building was scuttled peremptorily.While the HDW-Bofors scandal rocked Indian politics, the long-term negative impact on India’s military procurement policies has been disastrous. Acquisition decisions became more complex, the procedure turned labyrinth-like. And officials tasked to enable the final outcome became hesitant and more concerned about RTIs being filed at a future date.Cutting through the accreted bureaucratic bramble is a daunting task but this gauntlet has to be picked up. The trajectory of P 75 I could be the bellwether to India’s ability to acquire a credible index of indigenous capability in manufacturing major military platforms with foreign original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).India has invested heavily in defence public sector units (DPSU), but they have not been able to deliver what the military needs — and hence import dependency persists. The challenge for Rajnath Singh will be to provide the political leadership to synergise the innate strengths of the three entities – the DPSU, the private Indian entity and the foreign OEM to make the SP model for submarines a success.This would be an enviable legacy for Modi 2.0.Commodore (retired) C Uday Bhaskar is director, Society for Policy StudiesThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/for-narendra-modi-and-rajnath-singh-a-test-on-indian-defence-101623157124951.html
09-06-2021||Today's||In the digital era, the rise of techno-feudalism||Technological disruptions are causing far-reaching upheavals in the economy, society and polity. The latest standoff between India and foreign companies over IT regulations is part of a worldwide trend. It is indicative of the growing power of tech companies to defy and undermine State power.Technological revolutions are the only true revolutions in history that transform a society’s economic, social and political organisation. Over the past few centuries, technological progress enabled the decline of feudalism due to industrialisation, the rise of industrial cities, induced labour mobility, and the transfer of economic power from the landed elites to the industrial- and middle-class. It culminated in the rise of the nation and nation-State and a central government strong enough to curb the arbitrary powers of feudal and aristocratic elements.Also Read | After the pandemic, the centrality of the Blue Economy in recoveryBut the same technological progress is now giving rise to a new tech-aristocracy while the State’s power slowly withers away.This phenomenon can be called techno-feudalism, which rests on three pillars: Sheer computing power, the unprecedented concentration of economic power in a few private hands, and the ability of tech-aristocracy to shape society. Old feudalism rested on control of land, while techno-feudalism rests on control over digital real estate. The old feudal class enjoyed exemptions designed to facilitate the accumulation of arbitrary powers. Techno-feudalism has exemptions such as intermediary rules, loopholes to bypass data localisation and tax compliance.Old feudalism preached a doctrine of birth-based inequality. Techno-feudalism fetishises meritocracy to justify its breaks on social mobility, except at the very top of the tech-aristocracy. Old feudal fiefdoms were small and deliberately fragmented to control the concentration of too much power by making economies of scale impossible. Such restrictions are gone under techno-feudalism, as is evident by the rise of the Big Tech, which dwarfs the industrial and financial elites. Big tech are not monopolist but they own the market itself.The old feudal class presented itself as the champion of liberty against the tyranny of the king and spoke a language of rights and duties while suppressing those at its mercy. Techno-feudalism positions itself as upholding liberty against the State and speaks a language of rights and civic duty while amassing arbitrary power.Like old feudalism, techno-feudalism corrupts and subverts the law and all branches of government to such an extent that governments find it impossible to take any action that could control their rapacious behaviour. And just like the old feudal class, the new tech-aristocracy is constantly engaged in a turf war to capture more digital real estate and augment its control over data and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Many Big Tech companies resemble the East India Company. They exercise monopoly power, are rich, indulge in corrupt practices and subversion of the system while refusing to pay legitimate taxes or follow sovereign laws.The new tech-aristocracy can reshape society. Never in history have so few people had the power to decide the public consensus while remaining detached from the masses. It is this ability that has made them too powerful for any country to handle. It was visible during the Australia-Google standoff or in Twitter’s shenanigans in India and across the world. And the less we talk about behemoths such as Amazon, the better.Tech-aristocracy has the power to intervene in local politics and unseat governments via subtle manipulation of political discourse by leveraging their control over data and means of communication. This new aristocracy has spawned its own brand of ideological constructs and foot soldiers to take on the power of the State.It has acquired stakes in newspapers, magazines, and new means of entertainments such as over-the-top (OTT) platforms. It is moving fast to control the future of education by setting up edutech companies. We already think about fintech when talking money, and not banks.The anarchist and woke ideas empowered and favoured by techno-feudalism serve the function of weakening the existing political order and legitimacy of the State, while deflecting attention from the concentration of power by the new tech-aristocracy.The rise of social media and extreme socio-political polarisation has gone together. The political intermediation process is breaking down, and the democratic consensus is ever more difficult to achieve. It is making societies increasingly ungovernable, thus weakening the State and sapping it of its legitimacy.Tech-aristocracy enjoys arbitrary powers in matters of free speech. It seeks to impose its narrow homogeneous worldview over the rest of the world. Defiance can invite censorship, defamation, de-platforming, even purge from the internet, which in today’s world is as good as an exile in the wilderness. The ideas of due process, the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, and the right to appeal and seek judicial redress are being rendered meaningless, with the new tech-aristocracy imposing its private laws and acting as judge, jury and executioner and recreating a world eerily similar to medieval feudalism.This is accompanied by a stagnation in the socioeconomic mobility of the masses due to restructuring of the economy caused by the same tech disruption that has created the conditions for techno-feudalism. Jobs are disappearing. The middle-class is being squeezed. And more people are trying to eke out a living from the gig economy, which effectively reduces them to a new serfdom.It is difficult to predict the future as technological transformations cannot be stopped.But starting a discussion outside the academic and intellectual orthodoxy and narrow political contestations may be a step forward.Abhinav Prakash Singh is an assistant professor, economics, Sri Ram College of Commerce The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-the-digital-era-the-rise-of-technofeudalism-101623153524535.html
09-06-2021||Today's||As India flies, it will be environmentally responsible||Around the globe, civil aviation has been a sector that has propelled economic growth, promoted social development and created access. On the other hand, it has also had a limited detrimental impact on our environment, especially on the local environment, as aircraft and airport operations contribute to air, water, soil and noise pollution.In October 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) decided to launch an initiative to limit emissions from international aviation. Global consciousness around this has driven numerous policy-driven solutions to be implemented in the sector regarding the efficient operation of aircraft and airports.Also Read | Covid-19: Airlines urge G7 to adopt data-driven approach to reopening travelAs we marked the World Environment Day on June 5 — as a part of the United Nations Decade of Ecosystem Restoration — it is fitting to look at the Indian civil aviation sector and the efforts taken to step into the next era of aviation, with environmental and ecosystem preservation as a core tenet.Pre-Covid, India was the third-largest domestic aviation market globally, with approximately 140 million passengers travelling annually. The country is poised to become the third-largest overall market in three years. With just 7.3% of the population using aviation as a mode of transportation, the growth potential in the sector is immense.While Covid-19 has undoubtedly disrupted the sector, we are making a resilient and robust comeback as we revitalise our economy. Push for initiatives such as the Airport Council International – Airport Carbon Accreditation Programme, which independently assesses and recognises the efforts of airports to manage and reduce their carbon emissions through six levels of certification, is a timely intervention to combat climate change.India has been following the programme since 2014. Recognising that the Indian aviation sector will undergo exponential growth in the coming years, addressing the environment and sustainability concerns is a top priority for us.Delhi Airport is the first airport in the Asia Pacific region to have achieved “Level 3+, Neutrality” accreditation in 2016 and “Level 4+, Transition”, the highest accreditation in 2020. Other airports such as Mumbai, Hyderabad & Bangalore International Airports have achieved Level 3+ Airport Carbon accreditation.Airports Authority of India has been taking the lead in implementing technical fixes for route optimisation such as shortening and straightening major air routes, Reduced Horizontal Separation and Performance-based Navigation (PBN). In consultation with Indian Air Force, AAI has optimised airspace utilisation under Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA) initiative. Estimated annual CO2 emissions reduction by establishing the 32 conditional routes come to about two lakh metric tonnes.Initiatives to promote the adoption and promotion of renewable energy use at Indian airports have also been initiated. Since 2014, the installed solar capacity has increased by 44 MWp at 44 airports, helping us achieve a carbon emission reduction of approximately 57,600 tonnes of CO2 per annum at AAI Airports.Today, Delhi Airport sources 100% of their energy demand through renewable energy sources. Similarly, with an installed solar power capacity of 40 MWp, Cochin International Airport has become the first fully solar-powered airport in India.In tandem, initiatives to promote energy conservation and monitoring have also been brought into the fold through regular energy audits. Since 2014, review audits to assess the effectiveness of implementation measures of previous audits have already been completed for 50 airports.Also, under the National LED program (UJALA- Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for all), AAI has aimed to replace conventional light fixtures with LED fittings at 85 airports. The work has been completed at 81 airports, and at four airports, work is in progress.Infrastructure building, which is another essential aspect of an expanding civil aviation industry in the country, has been brought under a green and sustainability focus. Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru International Airports have already received a “Gold rating” by the International Green Building Organisation, LEED. Jammu, Chandigarh, and Tirupati airports have received a “4-star rating” by Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA), which is India’s very own green building rating system.AAI has also taken the initiative on waste and water management by minimising the wastage of potable water by processing wastewater and reusing treated water. The Sewage Treatment Plants (STP) and Rainwater harvesting are provided/planned with every existing/new project.Through the UDAN initiative (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) scheme, 100 new airports are being built to increase access to civil aviation in the country. This development will benefit from the decisions made in hindsight, as green infrastructure, energy efficiency, waste management, and efficient transportation have become vital aspects of India’s expanding civil aviation sector.Over the next decade, finding the appropriate balance between ecology, economy, and society will be crucial. Civil aviation progress that is synchronous with preserving and restoring our environment and ecosystems is the key to unlocking a safe, healthy and prosperous future for our citizens and remains a cornerstone philosophy of the Narendra Modi government.Hardeep S Puri is union minister for civil aviation The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/as-india-flies-it-will-be-environmentally-responsible-101623151424538.html
09-06-2021||Editorials||The exodus from the Congress continues||To the list of high-profile defections from the Congress to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since 2014, Himanta Biswa Sarma and Jyotiraditya Scindia, among others, former Union minister and Uttar Pradesh (UP) leader Jitin Prasada is the latest addition. Mr Prasada’s political switch reflects the diminished fortunes of the Congress and the persistent appeal of the BJP.The Congress’s problems are well-known. Those who belong to Rahul Gandhi’s generation linked their political fortunes to his rise. But they now stare at an uncertain future. The party’s leadership structure is unclear and internal conflict resolution mechanisms are weak. There remain doubts over Mr Gandhi’s leadership and electoral appeal. The prospect of returning to power at the Centre is limited. Despite the recent backlash against the Centre on its Covid-19 mismanagement, the BJP remains the favourite for 2024. In UP, the best-case scenario for the Congress is coming a respectable fourth. And individual leaders are getting restless. And that is when the BJP provides the pull factor. Conscious that these new entrants reinforce the optics of a strong BJP and a weak Congress, the party is more than open to outsiders. It would be a stretch to refer to Mr Prasada as a Brahmin leader, and with three successive electoral losses (2014, 2017 and 2019), there are serious questions about his mass base. But in UP, where Yogi Adityanath’s government is seen as pro-Thakur, having Mr Prasada is a signal to Brahmins that the party is sensitive to their aspirations for representation in the run-up to the polls. At a time when the BJP is defensive about its governance, the entry also helps shift the narrative back to its political appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-exodus-from-the-congress-continues-101623246308122.html
09-06-2021||Editorials||Talking to the Taliban||For more than two years, in the backdrop of America’s plans to draw down its military presence in Afghanistan, there has been an intense debate in India’s strategic community about the utility of engaging some elements of the Afghan Taliban. When the debate gained currency in early 2019, there was hesitation about engaging with a force which had been so hostile to Indian interests. But the reluctance was also linked to domestic political constraints. Engagement could well have triggered questions about the government’s anti-Pakistan, anti-terror hardline security stance and its unwillingness to engage with Kashmir’s local formations when it was willing to talk to Taliban. In fact, the Kabul-Kashmir link played out in a different way. One of the reasons the government pushed ahead with constitutional changes in Jammu and Kashmir was to preempt the possible impact of radicalised militants shifting focus to the valley. India also wanted to see how far the US would go with its plans.Also Read | India joins UN Economic and Social Council for 2022-24 termAs it became clear that the Joe Biden administration intended to push ahead with the withdrawal plans, the debate got renewed. As this newspaper reported, New Delhi has begun reaching out to Afghan Taliban factions and leaders, especially those who are outside Pakistan’s sphere of influence. There have also been positive feelers seeking engagement from within the Afghan Taliban leadership. The move is a reflection of the growing realisation in capitals around the world that Taliban will be part of the next ruling dispensation in Kabul. Retired diplomats and experts also pointed to the heterogeneity within Taliban, and that the Afghanistan of today was not the same country of the mid-1990s. Despite the precarious position of the elected government, there are elements in Kabul that strongly believe the post-2001 generation which won’t be willing to accept an authoritarian regime and that even the Taliban apparently realise this.For India, an outreach to the Taliban will be an intense game of playing catch-up as other players such as China, Russia and Iran have already started formal dialogue with the group. But despite the delay, the move is well-considered. It represents an opportunity for India to make it clear, directly to Taliban, that the gains of the past two decades cannot be squandered away, and convey its core security redlines. It is also a signal that Pakistan cannot be sole arbiter of Afghanistan’s future. India must continue to engage, cautiously, while the onus rests on Taliban to prove it is not the same inimical force of the past, beholden to Rawalpindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/talking-to-the-taliban-101623238747141.html
09-06-2021||Editorials||When a judge learns — and teaches||“I am the society, with all the misconceptions present. Now I’m working through it and engaging in the process of unlearning, so it is me who needs to convey this understanding to the rest of the society that stands where I once stood.” These are the words of Justice N. Anand Venkatesh of the Madras high court (HC), who underwent voluntary “psycho-education” on gender and sexuality related issues before passing interim orders on June 7 that directed various state and central agencies to ensure that persons belonging to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexual (LGBTQIA) communities do not face discrimination. The judge was hearing a case of a lesbian couple who moved court seeking protection from police action, based on complaints filed by the women’s parents, who felt ashamed by the sexual identities of their daughters. Not only did the court ask the police to close the case, it also issued a directive that police should close all such complaints if it finds that the person in question is of the LGBTQIA community in a consensual adult relationship.Also Read | ‘Change must take place...’: Madras HC interim order on LGBTQIA communityThe couple is neither the first nor will it be the last to move court seeking protection from families that misuse the law to harass queer persons. In a country where social norms trump the law and even heterosexual adults face immense violence for falling in love with a person of the “wrong” caste or faith, it is not hard to imagine how same-sex couples, particularly women, are doubly vulnerable, stigmatised on account of a barely legitimate love and subject to patriarchal control over their sexuality. Before Section 377 was read down by the Supreme Court in 2018, the colonial-era law that criminalised homosexuality was routinely weaponised to extort and threaten gay men and genders assigned male at birth. Other sections of the Indian Penal Code continue to be used for those assigned female gender at birth — usually, one partner is charged with kidnapping the other; parents file missing persons’ reports, prompting the police to conduct an investigation and bring the “charge” back, irrespective of age or consent.Justice Venkatesh’s order recognises that society changes incrementally. The sensitisation of the police, the judiciary, even medical professionals is essential, and they need to unlearn socially acceptable patriarchal notions that adult women are charges of parents till such time as they are wed. It would behove institutional authorities to remember what the judge wrote, “Ignorance is no justification for normalising any form of discrimination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/when-a-judge-learns-and-teaches-101623148964388.html
