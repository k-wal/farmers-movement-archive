We go beyond our legal obligations by following Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) processes and have always provided information to law enforcement authorities whenever required. We are able to trace all users on our platform with official identity information. Should we receive a formal communication or notice from ED, we’ll fully cooperate in the investigation,” Shetty stated.On Friday, an ED statement read that the agency has initiated a FEMA investigation on the basis of the ongoing money laundering investigation into illegal Chinese betting applications.During the course of the investigation, it was seen that the accused Chinese nationals had laundered proceeds of crime worth around ₹57 crore by converting the deposited Indian currencies into cryptocurrency tether (USDT) and then transferring it to Binance Wallets (an exchange registered in Cayman Islands) based on instructions received from abroad, said ED.WazirX allows a wide range of transactions, including exchange of cryptocurrencies with Indian rupee (INR) and vice-versa and cryptocurrencies to P2P (person-to-person) exchange as well as transfer of cryptocurrency held in its pool accounts to wallets of other exchanges which could be received at foreign locations.“WazirX does not collect the requisite documents, which is in clear violation of the basic mandatory AML and combating of financing of terrorism (CFT) precaution norms and FEMA guidelines,” ED stated.In the period under investigation, the users of WazirX via its pool account have received incoming cryptocurrency worth ₹880 crore and transferred cryptocurrency worth ₹1,400 crore to Binance accounts. None of these transactions are available on blockchain for any audit/investigation, read the ED statement. The anti-money laundering agency added that it was found that WazirX’s clients could transfer valuable cryptocurrencies to any person irrespective of location and nationality without any proper documentation, making it a safe haven for users looking for money laundering and other illegitimate activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ed-issues-notice-to-cryptocurrency-exchange-wazirx-over-2-790-cr-transactions-101623436107495.html
11-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body urges citizens to stay away from beach, coastal areas||Owing to the extremely heavy rainfall warning issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for Mumbai on Sunday and Monday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has appealed citizens to stay away from the sea and coastal areas. Five teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been put on high alert in the city and the civic body is making arrangements to shift hundreds of families residing on the banks of Mithi river, in case water level crosses the danger mark due to heavy rainfall. According to BMC officials, IMD has issued a red alert for Sunday. BMC in a statement said additional dewatering pumps followed by fixing of drainage systems, checking of manholes is being done by the staff to ensure there is no untoward event.Further, municipal schools in all 24 wards of the city are to be turned into temporary shelters in case of excessive rainfall that requires evacuation. BMC said it is putting the flood rescue team of the Mumbai Fire Brigade on standby and that it will coordinate with the Indian Navy and Coast Guard for help in case of extreme situation.Ward officers in areas around Mithi river, such as Worli, Bandra, Andheri, and Malad, have been asked to stay on alert considering these areas are either affected being coastal areas or have rivers that overflow due to excessive rainfall.A BMC official said, “At any given time, in case the Mithi river water level goes above danger level, we will have to shift at least 1,200 residents to safe locations. We have kept the staff on standby and residents will be shifted only if we feel that the water level is increasing dangerously on Sunday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-urges-citizens-to-stay-away-from-beach-coastal-areas-101623436046780.html
11-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Haffkine approaches Sputnik and J&J for manufacturing Covid vaccine||To expand its manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccine, state-owned Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited has now approached Sputnik and Johnson and Johnson (J&J) expressing their interest (EoI) for the same.The Maharashtra government has allowed the Haffkine Corporation to hold talks with other firms for manufacturing the Covid-19 vaccine.With the help of Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, it is expected to start manufacturing Covaxin, the first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine in the next eight months, and has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with them recently.“We have written to Johnson & Johnson and Sputnik expressing our interest in manufacturing their vaccine sometime back. Our follow up with them is on. They will study our report and will let us know,” Dr Sandeep Rathod, managing director, Haffkine Institute, confirmed the development.Haffkine is already working to produce 228 million doses of Covaxin vaccine in a year. For this, it is setting up a Biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory at its premises at Parel in central Mumbai, which is likely to take a few months.In January, the institute had sought permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), for the transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech. The ICMR and Bharat Biotech had co-developed the Covaxin, which was granted emergency use authorisation “in clinical trial mode” by India’s drugs regulator on January 3. Haffkine received approval from the department of biotechnology of the ministry of science and technology on April 15. Following this, the state government too approved the project on April 28. While doing so, it has also been allowed to hold talks with other firms manufacturing the Covid-19 vaccine for expanding its production, the officials said.The state granted ₹94 crore for the project while the Centre too approved a grant of ₹65 crore under Covid Suraksha Yojana.Haffkine Corporation is a subsidiary of Haffkine Institute for Training, Research and Testing, owned by the state government.Haffkine Institute is one of the oldest biomedical research institutes in the country. It was established in 1899 by Dr Waldemar Mordecai Haffkine, an originally Russian microbiologist, who was deputed to then-Bombay to help authorities tackle the Bubonic plague outbreak in 1896. Haffkine started the Plague Research Laboratory and developed a vaccine that he first tested on himself and his assistant. The vaccine was then rolled out to inmates of a Byculla prison – all of whom survived the epidemic and did not contract the plague.The vaccine was then rolled out among the Parsis, one of the first communities that agreed to be vaccinated en masse. The microbiologist is also credited for having developed an anti-cholera vaccine. The laboratory, which was opened in the Governor’s official residence in Parel – a site it has occupied since then – was renamed Haffkine Institute in 1925.The multi-disciplinary institute is engaged in training, research and testing of various aspects of infectious diseases. It is credited with developing several prophylactics in the recent past too, including the anti-rabies serum, anti-venom serum, and the oral polio vaccine.To expand the production activities and to meet the growing demands for medicines and lifesaving drugs, the Maharashtra government bifurcated the Haffkine Institute in 1975. Production of vaccines was entrusted to Haffkine Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation Limited, a state-owned firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-haffkine-approaches-sputnik-and-j-j-for-manufacturing-covid-vaccine-101623435987364.html
11-06-2021||Mumbai||IMD issues red category weather alert for Mumbai on Sunday||With very heavy to extremely heavy rains anticipated this weekend, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has sounded a red category weather warning for Mumbai on Sunday, while Saturday and Monday are under orange category. Citizens have been cautioned to stay at home unless essential.The city received 137mm of rain in the 24 hours ending at 5.30pm on Friday, more than the 107mm rain received the day before, according to IMD’s Santacruz weather station. Mumbai is expected to get at least another 200mm-250mm of rainfall by Monday, along with a thunderstorm. In June so far, the city’s total rainfall including pre-monsoon showers between June 1 and June 8 comes to 670mm, which is 32% more than 505mm — the long-period average for the month. The city exceeded this average on Friday, with the heaviest showers concentrated in the northern suburbs.Most monitoring locations in south Mumbai received less than 5mm of rain between 3pm and 6pm on Friday, while areas closer to Sanjay Gandhi National Park in the north saw around 40mm rain in three hours.“With the formation of a low-pressure zone in the north of Bay of Bengal, there will be an inward movement and intensification of the monsoon trough over Arabian Sea, and this may lead to heavy, very heavy and even extremely heavy rainfall over the Maharashtra coast especially Mumbai, Palghar, Thane and Raigad over the next four to five days,” said KS Hosalikar, head of the IMD’s surface instrument division in Pune.IMD classifies 15.6-64.4mm rain as moderate, 64.5-115.5mm as heavy, 115.6-204.4mm as very heavy, over 204.5mm as extremely heavy rain, and over 300mm as exceptionally heavy rain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/imd-issues-red-category-weather-alert-for-mumbai-on-sunday-101623435986688.html

From the Youth Congress, Davinderjeet Singh Laddi Dhos, who was considered close to state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, joined the party. Laddi and his father remained steadfast Manpreet supporters for long and had joined the Congress, along with him. This was after Manpreet’s idea of forming a People’s Party of Punjab (PPP) did not succeed. Laddi has joined the AAP just a few days after his father’s death. AAP state president and MP Bhagwant Mann formally inducted Laddi, BJP leader Kewal Singh Brar and ABVP leader Harmandeep Mita into the party. “Davinderjeet Singh Laddi is a well-known personality of the area. He, along with Kewal Singh Brar, co-convener of BJP education cell from Moga and Harmandeep Mita, district general secretary of BJP’s student wing ABVP, have joined the AAP to serve Punjab,” said Mann, adding that Laddi’s father Kuldeep Singh Dhos had been a member of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and had contested 2012 assembly polls from the PPP.  “People of Punjab want a change of government in the state. In 2022 elections, they will definitely give a chance to the AAP to serve the state,” Mann added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/youth-cong-leader-2-from-saffron-fold-join-aap-101623435930506.html

The park will be open from 5am to 7.30am for morning walkers, and from 7.30am to 9am for cyclists and other visitors.“However, for the safety of captive animals, the roads going to Safari and Rescue centre are closed,” said G Mallikarjuna, chief conservator of forests, SGNP. The move to reopen, he said, is possible since Mumbai falls under level three of unlock guidelines under the state’s Mission Break the Chain. “We are expecting a sizeable footfall. Earlier this year, we had good crowds right up to end February. They started tapering off only in March when cases began rising,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-sgnp-to-reopen-on-friday-101623435928704.html
11-06-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay looks for ways to subsidise Covid vaccine||Amid growing demand for free vaccines among students, the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B), is now looking for ways to subsidise the doses.Despite registering as a government vaccination centre for Covid-19 vaccines, the hospital on campus has not been able to procure vaccine doses. The institute is now planning to hold a vaccination drive with the help of private hospitals for its students on campus.“IIT will bear the administration expenses but the cost paid to the private agency is recoverable from students. However, if any student is unable to pay, provisions have been made to support them for now,” said IIT-B director Subhasis Chaudhuri.A workplace vaccination drive is being planned where beneficiaries have to pay ₹1,000 plus taxes, much to the disappointment of students.Dean, student affairs, Tapanendu Kundu said, “We are doing our best to reduce the financial burden on students for vaccination. The aim is to get more and more students to be inoculated during the drive. There are no government rules for institutes to pay for students’ vaccines.”One of the ways the institute is considering is adjusting the vaccination charges against fees paid by students towards hostel amenities. “We are also in touch with alumni groups to raise funds for the vaccination drive,” said Kundu.Students, on the other hand, remained upset with the charges for vaccination. “Many other central universities and institutes have been inoculating students for free. Why is IIT-B not able to do so?” said a student requesting anonymity.Currently, around 3,000 students reside on campus. The institute has made it mandatory for anybody getting a vaccine outside the campus to return and complete a 14-day quarantine. “This rule has discouraged many students from getting a free shot outside,” said the student.The institute, meanwhile, is worried that once the price capping of Covid-19 vaccines comes into force from June 21, private hospitals may not find it feasible to run a workplace drive. A senior official at the institute said that the institute is encouraging more students to get vaccinated in the inoculation drive planned for next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombay-looks-for-ways-to-subsidise-covid-vaccine-101623435926708.html
11-06-2021||Mumbai||Drop in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai puts focus back on other ailments||With the decline in cases of novel coronavirus infections in the city and the arrival of monsoon, civic-run hospitals are converting unused Covid-19 beds into general beds to treat non-Covid patients. Surgeries in hospitals have also got a boost with the opening of operation theatres (OT). Compared to May 1, the number of active Covid-19 patients who are currently on treatment has plunged by 73% as of June 10. As per officials, most Covid-19 beds in hospitals and jumbo centres are lying vacant. For instance, at BYL Nair hospital, Mumbai Central, only 145 of the 700 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients are presently occupied. Similarly, at Nesco jumbo centre, 187 of the 800 Covid-19 beds have Covid-19 patients. Given this scenario, civic-run hospitals have decided to reduce Covid-19 beds and focus on monsoon-related ailments. Dr Pratima Patil, medical superintendent of Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Municipal General Hospital Kandivli, said they will reduce the total Covid-19 bed strength from 200 to 50. At BYL Nair Hospital, around 250 of 700 beds will be reserved for monsoon-related ailments. Similarly, at Rajawadi Hospital, Ghatkopar, 30 of the 150 Covid-19 beds will be temporarily converted into general beds. “Since almost 60-70% beds are lying vacant, we have decided to temporarily convert some unused Covid-19 beds into general beds for monsoon-related ailments,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).All converted beds have to be fumigated and sanitised to prevent any possible presence of Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. On Thursday, BMC also issued a circular—Measures to be taken for monsoon 2021 - instructing all four medical colleges including peripheral hospitals to keep the intensive care units (ICU), OT and blood banks ready to handle mass casualty in the monsoon. “We have instructed all the hospitals to procure enough diagnostic test kits, assess laboratories, and all backup batteries that require electrical gadgets should be ready and charged. Blood bank officers have also been asked to store enough blood to handle mass casualties,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of Nair Hospital. All medical colleges have been instructed to keep 100 beds ready for patients with monsoon-related ailments. Also, ICU, Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) which had remained closed amid the pandemic, have opened to handle any monsoon-related casualties.Amid the plunge in Covid cases, surgeries see a rise:Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many hospitals were converted into dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. But as cases have decreased to a daily average of around 700 from 8,000 in April, civic-run hospitals are opening their OTs for non-Covid patients. “We have already fumigated and sanitised our OT. Now, we will send samples to BMC for testing to rule out the presence of any pathogens. Once it is confirmed, we will start the OT for non-Covid patents,” said Dr Patil.As per rules, to avoid any possible transmission of Sars-Cov-2 in a hospital, most hospitals were only performing emergency surgeries. With the fall in daily Covid-19 cases, they have opened their OT to non-Covid-19 patients. “During pre-Covid days, we used to do over 150 daily surgeries which have now fallen to around 60-65 surgeries per day. However, we believe the number will rise gradually as many patients are avoiding hospitals due to the pandemic,” said Dr Bharmal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/drop-in-covid-19-cases-in-mumbai-puts-focus-back-on-other-ailments-101623435807828.html
11-06-2021||Other||Delhi: 3 held for robbery, murder||The Delhi Police on Friday said they have arrested three men three days after they committed four serious crimes, including the murder of a truck driver during a robbery in west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh, within an hour. A Santro car that the suspects used in the crimes was recovered in a burnt condition from Baghpat in Uttar Pradesh. Police said the suspects robbed the car from Jahangirpuri five days before they used the vehicle for committing the four back-to-back crimes. They later parked it and set it on fire at an isolated place in Baghpat, said police. Around 2.30 am on June 8, the officer said, the suspects first fired bullets and tried to steal an e-rickshaw in Shalimar Bagh. Fifteen minutes later, they shot dead a truck driver and robbed him of his mobile phone and ₹5,000 in the Punjabi Bagh area. Thereafter, two more incidents of robbery and attempt to robbery were reported from IP Estate and Defence Colony in central and south Delhi respectively. Separate cases were registered at the four concerned police stations. The northwest district’s special staff and the local police began their probe in the attempted robbery at Shalimar Bagh and the firing case and scanned CCTV cameras. They examined the routes through which the suspect had reached Shalimar Bagh to steal the e-rickshaw. Investigators reached a garbage dumping site in Badola village near Mahendra Park where the Santro car was last seen on the day the crimes were committed. The police scanned CCTVs of the nearby areas and found three suspects with the vehicle in the same area. The suspects were identified, their hideouts traced in Loni and they were arrested following raids. Their interrogation led to the place in Baghpat where they had abandoned the Santro car and set it on fire to destroy evidence and avoid police arrest, said police. The suspects have been identified as Rizwan, Shamshad and Nasir, all from Loni in Ghaziabad and in their twenties. They were caught by the special staff team of the northwest district on Friday. All of them are habitual offenders and were previously involved in theft and drug peddling cases, said senior police officers associated with the operation. “The arrested men are jobless, addicted to alcohol and have no source of income. They stole vehicles and used them for committing robberies and thefts. Thereafter, they either sold the stolen vehicles or abandoned them at isolated places,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi3-held-for-robbery-murder-101623435748624.html
11-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra preps to turn the next Covid-19 tide||Caught unawares during the second wave of Covid-19, leading to shortage of beds, oxygen and drugs, the state has started implementing a plan in anticipation of the third wave in August-September – augmentation of health infrastructure, reserving beds for children, launching Mission oxygen and vaccinating 60 million people in three months. As Covid cases started to rise in Amravati in Vidarbha early February, the administration failed to see it as a sign of a second wave and take quick steps. It resulted in daily caseload shooting up to more than 60,000 in April, from less than 3,000 in January. The sudden surge resulted in shortage of beds, acute shortfall of oxygen as well as anti-viral drugs. Although the situation did not worsen much, the health infrastructure was stretched beyond limit. On April 22, the number of active patients was highest at 699,858 which resulted in patients outnumbering the available beds in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur. The oxygen demand, too, went up rapidly, along with shortage of anti-viral drug Remdesivir, leading to panic. The state learnt its lessons and is now using them to prepare for a potential third wave, say officials. HEALTH INFRA The total number of beds in the state has now gone up to 495,190 as of June 10, against around 80,000 in March 2020. A majority of them are in make-shift jumbo Covid centres. “We were struggling to accommodate patients in areas outside Mumbai as the health facilities did not have enough beds. Taking a cue from jumbo Covid centres in Mumbai, we have asked local authorities to set up temporary hospitals in case of a surge,” said another health department official. The other problem, as pointed out by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at the beginning of the second wave, was shortage of trained medical staff to handle facilities. “We can increase beds overnight, but how can we get doctors in a short span of time,” Thackeray had remarked while stressing the need for a lockdown to control the spread. The administration now plans to recruit 16,000 medical staff, including doctors, paramedics and supporting staff. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said on Tuesday the recruitment process will be completed on an urgent basis. Orders were issued early this week to begin the process to recruit first batch of 2,226. Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh said the government has also approved six more medical colleges in different districts in addition to medical colleges in 18 districts to strengthen public infrastructure. State-owned medical colleges come with public hospitals. “We are also planning public-private policy,” he added. MISSION OXYGEN Although the state did not witness tragic incidents, it barely managed to tide over the demand for oxygen with help from the Centre and private sector. “Against the daily production of 1,250 metric tons (MT), the demand had gone up to more than 1,600 MT at one point in May. The administration was put on high alert. Mantralaya war room saw heightened activity, as officials struggled to meet the demand. A special task force was constituted to look after oxygen supply. We did not want to lose any life due to shortage of the oxygen. The situation was taken seriously by the political leadership and a plan was chalked out to increase the production and take it to 3000 MT daily under Mission Oxygen,” said a top official from state’s public health department. The government has now begun implementing Mission Oxygen drive to generate 3,000 metric tonnes of oxygen over the next two years, from the current generation of around 1,300 MT. Besides the targeted generation of 517.9 MT from the 487 PSA (Pressure Swing Absorption) oxygen generation plants at district levels, 56 have already been installed and the generation of 69.37MT has already started. The daily oxygen generation capacity of these plants varies from 0.5 to 5MT and cost ₹20 lakh and above. Similarly, the state is planning Air Separation Units (ASUs), which take some time for installation. It is also eyeing to utilise the existing capacity of 600MT of generation plants in gaseous form, by providing compression and bottling facilities to them. This would help the government to take the generation to 2,300 MT in six months, said an official. The state has announced sops for the private industries to materialise the Mission Oxygen Swavalamban which is expected to cost ₹1,100 crore. Private players investing in oxygen generation plants or the existing manufacturers going for expansion of the existing ones will get a waiver on duties and taxes including GST, stamp duty, electricity among others. PAEDIATRIC COVID MANAGEMENT Experts have expressed the fear that children may be the worst-hit during the third wave. Maharashtra was among the first few states to constitute a paediatric task force of expert doctors under Dr Suhas Prabhu. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has had a couple of meetings. The task force has submitted its draft action plan for the third wave. The state has directed all district hospitals to reserve 10% of the beds for kids. They have also been asked to identify hospitals equipped to treat multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and ensure adequate number of beds at all dedicated Covid hospitals. “The task force has submitted a draft of the action plan. The districts have been asked to prepare bed infrastructure to take up the patients equal to the highest number of active cases in tehsil or district during the second wave. At least 25% of the beds in Covid Care Centers need to be equipped with oxygen supply, while every dedicated Covid health centre needs 10% of their beds equipped with ventilator. Training doctors and paramedics will be undertaken with special focus on paediatric management,” said an official from the health department. “The districts have been directed to conduct ‘My Kids, My Responsibility’ campaign for awareness among parents and teachers. Besides, training physicians and public health care staff in paediatric management, we have told the authorities to train teachers in schools to screen children for early warning signs,” another official said. “We have prepared for the new wave with focus on paediatric health services,” Tope said. Vaccination With more than 25 million doses administered, Maharashtra tops in the country in inoculation. State officials said they have set up 9,000 vaccination centres and ramped up the capacity to vaccinate 1 million a day. “If we get adequate supply of vaccine, we would be able to vaccinate 60 million people in three months which will effectively help us contain the spread of the epidemic,” said another official. The state has been complaining continuously about the short supply of doses. The state has received 22 million doses from the Centre, while it procured 2.5 million on its own. THE CHALLENGES “Plasma therapy worked in first wave, while Remdesivir was buzzword in the second wave, both appear to be outdated now. We never expected the emergence of black fungus which has proven very dangerous in the second wave. Nobody knows what is there in store during the next wave,” the official said. He said they have decided to continue with aggressive testing for at least three months, using newer methods such as portable testing kits. “The monitoring of suspected patients through initiatives like ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ will be relaunched. Also, initiatives like ‘Covid-19 Free Village’ will be encouraged,” he said. “Maharashtra has shown the way not only for the country but for the world. We are all ready to take up the challenge. The number of beds has been increased by 500% over the past 15 months,” Deshmukh said. Dr Avinash Bhondve, Maharashtra president of the Indian Medical Association, said, “The state has been talking about preparation for the wave, but everything is on paper. The PSA plants are not feasible in small and medium hospitals due to space constraint. The government has not been able to install large size oxygen plants or increase the number of beds in expected numbers,” he said. Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital, said, “Besides preparations, people and healthcare machinery should not lower their guard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-preps-to-turn-the-next-covid-19-tide-101623435746712.html
11-06-2021||Mumbai||Decide on Mumbai civic body’s letter for door-to-door Covid vaccination: HC to Centre||The Bombay high court (HC) on Friday asked the Central government to decide on the June 10 letter written by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief Iqbal Singh Chahal to the health secretary, ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), wherein he had stated that the civic body was willing to undertake door-to-door vaccination for bedridden persons who cannot move out of their homes.The letter has also sought the issuance of guidelines for initiating such vaccination drives. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, was informed that the state and BMC were to answer the queries raised by the bench on the issue of providing door-to-door vaccination for people over 75 years of age, specially-abled and bedridden people. In the previous hearing on June 9, the bench had framed four questions which were regarding initiating door-to-door vaccination in the absence of any door-to-door vaccination policy by the Centre, whether the BMC was willing to undertake the exercise without the Centre’s go ahead, whether the BMC had written to the centre seeking such permission and whether the state of Maharashtra was willing to follow the Kerela model wherein door-to-door vaccination initiative was already underway. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for the BMC while responding to the queries informed the bench that the BMC commissioner had written a letter to the centre and a response was awaited. He submitted that the civic body was willing to undertake the initiative provided the centre gave it the go-ahead. “You (BMC) have taken many initiatives that were innovative and became an example for other civic bodies to combat the coronavirus. Your commissioner had claimed to have initiated the chase the virus initiative. Are you saying that all of those initiatives had the approval of the Centre?” questioned the bench. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh submitted that the committee of experts formed to mull over the directions of the HC had unanimously recommended the near to home vaccination plan and though the recommendation was only advisory in nature it was expected that the states and civic authorities abide by them. “Where is the problem (in adopting door-to-door policy), we are not understanding it. States are doing it successfully, why don’t you (Centre) communicate with them and know how they are doing it?” the bench asked Singh. The bench stressed that they were not trying to interfere with the government’s decision but only wanted to ensure that lives were not lost. “You want a large number of people to come out for vaccination and those who cannot come out, cannot be vaccinated? This is the message which has been sent to the people,” said the bench.Taking exception to the state’s request seeking time to respond to the query of the court in the previous hearing on how senior politicians had managed to receive the vaccination dose at his residence in Mumbai in April the court said, “A week’s time? This is alarming. It reminds us of an old saying you show the man and I will show you the rule,” said the bench.The bench then directed the Centre’s to respond to BMC’s letter and posted further hearing to Monday, June 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/decide-on-mumbai-civic-body-s-letter-for-door-to-door-covid-vaccination-hc-to-centre-101623435626659.html
11-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Private hospitals will have to follow Centre’s directives on Covid vax charge, says BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday made it clear that private hospitals in the city will have to follow directives issued by the Central government for Covid vaccination charges and action will be taken against those who violate the same. It also urged citizens to file a complaint against private hospitals that are overcharging.The Central government on Tuesday instructed private vaccination centres to not charge more than ₹780 for Covishield, ₹1,410 for Covaxin and ₹1,145 for Sputnik V jabs. The Centre said that private hospitals can charge up to ₹150 on service charges and the state governments will monitor the prices being charged.The BMC on Friday directed that the above rates would have to be followed by private hospitals in the city. However, if any private hospital is found to be overcharging the BMC has appealed to citizens to register a complaint with the health department of the BMC via email.

They claimed that they were forced to travel to far-off places such as Meerut and Chandigarh to avail of the second vaccine dose. While the time interval between two doses of the Covishield vaccine has been extended from four-six weeks to four-eight weeks, the second dose of Covaxin can be taken four to six weeks after the first.Aggarwal also submitted that the number of slots available has already been increased from 150 to 200 per day per vaccination site in schools.

Prayagraj has witnessed 20 cases of black fungus till date but this is the first confirmed case of black/yellow fungus here. The patient is a 73-year-old Ayushman scheme beneficiary. He fell prey to Covid and was treated in April-May in United Medicity. However, after a few days, he again came to the hospital due to heaviness on the left side of the face, informed doctors. He was examined by the doctors led by principal of United Medicity Prof Mangal Singh and ENT specialist Dr Prabhat Srivastava. Endoscopy and MRI on June 8 confirmed both black and yellow fungus in the nose. The patient was then successfully operated upon by the team on June 8 itself and is now doing well, as per Prof Mangal Singh. He said that the operation was successful only due to the state-of-the-art equipment available in the hospital. United Medicity director Dr Pramod Kumar informed that a team had been formed under the leadership of principal Prof Mangal Singh, to treat all such cases. He advised Covid patients to immediately visit an ENT specialist if they had symptoms like toothache, jaw pain, watery/bleeding nose, difficulty in breathing and blurred vision. Dr Kumar said that if the fungus was not detected or treated at the right time, it also affected the jaw and eyes, and could also reach the brain making the case complicated. Assistant professor in the department of ENT, United Medicity Dr Prabhat Srivastava said that mucormycosis, a black fungus, could be fatal for those suffering from uncontrolled diabetes and patients affected by Covid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/first-black-yellow-fungus-patient-in-prayagraj-operated-upon-doing-well-101623434846636.html

However, due to shortage, Covaxin doses in stock are being used for only second dose,” said Atishi, reading the Delhi government’s vaccine bulletin in a live streamed video briefing.Currently, there are 595 Delhi government centres for the 45+ group and 263 for the 18-45 group. While all centres for the 18-45 groups were suspended for shortage of vaccines last month, more than 300 sites for the 45+ were temporarily closed too.“For the 45+ group, we have also invested in an intensive outreach programme with which we aim to cover vaccination of the entire group in four weeks. With the new policy of the central government, we hope the supply of vaccines get even better after June 21 and help increase vaccine coverage of Delhi from 30% to 60% in the next one month,” she further said.As per government records, Delhi’s total population is around 20.6 million, of which around 15 million are adults who are eligible for vaccination.Government records further showed that around 4.52 million people in Delhi have taken at least one dose of the vaccine (30% of 15 million) and 1.39 million have got their second doses too.The 4.52 million first doses include around 250,000 healthcare workers, 425,000 frontline workers, 2.58 million people aged over 45 years, and 1.23 million individuals in the 18-45 age group, government records showed.Of the 1.39 million second doses, around 180,000 were given to healthcare workers, 260,000 to frontline workers, 887,000 to people aged over 45 years and 67,400 to the 18-45 age group, government records showed.Delhi’s first drive-through site suspendedMeanwhile, Delhi’s first drive-through vaccine site, which was launched on May 27 by a private hospital at the premises of a shopping mall in Dwarka sector 14, has been suspended in the light of the recent price capping announced by the central government.“We have decided to stop Delhi’s first drive-through -- a highly safe and convenient way for public, which we ran non-stop for 15 days -- owing to the new vaccination pricing which has made running it non-viable now,” said Aakash Healthcare Superspeciality Hospital in a statement.The Union health ministry on Tuesday capped the prices of coronavirus vaccines being administered at private vaccination centres, a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that private hospitals can procure 25% of the doses manufactured in the country and administer them at price set by the manufacturer, with a maximum of ₹150 as additional service charge.An office memorandum issued by the ministry fixed the maximum price per dose of Covishield at ₹780, for Covaxin at ₹1,410, and for Sputnik V at ₹1,145, which is as per the prices disclosed by the vaccine manufacturers at the moment.The drive through centre at Dwarka used to charge ₹1,400 per dose for Covishield.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/over-30-of-adults-in-delhi-have-got-at-least-one-vaccine-doseatishi-101623434786641.html

The city also reported 238 new cases on Friday -- the second time this week that daily cases have fallen below the 300-mark. The test positivity rate – proportion of samples that returns positive – is also on the decline in Delhi, with the city reporting a 0.31% positivity rate, which is the lowest after the April-May surge in cases. The seven day rolling average case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – has also started decreasing. It had shot up to 12.4% when the number of cases in the city dipped suddenly but deaths due to the viral infection continued to remain high. On Friday, the CFR stood at 11.8%, according to data. The cumulative CFR – based on the total number of cases and deaths so far – stands at 1.73%, higher compared to national average of 1.24%. So far, 24,772 people have succumbed to the infection since the first death was reported on March 13, 2020. In comparison, 60 persons had died in one of the worst dengue outbreaks in Delhi in 2015 that affected nearly 16,000 people. Covid-19 has affected 1.43 million people in the city so far. “The proportion of population which is vaccinated is still minute in India. While vaccine is the major weapon for fighting the pandemic, equally or more important is Covid-appropriate behaviour, which is in our control.

Health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday visited one such facility-- the under-construction building at Acharya Shree Bhikshu hospital that is adding 400 more beds to its existing capacity of 100. “These 400 beds will be fully dedicated to Covid-19 treatment,” said Jain after his visit. He asked the hospital to add two oxygen ports to each bed in the hospital and use the beds meant for patient attendants for treating Covid-19 patients. The minister’s suggestion came in the backdrop of patients having to share beds at many hospitals during the peak of the second wave of Covid-10 in April-May surge, when over 20,000 new cases were being reported every day. At Lok Nayak hospital, where a 1,500-bed block is coming up, the minister asked the team to add a temporary building that can house around 120 beds for Covid-19 patients. The government is also working on the construction of two new hospitals -- in Madipur and Jwalapuri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-reviews-work-on-ramping-up-hospital-infra-as-covid-cases-decline-101623434726643.html

Despite having Covid-19 symptoms such as high-fever, body ache and cough, Singh defeated the virus in home isolation. He had caught the infection in mid April when Delhi was under the fourth wave of the infection. Local residents as well as his family members remember Singh as a “health-conscious person” and said that his daily 5-7 kilometer walk and two-hour Yoga as a reason why He could defeat the virus at the age of 93 while on home isolation. Locals said same daily fitness routine that started with a morning walk resulted in him getting run over by a truck on Friday.“Everyone in our neighbourhood knew dadajee (Singh) because he was conscious about his health and fitness and motivated others for including Yoga and physical work in their daily life. While hundreds of young people lost their lives due to the virus, his Covid-19 survival story was an inspiration for many of us,” said Kapil Jhangra, a local resident.Singh’s grandson, Rakesh Yadav, said that he was sleeping when his grandfather left home at around 4.45 am for a morning walk. He had just walked about 50 metres on the road when an allegedly speeding tipper truck crushed him and four members of a family under its wheels at 4.51 am.“A neighbor told me about the mishap. My grandfather had died by the time I rushed to the nearby hospital, where he was admitted by some locals,” said Yadav, adding that Singh became Covid-19 positive within a week after he took the first dose of Covid vaccine on April 12. Yadav said that his grandfather was aware of all the Covid-19 guidelines and he isolated himself in a room and started medication, soon after he got fever and cough.“The symptoms were not severe. We consulted a doctor in Akash hospital and my grandfather followed his medical advices and medication. He continued his Yoga and other exercises in home isolation as well. My grandfather defeated the virus because of his will power and fitness,” said Yadav.Singh’s younger brother, Kripa Ram,82, also remembered him as a disciplined and self-motivated person. “I have been a wrestler all my life but could not maintain the fitness routine like my brother. He looked healthier than me, although I was more than 10 years younger to him,” said Ram, who is famous as “pehalwan dada” in the neighbourhood.Two-and-half-year-old Dev Rajoura, who was the youngest among the five killed in Friday morning’s road mishap outside his home in Najafgarh, was speech and hearing impaired since birth. But since his family’s financial condition was poor and his parents were not able to afford the costly medical treatment, they were hoping that a miracle from the “divine powers” would cure Dev. And it was because of that reason that they had planned a shrine visit to a few holy places, including Vaishno Devi temple in Jammu, said relatives of the four dead family members.Apart from Dev, his parents – Ashok Rajoura and Kiran Rajoura – and brother Istant Rajoura,5, were killed in the road mishap, just outside their Najafgarh home. They were walking towards Chhawla bus stand to board a bus to Gurugram, where they had to visit Sheetla Mata temple, first among the many holy places they had planned to visit hoping it would help Dev.They (Kiran and Ashok) had been planning the Gururgam temple’s visit for nearly two months, after someone in her (Kiran’s) parental neighbourhood told them that Dev could be cured if they visited Vishno Devi and other famous temples, said Pooja, wife of Ashok’s brother Manoj.“I had been advising them against it because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But today, they left without informing us. I would have stopped them, had I known about their trip. They would have alive,” said Pooja, sobbing on the floor with other relatives.As Ashok left behind a joint family that is facing financial crisis, his relatives sought the government’s help in providing some relief to the family either through some financial assistance or a job to the eligible one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/najafgarh-accident-the-oldest-victim-covid-survivor-youngest-speech-and-hearing-impaired-101623434666643.html

The Board had sought suggestions from all stakeholders including students, parents, teachers and principals with a deadline of 2pm on June 10, to determine the formula for declaring results of the cancelled examinations of both Class 10 and Class 12 students, officials said.Now that these suggestions are in, they will be presented to the government for consideration in the next meeting, they added. Following the meeting, the government will declare the formula for calculating the marks to be awarded to high school and intermediate students who had registered for the UP Board exams. Earlier on June 5, director of secondary education and chairman of the UP Board, Vinay Kumar Pandey, had sought suggestions from the principal of one reputed government, aided and unaided school in all 75 districts and an office-bearer of the teacher-parent association till June 7.At that time 580 suggestions were received. They were placed in a meeting chaired by the additional chief secretary (secondary education) Aradhana Shukla on June 7. Following this, it was decided that suggestions should also be taken from all stakeholders.“Over 3,500 suggestions were given by a cross section of stakeholders including students, parents, teachers and principals and all of them suggested their own methods of calculating marks that could be awarded to students of class 10 and class 12,” said a senior official of UP Board aware of the development. He said that among the suggestions, many wanted that the average marks of class 10, class 11 and pre-board, or any other exams conducted in class 12, be the main base for awarding marks to a class 12 student. Likewise, for class 10, the marks obtained in preceding classes should be considered. UP Board had recently cancelled class 12 exams in view of the Coronavirus situation in the state. The education board, counted among the largest examination bodies of the world on account of the number of examinees, had earlier proposed to take a 90-minute exam of each subject for Class 12 students in the second week of July. The final decision of the UP Board was in line with the Central Board of Secondary Education’s (CBSE) decision, which too had cancelled the Class 12 exams. The decision of the board will affect over 26 lakh students who had registered for the UP Board Class 12 exams of 2021.Earlier, the state government had called off examinations for Class 10 too and had decided to promote over 29 lakh students registered for it to the next class without exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/high-school-inter-results-up-board-gets-4-000-suggestions-from-stakeholders-101623434609180.html

Five posts on the list have not been filled.Uttar Pradesh’s additional chief secretary (agriculture) Devesh Chaturvedi said: “Though we have not received any written complaint, but taking note of media reports, we are probing if the reservation policy was followed or not and if any rules, regulations were flouted.”The university had advertised a total of 40 positions separately and filled 24 of them.As for the rest, the university said the applicants did not fulfil the criteria and that was why 16 seats remained vacant.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Tindwari (Banda) Brijesh Prajapati has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Yogi Adityanath and governor Anandiben Patel, alleging irregularities in the appointments. He said only one caste had been preferred for appointments at the university.Last year, the university had advertised for 20 positions—18 in the general category and two from the economic weaker section (EWS). Of this, 15 candidates were selected. Eleven of them from one caste were chosen for the positions of professor, associate professor and assistant professor, the MLA alleged.Prajapati, in his letter, alleged the university did not follow the reservation roster. He further alleged the university issued two separate advertisements for a total of 40 positions to carry out irregularities in the reservation.The total reservation is 50% as per the rules—27% for OBCs, 21% for SC/STs and 2% for the EWS.“In order to skirt the roster system, the university issued two advertisements to fill all the 40 vacant seats, 29 positions were to be filled in one go and 11 later. If all the positions were filled at a time, then roster should have been applied,” he said, demanding recruitment advertisements be cancelled and reissued.The university, in an official statement, said it had advertised a total of 40 positions — eight professors, 14 associate professors and 18 assistant professors. Of them, 18 positions were for unreserved category candidates, 11 for OBCs, nine for SCs and two for EWS.During the recruitment process, 24 candidates were found eligible: 16 from the unreserved category, five from OBCs and three from SC, it said.As per the University Act, the chairman of the selection committee is the vice chancellor.

In his letter, Sisodia suggested that the students should be evaluated on the basis of their performances in class 12 pre-boards and practical exams, class 11 final exams, and class 10 board exams. The Delhi education minister said the Center should fix the range of moderation at +/- 5 marks for class 12 students.On June 1, the Centre cancelled CBSE class 12 exams to ward off the threat of coronavirus infections. The government said that CBSE will come up with a “well-defined objective criteria” in a time-bound manner to assess these students. The board constituted a 13-member team to fix criteria for the assessment of Class 12 students on June 4.Sisodia said that he has discussed the possible criteria for the evaluation of class 12 students with various stakeholders. “First of all, our principle for evaluation should be that whatever method we adopt, it should be in the interest of students. And for this, we have to make decisions rising above the traditional principles. The past year has been very challenging for our students and their parents. Not all students had fair and equal opportunities to study and learn. So, we should not object if the results of these students are much better due to the proposed new evaluation process. If we prepare results on the basis of different sources and examinations, then perhaps it will do justice to all the students,” he said in the letter.The Delhi deputy chief minister suggested that the board should give 30% weightage to class 12 pre-boards, 20 % to class 11 final exams, and 20 % to students’ performance in CBSE class 10 exams. Besides, the remaining 30% marks should be allotted on the basis of the practical exams conducted by the schools. “The 20% weightage of class 10 exams should be on the basis of the subject in which the students had secured the highest marks in class 10th. This is necessary because the subjects of class 10 are very different from the subjects students study in class 12,” he added.Sisodia further said that the Centre should allow schools to fix the range of moderation at +/- 5 marks, unlike class 10 where moderation of only +/- 2 marks is allowed. CBSE uses moderation to check on “inflation of marks” and to maintain consistency. According to the evaluation criteria CBSE has set for class 10 students, schools will have to award marks in consonance with their best performance in Class 10 in the last three academic years -- 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20. The selected year will be the reference year for the schools, and subject-wise marks allotted by the schools for 2021 will be within a range of +/- 2 marks obtained by the school in the subject in the reference year. “Delhi has started some new schools of excellence in which this was the first batch of class 12 students. There is no historical reference available in the case of these schools. The reference year of such schools should be taken from the nearest School of Excellence so that there is no undue harm to the children here,” Sisodia said in the letter.Sisodia also suggested chalking out plans for evaluating class 12 students next year, and informing the children about it at the earliest.A Union education ministry spokesperson did not respond to requests seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/consider-pre-boards-practicals-and-final-results-of-class-10-and-11sisodia-101623434546611.html

The errant truck driver was arrested and the vehicle impounded. Police said a DTC bus driver blocked the road with the bus when the truck driver tried to flee the mishap spot. The arrested driver told the police that he dozed off while driving and lost control of the vehicle, senior officers said.Rao Jawahar Singh (93), who recovered from Covid-19 last month, was out for a walk while the other four victims – a couple and their two sons, aged 5 and two-and-a-half years, were on their way to a temple in Gurugram, when the mishap took place around 5am. The accident spot is around 150 metres away from the Najafgarh police station. The mishap was captured on several CCTV cameras installed at nearby shops. Footage from one of the cameras shows the couple walking on the road with their elder son while the younger one is in his father’s arms. The elderly man is not visible in the 50-second video clip, which made the rounds on social media on Friday.In the video clip, none of the five victims are in focus when the truck runs them over. However, the cameras captured the truck dragging the victims on the road and crashing into three parked cars. The entire carriageway on Thana Road, where the mishap took place, is divided into two parts with concrete barriers, but only one-way traffic is allowed on the road. Local residents and relatives of the victims said the truck was travelling at a high speed from the Najafgarh police station side.“The truck suddenly swayed left and hit Jawahar Singh from behind and then ran over the other four. The bodies of three of them were crushed in the accident, and they died on the spot. The elderly man and the youngest child were rushed to the nearby Vikas Hospital with grave injuries. The old man succumbed to his wounds while the child was referred to Safdarjung hospital where he died later in the day,” said Ram Rajoura, a relative of the dead family.The four other victims were later identified as Ashok Rajoura (30), his wife Kiran (27), and their two sons – Ishant Rajoura (5), and Dev Rajoura. Ashok worked as a security guard in Vikas Hospital while his wife was a homemaker. They lived with Ashok’s brother and two uncles.Ashok’s uncle, Satish Rajoura, said they were at home when they heard a loud crash and rushed out to see what happened. “We knew it was an accident, but could never imagine that the victims would be my four loved ones,” said Satish.Ram said the truck driver tried to escape after the accident, but a DTC bus blocked his way about 80 metres from the spot. Local residents caught the truck driver handed him over to the police.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said a case of rash and negligent driving causing deaths was registered and the truck driver, identified as Rajesh, was arrested. “Five vehicles were found damaged at the spot. The accident was caused by a dumper truck driven in a rash and negligent manner,” he added.Rakesh Yadav, Jawahar Singh’s grandson, said his grandfather walked at least five kilometres every morning and performed yoga to keep himself fit. “My grandfather was 93, but he was healthy. It was because of his fitness that he survived Covid-19, staying in home isolation with high fever, body ache and cough. I was sleeping when a neighbour woke me up and told me about the accident. By the time I reached the hospital, my grandfather was dead,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-hit-and-run-over-by-tipper-truck-in-delhi-s-najafgarh-101623434306625.html

The food grain production was recorded to be 601 lakh MT last year. “There is bumper food grain production in UP this year too as per the third advance estimates that has estimated production of Rabi, Kharif and Zaid seasons at more than 624 lakh MT and the figures are likely to remain more or less same in the fourth and the final advance estimates,” additional chief secretary, agriculture, Devesh Chaturvedi said. The third advance estimates available with the agriculture department here put the production of rice at 171.36 lakh MT and that of wheat at 378.92 lakh MT, the two major crops of Kharif and Rabi seasons, respectively.As per the report, the cereals were grown on an area of 178.34 lakh hectares resulting in a record production of 598.11 lakh MT during 2021-22 while coarse cereals were grown on 20.25 lakh hectares of area producing 47.03 lakh MT.The pulses were grown on 24.1 lakh hectares of land and their production was recorded to be 26.22 lakh MT. Of all the crops, wheat recorded the highest productivity at 38.50 quintal per hectare.UP, it is seen, has been breaking its own records of food grain production for the last few years due to good monsoon and increasing productivity. UP’s food grain production in 2016-17 was 558 lakh MT which rose to 574 lakh MT in 2017-18 and 604 lakh MT in 2018-19. It dropped only marginally to 601 lakh MT in 2020-21 and this year production is expected to break all previous records.According to Chaturvedi, food grain production in UP is growing despite the shrinking area under cultivation due to urbanisation. “But a number of other factors are contributing to record food grain production,” he said.“Good monsoons, enhanced productivity, use of scientific methods of agriculture by farmers and making fertilisers, seeds, irrigation facilities etc available to farmers by the government are among the prominent factors,” Chaturvedi added. He said food grain production was likely to further increase in 2022-23 considering the possibility of good monsoon again this year.The government data show that UP produces 20% of the country’s total food grain feeding the country’s 16.9% population. This is despite the fact that its share in country’s cultivatable land is only 11.8%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/despite-pandemic-up-grain-output-sets-record-101623434246602.html

Police said they were on the lookout for Delhi’s “desperate gangster” Narendra alias Ravi Gangwal, who was booked by the police under the MCOCA for running an organised crime syndicate. Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Kushwah said Gangwal, who was evading arrest since 2018, was arrested from Vaishali Nagar from Rajasthan’s Jaipur on June 8.Narrating the sequence of events, Kushwah said in August 2019, the police had received a tip-off that Gangwal was residing in a residential society in Noida’s Sector 120 but by the time police reached the house, he had already shifted to another society.“On checking, we learnt that he, along with his wife, had already left the flat about 20 days earlier. However, during local enquiry in the society, we found that he was using a blue Baleno car with a registration number of Delhi. Further efforts were made to trace the Baleno car,” said the DCP. “It was found that the Baleno car was challaned by the Rajasthan traffic police near Jaipur. It was also learnt that his wife was also in the final stage of pregnancy,” said Kushwah adding that police teams then focused their search in Rajasthan.The officer said last month, in May, police received a tip-off that Gangwal’s wife had delivered a child in April. “Municipal records were checked in Jaipur, Faridabad and Delhi and we found that Gangwal’s wife delivered a child at a hospital in Jaipur’s Vaishali Nagar. The team made an extensive search in the area and finally traced the Baleno car in the area. A team from the special cell of the police laid a trap in the area . We arrested Gangwal on May 8, when he had come out to buy some household articles in the nearby market,” Kushwah added.Detailing Gangwal’s history of crimes, police said he is a listed “bad character” at the Ambedkar Nagar police station. In police lexicon, a “ bad character” is a person with many criminal cases, whose activities need to be monitored because he/she could be a threat to the law and order in the area. “He (Gangwal) was initially associated with a local criminal named Ramakant alias Raju in Ambedkar Nagar and was involved in running satta, cable operations and drug trafficking racket. In February 2014, he and his gang members fired multiple rounds at his rivals over a property dispute, in which a woman was killed. In May 2015, he and Ramakant had ordered the hit on prisoner Ajay alias Chottu inside Tihar jail. Ajay died in the attack. His gang was known as the Gangwal gang. His gang was involved in settling property disputes, grabbing properties, committing extortion, running satta and drug rackets, managing cable network in the area of South Delhi by using violence and threat. To check the criminal activities of Gangwal gang, he was booked under MCOCA in 2018 by Ambedkar Nagar Police Station,” added Kushwah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/car-challan-lands-delhi-gangster-in-police-net-101623434126565.html

The beneficiaries had to face problems initially with the distribution centres running out of stock as officials reported heavy crowd. However, most of the beneficiaries got their free food grains on Friday at centres set up across the city. “I finally got ration today. It is a major relief in such times. Incomes have dropped badly and there is hardly any work to ensure stable wages,” said Kavita Devi, who did the rounds of two other schools in the last two days without any luck before receiving grains at a government school in Gautampuri on Friday. On Tuesday, Delhi food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain assured that there will be no shortage of stocks, adding that the government has placed orders with the Food Corporation of India. He said the start government will provide free food grains to all the estimated two million beneficiaries. According to government officials, public schools in Jhilmil Colony, Hari Nagar, Begumpur and Janakpuri were among the centres which catered to all beneficiaries on Friday. “The system will be further streamlined in the coming days as more food grain is scheduled to arrive,” said a senior government official.While the Delhi government had made provisions to allot food grains to 200,000 of the overall 2 million beneficiaries in the first phase, officials said more people turned up to collect the ration than expected.Officials said they have already placed orders for more ration to speed up distribution.As per beneficiaries HT spoke to, centres set up at schools in Hauz Rani, Munirka, Shahpur Jat, RK Puram, Ber Sarai continued to send people back citing shortage of stock.Also, a large number of people complained that the government had not amply advertised the drive, and they had a tough time finding the schools from which ration was being distributed.“I had to run from pillar to post looking for the school from which the distribution was taking place. I started with the ration shop but there was nothing on the notice board. Finally, I got help from the SDM office who pointed me to a school in Begumpur from where I got the ration,” said Kusum Devi, a resident of Seemapuri.The government said that people can call up the 1031 helpline, which was mainly set up for Covid-19 related queries, for help identifying the location of schools from which ration is being distributed.Delhi has 7.2 million ration beneficiaries who got 100% subsidised ration in May and June under a relief measure announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on May 4 in the light of the lockdown. On May 18, Kejriwal extended the relief to people without ration cards too, pegging the number of beneficiaries at 2 million over and above those covered under the public distribution system. The scheme was implemented on June 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-ration-distribution-for-those-without-cards-picks-up-101623433826544.html

Delhi govt announces distribution of ration in normal mode||New Delhi Amid an ongoing tussle with the Centre, the Delhi government has virtually put on hold its plan to implement a pilot run of the doorstep delivery of ration scheme in the city this month.In an order issued on Thursday, the Delhi food department directed fair price shops to start disbursing ration among beneficiaries for the month of June from Friday, including in Seemapuri where the government was planning to carry out the pilot run of the doorstep delivery scheme. The additional allocation made to each beneficiary under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) will also commence simultaneously, said the order, a copy of which HT has seen.While people are entitled to 4kg wheat, 1kg rice and 1kg sugar under regular ration in Delhi, they will get an additional 5kg food grains under PMGKAY till Diwali, as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 7. While food grains under PMGKAY are 100% subsidised, the Delhi government had announced free regular ration for May and June. Delhi has 1.78 million ration card holders which translates to 7.2 million beneficiaries.Last Saturday, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal has “rejected” the scheme citing lack of Centre’s approval and a pending case in the high court. The L-G office, however, said Baijal did not “reject” the scheme and only “advised for the constitutional scheme of things to be followed in letter and spirit”.This was the second time this year that the scheme was stalled due to differences between the Delhi government and the Centre. The scheme was to be launched on March 25, but the Union food and consumers affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 raising two objections to the scheme — the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and that any change in the delivery mechanism in the NFSA requires an amendment that can be done only by Parliament.On Tuesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and urged him to approve the scheme in the “national interest”. In his letter, Kejriwal assured the Prime Minister that the Delhi government was ready to make whatever changes the central government will suggest in the long-delayed scheme to deliver ration at the doorsteps of the beneficiaries. He said his government only aims to provide ration to the poor and did not want any credit.The scheme was first approved in March 2018 but could not be implemented because of administrative issues, largely over approved methods to distribute ration under the NFSA. It also led to a tussle between the elected government and lieutenant governor, leading to a demonstration outside the L-G’s office by the top leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/doorstep-delivery-on-hold-delhi-govt-announces-distribution-of-ration-in-normal-mode-101623433766520.html

11-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers go for multiple paddy varieties, sowing methods||Farmers in Punjab are adopting multiple varieties and different methods for paddy sowing on their farms simultaneously, a new trend noticed by the state agriculture department. “We have noticed that farmers are growing kharif crops, particularly paddy, in an intelligent manner. They are growing paddy by direct seeding on one portion of their farm, and on the other portion, they are adopting transplantation on puddle fields,” said Baldev Singh, a senior official in the Punjab agriculture directorate. The official said farmers are also mixing varieties, such as the long-duration and high-yielding Pusa-44, short-duration PR (parmal rice) varieties and aromatic basmati. This kharif season, coarse varieties of paddy are expected to be grown over 24.5 lakh hectares and basmati over 5.5 lakh hectares. Nek Singh, a progressive farmer from a village near Nabha in Patiala, said that every farmer should diversify in whatever small way possible. Growing different varieties will help farmers, because if basmati fails to fetch a good price, the coarse varieties covered under minimum support price (MSP) regimen can stabilise their income. According to an announcement made two days ago, the Centre has increased the MSP on paddy by ₹72 per quintal from the existing ₹1,888. Against the previous season, the area under DSR (direct seeding of rice) is expected to be doubled to 10 lakh hectares, almost 40% of the total area (24.5 lakh hectares) under coarse varieties and one-third of the total area under paddy cultivation, this kharif season. According to data gathered by the agriculture department, the transplantation of Pusa-44 in puddle fields has started from June 10, the date mandated by the state government for beginning paddy transplant, while paddy sowing by DSR method has already been reported over 2 lakh hectares. The sowing under DSR method started on May 25 and will go up to June 15, while the ideal time for the transplanting varieties is from June 10 to July 15. Paddy varieties and preferences in PunjabThe water-guzzling Pusa-44, developed by Delhi-based Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) that is commonly referred to as Pusa institute, is one of the oldest varieties grown in the state. The council has stopped producing it, but farmers are still producing its seeds on their own. The PR varieties belong to Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, which sells them to farmers. While farmers in Sangrur, Barnala and Mansa belt prefer Pusa-44 variety, those in the rest of the state grow mixed varieties. “We are recommending short-duration PR varieties. But farmers don’t want to stop growing Pusa-44 variety completely because of its high yield of 6-10 quintals per hectare over the PR varieties,” said Baldev Singh. He said PR varieties grown by the DSR method save at least 25% water. Pusa-44 takes 155-160 days for maturing, leaving very short window for wheat sowing in the upcoming rabi season, which is still grown over 22% of the total area. Hence, short-duration PR varieties that take 135-138 days are recommended. According to PAU vice-chancellor BS Dhillon, in changing times, farmers should act smartly and go for multiple varieties and even multiple crops. “I suggest them to also grow maize and cotton simultaneously with paddy if it suits their soil and climatic conditions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-farmers-go-for-multiple-paddy-varieties-sowing-methods-101623431247122.html
11-06-2021||Chandigarh||Post-matric scholarship: Relief for SC students in Punjab||After the Punjab government agreed to release funds under the post-matric scholarship scheme, the Joint Association of Colleges (JAC) of private educational institutions on Friday decided to issue roll numbers to nearly two lakh scheduled caste (SC) students in the state. The decision to issue roll numbers was taken after the state government agreed to release 40% of the outstanding amount of SC post-matric scholarship scheme pertaining to financial years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. The two sides reached the agreement at a meeting held between a committee of ministers headed by finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and the association of private educational institutions. The high-powered committee also included technical education and industrial training minister Charanjit Singh Channi, higher education minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, social welfare minister Sadhu Singh Dharmsot, chief principal secretary to CM Suresh Kumar and secretaries of various departments. The JAC was represented by chief patron Satnam Singh Sandhu, chairman Gurmeet Singh Dhaliwal, president Jagjit Singh and co-chairman Anshu Kataria among others. The private educational institutions have been protesting against non-disbursal of ₹1,549 crore by the state government under the scholarship scheme, and had decided to withhold roll numbers of students. In the meeting, the state government agreed to release 40% of the outstanding amount. Out of this, 50% amount will be released within this year and balance 50% will be released in the next financial year, according to Kataria.For the remaining 60% from the year 2017-18 to 2019-20, the state government and JAC will follow up with the central government. Kataria said the govt has also agreed to form a committee to rationalise the fee capping issue of BEd, ETT, ITI, MEd and other courses. The committee will submit its report within 30 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/postmatric-scholarship-relief-for-sc-students-in-punjab-101623431187212.html

11-06-2021||Lucknow||More Congress leaders in Uttar Pradesh may be weighing their options||A number of senior Congress leaders have left the party over the years and many more may do so ahead of the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, said people claiming to be privy to the developments.Jitin Prasada, Rita Bahuguna Joshi and Jagdambika Pal are some of the top Congress leaders from Uttar Pradesh who have switched loyalties to the BJP in recent years. Others may be weighing their options or waiting for an opportune time to do so.Although Congress leaders remained aware of the developments and watched them closely, the party failed to take corrective measures well in time, people familiar with the issue said.“A few months before every assembly or parliamentary polls, the “aaya ram gaya ram” (political cross-over) phenomenon is witnessed in all the political parties, but the grand old party has remained in focus for this in recent years,” said a senior party leader when asked about reports that more leaders may be looking for options outside the party.Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu said Jitin Prasada had no political base among the people and this was the reason that he failed win even an assembly election in 2017 when the party aligned with the Samajwadi Party (SP). He said Prasada’s exit would not make any difference to the party. Lallu said he was not aware of any other leader making moves to leave the Congress.Others aware of the developments, however, admitted the party was going through a bad phase.“The Congress leadership should focus on strengthening the party organisation and ensure that the party is considered a contender for power,” said another leader.“If some leaders are leaving the Congress, some will join it, too. Jitin Prasada’s overtures to the BJP have been known to the party. So are the moves of the other leaders. Jitin Prasada could have left the party when the Congress considered fielding him as a candidate from Lucknow in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. What did not materialise in 2019 appears to have worked now. This is the time for leaders to look for options. There are reports about another former Union minister who may be considering moving out. There are similar reports about the son of a senior leader. This number may be higher,” he said.Congress MLAs from Rae Bareli Aditi Singh and Rakesh Singh from Harchandpur (also in Rae Bareli) are known for their proximity with the BJP. A Congress petition to disqualify them from membership of the assembly has not worked and they continue to be party MLAs. Both of them are likely to look for their future outside the party in 2022.“You know things work differently in the Congress. Major organisational changes are expected in the party at all-India level and this will have a fallout in Uttar Pradesh, too. We hope things will be worked out soon,” said the party leader.After the Congress received a drubbing in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party had dissolved all district and city units. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had initiated a major programme to revamp the party. A new team of district and city unit leaders was picked up under the leadership of Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attended a training session for new office bearers at the Bhuemau guesthouse in Rae Bareli in January 2020. UPCC’s new team, however, evoked a mixed response and a dividing line persists between the old timers and the new team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/more-congress-leaders-in-uttar-pradesh-may-be-weighing-their-options-101623430047330.html
11-06-2021||Pune||Fire destroys a portion of British-era Mahatma Phule heritage market||Mahatma Phule Mandai, the 138-year-old heritage vegetable market in the old city of Pune caught fire around 12.30 am on Friday and the flames were brought under control within 20 minutes. According to the central fire brigade officials, fire broke out in the inner roof of the market during midnight, but the exact cause of the fire could not be ascertained. No casualties were reported in the incident and the total damage was being assessed. PMC fire chief Prashant Ranpise said that the British-era structure with a wooden interior caught fire around midnight. Accordingly, the fire brigade rushed to the spot but by then, some of the interiors had been burnt to ashes. The fire was brought under control with the help of three fire tenders and the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained, he said. Mahatma Phule mandai (formerly known as Lord Reay’s market) is the biggest retail vegetable market in the city is housed in an iconic building from the British colonial era in the Shukrawar peth. The construction of the building had started in 1882 and it was completed in 1886. Fire officer Pradeep Bedekar said, “The old wooden structure on the eastern side of market caught fire. The flames spreading fast due to the wooden structure and more fire tenders, water tankers and a Devdoot vehicle were rushed to the spot to douse the flames. We brought the situation under control within 20 minutes. Some wooden compartments in the market were damaged due to fire which is suspected to have taken place due to a short circuit. However, we are still investigating the other reasons behind the fire,” he said. A massive fire broke out at the Chhatrapati Shivaji market on the night of March 15 which destroyed at least 25 shops in the fish and chicken section of the market. Fire tenders from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) were rushed to the spot and the fire was brought under control within an hour’s time. Chhatrapati Shivaji Market, a grade I heritage structure, has been a bustling marketplace since its construction in 1885 by British army officer Lt Gen John Ross as per the design by Gen Cecil D’Urban La Touche and WM Ducat. The heritage structure still awaits restoration owing to lack of funds from Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) which is facing a near bankruptcy of central government funds for the past three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fire-destroys-a-portion-of-british-era-mahatma-phule-heritage-market-101623427947697.html

Most big companies and organisations use professionals to manage their Facebook (FB) accounts. The Punjab school education department, however, has directed teachers to publicise and promote its social media posts on its FB page, titled ‘Activities School Education Punjab’. The department has launched a competition among districts to monitor their performance on the number of likes, comments and share on its FB page. To beat competition, some districts have started assigning targets of likes, share and comments to teachers, who are uneasy. Most teachers are resentful at the additional task, claiming that the education department is using them as its Information Technology (IT) cell.A block primary officer education officer of Malwa, pleading anonymity, said, “For long, general guidelines have been in place for promoting social media content. Now, district education departments have been assigned particular days to do such tasks.”Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar education department has given targets to its teachers and deputed nine officials to ensure that the work is done. The order from district education officer (secondary), SBS Nagar, reads, “The education department is organising a healthy competition among all districts related to the activity page of the education department is being organised. SBS Nagar’s turn is from 11pm of June 17 to 11pm of June 18. Officials will ensure ten likes, ten shares and ten comments from all subordinate teachers.”Moga deputy DEO, secondary, Rakesh Makkar, said, “Our turn has been fixed for June 27. This activity is about sharing the good work of the education department. This will help in increasing enrolment of students in government schools. No teacher is being forced to do the tasks.”Vikramdev Singh, state president, Democratic Teacher’s Front, said, “The education department is using teachers as the IT cell of the state government. It is an attack on an individual’s freedom on social media. Like other citizens, teachers also have the freedom to choose what to like and what to share.”SBS Nagar DEO (secondary) Jagjit Singh; DPI (secondary) Sukjeetpal Singh and state education secretary Krishan Kumar did not respond to repeated calls and messages on their cell phones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-govt-school-teachers-resent-order-to-promote-education-dept-fb-page-101623427847751.html

Recently, Hindustan Times published a report on the issue of residents of Indira Gandhi Vashat near Ambil odha under the Neelayam theatre flyover under fear due to cracks in their homes. After that, PMC officials visited the area and inspected the homes and issued notices to vacate their homes for the precautionary measurement. However, local residents registered an opposition and refused to accept the notices and vacate their homes in the monsoon season. Dilip Waghmare, resident of Indira Gandhi Vasahat said, “Cracks are developed due to negligence of contractors. PMC should punish them and provide us compensation to repair our homes. Instead of that, PMC slapped notices to vacate our homes. At this stage, how can we leave our well-furnished homes and stay in nearby PMC schools. Why should we suffer due to the irresponsible work of contractor?” Vilas Phad, executive engineer of drainage and maintenance department said, “The retaining wall work is going on along Ambil odha near the Indira Gandhi Vasahat. We requested residents to shift temporarily till the retaining wall work is not completed. If we find contractor work is responsible for cracks, we will ask the contractor to repair cracks.” Meanwhile, there are more than 40 families living along the Ambil odha near Seva Dal office in Survey number 133. It is called 52 chawl. There is an old compound wall along the Odha. But, it is not in good condition. Therefore, the PMC drainage department has undertaken work to construct a parallel compound to strengthen the existing one to protect residents from the flood like situation.

11-06-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh assembly polls: Big parties begin wooing smaller outfits||Uttar Pradesh’s smaller political parties are being wooed by the major political players in the run-up to next year’s assembly elections due to their influence in various pockets of the state.With about eight to nine months to go for the elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress are vying with one another to keep these smaller parties in good humour ahead of the 2022 elections.Union home minister Amit Shah’s meeting with Apna Dal (Sonelal) chief Anupriya Patel and Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (Nishad) party president Sanjay Nishad in Delhi has set the pitch in this context.Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP), an erstwhile ally of the BJP, is also being sought after for an alliance, people familiar with the development claimed.“The BJP has sent feelers to Rajbhar to join the alliance for the 2022 assembly elections,” said a SBSP leader who did not wish to be named. But SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar on Friday denied meeting BJP leaders.The importance the BJP is giving to its allies Apna Dal (S) and Nishad party can be gauged from the fact that immediately after his interaction with UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday, the Union home minister met Patel and Nishad. The BJP shared the photos of both the leaders meeting Shah on various social media platforms.Apna Dal (S) enjoys influence over the Kurmi caste settled in the Mirzapur and Varanasi region of eastern Uttar Pradesh. It contested the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls and the 2017 assembly elections in alliance with the BJP.While Apna Dal MLAs are ministers in the UP government, Anupriya was minister in the central government from 2016-19.Recently, there was speculation about differences between the two parties over representation in the state and central governments. Purported efforts by the Samajwadi Party to woo Apna Dal (S) also set alarm bells ringing in the BJP camp.To send the message that the relationship between both the allies was resilient, Shah met Patel, those in the know of things claimed. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav was quick to hit back, alleging that there was something “dubious” in the meeting of the BJP leaders with the presidents of smaller parties.The Nishad party that is said to be influential among the Kewat, Mallah, Nishad and Bind castes in central and east UP joined the alliance with the BJP before the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Sanjay Nishad’s son Praveen Kumar Nishad was elected to the Lok Sabha from Sant Kabir Nagar in eastern UP.In the 2018 Lok Sabha by-poll, the Nishad party had given a jolt to the BJP by winning the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat. The SP and BSP had supported the Nishad party in the by-election for the prestigious seat vacated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath.Of late, there had been murmurs about relations between the BJP and the Nishad party souring. Sanjay Nishad alleged that BJP had failed to fulfil its promises and the Nishad party’s request to include 14 backward castes in the scheduled castes’ list had also not been met.People privy to the development claimed Shah assured Sanjay Nishad that the BJP will fulfil the promises. Earlier, a senior SP leader had met Sanjay Nishad with the request to ally with the Samajwadi Party for the assembly election.Newly elected Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Jayant Chaudhary has made it clear that his party will contest the assembly election in alliance with the SP to send a message to its support base, the Jat community settled in western UP. RLD has also announced its support to SP candidates in the zila panchayat chairpersons’ election likely to be held in June-end or early July.The Mahan Dal that is said to be popular among Maurya, Kushwaha and Saini caste voters has announced its support for the SP in the assembly elections. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) led by Asaduddin Owaisi and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar have announced the launch of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha (BSM) to form an alliance of smaller political parties for the 2022 assembly election. The Morcha had invited the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bhim Army to join the pre-poll alliance. The Jan Adhikar Party led by Babu Singh Kushwaha, Rashtriya Uday Party president Babu Rampal, Rashtriya Upekshit Samaj Party chief Premchanda Prajapati and Janata Kranti Party president Anil Singh Chauhan have given their consent to join the alliance, he said. These parties have some influence over backward and Dalit communities in various regions of state.The leaders of the SP, BSP and Congress are holding regular talks with BSM to sew up an alliance for the assembly elections. Rajbhar said the announcement of an alliance with other political parties would be made at the appropriate time.Political analyst SK Srivastava said the BJP won the 2017 assembly elections with the support of the non-Yadav backward castes, non-Jatav Dalits, as well as the upper caste Brahmins and Rajputs.The BJP leaders were now working to retain the support of these caste groups by wooing their leaders, he said.Professor SK Dwivedi, former head of the political science department at Lucknow University, said major political parties could not ignore the role of smaller parties in garnering votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-assembly-polls-big-parties-begin-wooing-smaller-outfits-101623427547488.html

Hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) on Covid management in the state, the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar reiterated the need for updating the official website for registration of births and deaths and sought to know who was responsible for maintaining it at the state level and why there were multiple sites for the purpose. The court also directed amicus curiae Mrigank Mauli and Parul Prasad to do some research as to how many such portals were functional in the state.“There is a reason why there is a department of statistics. The proper compilation of data has effect on policy planning,” it said, citing the example of a boy with black fungus admitted in serious condition to the hospital with no Covid symptoms, but was later diagnosed Covid positive and developed problems in vital organs.The AG presented the affidavit of the chief secretary with details of the revision of death figures, which went up to 9,375 on June 9 from just 5,424 just a day earlier. The AG said that disciplinary action was being taken against the officials concerned for not reporting deaths in houses, isolation homes, private hospitals etc. earlier. “But is the figure complete in all respects now? We don’t see it being mentioned anywhere in the affidavit. After all, all the functionaries entrusted with the job of reporting deaths be at the level of panchayati raj institutions or the urban local bodies are duty bound to do it,” the bench said.Development commissioner Amit Subhani, who is also in-charge of the department of planning and statistics, also joined the proceedings and explained the mechanism of updating data regarding birth and death registration on the official portal. “”There is a unified system and unified software of the central government for the purpose under registrar general. There is director, statistics, at the state level as well designated registrars at the level of the panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies for uploading data, but the official portal is maintained by the Centre. There is just one such official platform. Whether it is for public viewing can be ascertained from the Centre only,” he said.On this, the court sought to know why there was a parallel portal under the urban development and housing department. “From the affidavits we see, there are at least three such platforms,” it said, to which the AG would present facts during the next hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/are-revised-death-figures-complete-hc-asks-govt-101623427287573.html

He also voiced his objection to the picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Covid-19 vaccination certificates.For the record, the HAM(S) described Tej Pratap Yadav’s visit to Manjhi as “personal”. “It was a purely personal visit by Tej Pratap. Manjhi talked to the RJD chief to convey birthday wishes. There was no political talk during the meeting,” said HAM(S) spokesperson Danish Rizwan.However, before the visit, Tej Pratap Yadav told media persons at the party office that HAM(S) was always welcome in the opposition’s grand alliance. “If Manjhi is feeling restless, he is free to join us,” he said.Party’s senior leader and former speaker Uday Narayan Choudhary spoke of heightened political activity once RJD chief returns to Patna.HAM(S) spokesperson Rizwan, though, vehemently rejected the possibility of his party leaving the NDA.Manjhi’s party has four MLAs currently. His son Santosh Suman is a member of Nitish Kumar’s cabinet. Since the NDA enjoys only a slender majority in the Assembly, his party’s support is crucial for the ruling alliance.Sources say Manjhi was not happy over being apparently sidelined in selection of nominees for MLCs from Governor’s quota.Later, Manjhi said in a statement that he was very much part of the NDA and would remain with chief minister Nitish Kumar.BJP MP and former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi said there should not be any haste in deriving any political meaning if any public representative pays a courtesy visit to a leader. “Manjhi is a tall Dalit leader and not a leader of any caste. He has seen the misgovernance of RJD. If somebody is made to meet him forcibly, it makes no difference. NDA is intact and the state government will complete its full term,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tej-pratap-visits-manjhi-ex-cm-dials-lalu-101623427286850.html

The official said that the forensics team or anti-terrorism squad (ATS) sleuths had not found any trace RDX or improvised explosives from the site. “It seems crude bombs kept in a steel container exploded one by one.”The police had also recovered ₹1.65 lakh from almirah of the deceased Imam, Mohammad Abdul Momin Sattar, which has been handed over to his family members. The madrassa didn’t have any students present at the time of the blast since it was shut since Bihar enforced lockdown on May 5.Meanwhile, Banka district magistrate Suharsh Bhagat said madrassa was not a registered one.

11-06-2021||Delhi||Baba returns to dhaba: Rise and fall of the social media sensation||A video of a teary-eyed old couple who ran a small eatery in Delhi’s Malviya Nagar and were forced into penury due to Covid-19, tugged at the heartstrings of many, last year. Featuring Kanta Prasad aka Baba — owner of Baba ka Dhaba, which was set up by him and his wife to make ends meet — the video became viral overnight and donations poured in, so much so that it enabled him to open a restaurant, last December. But, Prasad, 80, is now back to square one, for the restaurant had to be shut due to insufficient earnings.“I had to shut that new eatery on February 15 this year, since I was incurring heavy losses. Tushant (Adlakha; social worker) had said he’d help run it, but woh chala gaya (he left). There were expenses in running it, including the rent and workers’ salaries whereas the income was barely anything. So we closed it and sold off all the equipments and that fetched us somewhere around ₹36,000 out of the ₹5 lakh we had invested. Wahan parking bhi nahi thi, kaafi dikkat thi jagah mein (There was no parking available there, and other issues as well),” informs Prasad, adding that he wasn’t responsible for managing the funds that came to him as donations via social media. Many accustomed to Baba, however claim that he wasn’t experienced enough to handle the money that he amassed and that lead to the closure of the restaurant. One, for instance, is Adlakha, who not only differs from Baba’s claims but also presents another side to the resurged controversy. “Baba had received around ₹42 lakhs through donations. A majority of this sum they had put in a fixed deposit, making their younger son as the nominee, which caused a rift in his family. After the restaurant became functional, neither of his sons devoted time to manage the restaurant, and Baba had to sit at the counter himself. He would also drink regularly at night,” says Adlakha stating that Baba has been retracting from his statements quite often. “I’ve been reading reports of Baba saying that I advised him incorrectly on opening a new restaurant, or that I’d help him run it,” states Adlakha, clarifying, “The truth is that he already had a plan to open a new restaurant, which he had discussed with Gaurav (Wasan; food blogger), and I was put in touch with Baba via Gaurav. We tried to help him out with everything from looking at possible locations to purchasing the equipment and taking decisions on funds. Baba was involved at every step, and it was him and his sons who managed the money... Later, Baba called me to help him out, but I had personal commitments and college work as well, so I couldn’t. I had plans to call and check on him, but now I’m deeply hurt by what he is saying about me publicly!” It was reported by us last October that YouTuber Lakshay Chaudhary had accused food blogger Gaurav Wasan, of Swad Official — who had filmed the old couple’s heart-wrenching video, which went viral — of allegedly misappropriating an amount of more than ₹20 lakh that came as part of the donations for Baba; who even filed a cheating complaint against Wasan. Ask Baba if he still holds grudges against Wasan, and he says: “Koi gile shikwe nahi hain. Agar wo (Gaurav) aayenge toh hum unhe baithaenge sath (There is no ill feeling. If he comes, we will sit together).” Since Baba is back at his old eatery this month, he tells us that he’s doing just about okay and earns somewhere between ₹500-1,000 daily. “I’m now doing everything on my own. Humara kam sahi chal raha hai, aur kisi baat ki pareshani nahi hai (Our work is going well and there is no trouble of any sort). After me, my kids will run Baba ka Dhaba!” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/baba-returns-to-dhaba-rise-and-fall-of-the-social-media-sensation-101623427123487.html

11-06-2021||Pune||14 tempos vandalised by a security guard in Wakad||A security guard went on a rampage and vandalised 14 vehicles in Wakad on Thursday night. The accused who was drunk attacked the vehicles with a wooden stick and damaged them by smashing the windshield of mostly commercial tempos which were parked at the spot. The Wakad police have arrested the security guard and detained two others in the case. According to the police, the security guard identified as Kiran Gadge had objected to vegetable vendors and tempo drivers for parking their vehicles in front of the society main gate. He was also disturbed as the vendors and auto driver were dumping garbage and urinated in an open space in front the society main gate in Mhatobanagar in Wakad. The society residents too had objected to the development and asked the guard to enforce discipline. Accordingly, he reminded them a number of times, but his plea fell on deaf ears. Since then, he was angry which led to his violent behaviour on Thursday night, the police said. Wakad police station in charge Vivek Mugalikar said that a huge police force was rushed to the spot to prevent the violence. “The guard was upset and seems to have taken the decision to vandalise during an inebriated condition. It is a serious case, and an offence has been lodged against the security guard. We are also looking into details of the other accused and examining their role in the violence. Based on the investigation and evidence, action will be taken against them,” he said. Meanwhile, PCMC police chief Krishna Prakash has given strict orders to all the police stations to take strong action against those indulging in spreading fear in the society through vandalism. Wakad including Pimpri-Chinchwad has been witnessing many events of vehicle vandalism since 2017. These incidents usually involve youngsters, especially juveniles, who take law into their own hands. Their motive seems to be spreading terror among residents and establishing supremacy of their gangs. Though tough measures have been undertaken, it failed to deter the law breaker from taking the extreme step of destruction of public property. In Oct 2021, in a fear spreading incident, a mob of 100 unidentified persons vandalised 10 vehicles with machetes, swords, and cement blocks on the streets of Nehru Nagar in Pimpri. It was a petty dispute between two gangs which resulted in mob vandalism of vehicles. The clash and violence took place when groups of 100 youths from the second group went to kill the other group. As many as 21 vehicles were damaged. In Feb 2021, six vehicles were damaged by the vandals in Bhosari by the youths of warring factions. Amongst the steps taken, the PCMC have been issuing written warnings to known offenders, besides carrying out combing operations in slum pockets to flush out miscreants, as a part of an exercise to check the unprecedented rise in the number of cases of vehicle vandalism. The police have also booked offenders under more stringent legal provisions of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, offences of extortion, robbery and issuance of threats, as the case may be. As many as fifty cases of vehicle vandalism where over 500 vehicles have been damaged in PCMC have been registered since 2018 with over 100 persons arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/14-tempos-vandalised-by-a-security-guard-in-wakad-101623426746168.html

As per PMC, the heritage and garden committee had come up with a unique concept in 2015 which categorised old trees not only on the criteria of age but the value of heritage, rare, unique botanically and ecological significance. Pimple and chapha trees at Parvati temple complex, the date palm tree at Parsi Agyari (Nana peth), the banyan tree at Pune university, Medshinigi tree at Marimata temple inside Pune university campus, Gorakchinch tree at Abhinav chowk on Tilak road, Shirish tree in Vaikunth crematorium are some of the heritage trees mentioned in the PMC garden department report tabled in PMC heritage committee for approval. The PMC garden department identified almost 45 such trees which fitted in the category of heritage, old, historical significance and unique species in the city. In 2015, the PMC garden department had shortlisted 45 trees on the basis of historical, botanical and ecological significance, of that, the heritage committee approved 25 trees. Ashokh Ghorpade, chief garden department of the PMC said, “Before the state government, the PMC introduced a heritage trees concept in 2015. After giving approval by the heritage committee, we placed green board on the tress which includes local, botanical, vernacular and popular names of the tree, origin of the tree, historical information, medicinal use.” Dr Sachin Anil Punekar, botanist and founder president Biospheres and one of the members of state government heritage tree committee said, “I was also part of the PMC tree authority committee when the concept was introduced. We welcome the decision of the state government to preserve heritage trees in the state. But age should be one of the criteria instead of a major and important one to announce a heritage tree. The state government should have to include other criteria such as historical, botanical, ecological, social, spiritual and traditional significance and value which PMC considered while declaring heritage trees in Pune city. If we consider age as the only criteria, we will find more than 10,000 such trees in the PMC jurisdiction. We mentioned Pimple in the heritage structure which is located at Parvati temple complex because Nanasaheb Peshwa performed the thread ceremony of this tree in 1754. Lal Chapha or Dev chafa tree is also placed in the same complex which is one of the oldest trees (300 years old).” He further explained, “Gorakh Chinch tree is located at Abhinav chowk, at the junction of Tilak and Bajirao road. They are important as they are rare and have a unique shape. Walunj (Indian Willow) is an indigenous tree and located near Chavan bridge near Poona hospital.” ========================================= Box Some of the heritage trees declared by PMC Name of the tree Botanical Name Location Age Pimpal Ficus religious Parvati temple 250 Chapha Plumeria rubra Parvati temple 300 Date palm Phoenix dactylifera Parsi Agyari, 55 - 60 Nana peth Wad ficus benghalensis Pune university 125 -150 Gorakhchinch Adansonia digitata Abhinav chowk, 130 Tilak road||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-designates-25-trees-as-heritage-based-on-historical-botanical-and-ecological-significance-101623426686201.html

If the prices are not checked, it would lead to chaos in the country,” he said. Comparing the current fuel prices with those during the Congress-led UPA government, the finance minister said price of petrol was below ₹70 when international crude price reached US$145, but the Modi government was now selling petrol for ₹100 per litre when crude price was only ₹73 per barrel. “This is the model of Modi goverment, wherein it is only interested in serving the interest of corporates and private companies,” Oraon said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/spiralling-fuel-prices-can-lead-to-chaos-in-country-congress-101623425859349.html

The Centre has asked the state urban development department to begin work on the project within a week. Till then, all funds to be received by the state urban development under PM Awas Yojana (urban) for the project are being held up, Union urban development department officials communicated the same to state officials during recent a virtual meeting on June 8 and 9. State urban development secretary Vinay Kumar Choubey said, “All these instructions were given during the meeting. But, we have not received any letter in this regard from the Government of India till now.” Under the LHP, as many as 1,008 affordable houses will be constructed for the poor and middle-class. The project will come up on 7.5 acres of land using innovating construction technologies named ‘NAVARITIH’ (new, affordable, validated, research innovation technologies for Indian housing) at an estimated cost of ₹133.99 crore. However, work on the project could not take off due to protest by local people, who are demanding shifting of the project from the current location, as they claim it to be the only playground in the area. On April 12 this year, the urban development department started soil sample collection work for the project, but it stopped after protest by locals, including women and children, under the banner of Basti Bachao Sangharsh Samiti (BBSS). As per sources in urban development department, the state was supposed to receive ₹5.5 lakh for each house under the project from the Centre. However, now the latter has made it clear not to release any fund until satisfactory progress is seen on the project, officials said. Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA) on Thursday wrote to Ranchi deputy commissioner to ensure adequate security, including women police force, for starting the project work scheduled on June 15. Soil sample collection will be done on the said date, officials said. DMA director JV Narayan Rao said, “If locals are creating trouble for a project being built on government land, it is the district administration’s responsibility to maintain law and order situation at the site. So, we have written to Ranchi administration to provide adequate security for soil sample collection work scheduled on June 15.” She said, “As per norms, we will not get state’s share in the project until Centre releases fund. We were expecting the Centre’s fund, but it has been held up for not starting the project on time. We have been told that they will not release fund until they see any progress in the project.” The LHP will include on-site infrastructure development such as internal roads, pathways, common green area, boundary walls, water supply, sewerage and drainage system, rain water harvesting, solar lighting, external electrification and others. The carpet area per flat will be around 315 square feet.Meanwhile, the agitating BBSS members said they will not allow the project to take off at the identified location. BBSS convener Mintu Paswan said, “We are not against the LHP, but we are protesting against the location where it is proposed to be built.

11-06-2021||Ranchi||Interstate buses ply uninterrupted despite ban in lockdown||In a flagrant violation of lockdown norms, nearly 40-50 buses ferry passengers daily from state capital Ranchi to different cities in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Chattisgarh and other states.Despite a ban imposed by Jharkhand government on interstate movement of buses for ferrying passengers, these buses originate from different locations in Ranchi on daily basis in the evening and crossed state borders uninterrupted without check.Not only this, they also return to Jharkhand carrying passengers from different states. Interestingly, these passengers neither possess the mandatory e-pass required for entry in Jharkhand nor they maintain compulsory home isolation after arrival.“The to-and-fro interstate movement of these buses have begun since Unlock-1. These operations are not possible without the support of local administration,” said a bus owner on the condition of anonymity.“I arrived to Ranchi from Patna through bus on Friday morning. Due to some urgent work, I had gone to Patna two days back. The bus, by which I returned, dropped me at Booty More. During lockdown, the fare has increased threefold,” said a passenger Ramesh Singh, who didn’t divulge his residential location.He, however, said that he was maintaining home isolation.According to sources, many buses ply on the garb of transporting labourers for project work in different states. For this, they secured passes for one or two days. But, on the strength of the same expired passes, they continued operations for further period.The Ranchi district administration has impounded one such letter issued by a central authority from a bus owner, who was required to transport labourers for Central Vista project. The administration is verifying the genuinity of the said letter. “We have launched a crackdown on illegal movement of these buses. Some of them have been seized. Cases have also been lodged against them under Disaster Management Act,” Ranchi’s regional transport authority secretary Niranjan Kumar said. The bus owners carry out this illegal operation under a well set-up system. Their agents book tickets at bus terminals. Tickets can also be booked through phone. An hour before departure, these agents inform the passengers about the location from where they can board the bus. If they find difficulty, they are asked to arrive at a fixed location near the bus terminus. From here, they are taken to the right place through auto rickshaws.According to a bus owner, these buses generally originate from Ranchi’s Ring Road, some roadside highway eateries and some petrol pumps. During the day, the buses park near Jumaar bridge, Dhurwa and many petrol pumps between Booty More to Ormanjhi.He also said that generally buses take different routes other than their routine ones to reach the destination. Buses, that go to Bihar’s Buxar district or Uttar Pradesh, move via Daltonganj and not via Hazaribagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/interstate-buses-ply-uninterrupted-despite-ban-in-lockdown-101623425789241.html
11-06-2021||Other||UP zila panchayat president poll: RLD, SP accuse BJP of using “unethical tactics”||The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and Samajwadi Party (SP) have accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of adopting “unethical tactics” to rope in their zila panchayat members in Baghpat to ensure the victory of the ruling party candidate on the post of zila panchayat president in the forthcoming election. The elections are likely to be held in second week of July. The post of zila panchayat president in Baghpat is reserved for a dalit woman candidate. The BJP, which had won 4 of the total 20 seats in the recently held zila panchayat membership polls in the district, needs support of 11 members to get its candidate elected for the post of president. While RLD has 8 members, SP has 4 and the remaining 4 are independent candidates. RLD national secretary Kuldeep Ujjawal said only two women candidates Mamta Kishore of RLD (ward 13) and Babli Devi of SP (ward 18) had won as members in zila panchayat elections. BJP had no woman candidate to field for the post of president therefore they somehow lured Babli Devi and got her in their fold. “Now to ensure their victory in the forthcoming election, BJP leaders are misusing government machinery and implicating family members and elected members in false cases,” he alleged. Citing an example he said, Shahida (goes by one name) of RLD was elected as member from ward 17 and to mount pressure on her to vote in favour of BJP a notice of ₹96 lakh dues on her home was sent. Later, her 3 sons too were falsely implicated in a case of firing on a complaint filed by a villager. He also cited the case of Mehboob Alvi, who has been elected from ward 3. “Alvi was summoned to Binauli police station by the then inspector and asked to vote in favour of BJP candidate. In return he was assured of help in settling the dispute of his plot. Alvi too refused to succumb to the pressure and a delegation of RLD and SP leaders met the Baghpat district magistrate Rajkamal Yadav a few days ago and lodged their complaint,” he said. Ujjawal said the inspector was then transferred from the police station. He also blamed that another member from ward 12 Sunil was also harassed by the police. The RLD leader said these incidents have compelled both parties (SP and RLD) to convene an emergency meeting on Sunday to chalk out a strategy to counter the BJP. Ujjawal said a joint delegation of leaders of both parties would also meet additional director general of police Rajeev Sabharwal and IG Praveen Kumar in Meerut on Saturday to brief them about these incidents. He further said elected members of RLD and SP along with some independent members have been sent to their relative’s places so that they could be kept away from being accessed by leaders of ruling party. Samajwadi Party district president in Baghpat Manoj Choudhary also blamed BJP for adopting “unethical practices” to ensure the victory of their candidates. “People have rejected them in panchayat elections and they would be defeated in the forthcoming assembly elections too,” said Choudhary. However, BJP district president in Baghpat Sooraj Pal denied the allegations. “Being the ruling party, members from different wards have approached us to join the party. When the RLD and the SP leaders failed to stop their members from joining BJP they are leveling such baseless accusations. BJP has support of 12 members and our candidate will win the election for zila panchayat president,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-zila-panchayat-president-poll-rld-sp-accuse-bjp-of-using-unethical-tactics-101623425787992.html

11-06-2021||Lucknow||Samajwadi Party says will fiercely contest district panchayat chief elections||In a change of stance, the Samajwadi Party (SP) has now decided to give ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) a tough fight in the zila panchayat president polls by fiercely contesting the elections and trying to win 50 of the 75 seats in the state.“We can easily win 25 Zila panchayat president posts as SP supported candidates won zila panchayat membership in a majority in these districts. But now, with a fast-changing political scenario in the state, uncertainty and speculations in the BJP, and possibilities of getting the support of non-BJP zila panchayat members, we are looking to win 50 seats,” said a senior SP leader.Earlier, the party had announced not to waste energy in countering BJP’s “horse-trading” to win zila panchayat headship elections and rather capitalise on putting up an even more impressive show in the UP assembly polls in 2022.The panchayat elections are not fought on party symbols, but rival parties issue support to their preferred candidates. The election for over 8.69 lakh posts, including the 3,050 Zila panchayat member seats, was held in April.The three-tier panchayat system elected public representatives from the village to the district level and was seen as a curtain-raiser to the 2022 state assembly polls.District panchayat headship elections may be announced soon.After the panchayat elections results came out in early May, the state election commission had decided to put the next level of the polls on the hold given the surge of Covid cases under the second wave of the pandemic.The district panchayat members, who were declared elected between May 2 and May 5, will vote in the indirect elections to choose respective district panchayat head in 75 districts.The declared candidates and aspirant for the district panchayat headship in Samajwadi Party and even other parties (largely BJP) have begun garnering support for victory.Samajwadi Party took the results of the poll as a boost for its preparations and aspirations for 2022.SP state president Naresh Uttam Patel said: “SP supported candidate won the maximum of zila panchayat member seats and we will contest the next level of the polls fiercely. Our fight in the elections is dual, with the ruling party as well as the administration machinery controlled by it.”SP president Akhilesh Yadav already alleged last month that the BJP was indulging in ‘horse-trading and intimidation’ to seize control of zila panchayats.To win the indirect elections, the SP is also betting on heavyweight candidates (in these cases, the candidates who are relatives of established politicians or political families).In Etawah, Akhilesh’s cousin Anshul Yadav is looking to win the post again. In Meerut, the SP has inducted a BSP supported zila panchayat member into the SP and is fielding her for the district panchayat headship. In Meerut, the SP is also sure of getting support from Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). In Moradabad, Amreen, the sister of an SP MLA is contesting the polls, in Amroha, SP is fielding Sakina Begum, the wife of an SP MLA; In Bijnore SP has given ticket to a Sikh woman; in Kushinagar the daughter of an expelled BSP leader is now the SP candidate; in Jaunpur the SP is fielding Ruchi Yadav from a political family; Vijay Yadav, the son of SP MLA Durga Prasad Yadav is Azamgarh candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/samajwadi-party-says-will-fiercely-contest-district-panchayat-chief-elections-101623425307628.html
11-06-2021||Lucknow||Around 10K textile units in Noida,Kanpur face financial crisis: SIDBI-CRIF report||With both the textile hubs of Kanpur and Noida reporting decline in credit (loan), the textile industry has been the worst hit in Uttar Pradesh, suggests the SIDBI-CRIF report on Indian Textiles and Apparels Industry.This is due to the suspension of manufacturing activities after the COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020 imposed to check the spread of pandemic. When the manufacturing activities were to pick up in December-January the deadly second wave dealt a severe blow to the sector. The textiles and apparels industry in India is one of the oldest and largest sectors of the economy. The CRIF is an RBI approved credit bureau in India which provides information about credit-worthiness or credit history of individuals and commercial establishments. The SIDBI’s report states that the number of active loans (volume), in the sector stood at 4.26 lakh as of December 2020. During this period, there has been a decline of 42 percent in the credit (loan) in Kanpur region which is one of the two hubs of textile industry in Uttar Pradesh. Till December 2020, the credit outstanding portfolio in Kanpur was ₹1,730 crore. The credit portfolio of textile industry in the entire Uttar Pradesh was ₹4,600 crore till December 2020. At present, there are over 10,000 textile and garment units across the state with most of them concentrated in Kanpur and Noida region. In Noida region of the state there are around 3,000 textile units. Each unit has a minimum workforce of around 100 employees. Almost all of them are facing financial crisis in the post-pandemic scenario. Foreign buyers are reluctant to place orders with Noida units as they are apprehensive whether they will be able to fulfil the order due to prevailing Covid-19 condition in India. “After the grim Covid-19 picture of India was portrayed in international media, foreign buyers are no more placing orders with us. Instead they are moving to Taiwan and Bangladesh,” said Rajiv Bansal, national secretary, IIA, and a garment exporter. Garment exporters also claim that the Centre has stopped Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), an incentive based scheme for exporters from December 31 last. Against this, the government has launched new scheme Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products (RoDTEP) which is yet to be rolled out, said Rajiv Bansal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/around-10k-textile-units-in-noida-kanpur-face-financial-crisis-sidbi-crif-report-101623424766067.html

The processing and branding of these products will not only help in doubling the farmers’ income but will also attract investment and promote employment opportunities at the local level. After discussion with the Uttar Pradesh government, the union ministry of food processing, under the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ campaign has identified about two dozen agricultural products for adding them in ODOP scheme.

BJP General Secretary of Bengal, Sayantan Bose, told reporters.“West Bengal BJP has set up a disciplinary action committee to take action against leaders who are going against the party,” Bose told news agency ANI.He added that the final decision on the committee rests with party president Dilip Ghosh to take the final decision.Bose’s announcement comes against the backdrop of BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy leaving the party to join his former political outfit the Trinamool Congress (TMC). Roy had joined BJP in 2017 after 19 years of being with the ruling TMC.Bose commented on Roy’s departure stating that the latter had never refused a national position within the party or an electoral ticket.“Mukul Roy was made national vice president. He didn't refuse it. Even when he was offered to contest from Krishnanagar north on BJP ticket for this election, he didn't refuse. I don't know, maybe tomorrow he'll say that he's not feeling good in TMC,” Bose told ANI.Bose also told ANI that Roy’s departure will not impact the party’s organisation as no worker followed him back to TMC.“He has left the party, it's unfortunate. But you should remember that many big leaders, much bigger than Mukul Roy, had left BJP earlier. Today, not even one BJP worker went with him. So, he can leave the party but I don't think it'll have a great impact on our organisation,” he said.Roy’s departure has created as much noise as his entry into the national party. His son Subhranshu, a former legislator, also returned to the TMC fold. The father-son duo were welcomed back in by party supremo Mamata Banerjee who claimed that Roy was threatened by probe agencies but could not stay in the BJP since the party “does not allow dignity and peace”. Roy was accused in the 2016 Narada sting operation case, along with his party colleagues Firhad Hakim, Madan Mitra, Subrata Mukherjee, and former member Sovan Chatterjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-bjp-to-set-up-disciplinary-action-committee-following-mukul-roy-s-exit-101623422341209.html

A delegation comprising Tirkey's mother, Padmavati Oraon, father Devanand Tirkey and MLA Bandhu Tirkey among others called on the CM during the day showing dis-satisfaction in the probe so far and stating that they suspected 'murder' of Tirkey and not suicide. The chief minister said that the Jharkhand government has constituted a one-member inquiry commission to investigate the case of unnatural death and justice would be ensured at all cost. Those found guilty will not be spared, Soren said. The state government had on June 8 issued a notification with regard to forming a judicial probe team under section-3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act. The commission was formed at the instance of the chief minister. A police sub inspector of the 2018 batch, Tirkey had allegedly died by suicide in early May at her government accomodation in Sahebganj. Retired former Chief Justice of Jharkhand High Court Vinod Kumar Gupta has been given the responsibility of the probe and has been asked to submit the report within six months. The commission will look into all the matters related to the alleged suicide by Tirkey. The opposition BJP in the state had been demanding a CBI probe into the matter.

11-06-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: The Mark of Zoru||Fans of the superhero genre will be familiar with one of the earliest examples of a masked avenger, known as Zorro. Created in 1919, this swashbuckling vigilante, who rushes to the aid of those in trouble, went on to capture public imagination, when he was played by Douglas Fairbanks in the Hollywood blockbuster The Mark of Zorro. Forty subsequent films and 10 TV series later, he is believed to be the inspiration for a whole slew of comic book superheroes, Batman in particular. Zorro’s special appeal was that he took on enemies of the greater good, bringing them to book, with expert swordsmanship and fox-like cunning. No matter how strong his opponents, they would ultimately be vanquished by Zorro, as he galloped in, wearing his signature black cape and hat, on his trusty steed Tornado. And no sooner had he annihilated the villains, would he disappear, leaving only the letter Z behind, to mark his presence. *********************************************He may not wear a mask or cape and his name may only bear an echo of the original vigilante, but Mumbai’s environmental activist Zoru Bhathena makes up for it with the passion and commitment he brings to every battle he takes on. Whether it is waging a war against what he sees as the mindless destruction of Mumbai’s coastline, or the senseless plan to build a casting yard for cement girders on Juhu beach, or the felling of 3,000 square metres of precious mangroves to accommodate a bridge, Zoru battles it out in courts, in the media and on the streets, daily. His mission is to save Mumbai from the destruction of “devil-opment” — a word he is proud to have coined, to describe the wanton destruction of Mumbai’s fragile ecosystem and public spaces. Never in his wildest dreams, says this 46-year-old father of teenagers, would he have imagined that he would spend every waking hour fighting so passionately for a better city. Or that during a hearing before the Supreme Court, no less than Tushar Mehta, the Solicitor General of India, would point to him and declare: “He is stopping every single project in Mumbai.” “I have only one regret-of not hollering back “So why doesn’t your government plan and execute things properly in the first place, Mr Solicitor General?” he says. “Having the SG lash out at you in open court is an unnerving feeling, but a proud reminder that you have stood up for what IS right. Till five-six years ago, I too was a happy-go-lucky, unbothered Mumbaikar. But one day something just snapped.” It was a day like any other in 2015, he says, driving home from work on the Western Express Highway to Khar, he had noticed that the entire road was lined with dead trees; trees that had shed their bark and turned an eerie, grave-stone white. The sight had sent a shiver down his spine. Taking advice from his solicitor wife, he had sprung into action, joining forces with other like-minded environmentalists, most prominent among them Stalin, whose NGO Vanashakti, he says, has inspired many like himself. The group had enjoyed an early victory when the high court had stepped in and saved the trees. Since then, there had been no turning back. On the urging of his tree-loving friends, he had visited Aarey, enthralled by the lush, natural beauty of the forest at the edge of the city; on learning that its pristine environment was in danger of being axed to make way for a metro shed, he had been inspired to throw in his might to protect it. One thing had led to another. “Daily, I began to notice other things,” he says, “roads that were unnecessarily being repaired, pavements that were ripped up and re-laid with the exact same tiles, trees being senselessly hacked. Getting involved in activism opened my eyes and once opened, there was no way I could close them,” he quips, “In fact, it was just like that Myntra logo — once you see it, you just can’t unsee it!” *********************************************To be sure, Zoru may have assumed the mantle of a fiery activist, but what this otherwise cheerful scion of a famous car racing clan, whose day job is manufacturing of medical supplies, is petitioning for is the simple plea of a majority of Mumbai’s citizens, who love their city and cannot comprehend why its environment appears to be desecrated with such relish by authorities. “Surely our powers-that-be have travelled abroad. Surely they can see how London, Amsterdam, Madrid, Venice have preserved their heritage. How Singapore has been forested and developed. How Dubai has been converted from a desert into a green zone. How Bali has protected its coast and yet built a coastal road,” he says, adding, “But then, some people believe Mumbai’s roads are paved in gold. The more they dig them, the more they earn. This is the unfortunate fact, which we Mumbaikars must fight to change.” Nevertheless, though assaults on the city’s green spaces and destruction of its ecosystem are legion, like his fictional namesake, Zoru and his band of fellow activists have seen some successes too. From saving trees on the WEH, to getting the Supreme Court to issue a stay order on tree-cutting at Aarey, to protecting Juhu beach from becoming a cement-casting yard, there have been triumphs, but few know the costs at which they have come. “Activism and taking on powerful state machinery is an uphill battle,” he says, “And unfortunately there are far too few of us and many get worn down pretty quickly...” *********************************************Zoru believes that Mumbai’s fragile ecosystem is at its tipping point and no amount of activism is too urgent or too much to rescue it. Every day, with characteristic impish humour, his social media posts take on the ludicrous, absurd and destructive assaults on it, regardless of politics or party. “Mumbai’s environment is at near rock bottom. Every single protective step is important. Be it saving the coast or the Aarey forest, or our mangroves, they all seem to be planned with nil focus on the destruction they cause. If only our politicians would understand that it is so simple to plan a project while preserving the environment too. The rot that has befallen the city runs deep, deep, deep…” he says.

Having won gratitude and praise for successfully dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, perhaps BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray will next be open to sitting across a table to try and understand the pleas of their citizenry.

11-06-2021||Lucknow||Shivangi Singh: Things are looking up for production designing in realistic cinema too||From being an intern in Sonali Bose’s film Margarita with a Straw to becoming an art director in Karan Johar’s next Jug Jugg Jeeyo, Lucknow-girl Shivangi Singh has carved a niche in the field of production designing. A self-confessed non-filmi person in school days, she got exposed to world of cinema during her under-grads in fine art from Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi. “Before that I was not into films or TV at all. Arts was all I was interested in and realised that visual art is what I want to do. Slowly I got interested in the world of cinema,” said Shivangi on her visit to her hometown for her mother’s vaccination. She started working at an art gallery and through Facebook got in touch with film maker Shonali Bose and who was about to was start Margarita… in Delhi. “I joined the crew as a story board artist. I made sketches for the film and learnt the international style of production designing. Then I got a period film Children of War as an assistant art designer followed by legendary Buddhadeb Dasgupta’s film Choti Moti Bateein directed by his wife. Then I shifted to Mumbai where I got Bajrangi Bhaijaan as chief assistant to production designer followed by ads films with Pradeep Sircar.” For a formal training Shivangi went to Los Angles, US. “After my master’s degree, I became a production design fellow in Hollywood Art Department Union and done did American show Making a Cut as a set designer, some films like Refuge, The Speech and a project for Universal Studio Theme Park.” With the Covid spread in the US, she came back to Mumbai. “Last year I started a project which was scheduled in Thailand, but it got shelved. Then I got this Varun Dhawan film (JJJ) as an art director. We have shot one schedule in Chandigarh with three schedules remaining to be shot. Since art department is dependent on props, rented furniture and stuff from whole-sale market so work has suffered a lot.” She feels focus in India on production departments is not as big as it is in Hollywood, but a few Indian directors focus on it too. “Makers like Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Ashutosh Gowarikar, Zoya Akhtar and Karan Johar focus a lot on spending on sets and production designing. Bhanu Athaiya got Oscars in ‘80s for costume designing (Gandhi)! Here we make more realistic films and focus on production design is less but Oye Lucky, Lucky Oye winning over Jodha Akbar was a real victory for this art. Gully Boy is another example, so a lot is happening in realistic films in terms of production designing. And things are looking up.” Few years down the line, direction is on the list for Shivangi, she shared while concluding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/shivangi-singh-things-are-looking-up-for-production-designing-in-realistic-cinema-too-101623418886292.html

Ahead of his return, Roy and his son held a meeting with Mamata and other senior TMC leaders at the party headquarters in Kolkata.Roy said, "I will not work for the Bharatiya Janata Party again. You cannot work for the BJP." TMC MLA Abhishek Banerjee welcomed both Mukul Roy and his son Subhranshu Roy by greeting them with uttariyos (shawls).Warmly welcoming the National Vice-President of @BJP4India, Shri Mukul Roy, into the Trinamool family. We understand the multiple challenges he faced in BJP.We look forward to this new journey whereby we can work in unison, prioritizing the well-being of the people of India.Banerjee after Mukul Roy's return said that the BJP scared Mukul Roy into joining the party. She said, "Mukul has returned home. He was scared into joining the BJP. I also felt that his health condition was deteriorating and now he is at peace mentally after returning to the Trinamool Congress.""The BJP is not a party for common people. He could not remain in the BJP anymore. We were always a strong party. He returned because he wished to. More people will return," she further added.Mamata highlighted that turncoats who left the TMC to join the BJP for money will not be allowed to return. Mukul Roy was among the leaders who were instrumental in the rise of the TMC. He had left the party in 2017 after he was named as an accused in the Narada sting operation case and his fallout with Mamata Banerjee. He was also suspended from the party for six years. Soon after he joined the BJP was made its national vice-president. His son also followed in his footsteps and joined the party in 2020.Roy also spearheaded the Bharatiya Janata Party's electoral campaign in West Bengal earlier this year and led the charge against his former party, even winning Krishnanagar North assembly seat in Nadia district, thus securing a victory in his first attempt as a BJP leader. Speculations were rife regarding Roy's return after TMC MLA Abhishek Banerjee met with Mukul Roy's ailing wife at a hospital in Kolkata last week.

They have now alleged that Harvinder was fatally attacked for objecting to the sale of narcotics at their village by the accused. They also claimed that the police were shielding the drug peddlers.Also read: Is Co-Win blocking users with over 1,000 vaccine slot searches a day?Senior superintendent of police (SSP) BS Virk said a three-member SIT led by SP (investigation) Balwinder Singh will probe the matter. “In his complaint, Harvinder had only cited the theft of the rooster as the reason behind the attack on him and his friends. But in view of the charges made by his family, an SIT will probe the charges that drug peddlers were behind the murder,” Virk said.The first information report (FIR) was registered at Rampura police station on May 27 on the complaint of Harvinder, who died during treatment at a private hospital in Ludhiana on June 9. In the FIR, there was no reference to any illegal sale or supply of narcotics. . Harvinder named five residents of Chauke for the attack on him and others at a farm on Pitho road on the evening of May 26. Later, the names of eight more persons were added to the complaint of others. According to the FIR, Harvinder said that Gagna Singh and his brother Babbu Singh had stolen the rooster from the house of Harvinder’s uncle Makhan Singh. “My uncle brought the matter to the notice of the accused’s family. After that Gagna and Babbu were annoyed with me for supporting my uncle over the incident. When I was at a farm with friends, Gagna and Babbu attacked me and my friends with sharp-edged weapons, baseball bats and a pistol,” Harvinder said in the FIR. The SSP said eight people have been arrested and efforts are on to catch the rest. “Our teams are talking to Harvinder’s family to ensure justice.

11-06-2021||Pune||Global Village Idiot: Why education innovation is humming the tech-know beat||Once upon a time, around the early 2010s, there used to be these professionals in India called graphic designers (GD). Then one day, they all disappeared and suddenly, overnight, appeared a new set of professionals called user interface (UI) designers, who then evolved into upgraded, improved user experience (UX) designers. Graphic designers rebranded themselves, since that was the role-set newer technology companies had started looking for. Slowly but surely, other ancillary tech-enabled sub-industries picked up the trend without understanding what UI and UX really meant and before anyone realised, many companies had hired for a completely new role (the GD role coexisted), with no relevant skills to go with it. Something similar is happening in the education ecosystem which is being changed by non-education innovators (edtech and tech companies), and I am not sure if it’s all going to work out in the end for the existing industry.Traditionally when one used to hire GDs, the educational qualifications one looked for was a visual arts background, and the typical skills’ repertoire included visualisation, illustration, layout, design, communication, and typography, among others. Proficiency with standard software was important, but not a replacement for the core skills. At this point, it is essential to acknowledge that education is a governance instrument, with a clear stated objective: to (eventually) move young ones into the global labour market at a minimum acceptable level of productivity.How does the GD quest connect to school education? Art subjects. Students who had the inclination honed their skill across school years, went to art college and later decided to go into commercial art or fine arts, and then into work. In recent decades, art and design have been added specifically to school curriculums as part of educational policy. The methods of teaching have evolved somewhat. The teaching talent base has expanded, but the big question is: does the educational approach and educator’s profile map to the evolving learning requirements and student profile?Student profiles relate to two types: generational profile and technology generation profile. So, what are the generations in school now? Generations Z and Alpha. And what is the Technology Generation that they correspond to? Digital Natives - born to deep digital reality (smartphone, always connected, social networking).Who’s teaching them? Generation Xers, early Gen Y, corresponding to the digital computer and early internet technology generations.Who’s making educational policy? Generation Baby Boomers and Gen X corresponding to analog electronic and digital computer technology generations. Why is this important? Because it is all about computational speed from policy to end result. For the first time in human history, new knowledge is being added at a daily pace which is eroding the relevance of existing knowledge bases at the practice level. Getting back to the GD, UI, and UX example. Today, erstwhile GD is a redundant skill repertoire in most of its previous primary bastions because software tools on the phone have evolved to the point where a school kid can easily make required choices on visual matters. A school teacher, meanwhile, will have to read about the tool, use it, and in a week or two understand the changes on a particular tool. Most upper primary kids would look at the one tool, and get how to use it in a day if they sit with the tool. Classic example, ICT teacher introduces Scratch as a coding platform to Grade I student. Grade I student sees your Scratch, raises the stake with Code dot org and dares you to play on with Thunkable and PictoBlox. Essentially, the challenge for generic educators is that they have invested in processes and methodologies which are now redundant because these have been automated by technology. More importantly, a child today can access most source material that teachers use and will go through 10 different levels of such material, find their favourite online YouTubers and practice while they are munching a snack and listening to music - before the next class. UX is a design field, related to structures and logic, functionality and experience, and problems and solutions. It’s not a visual design field. Typical skillsets include research, information architecture, wireframing and prototyping, analytics and reasoning, coding, among others depending on the field of application. Design is taught in some schools today, but not taught by designers.A secondary school student interested in the field, can pick up professional knowledge online quite easily, quickly.Educators are going to find it increasingly difficult because they are approaching the whole matter driven by their own convictions, based on the value-systems that they hold dear. The doctorates and degrees and studies and methodologies were meant for a human race that observed, argued, participated, thought, did, understood, mastered, implemented, et al, at the expeditious pace of centuries, decades, in extra-ordinary instances maybe years.Generation Z and Generation Alpha are. They just arrive and become. They are intuitive at a level that is incomprehensible to an intelligence that needs to observe, study, argue, make a case, understand, do, find patterns, seek consensus, explain, et al, to even produce a first draft of anything. The Alpha generation just knows and they can connect, see patterns, think, and do in hours, minutes and seconds. Intuitive. How can a generation that is prescriptive and deductive direct generations that are collaborative and intuitive? Our generations had values and we divided the world, because people have different values. The coming generations will unite the world because they connect by intuition. What exactly are we to teach them? And what role should schools and educators play?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/global-village-idiot-why-education-innovation-is-humming-the-tech-know-beat-101623408746214.html

His statement came one day after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national general secretary Arun Singh ruled out replacing Yediyurappa as the chief minister of Karnataka and asserted that the 78-year-old Lingayat strongman will continue in the top spot.There had recently been much speculation regarding a change of leadership in the Karnataka BJP, with many projecting that a section of the ruling BJP was trying to unseat Yediyurappa from the post of the chief minister. It was even said that some BJP legislators were pushing for a legislature party meeting where they intended to raise the state government's alleged mishandling of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and instances of corruption.Citing the trust that the BJP high command decided to place in him, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa said that the statement from the party's national general secretary had given him "more strength". "Arun Singh who is Karnataka in-charge has said that there is no question (of leadership change).. it doesn't arise and that Yediyurappa will remain (CM) for the next two years and complete the term-- where does that question arise," news agency PTI quoted Yediyurappa as saying in response to a question.Yediyurappa vowed to "put more effort and honestly work for the next two years", adding that his responsibility has increased now that the BJP's Karnataka in-charge has recognised the good work happening under his rule. He said he will also try to live up to the trust shown in him by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/will-remain-karnataka-cm-for-next-two-years-yediyurappa-thanks-bjp-leadership-for-reposing-faith-101623403087001.html

The officer, Shradha Pandre, said the police did not come to their rescue immediately even as the local police station is located just a km away from the attack scene.Pandre, the sub-divisional forest officer (Chambal Sanctuary), who has been attacked earlier as well, accused police officers of supporting the illegal mining mafia. She added they are not letting her curb the illegal sand mining menace.Pandre said she called the police at least twice. “I informed the police after the seizure of tractor but police inspector of Devgarh police station refused to come. We decided to seize the tractor by ourselves just 1 km away from the police station near Lohikapura village. Over 100 people attacked us and stopped our vehicle by putting stones and thorny bushes on the road. I called the police once again, but they reached after 15 minutes,” she said.Also Read | MP police put notices with skull mark around necks of unvaccinated peopleShe added special armed force guard Mukesh Sen sustained injuries in the attack. “We locked ourselves in the vehicle and rushed towards the police station.”Pandre said despite videos and clear evidence against the attackers, police registered a case under the Indian Penal Code’s Sections 147 (rioting), 336 (endangering life or personal safety of others), and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty). “They are not willing to register a case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) as they do not want to take tough action against the mafia,” she added.Pandre said the mafia has earlier eight times fired with country-made pistols, tried to mow down her, and attacked her with stones. She added the police just registered a case of assault.“The police said instead of spot action after receiving information related to illegal mining, I should have informed authorities and made plans accordingly. By doing this, I would only have given time to the mafia to get information on possible action and to run away from the spot. Villagers are sharing information with us as they have started trusting us. I do not want to do table work. I am a field officer, and it is my duty to stop illegal sand mining in the sanctuary area.”Activists supported Pandre and accused local administration and police of allegedly patronising the mafia.“Pandre is doing a good job. The mining mafia could be controlled with prompt raids not with action by making a plan. I am sure that someone from the police department would have informed the villagers of the movement of the forest team on Wednesday night,” said Satendra Singh, a local social activist.“On the roads of Chambal division, anyone can see the movement of at least 20-25 tractor trolleys laden with illegally mined sand daily but hardly any officer or police stop them to take action. The illegal sand mining business is flourishing in the region with the support of politicians, police, and other officers,” said Vinayak Tomar, an environmentalist.Divisional forest officer Amit Nikam said he has informed their head office about the attack.Morena police superintendent Lalit Shakyawar called Pandre allegations serious, and said they are inquiring about the matter.Additional police superintendent Raisingh Narwariya said it is more a case of miscommunication. “If the police station in charge did not respond to her call properly, she should have called me or the superintendent of police. But we did not receive any call.”Narwayiya said Pandre is doing a great job but should follow the system. “In a task force meeting, the divisional commissioner Ashish Saxena clearly said that forest and police officials have to inform sub-divisional magistrate before any action against mafia so that required force could be provided to them, but Pandre is conducting raids randomly and risking her life and that of other officials too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sand-mafia-attacked-my-team-police-failed-to-act-promptly-mp-forest-officer-101623403225558.html

No TMC leader commented on record, but some of them said chief minister Mamata Banerjee might consider welcoming turncoats who left before the recent assembly polls but did not take any radical stand against her. Roy kept mum on his next move, but left his Salt Lake residence at 2pm and headed for the TMC headquarters at the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, where an important meeting was scheduled to be held at 3pm. Roy was escorted by a Kolkata Police convoy. The chief minister also left her residence at Kalighat in south Kolkata at 2pm and headed for the party headquarters. Roy and his son Subhranshu Roy reached the TMC headquarters at 2.29pm in separate cars. The chief minister’s convoy reached a few minutes earlier.Banerjee is scheduled to make an announcement at a press conference around 3.30pm.The development came as an embarrassment for the BJP, although Mukul Roy’s recent actions made it clear that his relationship with the saffron camp was souring. Also Read | Contain ‘volatile situation’, Dhankar to Mamata on tension in Kolkata’s Tiljala“I cannot speculate on rumours,” Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said at a press conference in Delhi. “Those who have nothing to contribute to the growth of the BJP are free to leave,” said Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, without referring to Roy or any of the TMC turncoats. Several former TMC leaders who joined the BJP have publicly appealed to Mamata Banerjee to forgive them. They include the chief minister’s former aide Sonali Guha. Others, such as former forest minister Rajib Banerjee, have written critical posts against the BJP. On June 3, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up Mukul Roy to inquire about the latter’s wife who is being treated for Covid-19 at a private hospital in east Kolkata. Though Mukul Roy did not comment on the conversation that, according to BJP leaders, lasted around two-three minutes, the phone call made news as Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee had visited the hospital the night before. His visit triggered speculations about Mukul Roy’s next political move. Also Read | PM Modi speaks to Mukul Roy, day after Abhishek Banerjee’s 10-min courtesy callThe young Lok Sabha MP spent about 10 minutes at the hospital and met Mukul Roy’s son to enquire about his mother’s health. Around two hours after Banerjee’s visit, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh also went to the hospital to talk to Subhranshu Roy. The next day, Mukul Roy denied having any knowledge about Ghosh’s visit. “I don’t know who he came to see,” he said.On May 29, Subhranshu Roy wrote on his social media page that self-criticism was more necessary than criticising a government elected by people. Though he did not name any party or state, social media users took it as an obvious reference to the situation in Bengal. While Mukul Roy won the Krishnanagar North seat in Nadia district in the recent assembly polls, his son was defeated from the Bijpur seat that he held in North 24 Parganas district. Mukul Roy, who was the TMC’s founder member and a close aide of Mamata Banerjee, joined the BJP in 2017. His son switched sides two years later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mukul-roy-prepares-to-return-to-tmc-bengal-bjp-shows-indifference-101623402746874.html

Perarivalan is currently out on parole. Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin approved Perarivalan’s parole for a month on medical grounds after Ammal petitioned for it, citing increasing Covid-19 cases in prisons and the comorbidities that put her son at a greater risk of contracting the disease.Perarivalan was 19 when he was arrested for procuring two nine-volt batteries used in the bomb detonated in kill Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 in Tamil Nadu’s Sriperumbudur.Perarivalan’s lawyer, K Sivakumar, said they do not want his client to return to prison after his parole is over and that is why they have launched the social media campaign.In a video message, Ammal said her son was taken away saying it is a minor investigation and he will be sent back the next morning and 30 years are over. “Several of you have supported his release but it has not happened, and we cannot get back his years spend in jail. But at least I want him to be with me during this old age.”V Thiagarajan, a former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) official who was involved in the probe into the case, has claimed Perarivalan was not aware of the reason for which he was asked to get the batteries and that this was omitted from his statement.On May 20, Stalin wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking to remit the life sentence of seven convicts and to direct their immediate release.In 2018, the Tamil Nadu Cabinet passed a resolution for the release of the seven and sent it to governor Banwarilal Purohit for his assent. During a hearing in the Supreme Court on Perarivalan’s remission, an affidavit submitted noted that Purohit was awaiting a report of the CBI to make his decision. But in subsequent hearings, the CBI clarified that there is no connection between the remission of the sentence and investigation.The court also called the governor’s delay “extraordinary”. In February, Purohit refrained from taking a call on the matter and said the President was the competent authority to make a decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/social-media-campaign-for-rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case-convict-s-release-101623402745767.html

The final decision regarding Roy's joining will only be taken after his meeting today with the TMC top brass in Kolkata, the agency added. Incidentally, there had been throughout this week much speculation over Roy's potential return to Trinamool Congress, the party he had once helped form. Heavyweight BJP leaders Mukul Roy and Rajib Banerjee were not present at a recent meeting of the party's West Bengal unit, thus sparking a buzz in the state's political scene.The Bengal BJP, on the other hand, has shown indifference over Mukul Roy's possible defection to the Trinamool Congress, those familiar with the development said, adding that the BJP national vice-president left his home in Kolkata at 2pm along with his son Subhranshu and reached the TMC headquarters at 2:29pm.BJP National Vice President Mukul Roy is likely to join TMC. The decision regarding his joining will be taken after his meeting with the party's top brass in Kolkata today: Sources(file photo) pic.twitter.com/Q26UmmXX1hMukul Roy, once a veteran leader of Trinamool Congress and close aide of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, had a falling-out with the TMC supremo after being named an accused in the Narada sting operation case back in 2017. After being suspended for six years over "anti-party activities", Roy eventually left the TMC, giving up his Rajya Sabha seat in October that year, before joining the BJP in November. Subhranshu Roy, Mukul's son, also followed in his father's footsteps and joined the party in 2019. In September 2020, Mukul Roy was made the national vice-president of the BJP.Also Read: PM Modi speaks to Mukul Roy, day after Abhishek Banerjee's 10-min courtesy callHowever, Mukul Roy's position in the BJP was debated in select political circles following the recently conducted 2021 West Bengal legislative assembly elections, which saw the Trinamool Congress receiving an overwhelming public mandate to retain power in the state. Although many considered Roy a fearsome addition to the BJP's arsenal ahead of the state assembly elections -- armed with "insider" knowledge against the TMC, so to speak -- the final result was unpredictably grim for the BJP. While Mukul Roy won the Krishnanagar North seat in Nadia district, the only time he ever contested elections, his son was defeated from the Bijpur seat that he held in the North 24 Parganas district.Also Read: Bengal BJP leader Mukul Roy’s son calls for self-criticism after poll defeatMukul Roy's wife, Krishna, was admitted to a hospital in Kolkata last month for undergoing treatment for coronavirus disease (Covid-19).

He spent ten minutes, again sparking speculations that Mukul Roy might eventually return to the party he left in 2017.

Instead, by providing small loans against the application, the opposite party followed unfair trade practice.”“The employees of the opposite party, in the name of rules and regulations, debited certain amounts from the complainant’s account from time to time. The complainant who suffered from financial loss and irregularity passed through hardship. Thus, the schemes floated by the government, to help and promote entrepreneurship by providing adequate guarantee as well as support to new entrepreneurs, could fail due to non-application of the mind by the employees of the opposite party,” said the commission. The Pune-based company, run by a woman and her family, on July 15, 2015, approached the Indian Bank for a loan of ₹60 lakh under the CGTMSE scheme for funding their pharma enterprise.The complainant claimed that they came to know about the credit guarantee scheme through advertisements and after reading the advertisement about the scheme, they approached Indian Bank, one of the listed banks for implementing the scheme.The complainant stated that the company provided all the requisite documents to the bank. However, the bank refused to grant a loan of ₹60 lakhs under the CGTMSE scheme for various reasons.The bank quickly sanctioned a small loan on pledging gold ornaments that the complainant availed for preparing for the pharma business. The company claimed that the bank sanctioned a loan of ₹only ₹1 Lakh under a different heading, other than the one for which the loan was applied, as per the complainant.The whole process of establishing the new pharma business could not take off and she suffered from mental agony and harassment due to the attitude of bank officers, according to the complaint.Further, the business did not start despite all efforts, the complainant was also unable to pay back the loans availed from the bank hence the gold ornaments pledged by the company were confiscated.The complainant first filed a complaint with District Consumer Forum but the same was dismissed, terming it frivolous. The complainant then moved the state commission in appeal. The state commission issued a notice to the bank but the bank did not appear before the commission.The commission has also asked the bank to return ₹2 lakh collected by it under various heads from the company of the entrepreneur and also return with interest the amount of sale proceed of her ornaments, pledged with them by her company, Orasone Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. The bank had auctioned the gold ornament as the complainant failed to repay the loan amount.The commission has also marked a copy of the order to the Prime Minister’s Office and Governor of the Reserve Bank of India for “bringing to their notice as to how the Government scheme failed due to negligence of adamant bank officials.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/consumer-commission-fines-indian-bank-for-refusing-credit-to-woman-entrepreneur-101623395725397.html

11-06-2021||Lucknow||‘Adopt health centres but also deploy more pharmacists in UP’: Pharmacy council||Appreciating the efforts by lawmakers to adopt community health centres in Uttar Pradesh, the state Pharmacists’ Federation has demanded that the state health department should ensure the deployment of an adequate number of pharmacists, besides bolstering infrastructure at these health centres, federation officials said in a statement. “We have written a letter to the chief minister’s office, stating that even if the equipment is brought, lack of manpower at health centres will be a roadblock in providing the required quality of treatment. A pharmacist is one medical staff who can handle emergency cases and administer medicine too,” said Sunil Yadav, president of the federation, and Ashok Kumar, general secretary. Adopting health centres would certainly bring about improvement but if manpower was also increased by appointing more pharmacists, a 24x7 facility could be ensured, the officials said. “This requires creating more posts of pharmacists,” said Sunil Yadav. “A pharmacist knows how to take care of emergency cases and can also ensure right monitoring of the admitted patients. If their number is increased, it will certainly bring about a positive change in healthcare at community and primary health centres,” he added. “A virtual meeting was also held with the Union cabinet secretary wherein the representatives of the Indian Public Service (IPS) employees federation demanded speedy financial assistance of ₹50 lakh to Covid warriors along with employment to their kin,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/adopt-health-centres-but-also-deploy-more-pharmacists-in-up-pharmacy-council-101623391644795.html

11-06-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka CM, BJP high command in state 'weak', says Siddaramaiah||Amid speculations about the resignation of chief minister BS Yediyurappa, Congress leader and Leader of Opposition in Karnataka Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah on Thursday said that the BJP has taken no action against those party leaders who spoke against Yediyurappa.Siddaramaiah demanded a leadership change, terming the chief minister and the BJP high command in the state 'weak'."Both the chief minister and the BJP high command in Karnataka are weak. Arun Singh said don't talk about change then why is there no action against those who spoke against BS Yediyurappa and are demanding leadership change? Yeddyurappa is a weak chief minister. And instead of taking action, the party high command is trying to cover it. When Yediyurappa is weak, what else the high command will be?" Siddaramaiah questioned."We have not insisted to replace Yediyurappa. I was told that there is a discussion going on over CM change in Delhi. If the chief minister does not change, why the BJP High Command has not taken action against MLAs Basanagowda Patil Yatnal, Arvind Bellad, Vishwanath, Renukacharya and Minister Yogeshwar even after their statements against Yediyurappa?" he added.BJP state in-charge Arun Singh had said that there is no change in the chief minister's post. However, Siddaramaiah had said that there's no smoke without fire.Earlier, on Thursday, after some Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders speculated about the resignation of chief minister BS Yediyurappa, state revenue minster R Ashoka had said that the chair of the chief inister is "perfectly occupied."Yediyurappa had on Sunday stated that he will resign from the post the day the party high command asks him to quit.While speaking to the media persons, he had said, "I will resign the day party high command asks me to quit. I do not speak about the rumours and the speculation created by some of the ministers and legislator.""High command has given me the opportunity - I am trying to utilise it and I am trying to serve the people. I do not want to comment on the rumours of whoever speaks against me. If my high command wants me to resign, I will resign. I myself am involved in working for the development of the state," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-cm-bjp-high-command-in-state-weak-says-siddaramaiah-101623375816932.html
11-06-2021||Chandigarh||Kharge panel fine with Amarinder as captain, pushes Sidhu’s rehabilitation||The three-member Congress committee set up to resolve factionalism in Punjab Congress, which submitted its report to party president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday, is learnt to have suggested that chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh should remain in command and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu be accommodated ahead of next year’s assembly polls in the state. The panel comprising leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, AICC general in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former Delhi MP Jai Prakash Agarwal has also suggested a total revamp of the organisational set-up (read Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee) to give due representation to all social groups, particularly Dalit leaders, and take immediate steps to fill up vacancies in boards and corporations to accommodate party workers, a senior party leader familiar with the development said. The Congress president had dissolved the organisational set-up in Punjab in January 2020, but its reconstitution has been in limbo even though state chief Sunil Jakhar had sent the list of new office-bearers more than nine months ago. The committee’s report has summed up the views and grievances expressed by about 150 Punjab leaders, including present and former state presidents, ministers, MPs, MLAs and heads of frontal organisations during the interactions held in Delhi last week. The central panel was constituted by the Congress president to resolve the internecine war in the state unit. Tension had been simmering between Amarinder and Sidhu, who quit the state cabinet two years ago over differences with the former, for quite some time, but the cricketer-turned-politician and some other discontented ministers and MLAs upped the ante after a legal setback in the Kotkapura police firing case. Though several MLAs and other leaders griped before the central committee against the chief minister’s style of functioning, lack of accessibility and over dependence on bureaucracy, a few including Sidhu, Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh and Amargarh MLA Surjit Singh Dhiman demanded a change of leadership. A panel member said the committee was constituted to talk to state leaders and find a solution to the ongoing squabbling. “It (committee) did not have the mandate to look at change of guard. Unlike the time when (Rajinder Kaur) Bhattal staked her claim during Amarinder’s first term (2002-2007) or other states which have two-three strong groups, no claimant has put forth his case for the chief minister’s position here,” said the member who did not want to be identified. The detractors’ grievances have been included in the report along with the chief minister’s response. The party leadership, which has been trying to find a way to accommodate Sidhu without rocking the CM’s board, is learnt to be considering the appointment of two deputy chief ministers, including Sidhu and another from the Dalit community. Though Sidhu may also be offered the campaign committee in-charge’s position, he seems to be more interested in heading the state unit, to which the chief minister has voiced his opposition on various occasions. However, a senior state leader termed the committee’ suggestions as much ado about nothing. “Rawat was anyway trying to get Sidhu back into the state cabinet. Why did the party have to wash its dirty linen in public? In my view, (UP leader) Jitin Prasada’s sudden exit and the rumblings in Rajasthan Congress will have a bearing on the situation in Punjab and vice versa,” he said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rumblings-in-punjab-cong-kharge-panel-fine-with-amarinder-as-captain-pushes-sidhu-s-rehabilitation-101623356841275.html

It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to produce antibodies against the virus.“A study has been initiated by a team of expert doctors who aim to check the formation rate of antibodies in people after receiving the Covishield vaccine. For this, a serological test of 100 vaccinated healthcare workers will be done for a year and readings will be noted after which, we will be able to know how the antibodies will behave and how the bodies will react to the virus. The research will also guide us if there is any requirement of booster dose in future,” said Dr KD Singh, microbiologist, who is leading the team of doctors in the research.Elaborating about the research, he said, “We had checked the antibody levels of 100 healthcare workers before they received their first jab. After 14 days of receiving the first dose, we again checked their anti-body levels and then repeated the same process 14 days after the second dose.”Dr Singh, who is also the medical superintendent (MS) of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Amritsar, added, “Now, we will repeat the serological test of the healthcare workers, till March 2022. The purpose of repeated testing is to know the level of antibodies after vaccination. The initial findings revealed that in some cases, antibodies doubled after the second dose, revealing that enough antibodies were developed in the beneficiaries which will help in fighting the virus, effectively.”It was also found that antibodies had not developed in three out of the 100 vaccinated beneficiaries, which is a minimal number.“We are also probing into why antibodies did not develop in a few beneficiaries. However, in cases where antibodies level will be recorded ‘low’ in March 2022, the levels of memory cells will be tested. The human body has few special cells, called “memory cells,” that go into action quickly if the body encounters the same virus again. Hence, we will also conduct a ‘cell-mediated immune response’ research to check if the memory cells of the beneficiaries with low antibody levels will be enough to fight the virus. Booster dose will be required for people if memory cells are low,” Dr KD added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amritsar-gmc-to-study-immune-status-of-100-vaccinated-healthworkers-101623356481415.html
11-06-2021||Bangalore||In memory: Mother-son duo carry forward a legacy in acts of kindness||Bengaluru resident Mayank Agarwal was a loved son, brother and friend, who almost never thought twice when it came to helping those in need. Be it to provide monetary assistance or emotional support, he was always ready. So when he succumbed to Covid-19 in late April, at the age of 29, his family decided to pick up the mantle and take his legacy forward. “Mayank would help anyone and everyone who asked for it. He would go long distances to feed the homeless, take care of stray dogs among so many other things. When we went to immerse his ashes, the priest told us to remember him by all the things that he loved. So we started the Mayank Agarwal Memorial Fund in his memory,” says Varun Agarwal, Mayank’s elder brother, who runs the fund along with his mother Purnima. Together the two raise money to help low income families in the city, who have been affected by the pandemic. “We act as facilitators, and connect donors directly to the recipient’s bank account, so there is no delay from our end,” adds Varun.The fund raises money for three purposes and conducts a due diligence before starting a fundraiser. “Through various fundraising platforms, we aim to collect ₹2.5 lakh for each family, and have so far helped 25 families foot exorbitant hospital bills by raising ₹50 lakh. We also provide meals to the homeless around the city through Project Seva, run by Shreyas Reddy, and have served 12,000 meals till date. We promote all our campaigns on social media, and I never imagined that such a large hearted response would come our way,” says Purnima, adding, “Mayank always wanted a daughter. So in his memory we’ve partnered with an NGO Collective Consciousness to distribute sanitary pads to 1500 underprivileged girls for an entire year.” Bengaluru resident Shiva Kumar’s family is one of the 25 families that the memorial fund has helped. Kumar tested positive for Covid-19 and pneumonia. Rahul, Shiva’s son, says, “We got a test done, and initially my father turned out to be Covid negative. But soon after we learnt through a CT scan that one of his lungs was completely damaged and what we were thinking was just pneumonia was actually Covid-19. I’m an artist and musician, and the pandemic has dwindled our savings to nothing. When I took my father for his tests, I had a mere ₹3,500 in my account and had to ask friends for money to tide over the rising bills of the hospital. Then a friend put me in touch with Varun, who helped raise over ₹2 lakh for my father’s treatment. Dad is home today and doing better, and nothing I say will be enough to express my gratitude to this team of angels!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/in-memory-mother-son-duo-carry-forward-a-legacy-in-acts-of-kindness-101623356254456.html
11-06-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand orders probe against 9 testing labs||The Uttarakhand government on Thursday ordered a probe into the operations of the nine private Covid-19 testing laboratories that conducted tests of the visitors during the Haridwar Mahakumbh, after one of them was found to have allegedly issued fake test reports for least 50,000 samples, said a state minister.The claim is based on state’s chief controlling officer (CCO) of Covid-19 Dr Abhishek Tripathi’s preliminary inquiry into allegation of fake Covid-19 tests during Mahakumbh, which took place as India was entering its second wave, with many experts saying it served as a superspreader event. “We have ordered a probe on all the nine private testing laboratories with which the Mela administration had signed a contract to conduct the Covid test of those coming to attend the mega religious fair. It was ordered after the state’s Covid CCO in his report to state health secretary confirmed the irregularities in about one lakh Covid-19 tests conducted by the laboratory in question,” said state government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal, adding that the laboratory in question has been “blacklisted.”“State director general of health has issued a general order from the health department to initiate probe on the remaining eight other private testing laboratories involved in the Mahakumbh. The government won’t spare anyone found involved in the irregularities,” he added.A senior health department official said the irregularities came up after Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) asked the state health department to conduct a probe. “The complainant had claimed before the ICMR that when he went to attend the Mahakumbh, he had received an SMS that his samples have been collected for the test along with a proper valid id number. However, he gave no samples. The ICMR, citing the complaint, asked the health department to verify it after which Covid-19 CCO conducted the inquiry.”The official said the CCO said a private laboratory informed the health department that it conducted about one lakh rapid antigen tests. “Of that one lakh tests, at least 50,000 are fake. It collected the samples in the above-mentioned fraudulent way and issued fake test reports of which most were negative... It most likely did this to siphon off money from the government because for a single rapid antigen test, it was to receive ₹354 from the state government in Mahakumbh,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-orders-probe-against-9-testing-labs-101623355705281.html

The School of Climate Change and Agricultural Meteorology of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in its recently conducted study found that in the last 21 years, monsoon in Punjab remained mostly below normal. The average rainfall remained 19 to 59 % lower than normal in at least 10 of the total 21 year, while nine of these years saw the average rainfall remained 19% below normal. The state recorded normal or above normal rainfall for just two years in this period. Dr Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, head of the department of Climate Change and Agricultural Meteorology, said during the study, it was found that the dip in rainfall was due to cloud formation over the region. Cloud formation is usually witnessed during the kharif season (paddy season) when a huge amount of underground water is used for irrigation.” “The formation of cloud cover for an extended period has an adverse effect on the growth and photosynthesis process of the crop,” said Dr Sidhu. The study further stated that for the past four decades, the region had been receiving eight and a half hours of sun energy but now it has reduced to seven and a half hours. However, heat and humidity has increased. Variability in monsoon showers is one of the major concerns for the agriculture sector in particular and other sectors in general, said Dr Sidhu. The data shows that in Punjab, rainfall received during four months from June to September in northeastern parts such as Nawanshahr, central parts such as Ludhiana and southwestern parts such as Bathinda were highly erratic and variable. Over the past two decades (2000-2020), Ballowal Saunkhri centre of PAU in Nawanshahr which falls under sub mountain undulating zone, received a higher amount of rainfall for most of the years during the monsoon season as compared to Ludhiana and Bathinda. The normal duration of monsoon in Punjab is 77 days-- from June 1 to September 15. From 2002 to 2019, the duration was reduced only for three years, i.e., 2002 (13 days), 2017 (03 days) and 2018 (11 days). But the monsoon rainfall was reduced up to 19% during nine years (2000, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2019 and 2020) and 20% during nine years (2002, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2014 to 2017). While in 2004, 2012 and 2014, the state received 42, 46 and 50 % less rainfall respectively. “The monsoon rain plays important role in agriculture and this variability in rainfall can cause crop losses in some regions. Though the duration of monsoon winds in Punjab is invariably extended by seven or more days, rainfall is not well distributed. Also, a sudden heavy shower of rainfall received in a short span of time does not help the crops,” said Dr Sidhu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pau-study-shows-dip-in-rain-volume-during-kharif-season-101623355701192.html

11-06-2021||Delhi||A shot of hope: Aiding differently abled get vaccinated, battle Covid woes||The second wave of Covid-19 pandemic has only deepened the wounds of the differently abled; many of whom have lost their source of livelihood and have now become dependent on others for survival. And then there’s the larger challenge of getting access to Covid-19 vaccine since it isn’t an easy task for a differently abled person to reach the vaccination centre, due to factors including absence of convenient transport and accessibility inside the premises. Recently, the Delhi government ordered for dedicated vaccination centres for persons with disabilities — one in every zone — but not everyone feels that this is enough. Deepak, a resident of Delhi’s Paschim Vihar, who has a limbic disorder shares that going to such vaccination facilities is a challenge in itself. “When I reached the centre, I had to get a wheelchair arranged, and some volunteers helped us get our registration, and finally then could I get vaccinated. But it’s a larger concern with many, who are unable to leave their house or are confined to their bed,” he says opining that “Door to door vaccination could be the ideal solution” for the woes of the differently abled struggling to get vaccinated. To ease the hardships of the differently abled, in such times, some NGOs in Delhi-NCR have been working round the clock. For instance, to get a shot, a visitor at these centres need to present the necessary PwD document as a proof of disability. “We are working to help them get vaccinated at the earliest. Some people don’t have ration or PwD cards and we are trying to help them get these made in order to be eligible for vaccination,” says Pradeep Kumar, founding secretary of Nipun, an NGO that has identified dozens of differently abled individuals in Paschim Vihar’s JJ cluster, which is home to almost 12,000 people. Kumar adds: “There are people who are mentally challenged, hearing and speech impaired, and some are even bedridden with no caretakers at all! Through a door to door survey, we collect their details and provide them daily requirements such as dry ration, masks and sanitisers... We are hoping to also find some skill based employment for those who have lost their jobs because of the pandemic, in order to rehabilitate them.”Loss of a source of earning seems to be a bigger challenge to overcome for many differently abled at present. “Many of those who are differently abled have lost their sources of livelihood. Because of the pandemic, many SOS calls from the differently abled persons have been about funds for rent and utility,” informs George Abraham, from Score Foundation, which works for the visually impaired. The non-profit trust has been running a national helpline, and partnering with other organisations on ground as well. “We’ve been raising funds for those in need. Under our Eyeway Network initiative, we operate a national toll free number (1800 53 20469), where people call with questions and requests. Not just physical well being, but mental health of people also needs to be addressed. Being indoors for an extended period of time can have a negative impact, and our counsellors are also reaching out to the visually impaired to ensure that they are doing okay amid the pandemic,” adds Abraham. “Maximum requests are from people who do not have the funds to procure ration,” says Kapil Aggarwal from Viklang Sahara Samiti Delhi, an NGO that’s aiding the differently abled procure ration and other essentials. “We facilitate online payment at various shops where they can simply go and collect their essentials, by providing payment details. We’re also offering the option of home delivery of ration to those in need,” informs Aggarwal, adding, “People have been reaching out to us via word of mouth, and we have also circulated Google forms to collect information on the needs and requirement of the differently abled.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/a-shot-of-hope-aiding-differently-abled-get-vaccinated-battle-covid-woes-101623355591995.html

11-06-2021||Chandigarh||2015 Fazilka drug smuggling case: HC breather to Khaira on ED raids||Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) on Thursday asked the adjudicating authority of Enforcement Directorate (ED) not to pass a final order in a case pertaining to raids on Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira’s properties on March 9.The HC bench of justice Ritu Bhari and justice Vivek Puri allowed the adjudicating authority to continue with the proceedings before it but restrained it from passing the final order, senior advocate Vikram Chaudhri said. A detailed order in this regard is awaited. On June 4, Khaira had approached the HC against the show-cause notice from the adjudicating authority in which it had asked him on April 12 as to why the agency should not be allowed to examine his electronic devices. Show-cause notice was issued after ED approached the authority for permission to open his electronic devices such as phones.In HC, Khaira said electronic devices can’t be allowed to be opened as it would amount to breach of privacy. The agency has initiated these proceedings even as entire probe is under the scrutiny before the high court, he argued in the HC. The matter had reached the court on March 19 when Khaira had sought quashing of ED’s raids, carried out on March 9, 2021, on his properties as well as of persons associated with him, in connection with a 2015 Fazilka drug smuggling case. Following the raids, ED had claimed that in 12 odd years, ₹4.86 crore were deposited in his bank accounts but his declared income to the income tax department stood at ₹99 lakh.ED initiated a probe against Khaira, who joined Congress last week, in a 2015 drug seizure case in which nine persons were convicted in October 2017. In the same order, the trial court had summoned him as “additional accused”, a decision subsequently stayed by the Supreme Court. Khaira claims ED’s action was a case of “witch hunt” as he has been vocal against three farm laws enacted by the Centre last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-fazilka-drug-smuggling-case-hc-breather-to-khaira-on-ed-raids-101623355461141.html
11-06-2021||Chandigarh||Deepender Hooda demands white paper on health institutions||Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda on Thursday said a report by the public policy think tank, NITI Aayog, on the performance of states had exposed Haryana’s BJP-JJP government as the state had ranked among the top three in the country in terms of unemployment and crime. The think tank had tracked states’ performance on 17 parameters. “Haryana is also lagging behind in education, industrial and economic growth,” Hooda said.Quoting the NITI Aayog data, he said, “Till 2014, Haryana was at the top in development parameters such as per capita income, investment, agricultural productivity and sports. But the state has now slipped to the 14th position. Haryana now ranks 12th in poverty, and 23rd in water sanitation,” the Congress MP said.The report shows unemployment has increased in Haryana and states like Orissa have overtaken Haryana in health indicators, he said. Alleging that the BJP-led government had not paid attention to the health infrastructure in Haryana during the last seven years, the Congress leader asked the state government to put up the number of hospitals set up by them. “During Congress’ rule, 136 sub-health centres, 53 primary health centres, 37 community health centres, 25 general hospitals and at least 20 other hospitals were built or upgraded in Haryana,” he said. He demanded a white paper on why 10 of the 11 approved institutes had not been built on All India Institute of Medical Sciences-2 campuses. “As a Rohtak MP, I had got these institutions of national importance approved by the Union Cabinet. The institutions include a 710-bedded National Cancer Institute, 600-bedded national cardiovascular centre, 500-bedded General Purpose Hospital, 500-bedded national transplantation centre, 500-bedded national centre for child health, 500-bedded digestive disease centre, 200-bedded national institute for geriatrics, 120-bedded centre for blood disorders, a comprehensive rehabilitation centre, centre for laboratory medicine, and national centre for nursing education and research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/deepender-hooda-demands-white-paper-on-health-institutions-101623355401321.html
11-06-2021||Chandigarh||India bets on Haryana girl Aruna for a medal in Paralympics 2021||Last month, India’s taekwondo para athlete Aruna Tanwar, had anxious moments for some days. She was not sure whether she and other para taekwondo athletes from India would be able to take part in the world and Asian qualifiers in Jordon or not in order to qualify for the Paralympics 2021 to be held in Tokyo. She was disappointed when the Indian athletes missed the qualifiers in Jordan due to a travel ban. With that her dream of representing India at Paralympics 2021 crashed. And when on June 9, Aruna came to know that she was among the many eight athletes from eight nations, who have been provided the bipartite quotas for Tokyo by IOC and World Taekwondo, the 21-year-old was thrilled.“I was so upsetting to lose out on a chance in Jordan. It is like a dream come true now with Taekwondo World giving a go ahead to me for Paralympics 2021,” said Aruna, 21, the 2019 World Para Taekwondo Championship bronze medal winner. The Tokyo Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5.Aruna, a scholar of BPEd at Chandigarh University, Mohali, is the current World No. 4 in the women’s U-49 category. A five time national champion, she has finished on the podium in the last four years at both Asian Para Taekwondo Championships and World Para Taekwondo Championships.Aruna grew up in Dinod village near Bhiwani in Haryana, taking keen interest in athletics and martial arts despite deformity in both hands. Daughter of a factory driver and part-time farmer Naresh Kumar, Tanwar, was awestruck when boxer Paramjeet Samota from her village received a rousing welcome after winning a gold in 2010 Commonwealth Games 11 years ago.“He has been an inspiration. The way he was welcomed that day made me work on turning into an athlete. We were not well-placed financially but my parents made sure I chased my dreams and made them proud. My father has slogged hard to give me this life,” said Tanwar, who will be the first paralympic participant from India to compete in Tokyo. She just has three fingers each in both her hands and the size of her arms is small. “It was heart-breaking to see such athletes’ dreams getting shattered due to the pandemic. So, we requested World Taekwondo body and were elated to see Aruna getting a wild card entry,” said Sukhdev Raj, coach and general secretary Para Taekwondo Association of India. In total, eight athletes from eight countries were offered bipartite invitations for the Tokyo event. WorldOverall 72 athletes from 37 nations will compete as Para Taekwondo makes its Paralympic debut this summer in Tokyo and India will have Aruna fighting hard for a medal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/india-bets-on-aruna-for-a-medal-in-paralympics-2021-101623355223772.html
11-06-2021||Chandigarh||Amid farmers’ boycott call, Khattar goes for virtual inaugurations||Unable to hold public functions in person due to boycott threats of restive farmers, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had to inaugurate and lay foundation stones of developmental projects through a video conference on Thursday for the second time in three months.Projects focussing on health, ayurveda, education, road connectivity, water, power and sports were inaugurated across 16 districts. While projects cumulatively worth ₹200 crore were inaugurated, foundation stones of projects worth ₹900 crore were laid from Chandigarh. Also present during the video conference were cabinet ministers, members parliament, members of legislative assembly, public representatives and officials. In March, Khattar had launched developmental projects worth ₹1,400 crore through a video conference. Ever since farmers protesting the Centre’s three farm laws have given the call to boycott BJP-JJP leaders, Khattar has been forced to cancel his scheduled visits. Whenever he has attempted to inaugurate projects in person, protesters have resorted to physical violence. The latest face off was seen in Hisar last month when the farmers clashed with the police as they attempted to disrupt the inauguration of a Covid hospital by the CM.Speaking on the occasion, Khattar thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for increasing the MSP of Kharif crops, which he said will increase farmers’ profit margin.Karnal allotted projects worth ₹500 crore While Karnal was allotted projects worth ₹500 crore, Panchkula received ₹160 crore projects. Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said the CM had given the go ahead to renovation of the Avardhan Canal, which will cost ₹489 crore. The project, which will bring relief to villages along the canal, will take two years to complete.Khattar approved a 33 kilovolt sub-station at Jatton Gate in Karnal city and two mini-sewer cleaning machines for maintaining the sewerage system, he said.The CM inaugurated developmental projects worth ₹50 crore for Kurukshetra. The projects include reconstruction of the old Saraswati arch-type bridge, the new administrative block of the mini secretariat, and two new 33KV sub-stations at Pehowa-II and Malikpur. Khattar laid the foundation stone of a project for four-lanning and strengthening the Karnal- Ramba-Indri-Ladwa road.He allotted projects worth ₹15 crore for Kaithal, including a 33 KV sub-station each in Titran and Padla and a 50-bedded hospital in Kalayat. The CM also dedicated a 33KV power sub-station and a media centre in Panipat worth ₹5 crore each.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-farmers-boycott-call-khattar-goes-for-virtual-inaugurations-101623355222250.html
11-06-2021||Chandigarh||Interview with Panjab University V-C: ‘Vice-chancellor should be given free hand’||Panjab University vice-chancellor (V-C) Raj Kumar, who has been at the helm of varsity leadership since July 23, 2018, was given a tenure extension for a period of three years from July 23 by the vice-president of India and chancellor, M Venkaiah Naidu. The move comes at a time when the varsity is functioning without its governing bodies. HT reporter Dar Ovais talks to Kumar about the challenges and priorities for his next term as V-C.What is your assessment of your tenure as V-C?I am satisfied with the work initiated during my first term, and I will take it all to completion in the next three years.Anything you feel could have been done better? Do you have any regrets?I do not have any regrets with my first term, but the loss we have faced due to the pandemic since last year is a concern. This period has not been fruitful or to our expectations. On the other hand, our research became more pandemic-oriented.Do you feel you could have done better for the university if the senate and syndicate had better coordination with you?We know the governing structure of PU is entirely different and things are achieved with a joint effort. The members of the governing body should coordinate with the V-C to work for the betterment of the varsity. They should give a free hand to the V-C, there should be academic and innovative autonomy.What will be your priorities in the second term as V-C?Student welfare will be at the centre of our focus. I want to contribute by providing better facilities to them. We will promote research by renovating labs and bringing high-end equipment. We will fast-track the startup activities and our effort will be to increase industry-academia linkage.PU has been functioning without a governing body for more than seven months now. How do you plan to put the governing body in place?The matter is currently in the high court, but we are ready to conduct the polls when the situation allows. Both the bodies will be constituted.The varsity has been performing low in various rankings including NIRF and THE for some years now. What plans do you have to regain its glory?Being a premiere university, we can be ranked well if the data is collected properly and we are focusing on this. We have done well on various parameters, but our student-teacher ratio has not improved over the years because we have not been able to recruit faculty.PU could not implement NAAC recommendations of 2015. Why has the varsity failed to take corrective steps?We have already started working on the recommendations of NAAC and soon you will find a very tangible outcome. We are concerned about the next visit by NAAC.The varsity continues to reel under faculty crunch, and was not able to recruit teachers during your first term. What is your plan on this?I cannot do it on my own and I need the approval of the governing body for faculty recruitment. We also need a green signal from the government. I will put this thing before the governing body and hopefully they will take steps for the development and growth of the varsity.What in your view should be the governance structure of PU?I don’t want to comment on this at this juncture because the high-level committee is working on it. Let’s see what comes out of that.What are the major challenges for you in the next three years?According to me, the appointment of faculty will be a challenge, and the governing body needs to take serious note of it. I can work on improving rankings and other things, but I cannot do faculty recruitment on my own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/interview-with-panjab-university-v-c-vice-chancellor-should-be-given-free-hand-101623354861649.html
11-06-2021||Chandigarh||Sustainable development goals index: Chandigarh’s 100% score not in line with ground reality||The high score of nearly 100%, given to Chandigarh for its solid waste management by the recently announced Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) index 2021, has come under the scanner.The SDG index has called the city a “front runner” on the parameter, though, ground realities indicate otherwise. Chandigarh was accorded the “top performer” in the solid waste management parameter, covered under Goal 11—“inclusive and sustainable urbanisation”. Overall, the city has topped the index among union territories with 79% score on 16 goals.The SDG-2021 conclusions, prepared by the Niti Ayog, were based on data sourced from the Swachh Bharat Mission Urban November 2020.Door-to-door garbage collectionThe index states that there is 100% door-to-door garbage collection in all of city’s wards. This in spite of the MC officials themselves conceding that even now most of the rehabilitation colonies had not been covered.“It is yet another farce by the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled MC. What to talk about last November even now when the MC vehicles have been put into service, the collection remains totally erratic. They can give any marks they want to give to themselves but reality is far from it,” said Devinder Singh Babla, Congress councilor and leader of opposition in the MC.Source segregationFor the period of November 2020, the index states that in 96.15% wards, there was 100% source segregation between dry and wet solid waste.Questioning the claim, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) chairperson Hitesh Puri said, “There was no source segregation of waste at the time. In fact, after the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic in March last year, there was no effort by the MC at source segregation. It was only after January this year that MC started making some effort.”Solid waste processingThe index further states that in Chandigarh nearly 92% of the municipal solid waste generated is processed.Vinod Vashisht, convener of CFORWO (City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations) said, “We have gone through the Niti Aayog SDG report. The indicated scores provided for Chandigarh relating to solid waste management indicators, particularly processing of city’s municipal solid waste, is far from reality. It shows that in November 2020, the city was processing 91.91% of solid waste, when city’s sole waste processing plant has not been functioning to capacity for the last one year.”The waste processing plant was taken over by the MC last year, and since then has been working at around 30% of its capacity. Around 250 metric tonnes (MT) dry solid waste has to be processed in the plant, but, as of today, it is only processing around 70-80MT.MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “There is door-to-door garbage collection in all the wards of the city. Similarly, we are getting segregated garbage. Earlier, it was being done by cart-driven garbage collectors, but now it is being done by the MC vehicles.”On the processing of the waste, Yadav said, “All the wet waste is being processed. Even the dry waste is being processed as per the stipulated guidelines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sustainable-development-goals-index-chandigarh-s-100-score-not-in-line-with-ground-reality-101623354801153.html

Available for around ₹20 per kg since the start of April, onions were selling for ₹30 per kg at the weekly apni mandis in Sector 56 and Ram Darbar on Thursday. “Normally during summer, the prices remain low till the advent of monsoon. However, this year due to the hike in fuel prices, the prices rose earlier than expected. Due to further spike in fuel prices and pre-monsoon showers in Maharashtra, onions may get costlier in the coming days,” said mandi supervisor Satbir Singh.Vegetables brought in from Himachal Pradesh, including peas and cucumber, have also become more expensive, while those grown locally, including bottle gourd, bitter gourd and pumpkin, are available at the same price.Mandis seeing more footfall With Covid-19 cases declining considerably in the past month, the apni mandis have started witnessing more footfall. “Mandis are usually operating at full swing in the evening hours once people are free from work,” said Singh. With the recent lockdown relaxations by the UT administration, apni mandis at Sectors 40, 43 and 49 will also resume on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vegetables-prices-climb-in-chandigarh-as-fuel-gets-costlier-101623354741773.html

The chief minister, in his address to teachers after the state topped the national performance grading index for school education, asked the department to work out modalities to enable the students to learn foreign languages such as Chinese, Arabic and French as these could be instrumental in improving their chances of employability across the globe. “Though Punjabi is our mother tongue and English is already being taught in schools, the additional knowledge of foreign languages will help our students to excel in their career,” he said. Congratulating teachers and entire staff of the school education department for making Punjab number one state across the country in performance grading index for 2019-20, the CM urged the department, especially its secretary, to maintain this position for times to come. He also lauded initiatives like online teacher transfer policy, smart schools policy, pre-primary education, digital education and special cadre of teachers working in border areas. School education minister Vijay Inder Singla said the department would closely work with the digital platforms offering the facility of online courses in foreign languages to enable students to learn foreign languages of their choice.

11-06-2021||Chandigarh||Covid patients with black fungus refused surgery at PGIMS||Coronavirus patients who have contracted the deadly black fungus infection are being refused surgery until they test negative for the virus at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, family members of the said patients have alleged. Many patients have had to shift out of the hospital to seek surgical intervention to stop the spread of the fungal infection, which experts say is “deadlier” than the virus. One such patient, a 62-year-old retired government teacher, a resident of Bhiwani, was shifted to PGIMS from a private hospital in Hisar after he developed mucormycosis. However, after doctors refused to operate on him, he had to be moved to a private hospital in Rohtak on June 9, his wife said. The ear, nose, throat (ENT) specialist, who finally operated on the teacher, on condition of anonymity said, “The patient will be put on Amphotericin B for 10 days. If the infection spreads further, he will need another surgery. It is risky to operate on Covid positive patients.” The family of another patient, who is in his 40s and had contracted the dual infections, had to run from piller to post for his surgery. “Doctors of both private and government hospitals refused to operate on him. The doctors told us that they cannot put their lives at risk while treating a black fungus patient who has Covid. An ENT specialist has performed his surgery but his health remains poor,” a family members said. PGIMS medical superintendent Dr Pushpa Dahiya, said surgery of black fungus patients, who have Covid complications is not being conducted as they are not fit to be administered anesthesia.“Operating on such patients is risky. In most cases the fungal infection spreads at a slow rate and we conduct the surgery, once the patient has recovered. We have conducted 133 surgeries till June 9, of which six deaths were reported due to mucormycosis and 20 deaths due to Covid complications in patients who were also suffering from black fungus. There is also shortage of Amphotericin B drug,” she added.Dr Aditya Bhargava, head of ENT department at PGIMS refused to comment saying that he was not authorised to speak on the matter.A senior doctor at PGIMS, requesting anonymity, said there is no rule that black fungus patients with covid complications will not be operated on. “If the infection spreads and the patient loses his vision or develops other problems, who will be responsible. The surgery cannot be delayed on the pretext of it being risky or chances of doctors contracting the infection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-patients-with-black-fungus-refused-surgery-at-pgims-101623353840762.html

Moreover, members of the Lok Insaaf Party, including Ranjit Singh Sibia, also joined the protestors.The protestors blamed the contractor and his workers for issuing parking slips every time they entered the mandi gate during the day. “Earlier, we were allowed to enter the gate multiple times using a slip for 12 hours but now, the workers charge us for every single entry and if people refuse to pay, they beat them,” alleged the protestors.Sibia alleged that the Mandi Board and the contractor were harassing the poor vendors by charging them every time they enter the market during a day. “What will these vendors earn and how will their families make ends meet if they pay a fee every time they enter the market,” he said, adding that the board should permit multiple entries on a slip like it is being done in other mandis of the state.Later, the protestors met Baweja and demanded that they should be allowed multiple entries on a slip for a day. Baweja called up the contractor and asked him to come up with the solution for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cart-auto-rickshaw-drivers-stage-protest-at-new-sabzi-mandi-in-ludhiana-101623353722207.html

The then tehsildar had kept the case file pending awaiting legal opinion. The tehsildar had also raised objections over the non-payment of stamp duty by MGF Developers.During the pendency of the case, the then tehsildar was transferred and the land was transferred to MGF Developers by creating a new case file.Even former deputy speaker, Bir Devinder Singh, urged the chief minister to probe into the stamp duty evasion.

Punjab is yet to frame such rules.DC Dayalan said, “We have cancelled the mutation as it has resulted in loss to exchequer.

If my name is included, then make it public,” he said at a press conference. The Jalandhar Cantonment MLA said if the CM gave such a thing in writing, it was a confessional statement that he was running a corrupt government.However, Amarinder rubbished the allegations of keeping dossiers on party colleagues. “I have never done such things in my political career. My mantra is trust and transparency,” he said. Amarinder, who has been under fire from some of his ministers and MLAs, had met the committee constituted by Congress president Sonia Gandhi under leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge in Delhi on Friday after it had one-on-one discussions with about 150 party leaders from the state. Asked about reports that some MLAs had told the committee that they did not want Amarinder to be the CM face for next year’s assembly elections, Pargat said he had also conveyed the same. “I said that if he is there (as CM face), things will be difficult,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pargat-asks-capt-to-come-clean-on-dossiers-on-mlas-101623353602157.html

Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (Gadvasu) will also be developing a vaccine for tumour among dogs and an indigenous vaccine to protect pets from pests. V-C Dr Inderjeet Singh said focus will be on developing ‘smell activity’ among pets for training purposes. For this, he said, three different breeds of dogs (16 dogs in each batch) will be trained. “Specially trained sniffer dogs are currently being used to detect Covid among soldiers being sent to Ladakh. Foreign students are also showing keen interest in the studies of population control measures like dog sterilisation. Gadvasu has been selected as the only centre for such research project in the country,” the V-C said. He said grooming facility will also be provided at the university hospital as many residents are expressing interests on pets’ personal care and haircuts. He said that besides conducting research, GADVASU is also carrying out collaborative projects with many other educational institutes.

In a statement, Rajya Sabha member Balwinder Singh Bhunder said: “Disclosures about Grandway Incorporation, which supplied kits worth ₹26 crore to the Punjab government, indicate that the entire operation was fraudulent. This is the reason why the original tender, which had been awarded to a company with six-month validity at ₹837 per kit, was re-tendered twice and awarded to Grandway at inflated prices of ₹1,226 and ₹1,338 per kit.” “Only a free and fair inquiry can nail those responsible for this scam as it is apparent that Grandway is a proxy, which has been used to earn ill-gotten wealth at the cost of the exchequer,” added Bhunder, saying that the company does not have a valid licence to supply medical kits. He demanded dismissal of health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu and action against all officials and staff who were responsible for the award of the contract to the company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/why-has-capt-not-ordered-cbi-probe-into-fateh-kit-scam-sad-101623353181852.html
11-06-2021||Other||After CM-PM meet, Shiv Sena softens stance, calls Modi India’s top leader||Two days after the one-on-one meeting between chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, Shiv Sena – known for its acerbic tone against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and PM Modi – has softened its stance. Sena parliamentarian Sanjay Raut refused to comment when questioned on media reports suggesting that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) may not use Modi as a face in the upcoming Assembly polls as his popularity may be on a decline. He, however, said that Modi is still the top leader in BJP and in the country, and the party’s success in the past seven years, is due to the PM. “I will not comment on it. There is no official statement on it. BJP owes its success in the past seven years to Modi. At present, Modi is still the tallest leader of the country and BJP,” Raut, who is on a tour of north Maharashtra, said at Nashik. The comments reflect a change in the Sena leader’s tone. Last month, Raut had blamed Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah for BJP’s defeat in West Bengal elections. However, the Sena leader also said that PM must not campaign for elections. He said that it puts additional pressure on the machinery. “The Shiv Sena’s stand has always been that the PM belongs to the country and not one party... Hence, PM shouldn’t get involved in campaigning,” he said.Meanwhile, Raut’s north Maharashtra tour is aimed at strengthening the organisation in the region. He said that though Sena is a part of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance with NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) and the Congress, all parties have the right to grow their outfits. “The alliance partners of MVA have a right to expand their base and strengthen the parties. We [MVA allies] are also holding meetings to strengthen our coordination with each other,” the Sena leader added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-cm-pm-meet-shiv-sena-softens-stance-calls-modi-india-s-top-leader-101623353180255.html

11-06-2021||Mumbai||Sena trustworthy ally: NCP chief dismisses doubts||Days after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a one-on-one meeting with Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said he does not doubt that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will complete its five-year term. Not only this, but the three-party coalition will also perform well in the upcoming Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. He also said that Shiv Sena is a trustworthy party and it has, in the past, kept its promise to former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by helping Congress.The NCP supremo was addressing party workers and leaders on the eve of the 22nd foundation day of the party, at NCP headquarters, on Thursday. This was his first appearance at a public function after he was hospitalised in April for gall bladder surgery and treatment for a mouth ulcer.NCP was launched on June 10, 1999, after a fallout with the then Congress president Sonia Gandhi.“There was a lot of buzz soon after the chief minister’s one-on-one meeting with the Prime Minister in Delhi. As I said we have never worked with Shiv Sena in the past but Maharashtra has been watching the party for the past many years… Shiv Sena is a party that can be trusted even if people are raising doubts following the (PM-CM) meeting, I have no doubt that the MVA government will not only complete its tenure of five years but will also perform well in the Lok Sabha and state assembly elections and represent the state and the country,” Pawar said in his 20 minutes speech.To prove his point, the veteran leader shared an incident when late Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray decided to support Congress and did not contest a single seat in the state Assembly elections.“After Morarji Desai led Janata Party came to power at Centre, Congress was facing defeat in all the states. At that time, only one party came ahead in support and that was Shiv Sena. Balasaheb Thackeray promised not to field a single candidate in the state Assembly elections in Maharashtra then and also fulfilled his promise. He didn’t even care about the impact of his decision on the organisation and kept his word (given to Indira Gandhi),” Pawar pointed out.Before that, he said that the people of Maharashtra had accepted the unusual coalition as no one would have thought about NCP joining hands with Shiv Sena. “We did that and fortunately people accepted the alternative. I remember senior journalists associated with newspapers and news channels guessing the number of days the MVA government was going to last since day one but all this has stopped now,” Pawar said indicating that the party leadership took the right decision of forming the MVA government along with Shiv Sena and Congress in 2019.The NCP chief said the MVA government will have to resolve the issue of reservations for the Maratha community as well as for the OBC community. He said that the NCP will have to ensure that the power will be shared with more people to prevent it from getting corrupted. “Power gets corrupted if it is concentrated and thus should be shared with more people. We will have to ensure that Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Other Backward Classes and all the other communities are getting their share of power,” he said.This was the second consecutive year when the party decided not to celebrate the foundation day considering the Covid-19 pandemic. Selected leaders and workers were invited to attend a small gathering organized at NCP headquarters at Ballard Pier in south Mumbai. Pawar’s address was made live on social media platforms for the party workers and leaders across the state. State president Jayant Patil, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, senior leader Praful Patel and health minister Rajesh Tope too addressed the gathering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sena-trustworthy-ally-ncp-chief-dismisses-doubts-101623353060253.html
11-06-2021||Other||Developer accuses ex-Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh of extortion||Khar-based developer Kartik Bhatt has moved an intervention application before the Bombay high court (HC), accusing former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh of extortion.Bhatt has sought the rejection of Singh’s petition, seeking quashing of the FIR against him under SC, ST Act filed on the basis of police officer BR Ghadge’s complaints. He alleged that the senior IPS (Indian Police Service) officer was running an extortion racket through his junior officers.The developer has alleged that last December, Singh through an officer, had tried to extort ₹200 crore from him for a slum rehabilitation authority (SRA) project, which he had undertaken in Chembur. Bhatt has also alleged that he had already paid an “extortion amount” to Singh in 2018 for the same project. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NJ Jamadar was hearing the petitions filed by the state of Maharashtra, seeking directions to set aside two ‘unnumbered paragraphs’ from the FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on April 21 after completing the HC-ordered preliminary probe into the corruption allegations against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh and Singh’s petition. It was informed that there were two intervention applications against Singh’s petition. While making submissions to the state petition, solicitor general of India Tushar Mehta, representing CBI, said that Maharashtra government had no locus standi to file the plea and only the persons aggrieved by the FIR can file it. He stated that CBI had serious objections to the petition as it was filed only to pre-empt the investigation. Advocate Jaishri Patil, who had filed a complaint based on Singh’s March 20 letter to the chief minister alleging corruption charges against then home minister Anil Deshmukh, sought to intervene in the petition and said that the state’s petition was not maintainable. Senior counsels Rafique Dada and Darius Khambatta for the government maintained that the state did not intend to interfere in the CBI probe against Deshmukh and others but only sought removal of the two unnumbered paragraphs from the FIR as they were not mandated to be investigated by the April 5 order of HC.When Singh’s petition came up for hearing, advocate Ashok Dhanuka informed the bench that he wanted to intervene in the petition on behalf of Bhatt, his client. Dhanuka informed the court that Bhatt was a victim of extortion which was orchestrated by Singh through Mumbai Police officers. In light of this, the intervention application was filed to oppose the reliefs sought by Singh. Due to the multitude of the intervention applications, the bench stated that it would hear the petition along with Singh’s petition and other intervention applications on June 14. CBI continued its earlier statement that it would not press the state government for certain documents related to offences mentioned in the FIR till the next hearing, after which the state also assured the bench that it will not take coercive steps, including arresting Singh till June 15, in Ghadge’s case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/developer-accuses-ex-mumbai-top-cop-param-bir-singh-of-extortion-101623353000255.html
11-06-2021||Mumbai||Malad building collapse: Blame game begins||As 12 people, including eight children, died after a ground-plus-three structure collapsed on an adjoining building in Malwani area of Malad on Wednesday night, the blame game and tussle over jurisdiction began. The illegal structure that collapsed was built on the district collector’s land. The Bharatiya Janata Party, however, said the Shiv Sena-controlled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) cannot escape the blame. The search and rescue operations that began around midnight on Wednesday ended on Thursday, amid a steady trickle of political leaders and minister. Malwani, one of the city’s most densely populated localities, falls in the Assembly constituency of Congress minister Aslam Shaikh, who is also Mumbai city’s guardian minister. While Shaikh was the first to visit the spot in the night, BJP’s Pravin Darekar, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and minister Nawab Malik, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar and others reached in the morning. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray did not visit the spot, but they went to Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivali East to meet the injured. “The place where the incident has happened is the collector’s land. There was permission to construct up to ground floor, but three floors were built,” Pednekar said. Malik said, “These buildings did not have any structural design.” “North Mumbai Lok Sabha MP Gopal Shetty had written to the administration that such three-four floor structures have come up and warned they could collapse. The government and its administration did not take it seriously,” said Darekar, adding, “Was any permission given for construction? I demand that deputy collector, BMC officials should be booked for culpable homicide and suspended.” BJP legislator and party spokesperson Atul Bhatkhalkar said, “How can the BMC say it is not their responsibility?” The mayor said there should be collective responsibility. “This construction hasn’t come up in the past four years. These are 10-15-year-old buildings. The MP can’t merely write a letter and escape the responsibility. Everybody’s responsible, including us (BMC),” she said. Shetty had written to Aaditya Thackeray and Aslam Shaikh in August 2020 in the wake of collapse of a two-floor building in Malwani after a spell of heavy rain in July 2020. In the letter, a copy of which is with HT, Shetty said the state must give “immediate attention” to the people residing in such structures. “This is not the first time a house of 2-3 floors has collapsed in Malvanl Basti/Slums and innocent people lost their lives… The Maharashtra Government should get into action and take quick remedial steps and create and formulate a concrete development plan for entire Malvani Basti. There are several houses/slums in Malvanl Basti which are 2-3 floors and need immediate attention and people residing are at immense risk,” the letter said, a copy of which was also marked to Milind Borikar, collector, Mumbai suburban district. Shaikh, however, denied any knowledge of a letter from Shetty. “I don’t know about any letter written by the MP; he was an MP earlier as well and his [party’s] government was there in the previous five years. I am unaware of any correspondence from him,” he said. Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government has announced ₹5 lakh ex-gratia for the family of deceased and ₹50,000 for those who were injured in the collapse. Thackeray, in a statement, also said that the cost of the treatment for the injured will be covered by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malad-building-collapse-blame-game-begins-101623352940238.html
11-06-2021||Mumbai||Malad building collapse:Structure got shaky after Cyclone Tauktae in May, say locals||The incident of ground plus three structure collapse in Malad’s Malvani area could well have been averted, if the building owner had paid heed to the structural damage, according to the locals in the neighbouring building. The locals claimed that the residents of the building and their neighbours had felt the building was shaking when gusty winds and heavy rainfall lashed the city in the third week of May when Cyclone Tauktae hit Mumbai.The locals said that the building had undergone some structural repair works post the heavy rainfall due to cyclone in the city but despite this, the ground plus four structures collapsed.Mohmaad Momin a local from the area said, “During the cyclone when there were gusty winds and heavy rains, we felt that that the building was shaking. Had the building owners paid heed at that time, this incident could have been averted.”Amirul Shaikh who resides near the building said, “We had already alerted the residents that we felt the building was shaking when there were strong winds and heavy rainfall. Some work was also done but I think it was not enough.”Joint police commissioner (law and order) Vishwas Nangare Patil who spoke to reporters at the collapse site on Thursday also said the incident could have been averted.Patil told reporters, “It is a very unfortunate incident, and the building was illegally constructed. The building had suffered structural defects during a cyclone a few days ago. If proper action was taken at that time, this incident could have been avoided. We are taking legal action and going to book the contractor and owner of the building who did the repair work.”According to civic officials, the building was one of the load-bearing kind of structures mostly found in slums in the city. These structures are not properly built, hence vulnerable to collapse. Often, the owners add more floors to make more without roping in architects or structural engineers to build the same. The district collector’s office had permitted the citizens in 1976 to construct ground storey houses under a scheme by the state government around four decades ago, according to BMC officials. However, almost all the houses have constructed additional two to four floors illegally.According to BMC records, the building is located on plot no: 72 on New Collector Compound on Abdul Hamid Road, Malvani.Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that the BMC knew about illegal structures in the area but did not act on them. Vinod Mishra, a BJP corporator from Malad, said, “We had complained to the BMC about illegal structures in Malvani area in 2019, but no action was taken. If the BMC would have acted on our complaints, this incident would not have taken place.”BMC officials said they had written to the suburban collector’s office to take action against dangerous building in the area. Bharat Marathe, deputy municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “We have written to the collector’s office several times asking them to take action considering it is under their jurisdiction.”Malad that falls under P North ward of the BMC is one of the most densely populated wards in the city. Despite this, the ward does not have a dedicated ward officer.Vinod Mishra the local BJP Corporator said, “Since February 2021, the ward does not have a ward officer. This ward is one of the most densely populated wards and the BMC has given additional charge of this ward to another officer. How can such instances be avoided in that case?”Meanwhile, according to BMC officials, the process to give a full-time ward officer is ongoing and the file was stuck in the administration due to the second Covid-19 wave that hit the city over two months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malad-building-collapse-structure-got-shaky-after-cyclone-tauktae-in-may-say-locals-101623352881046.html

Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has directed the storm water drains department to survey all the manholes in the city and replace the damaged ones at war-footing.A CCTV captured two women falling into the manhole at Village Road in Bhandup. However, they narrowly escaped from being washed away. Though the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) did not confirm if the video was of Wednesday when the city had received heavy rain, on Thursday it replaced the damaged manhole cover. Ahead of monsoon, each of the 24 ward offices is required to inspect all the manholes, as a part of the pre-monsoon works, and replace their lids, if needed. “However, after yesterday’s heavy rain, BMC is again inspecting all the roads and manholes. Necessary replacement of manholes is being done,” a BMC statement read. Last year, a 32-year-old woman, Sheetal Dama, had died after falling into an open manhole near Global Hospital in Ghatkopar (East). Two days after the incident, Dama’s body was recovered 22km away from Ghatkopar at Haji Ali in Worli. In July 2019 after heavy rainfall, 18-month-old Divyansh Singh had died after falling into an open drain. The same year, seven-year-old Sumit Jaiswar had died after falling into an open drain at Dharavi, while in Worli, Babu Kumar Paswan drowned after falling into an unprotected water-filled pit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-fall-into-manhole-at-mumbai-bmc-gets-into-action-101623352880189.html

The development comes after Captain Sathe’s son Dhananjay, who is based in Bengaluru, had taken to Twitter on May 20, complaining that his mother was being misguided and made to go around in circles to receive his father’s employee compensation. Dhananjay tweeted that 10 months after his father’s death, the “individuals in employee compensation commissioner office (Mumbai, BKC) are misguiding and setting up hoops for my mother in the middle of a pandemic (sic)”.This tweet went viral and the state’s ruling party Shiv Sena intervened to help Captain Sathe’s wife. A day after the crash on August 7, the Centre and Kerala government had announced ₹10-lakh compensation each to the families of the crash victims. However, the family faced issues in getting the money after the amount was transferred from Kerala. Advocate Amit Dutia, who handled the case, said, “After Capt. Sathe’s request, the Kerala compensation court had transferred the amount to Mumbai compensation court. However, some administrative issues were delaying the procedure. But after we took over, all the verification processes were completed on the same day and Mrs Sathe received the total amount on Wednesday. “ Shiv Sena leader Sachin Ahir, who helped the family to get the compensation, said, “Captain Sathe’s son Dhananjay tweeted about the issue, after which our minister [state minister] Aadityaji [Thackeray] asked me to help the family. We then learnt the issue in detail and roped in advocate Dutia to help the family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ai-express-aug-crash-pilot-s-kin-gets-dues-101623352821607.html

Though heavy police deployment was seen, cops seemed helpless as farmers flouted Covid norms. Many farmers were not wearing face masks. The cavalcade caused traffic jams on the Delhi-Chandigarh highway (national highway 44). Panipat DSP Sandeep Singh said police was deployed to ensure there were no traffic jams. “The convoy comprising sport utility vehicles (SUVs), cars and bikes passed peacefully,” the DSP said. This was the third such movement from the GT Road belt in three weeks as two such convoys of protesters had earlier left from Karnal and Ambala. The move is an attempt to keep the agitation alive, following a drop in the gatherings at the New Delhi borders amid wheat harvesting season and paddy transplantation season beginning next week. Charuni, who is also a member of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), said though the farmers’ unions had held 11 rounds of discussions with the Centre, the government had failed to convince them of the benefits of the reforms. “These laws have been designed to benefit big corporate houses and will leave farmers at the mercy of traders,” he said. He also dismissed the hike in minimum support price of kharif crops as meagre. Farmers protest minister Kamlesh Dhanda’s visitFarmers protested against minister of state for women and child development Kamlesh Dhanda’s visit to Kaithal on Thursday. On the call of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU, Charuni) farmers, including women, gathered near the venue of Dhanda’s programme at the civil secretariat Kaithal and raised slogans against the minister and the government. However, police managed to stop farmers from venturing further. Hoshiyar Singh Gill, district president of BKU (Charuni), accused the minister of instigating farmers to hold protests as the chief minister had inaugurated the projects virtually and there was no reason to hold such a programme in Kaithal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-farmers-convoy-leaves-for-new-delhi-to-join-protest-at-singhu-border-101623352821171.html

Of the 12 dead, nine, including six children, were from the same family. Some relatives and survivors recount the horror:‘Didn’t know the building was dangerous to live in’Mohammed Siddiqui was returning home with a packet of milk on Wednesday night when he heard a loud rumbling sound. When he rushed to the spot, he couldn’t believe his eyes. The ground-plus-two storey building, where he was residing with his family, had collapsed.The Malad resident lost nine of his family members including his wife Rahisa Bano, who had asked him to get milk for the next day’s breakfast. He lost his 45-year-old brother Shafiq Md Saleem, sister-in-law—Ishrat Bano Shafiq and six of their children including a 1.5-year-old toddler. Tahes Safik, 12, who was the last to be lifted from the rubble had already succumbed to his head trauma.“Within just 15 minutes, the building collapsed, and I lost my family members. I tried to look for my brother and his family but couldn’t find anyone under the debris,” recalled Siddiqui, while waiting to collect the bodies of his deceased family members at the civic-run Bhagwati Hospital, Borivli on Thursday afternoon.The building collapsed at around 10.30pm on Wednesday. The civic-run Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Municipal General Hospital located in Kandivli (West) received an alert of mass casualty at around 12.30am. All the victims were brought dead to the hospital.Siddiqui survived with his 17-year-old son Zunaid Rafik whom he had adopted years ago when the teenager lost his parents.“He does a part-time job at a medical store, so he was at work when the building collapsed. Or else, I would have lost him too,” said Siddiqui.When asked if he noticed any cracks in the building when it rained heavily on Wednesday, he said they lived there for seven years, but never observed any cracks in the walls or tilting of the building.“We didn’t know if the building was dilapidated or dangerous to live in. Or else, I would have shifted somewhere else,” he said.Rapid antigen tests were conducted on all the bodies as per rules before performing autopsies.Siddiqui has not only lost his family but also his house and belongings. Now, he doesn’t know where to go with his son. All the documents have been lost in the disaster.“At present, I have kept my son at a neighbour’s house. After performing the last rites of my family members, I will have to look for a house to stay in. I don’t know where to begin,” he said.‘Mother is in denial, believes 9-year-old is still alive’Sahil Sarfaraz Sayyed was playing with his mother at home when their building suddenly collapsed and the nine-year-old lost his life.

On Wednesday around 8pm, he got a call regarding a job, so he got late returning home when the accident happened.Naseer Pathan, a relative, said when Rizwana woke up, she started shouting and howling when she was informed about her son. “She is in trauma and shock. When I met her once, she kept asking me about Sahil (Sayyed). She is still in denial and believes that we are lying. I didn’t know what to say, so I left the ward,” he said.Fortunately, their 17-year-old elder son, Faizan was playing outside with his friends when the building collapsed and escaped injuries.“They had been living in the building for 25 years but never had any problem other than some load shedding. We have also visited their house quite a few times but never realised that one day, it will take away Sahil’s life,” he said.As per family members, before Covid-19 hit the city, they were planning to shift to another place on rent. But after losing his job, the father decided to stay back.“In chawls, the rent of the upper floors are always less. So, the family decided to stay on rent upstairs,” said a family member who was waiting at civic-run Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Municipal General Hospital in Kandivli (West).The body of the child was taken to the civic-run Bhagwati Hospital, Borivli on Thursday afternoon for autopsy.On Thursday, when the chief minister, Uddhav Thackeray visited Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Municipal General Hospital, the family requested him to help them in getting justice and punishing the culprit.“No one knew that the building was dilapidated. Or else, we could have saved so many lives today,” said Naseer.‘Spoke about making paper boats in monsoon’It was 4am when the body of the eighth child reached the casualty ward of civic-run Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Municipal General Hospital, Kandivli. He was later identified as 13-year-old John Irranna. It took over four hours to recover his body from the debris.Irranna was at home with his mother Maria Kumari and grandmother Laxmi Pillai when the building collapsed. The adults survived with minor injuries, however, the child succumbed to his injuries.“Just a few minutes before the accident, the grandmother went downstairs to talk to a neighbour. Hence, when the building started cracking, she immediately jumped outside. Similarly, as the building started to collapse, the mother fell to the side while John who was sitting in the middle of the room caved in,” said Krishna, a relative at the hospital.Irranna’s aunt who is pregnant was also staying with the family in the same room. But on Wednesday evening, she had a doctor consultation, so she didn’t get injured.His father was outside for work when the accident happened. John studied Class 4 in a BMC-run school. Among his family members, he was known for being mischievous who also missed going to school.“It took over four hours to search for his body from the debris. We stayed awake the whole night hoping to see him alive. But when they pulled the body from the rubbles, we could see his lifeless body,” said Anitabai Kumari, aunt of the child.His body was also taken to Bhagwati Hospital, Borivli for post-mortem. Initially, the family wasn’t permitting the procedure but later agreed.“I just saw him last week where he was talking about making paper boats in the monsoon. Never did we know that he would never be able to sail those in the rain,” said Kumari with teary eyes.40-year-old pulled out by a relative, passer-by, savedSurymani Yadav, 40, got a new lease of life when one of his relatives pulled him out of the debris when the building collapsed. He has survived with minor injuries on his head. Though stable, he has been kept under observation.Yadav ran a dairy shop on the ground floor of the building. Like always, he was working in the shop when the building collapsed within seconds giving him no opportunity to rush out of the shop.Fortunately, a relative Jatashankar Yadav who was working nearby rushed to the spot when he heard the rumbling sound and pulled him out.“I could see his hair but didn’t recognise him as it was all covered with debris. I along with a passer-by pulled him out. He had almost stopped breathing in the trauma but later when we gave him water, he calmed down,” said Jatashankar.Currently, he is undergoing treatment at Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Municipal General Hospital in Kandivli. As per doctors, he is stable but still under trauma.The hospital will provide counselling to all survivors to help them deal with the trauma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malad-building-collapse-families-survivors-recount-horror-101623352580174.html

He denies the charges and has described the case as "clearly political". The United States has labelled the trial a "theatre of the absurd" and lacking in serious evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gravely-concerned-us-decries-lack-of-access-to-jailed-ex-marine-in-russia-101623432896027.html

Production of J&J's vaccine at the Baltimore site was halted by US authorities in April and J&J was put in charge of manufacturing at the plant.J&J did not have an immediate comment. The FDA declined to comment beyond its statement.The FDA said its decision allows the J&J doses to be used in the United States or exported. It said that for J&J and Emergent to export these shots, they must agree that the FDA can share information on the batches with the regulatory authorities of the countries in which the vaccine may be used.Last month, Emergent Chief Executive Robert Kramer said it was his understanding that there are 100 million doses of J&J's one-shot vaccine ready for FDA review and that regulators had begun the review process.The April halt followed the discovery that ingredients from AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, also being produced at the plant at the time, contaminated a batch of J&J's vaccine. AstraZeneca's shot is no longer being made there.An FDA inspection also turned up a long list of sanitary problems and bad manufacturing practices at the Emergent plant.Separately, Europe's drug regulator said on Friday that batches of J&J COVID-19 vaccine made for the region around the time the contamination issues were revealed at the Baltimore plant would, as a precaution, not be used.The European Medicines Agency did not say how many shots were affected, but Reuters has reported it involves millions of doses, making it harder for J&J to meet a target of delivering 55 million to Europe by end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/discard-60-million-covid-vaccine-doses-made-at-baltimore-plant-us-fda-to-jj-101623432645719.html

The immigration agency said that its updated policy is aimed at clarifying the criteria and circumstances for expedited processing, improving RFE and NOID guidance, and increasing the validity period for certain employment authorization documents (EADs).“We are taking action to eliminate policies that fail to promote access to the legal immigration system, and will continue to make improvements that help individuals navigate the path to citizenship, and that modernize our immigration system,” Alejandro N. Mayorkas, secretary of US homeland security, said in a statement.The H-1B visa, popular among Indian IT companies and professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. There are other immigrant visas as well which were impacted by the Trump-era policy, like the L1, H-2B, J-1, J-2, I, F and O.Also Read | USCIS should approve H-1B visas for 6 years, suggests Cato Institute's David BierThe Biden administration has undone several Trump-era immigration policies, including the suspension of employment-based nonimmigrant visas. USCIS is now returning to the adjudicative principles of a June 2013 memo that instructed agency officers to issue an RFE or NOID when additional evidence could potentially demonstrate eligibility for an immigration benefit, the agency said on Wednesday. USCIS further stated that the updated policy will ensure that requestors are given an opportunity to correct innocent mistakes and unintentional omissions.Acting USCIS director Tracy Renaud said in a statement that the latest policy updates are consistent with the Biden administration's priorities to eliminate unnecessary barriers to the “legal immigration system.” “USCIS is committed to promoting policies and procedures that ensure we operate in a fair, efficient, and humane manner that reflects America’s heritage as a land of opportunity for those who seek it,” added Renaud.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uscis-rescinds-trump-era-policy-that-denied-certain-visa-applications-101623432170918.html

The Star Tribune of Minneapolis won the breaking news prize for its reporting following the killing of George Floyd, while Darnella Frazier — the teenager who filmed Floyd's killing — received a special citation.Frazier's award was intended to highlight “the crucial role of citizens in journalists’ quest for truth and justice,” while the board called the Tribune’s prize-winning coverage “urgent, authoritative and nuanced.”The AP and The New York Times each won two prizes.The feature photography prize went to AP’s chief photographer in Spain, Emilio Morenatti, who captured haunting images of an older couple embracing through a plastic sheet, mortuary workers in hazmat gear removing bodies and of people enduring the crisis in isolation.The breaking news prize for protest coverage was shared by 10 AP photographers. One widely reproduced photograph by Julio Cortez on the night of May 28 in riot-torn Minneapolis shows a lone, silhouetted protester running with an upside-down American flag past a burning liquor store.“It is a tremendous honor to win not only one, but two Pulitzer Prizes for photography, and a true testament to the talent and dedication of AP photojournalists,” said AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt. “These photographers told the stories of the year through remarkable and unforgettable images that resonated around the world.”The Star Tribune won for breaking news for its coverage of the May 25, 2020 killing of Floyd and the resulting civil unrest that tore through the city. Floyd, a Black man, died as he was being pinned to the ground by a white Minneapolis police officer.Video of the killing sparked a wave of protests, first in the Twin Cities and then nationwide.Star Tribune journalists covered the rage in Minneapolis, where protesters burned buildings including a police station.The officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds was later convicted of murder.The New York Times won its public service prize for pandemic coverage the judges said was “courageous, prescient and sweeping coverage” and “filled the data vacuum” for the general public. Wesley Morris of the Times won for criticism touching on the intersection of race and culture.The Boston Globe received the investigative reporting Pulitzer for a series demonstrating how poor government oversight imperils road safety. The series detailed how the United States lacks an effective national system to keep track of drivers who commit serious offenses in another state. It also reported how the increasingly deadly trucking industry operates with minimal federal government oversight.The prize for explanatory reporting was shared by two recipients, including Reuters. Ed Yong of The Atlantic won for a series of deeply reported and accessible articles about the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pulitzers-honour-coverage-of-covid-19-black-lives-matter-protests-101623432280987.html

China landed the Tianwen-1 spacecraft carrying the rover on Mars last month, becoming the second country in the world to have touched the Martian surface. The spacecraft spent about three months orbiting the red planet prior to the landing.In the first photograph the terrain in front of the rover is clearly visible in the and the planet's horizon appears curved because of the camera’s wide-angle lens. This black and white image, was taken by an obstacle avoidance camera installed in front of the Mars rover, the CNSA said in a statement on its websiteThe second image is in colour and was taken by the navigation camera fitted at the rover's back. The rover’s solar panels and antenna appear to be clearly unfolded, against a background of red soil and rocks on the Martian surface.The probe also sent back a video taken by a camera on the orbiter, showing how the lander and the rover separated from the orbiter while landing on the surface of Mars.In one of the pictures the Chinese rover and lander bearing the national flag can be seen on the surface of Mars. The lander and rover both display the national flag and the former even has pictures of the 2022 Chinese Olympics and Paralympics mascot ingrained on its surface, reported the Associated Press.The Zhurong rover, named after a mythical Chinese god of fire, weighs 240 kilograms and carries six scientific instruments meant to aid in its mission, including a high-resolution camera. The rover is currently surveying an area known as Utopia Planitia, a large plain in the northern hemisphere of Mars on Saturday, according to reports by state media. It will be looking for signs of existence of life on Mars using a ground-penetrating radar during its 90-day exploration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-mars-rover-sends-back-images-to-earth-101623431813858.html

Ahead of the first meeting of the G7 Leaders’ Summit, Macron said that the group defends fair remuneration of innovation and the respect of intellectual property rights.India and South Africa have been pushing for a waiver for all members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on the implementation, application and enforcement of certain provisions of a 1995 intellectual property rights agreement in order to boost Covid-19 prevention, containment or treatment. The proposal has received support from US President Joe Biden but WTO members like Germany have opposed any kind of waiver.Also Read | G7 needs a reset. It must reflect the world of todayMacron said that G7 countries have worked on the initial proposal from India and South Africa and they want to continue working on it with the WTO, World Health Organization (WTO), and all other partners. “But I hope that it will lead to an agreement at this G7 summit,” the French president added.Macron also encouraged the idea of Covid-19 vaccines donation by pharmaceutical companies in the short term, which would complement the decision of the United States to share half a billion doses of Covid vaccines to struggling nations around the world. Speaking on Thursday ahead of the G7 meet, Biden said that the United States is going to help lead the world out of this pandemic working alongside its global partners, adding that the G-7 nations would join the US in outlining their vaccine donation commitments.G7 nations comprise the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada, Italy and Japan.

The bill to facilitate appeals by foreign nationals convicted by a Pakistani military court was among 21 bills passed by the National Assembly or lower house of Parliament on Thursday. The opposition boycotted the session and contended the government had bulldozed the legislation through the House. The International Court of Justice (Review and Re-consideration) Bill of 2020 is on the same lines as an ordinance that was issued by the Pakistan government last year to facilitate Jadhav’s right to appeal against the death sentence given to him by a military court for alleged involvement in espionage and subversive activities. Jadhav was arrested in March 2016 in Balochistan on charges of spying and sentenced to death the following year. India has rejected the charges levelled against the navy officer and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The ICJ stayed Jadhav’s execution in 2018. The bills were passed after the Speaker of the National Assembly suspended the rules of business, which was challenged by the opposition. However, the opposition was defeated in a vote 112-101. According to reports in the Pakistani media, opposition members shouted slogans such as “Modi ka jo yaar hai ghaddar hai” (Modi’s friend is a traitor) and “Kulbhushan ko phansi do” (Hang Kulbhushan), and PML-N MP Ahsan Iqbal said the government had passed the bill to provide relief to an “Indian spy”. Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi defended the decision to pass the bills by saying that they could be delayed once the budget session began on Friday. He also said that opposition MPs who were against the bill to provide relief to Jadhav were “speaking the language of India”. “India wants Pakistan not to abide by the decision of the ICJ and the opposition also wants this,” he said. Law minister Farogh Naseem added the ICJ had asked Pakistan to enact legislation to provide the right of appeal to Jadhav. If the bill wasn’t passed, India could initiate contempt proceedings against Pakistan in the ICJ, Naseem said. Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said the bill was meant to give safe passage to an “Indian spy”. He said, “You were advocating the case of Kashmiris and now that of Kulbhushan?” The bills will have to be passed by the opposition-dominated Senate or upper house before the president gives his assent to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-parliament-passes-bill-that-will-let-jadhav-appeal-against-death-sentence-101623426927904.html

In a blistering review of the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test, the US FDA advised healthcare providers and test users to either destroy the lateral flow Covid tests by throwing them away in the trash or return it to the company using the FedEx return label that was included with the recall letter that Innova sent to customers.The FDA said it has significant concerns regarding the performance of Innova’s rapid antigen test, highlighting that the test kit does not have authorisation, clearance, or approval from the US regulator. The FDA further added that the performance of the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test device has not been adequately established, which presents a risk of false results.The US regulator warned that false-negative results may lead to delayed diagnosis or inappropriate treatment of Covid-19, which could not only aggravate the health condition, it also poses a risk of the spread of coronavirus. On the other hand, false-positive results could lead to a delay in the correct diagnosis of the disease as well as an appropriate treatment for the actual cause of the patient's illness, the FDA said.“False-positive results could also lead to further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus when presumed positive patients are grouped into cohorts based on false test results,” the US agency added.Also Read | US FDA approves obesity drug Wegovy which helped people cut weight by 15%.

The FDA announced that the agency has also issued a warning letter to Innova Medical Group, Inc.The FDA has advised healthcare providers to consider retesting their patients using a different Covid diagnostic test if Innova’s rapid test was given less than two weeks ago and they suspect an inaccurate result. “If testing was performed more than two weeks ago and there is no reason to suspect current SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is not necessary to retest,” it further added.According to the US FDA, the Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test is also distributed under the names Innova COVID-19 Self-Test Kit (3T Configuration), Innova SARS-CoV-2-Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test (7T Configuration), and Innova SARS-CoV-2-Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test (25T Configuration).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-urges-users-to-throw-innova-rapid-covid-test-in-trash-or-return-to-company-101623423465163.html

The number of people signing up for benefits exceeded 900,000 in early January and has fallen more or less steadily ever since. Still, claims are high by historic standards. Before the pandemic brought economic activity to a near-standstill in March 2020, weekly applications were regularly coming in below 220,000.Nearly 3.5 million people were receiving traditional state unemployment benefits the week of May 29, down by 258,000 from 3.8 million the week before.Businesses are reopening rapidly as the rollout of vaccines allows Americans to feel more comfortable returning to restaurants, bars and shops. The Labor Department reported Tuesday that job openings hit a record 9.3 million in April. Layoffs dropped to 1.4 million, lowest in records dating back to 2000; 4 million quit their jobs in April, another record and a sign that they are confident enough in their prospects to try something new.“As life normalizes and the service sector continues to gain momentum, we expect initial jobless claims to continue to trend lower,″ said Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at the economic and financial consulting firm Maria Fiorini Ramirez, Inc.In May, the U.S. economy generated 559,000 new jobs, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.8% from 6.1% in April. Many economists expected to see even faster job growth. The United States is still short 7.6 million jobs from where it stood in February 2020.But employers are posting vacancies faster than would-be applicants can fill them. Many Americans are contending with health and childcare issues related to Covid-19 and with career uncertainty after the coronavirus recession wiped out many jobs for good. Some are taking their time looking for work because expanded federal jobless benefits pay more than their old jobs.Many states are scheduled to begin dropping the federal benefits this month. Altogether, 15.3 million people were receiving some type of jobless aid the week of May 22; a year earlier, the number exceeded 30 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unemployment-claims-fall-to-376-000-sixth-straight-drop-101623420627666.html
11-06-2021||World||Explained: What to expect from Israel’s next govt under Bennett in aftermath of Gaza violence||The confidence vote in the Israeli parliament on Sunday could end the 12-year-long run of its longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. If all goes according to the plan, the parliament will vote to install a “change” coalition, led by Naftali Bennett, the ultranationalist who has vowed to chart a new course aimed at healing the country's divisions and restoring a sense of normalcy.The new coalition, aimed at unseating Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu, consists of eight parties from across Israel's political spectrum, including a small Arab party that has made history by joining a government for the first time. The fragile coalition could collapse even if one party breaks out of it, which would give Netanyahu another chance for the top post.What to expect?Under the agreement reached by the opposition parties, Bennett will serve as prime minister for the first two years, followed by the centrist Yair Lapid, a former journalist who was the driving force behind the coalition. But that would be possible only if the government survives more than two years.The coalition holds a thin majority in the Israeli parliament, Knesset, with the help of parties from across the political spectrum - the right, left and centre. All parties signed the coalition agreement ahead of a Friday deadline, crushing the hopes of Netanyahu. But the parties have come together to keep Netanyahu out of the office and avoid another election.Also Read | Israeli lawmakers to vote Sunday on coalition formed against PM NetanyahuThe new coalition government is expected to adopt a modest agenda acceptable to Israelis from across the ideological divide that steers clear of hot-button issues. The major challenge in front of the coalition will be to agree on a budget, the first since 2019.Bennett, a religious ultranationalist, supports the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and is strongly against a Palestinian state. However, any push against Palestinians would risk his job given the fragility of the coalition supported by an Arab party. In such a situation, the annexation of the occupied West Bank and the invasion of Gaza are probably off the table, but so are any major concessions to the Palestinians.The new government is expected to expand Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem in a subdued way, unlike earlier governments, to avoid angering the Biden administration, which is pushing for restraint.

Doubling rate is a concept borrowed from the world of finance, which simply means the time taken for the number of infections to double. The doubling rate of the Delta variant was around 3.4 days in India before states imposed lockdown, as per government estimates.“Growth rates for Delta cases are high across the regions, with regional estimates for doubling time ranging from 4.5 days to 11.5 days,” PHE said in its analysis.The Delta or B1.617.2 variant of concern (VOC) also reduces the efficacy of vaccines compared to its predecessor, with it being more pronounced in individuals who have just been inoculated with the first dose.“There are now analyses from England and Scotland supporting a reduction in vaccine effectiveness for Delta compared to Alpha. This is more pronounced after one dose (absolute reduction in vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection of approximately 15% to 20% after one dose),” its risk assessment analysis reads.Repeated analysis also demonstrated that vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant is higher after both doses, but even then there’s slight reduction in the efficacy levels compared to the Alpha variant.“Iterated analysis continues to show vaccine effectiveness against Delta is higher after two doses but that there is a reduction for Delta compared to Alpha,” the report states“There is uncertainty around the magnitude of the change in vaccine effectiveness after two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine,” it adds.The report states that the maximum number of cases in the UK are of the delta variant but the increase in number of cases has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in hospitalisations yet. It also advised vaccination as the best possible way to combat the infection when deployed in combination with following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.The Delta variant, which was upgraded from variant of interest to variant of concern by the World Health Organization, is said to be the reason behind the surge during the second wave of the pandemic. This study comes as the UK government is poised to announce if lockdown restrictions will be lifted all over the country by the end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-60-more-transmissible-than-alpha-reduces-vaccine-efficacy-uk-study-101623415416351.html

Police received the incident report on Wednesday, and have since ruled out homicide.27 people, including municipal government officials, face criminal charges or disciplinary actions over the deadly ultramarathon.Among those punished include the party secretary and mayor of Baiyin city -- which holds jurisdiction over Jingtai -- as well as the magistrate of the county, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.Last month's incident also led to a suspension of sports competitions that lacked national safety standards, including events such as mountain trail running and ultra-long distance running.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-official-found-dead-amid-probe-into-fatal-ultramarathon-101623413414901.html

I speak freely to you," said the monk named Lhakpa, speaking from a courtyard overlooked by security cameras and government observers.The portraits of Xi were visible at almost all sites visited by Reuters during the trip to Tibet, where journalists are banned from entering outside of such tours. It was not clear when the posters and flags were put up."The posters coincide with a massive political education programme which is called 'feeling gratitude to the party' education," said Robert Barnett, a Tibetan studies veteran scholar at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies.Also Read | China says to uphold leadership of Communist Party in TibetChina's foreign ministry said: "Tibet's economy and society has made great achievements under the care of China's central government and the strong support of every Chinese person."The right to religious freedom of all ethnic groups in Tibet are protected by the Constitution and the law."During the visit, government officials suggested that such images, along with small Chinese flags that lined many city streets, were a sign of the "patriotic feeling" in Tibet.Beijing says it "peacefully liberated" Tibet in 1951, after Chinese troops entered the then-country and took over its administration.The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, and has since established a government in exile based in Dharamsala, India.Beijing has labeled him a dangerous separatist and has said when he passes away the government will select its own successor.Reuters did not see any images of the Dalai Lama, previously common in homes throughout Tibet, on the trip from May 31 to June 5.Photos of the spiritual leader are now strictly banned, according to rights groups and Tibetans who have since left the region.The foreign ministry repeated China's position that the Dalai Lama was "attempting to separate Tibet from China.""Since Dalai defected, he has not done anything good for the Tibetan people," said Fan Chunwen, the secretary for Tibet’s Department of Education.POLITICAL LEARNINGIn Tibet's College of Buddhism, a major religious training school on the outskirts of Lhasa, Chinese flags flew atop temples and images of Xi featured prominently in every dorm and classroom visited by Reuters."We are under the leadership of the Communist Party now, of course, we must learn about politics," said Kelsang Wandui, vice director of the college.Around 40% of the school's study program was dedicated to political and cultural education, Wandui said, adding the monks will celebrate the upcoming 100th anniversary of the Communist Party on July 1.Also Read | Chinese authorities restrict religious practices of Tibetans in Lhasa during holy monthThe Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), the name of the exiled Tibetan government which oversees up to 150,000 Tibetans in exile, said the "political re-education campaign has been reinvigorated to Sinicize Tibet."Beijing has consistently strongly denied any accusations of rights abuses in Tibet, and says people in China are free to practice approved religions, including Buddhism.In a Lhasa high school political ideology class visited by Reuters, a teacher preached the benefits of China's policy in Tibet and led them in chants of agreement."Our young people must cherish the party, listen to the party and be guided by the party and be loyal to our beautiful new Tibet," said Wang Zhen, Director of the Department of Education in Tibet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-is-my-spiritual-leader-china-s-education-drive-in-tibet-101623413432798.html

Nasa said that the newly discovered exoplanet is more than three-and-a half times as big as Earth, calling it “oddly reminiscent” of Neptune. The exoplanet named TOI-1231 b orbits a red-dwarf star that, according to Nasa, is “smaller but longer-lived” than the Sun.The exoplanet revolves once around the star in a year that is 24 days long. Despite the proximity to the star, TOI-1231 b is relatively cool because the red-dwarf star is also on the cooler side. Nasa said that the exoplanet could offer scientists the chance to capture a “bar-code” type reading of the atmosphere of a temperate planet orbiting another star.“This will allow comparisons with similar worlds elsewhere in the galaxy, bringing potentially deep insights into the composition and formation of exoplanets and planetary systems, including our own,” Nasa’s exoplanet exploration program said in a statement.Also Read | ‘They saw something real’: Nasa getting serious about UFOs under new chiefNasa said that the scientists might see evidence of clouds, perhaps even made of water, in the exoplanet's atmosphere. This star-and-planet system is moving at a high velocity away from Earth, the hydrogen atoms from the atmosphere of TOI-1231 b could also be detected, which means the planet could turn out to have a ‘tail’.While such atoms are almost impossible to detect due to its masking by the outer wisps of Earth’s atmosphere and by interstellar gas, Nasa said that the TOI-1231 system is moving so quickly that hydrogen atoms escaping from the exoplanet are “shifted out of phase with the blocking material, where they could be detected by telescopes like Hubble.”An international team of astronomers, led by Dr Jennifer Burt, an exoplanet researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, and Professor Diana Dragomir, an exoplanet researcher at the University of New Mexico, announced the discovery of TOI-1231 b in a new paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-says-newly-discovered-exoplanet-could-have-water-clouds-and-a-tail-101623412252350.html

11-06-2021||World||New law in China bans defaming of military personnel||China has passed a new law banning the defamation of military personnel as the country tries to weed out comments critical of the armed forces, many of which were made on social media in context of the Sino-India border conflict last year.The new law will add to the arsenal of existing legal measures under a 2018 law, which said that any individuals or groups defaming or slandering martyrs’ names, portraits or reputation would be punished and held criminally responsible for their behaviour.It was under the existing legal measures that a popular Chinese blogger was given an eight-month jail sentence for posting comments considered slanderous against People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers killed in last year’s clash with the Indian Army at the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh.The new law was passed by China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC) on Thursday. “No organisation or individual may in any way slander or derogate the honour of servicemen, nor may they insult or slander the reputation of members of military forces,” the legislation read, according to a report by the Xinhua news agency.The Xinhua report said that the legislation allows prosecutors to act if the slander seriously affects soldiers’ “performance and missions”.It also banned the desecration of plaques in honour of military personnel. “Prosecutors can file public interest litigation in cases of defamation of military personnel and the infringement on their legitimate rights and interests that have seriously affected their performance of duties and missions and damaged the public interests of society,” the law adds.Commenting on the new law, Song Zhongping, a former PLA instructor and Hong Kong-based military affairs commentator said the legislation which also covers families of service personnel was meant to bolster the PLA’s sense of mission.“Previously, our legal instruments were not complete and this new law will provide more comprehensive protection for the rights and honours of our soldiers,” Song told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.Chinese state media listed several cases of perceived defamation - mostly involving PLA’s deadly clash with the Indian army in 2020 - that could have hastened the passage of the law that was put up to the NPC in April.One case was of a 63-year-old man detained by the “…Beijing police after he was found to have slandered martyr Wang Wei and insulted Wang’s wife in a WeChat group earlier in April. Wang was a Chinese air force pilot who died when his fighter jet collided with a US military reconnaissance aircraft in the South China Sea in 2001”, a state media report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-law-in-china-bans-defaming-of-military-personnel-101623409165886.html

Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, warned on Friday that Myanmar has plunged into a “human rights catastrophe” since the military coup in February.“In just over four months, Myanmar has gone from being a fragile democracy to a human rights catastrophe...The military leadership is singularly responsible for this crisis, and must be held to account,” Bachelet said in a statement.Myanmar’s armed forces carried out a coup d’état by detaining de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other politicians after weeks of heightened tensions owing to a disputed election. The military, which ruled Myanmar for nearly five decades, again took control under a state of emergency for one year, triggering protests across the country and condemnation from world leaders.Also Read | UN says estimated 100,000 people internally displaced in Myanmar’s Kayah State due to violenceScores of pro-democracy protesters and children have been killed by Myanmar's military, the Tatmadaw, since the coup. Several media reports indicate a military build-up, especially in Kayah state in the east and Chin state in the west of the country.Citing reports of the military using civilians as human shields, Bachelet said that state security forces have continued to use heavy weaponry, including airstrikes, against armed groups and against civilians and civilian objects, including Christian churches. Bachelet said she was deeply troubled by the reports of detainees being tortured, and of collective punishment of family members of activists.“There appear to be no efforts towards de-escalation but rather a build-up of troops in key areas, contrary to the commitments the military made to ASEAN to cease the violence,” she added.Also Read | 'Undeniable that violence is spiraling': US govt's top Asia official on situation in MyanmarThe UN rights commissioner appealed to intensify regional diplomacy by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other influential States. Bachelet urged them to insist on the immediate cessation of violence and ongoing human rights violations. She will update the UN Human Rights Council on the situation in Myanmar on July 7.Meanwhile, Myanmar’s ministry of information, now controlled by the military, has said that the anti-corruption commission has inspected corruption cases against the ex-state counsellor. “She was found guilty of committing corruption using her rank,” the ministry said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-has-plunged-into-a-human-rights-catastrophe-un-rights-chief-101623407601084.html

The SAA, the second-largest airline in the entire continent, was grounded in December last year and had since been a drain on state finances, news agencies reported.The SAA, despite being one of the largest airlines in Africa -- second only to the Ethiopian Airlines -- had not turned in a profit since 2011. It was placed under a state-approved rescue plan in December 2019 to save it from collapse, AFP reported, adding that the airline was one of the many symbols of "the mismanagement of state-owned enterprises" that characterised ex-South African president Jacob Zuma's regime. The airlines was having a hard time surviving even way before the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, only managing to survive on state bailouts."Having evaluated the current environment, the government has agreed to the (strategic equity partner) owning of 51% of the shareholding and government 49%," South Africa's public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan said in an online media conference.The consortium to which South Africa is selling its national airlines comprises of private-equity firm Harith General Partners, an investor in African infrastructure and airports, and Johannesburg-based airline management and leasing firm Global Airways, which owns the recently launched domestic budget airline LIFT. The consortium will own the majority 51% share while the government will retain the minority 49% stakes in the shareholding, the minister informed, adding that the new SAA will not be "dependent" on the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-agrees-to-privatise-grounded-state-airline-101623406365783.html

Moon also called for cooperation "even though some political confrontation might be inevitable" ahead of the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-conservatives-pick-upstart-lee-jun-seok-to-retake-presidential-office-101623400369946.html
11-06-2021||World||Once ‘deeply-moved’ by K-Pop, North Korea’s Kim Jong Un calls it ‘vicious cancer’: Report||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has reportedly called K-pop, a music genre originating in South Korea, a “vicious cancer” corrupting the country’s youth, according to the New York Times. In recent months, Kim Jong Un and North Korean state media have been rallying against South Korean pop culture, including movies, K-dramas and K-pop videos. The North’s state media has warned that K-pop’s growing influence, which it calls “anti-socialist and nonsocialist”, on youth would make North Korea “crumble like a damp wall.”The two neighbouring countries of the Korean peninsula have often used loudspeakers in the demilitarised zone along the border as propaganda machinery. Last year, inter-Korean relations took a major hit after North Korean defectors started floating leaflets to criticise Kim Jong Un’s regime over human rights violations and nuclear ambitions. North Korea destroyed the inter-Korean liaison office and cut all communication lines with South Korea.Also Read | Kim Jong Un's Swiss watch 'clearest evidence' of weight lossKim has now apparently declared a culture war against South Korea as the North Korean leader believes the popular culture of the South is corrupting the “attire, hairstyles, speeches, behaviours” of the country's youth.“Young North Koreans think they owe nothing to Kim Jong Un,” Times quoted Jung Gwang-il, a defector who runs a network that smuggles K-pop into North Korea, as saying.“He must reassert his ideological control on the young if he doesn’t want to lose the foundation for the future of his family’s dynastic rule,” Jung reportedly added.Also Read | BTS 2021 Muster Sowoozoo date, time, tickets, live stream: Where and how to watch K-pop concert onlineThe family of Kim Jong Un, who took over the reins after his father’s demise in 2011, has ruled North Korea for three generations.

Times report suggests that young North Koreans now watch South Korean entertainment, smuggled on flash drives from China, behind closed doors and draped windows.The war against K-pop comes years after the North Korean leader was "deeply moved", as reported by North Korean state news agency KCNA, following a two-hour performance by South Korean artists. In 2018, a 160-person delegation from South Korea, including the K-pop group Red Velvet and Cho Yong Pil, visited the North. Kim attended a performance in Pyongyang by South Korean artists and was "particularly interested" in Red Velvet, a K-pop girl group, the publicly funded South Korean broadcaster KBS reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/once-deeply-moved-by-k-pop-north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-calls-it-vicious-cancer-report-101623403208916.html
11-06-2021||World||What the world wants China to disclose in Wuhan lab leak probe||The US push for a new inquiry to determine the origins of the coronavirus -- including whether it leaked from a Wuhan lab -- raises a key question: What has China failed to disclose?The Group of Seven leaders this weekend are set to call for a fresh, transparent, World Health Organization-convened study into the origins of this virus, according to a draft statement seen by Bloomberg News. Yet so far they’ve been vague on what exactly they want.In his statement giving intelligence agencies 90 days to redouble efforts into the origin of Covid-19, President Joe Biden asked them to come up with “specific questions for China.” Beijing officials have repeatedly denied that the virus leaked from the lab, and pointed to a WHO report earlier this year that said the most likely origin was natural.But WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the lab leak hypothesis required further investigation, adding that he was ready to deploy more resources. He said scientists would benefit from “full access to data,” including biological samples from at least September 2019. The European Union similarly called for more data.Here’s what a new study should examine:Details on Wuhan Lab ResearchOne big outstanding question is what type of work was actually going on in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Shi Zhengli, the top bat coronavirus researcher at the lab, said in a March 2020 article in Scientific American that the genetic code of the virus that causes Covid-19 doesn’t match any of her lab’s samples. She also told the WHO team that all staff had tested negative for Covid-19 antibodies.Still, researchers haven’t yet had access to all coronavirus isolates and genomic sequence data held at Wuhan labs. And they also haven’t had access to log books and records of the research that was being conducted on coronaviruses, in particular viruses with the RaTG13 bat sequence that is similar to SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen underpinning Covid-19.There are also questions about whether the institute conducted gain-of-function experiments, in which researchers manipulate naturally occurring viruses to see if they can be made deadlier or more transmissible.Medical Records of Lab WorkersThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that US intelligence indicates three researchers from the lab became sick enough in November 2019 that they sought hospital care. A number of media also reported that the Chinese government has restricted access to an abandoned copper mine in southwest China where researchers from the Wuhan lab collected coronavirus samples after a 2012 incident in which six miners fell ill with a “mysterious” respiratory illness.Shi, the bat coronavirus researcher, told the WHO team that all staff had tested negative for Covid-19 antibodies. The China Daily again reported this week that no staff member of the Wuhan Institute of Virology has ever contracted the virus that caused Covid-19.Still, researchers haven’t had access to medial records and specimens collected from staff at the institute who sought hospital care in late 2019. And they would also want to see medical records and specimens collected from the miners in southwest China.More Data on Early CasesTo identify the earliest human cases in December 2019, the WHO team reviewed health records, mortality data, trends in retail sales of cold and cough medications and reported patterns of influenza-like illnesses and severe respiratory infections in the two months preceding the outbreak in Wuhan.International investigators examined 76,000 cases from more than 200 medical centers, and researchers in China also tested some 4,500 patient specimens stored at hospitals in Wuhan and other parts of China.Even so, the WHO team that went to Wuhan earlier this year proposed further analysis of cases of respiratory illness that occurred in Wuhan in October and November 2019.Documentation on Wuhan Wet MarketsTo identify potential animal sources, 11,000 blood samples taken from livestock and poultry in 31 provinces were tested along with 1,914 samples from 35 species of wild animals. Researchers in China looked for SARS-CoV-2 in 12,000 animal swabs and 50,000 samples from 300 different species of wild animals. All were negative.Researchers this week found that mink, masked palm civets, raccoon dogs, Siberian weasels, hog badgers and Chinese bamboo rats were among 38 animal species sold live at markets in Wuhan from May 2017 to November 2019.Still, gaps remain in evidence to support a theory that the virus spilled over to humans from animals. WHO researchers haven’t seen full documentation of what species of animals were sold live at markets in Wuhan in 2019, when they were present, and a list of their vendors and suppliers.The WHO team has sought additional sampling of animal species that may act as a reservoir, including bat populations in China and neighboring countries. They also would benefit from names and addresses of farms raising minks, foxes, raccoon dogs and other fur-producing animals in China from 2018 to 2020.Evidence From Outside ChinaChinese officials have repeatedly raised the specter that the virus originated elsewhere in the world, and was brought into the country either through frozen-food imports or even a US military operation. Foreign Ministry officials have repeatedly called for the US to provide access to Fort Detrick in Maryland, which is home to the American bio-defence agency.The WHO team has called for collecting and analyzing epidemiological, clinical, molecular and environmental data from other countries to better understand the virus’s origins, since some reports have suggested it may have been circulating outside China before December 2019. They are also seeking more research to understand if it could be transmitted from contaminated products to humans, and under which conditions that might occur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-the-world-wants-china-to-disclose-in-wuhan-lab-leak-probe-101623400682838.html

Authorities in semi-autonomous Hong Kong have embarked on a sweeping crackdown to root out Beijing's critics after huge and often violent democracy protests convulsed the city in 2019. A new security law imposed by China and an official campaign dubbed "Patriots rule Hong Kong" has since criminalised much dissent and strangled the democracy movement. Films are just the latest target.In a statement on Friday, the government said the Film Censorship Ordinance had been expanded to include "any act or activity which may amount to an offense endangering national security"."When considering a film as a whole and its effect on the viewers, the censor should have regard to his duties to prevent and suppress acts or activities endangering national security, and the common responsibility of the people of Hong Kong to safeguard the sovereignty, unification and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China," the new guidance, which is effective immediately, states.Films are rigorously vetted on the Chinese mainland and only a handful of Western films or documentaries ever see a commercial release each year.Hong Kong's Film Censorship Authority has traditionally employed a much lighter touch.Historically, the city has boasted a thriving film scene and for much of the latter half of the last century, Cantonese cinema was world-class.In more recent decades, slick mainland Chinese and South Korean blockbusters have come to dominate the regional film scene.But Hong Kong still maintains some key studios, a handful of lauded directors, and a thriving indie scene.Yet there are growing signs authorities want to see an increase in mainland-style controls over the cultural and art scenes in Hong Kong.Over the past week, health officials have conducted spot checks on a protest-themed museum and a separate exhibition, stating neither have the correct licenses. The museum had been operating for years without issue.In March, an award-winning documentary about Hong Kong's massive pro-democracy protests was pulled hours before its first commercial screening after days of criticism from a pro-Beijing newspaper.It said the film's content breached the new national security law.Earlier this year a university cancelled a prestigious press photography exhibition that featured pictures of the 2019 protests, citing security concerns.And M, a multi-million-dollar contemporary art museum expected to open soon, has said it will allow security officials to vet its collection for any security law breaches before it opens to the public later this year.A government spokesperson said film censors would strike a "balance between protection of individual rights and freedoms on the one hand, and the protection of legitimate societal interests on the other".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-to-follow-china-s-steps-start-censoring-films-over-national-security-101623390894800.html
11-06-2021||World||Xinjiang a ‘dystopian hellscape’ where torture is common: Report||China is committing human rights abuses on Muslim minorities in the province of Xinjiang, a “dystopian hellscape” where brainwashing and torture in camps are commonplace, human rights group, Amnesty International has said in a new report.In a report published on Thursday, the group said hundreds of thousands of Muslim minority men and women were being subjected to mass internment and torture, systemic mass surveillance and being forced to abandon their religious traditions, cultural practices and local languages.The Chinese foreign ministry dismissed the report on Friday, calling it a “record of lies”. “People are clear about the nature of Amnesty International. This organisation, wearing tinted glasses, has been misleading the public and spreading lies and rumours about Xinjiang. Its so-called report is like adding one more page to its ‘record of lies’,” spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.“We urge the relevant organisation to abandon its persistent prejudice against China, stop fabricating and spreading disinformation and look at relevant issues from an objective and just perspective,” Wang added.The 160-page report by London-based AI - titled “Like We Were Enemies in a War: China’s Mass Internment, Torture, and Persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang” - is, however, scathing, alleging more than just persistent state-sponsored prejudice against Muslim minorities in China’s largest province.“Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in China’s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) face systematic state-organised mass imprisonment, torture and persecution amounting to crimes against humanity,” the report said, quoting dozens of new testimonies from former camp detainees.Sleep deprivation, beatings, and the use of “tiger chairs” - iron chairs with iron buckles to restrain those being questioned - were recorded, the report said, adding that detainees could be hooded and shackled during questioning.“The Chinese authorities have created a ‘dystopian hellscape’ on a staggering scale in XUAR,” Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s secretary general, said at the release of the report.“It should shock the conscience of humanity that massive number of people have been subjected to brainwashing, torture and other degrading treatment in internment camps, while millions more live in fear amid a vast surveillance apparatus,” Callamard added.The Chinese government does not deny the existence of camps in XUAR - it first acknowledged the camps in October, 2018 - but says they are part of anti-terrorism and de-radicalisation efforts in the region in accordance with the law to protect people’s lives.In February, state councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi told the UN Human Rights Council that it was taking counter-terrorism measures in accordance with the law and that Xinjiang enjoyed “social stability and sound development” after four years without any “terrorist case”.People of all ethnic groups enjoy labour rights and Muslims were free to pray in the 24,000 mosques in Xinjiang, he said. “These basic facts show that there has never been so-called genocide, forced labour, or religious oppression in Xinjiang.”Amnesty International, however, said counter-terrorism could not reasonably account for mass detention, and that the Chinese government’s actions showed a “clear intent to target parts of Xinjiang’s population collectively on the basis of religion and ethnicity and to use severe violence and intimidation to root out Islamic religious beliefs and Turkic Muslim ethno-cultural practices”.The report also said Muslims were not free to practice their religion in Xinjiang. Dozens of Muslim men and women told the organisation that the regional “Chinese authorities showed extraordinary hostility towards their Islamic faith. Basic religious and cultural practices have been deemed ‘extremist’ and used as grounds for detention”.As a result, most people have stopped praying or showing any outward signs of observing Islam. “We couldn’t say ‘as-salamu-alaykum’ [a typical greeting in many Islamic cultures meaning ‘peace be upon you’] …anymore,” one man told Amnesty International. “Qurans, prayer mats and other religious artefacts have effectively been banned.”The new report is likely to add to the international pressure on China over its policies for minorities in Xinjiang, described by the US, UK and Canada and Lithuania as genocide.The government has also been accused of carrying out forced sterilisation of Uighur women, a charge that has also been denied by the authorities.In March, the EU, US, UK, and Canada imposed sanctions on Chinese officials over the alleged abuses; Beijing responded with tit-for-tat sanctions on lawmakers, researchers, and institutions.In the report, Amnesty said the Chinese government “…must immediately close all the remaining internment camps and release all persons held in internment camps or other detention facilities - including prisons - in Xinjiang, unless there is sufficient credible and admissible evidence that they have committed an internationally recognised offence”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xinjiang-a-dystopian-hellscape-where-torture-is-common-report-101623384204402.html

The decision, as per ARY News, was taken at a meeting in Lahore presided over by the province's health minister Dr. Yasmin Rashid. The move is seemingly aimed at forcing all those citizens who refuse to get themselves vaccinated to do so at the earliest.Dr. Rashid, the provincial health minister in Pakistan's Punjab, said that there has been a "considerable decrease" in Covid-19 cases in the province due to mass vaccinations. However, a report compiled by the Punjab primary health department shows that the province still failed to achieve its set target for Covid-19 vaccination, reports ARY News, adding that around 300,000 recipients of the first dose of the vaccine never returned for the second dose since the start of Pakistan's mass inoculation drive on February 2.An official of Pakistan's ministry of national health services (NHS) said that the administration is identifying and categorising the people who never showed up for the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on their due dates. "There is a possibility that some of them might have died before getting the second dose," ANI quoted the official as saying. He noted that while a section of these people might have contracted the coronavirus after receiving the first dose and decided not to get the second, others might simply have fallen prey to negative propaganda regarding the vaccine.Meanwhile, Pakistan's finance minister Shaukat Tarin is set to present the country's budget speech in capital Islamabad on Friday afternoon, as he faces a challenge in walking the fine line between spending big over post-Covid economic recovery and keeping the budget deficit in check as Pakistan emerges from the more infectious third wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-punjab-to-block-sim-cards-of-citizens-not-vaccinated-against-covid19-101623379436486.html

Johnson presented his gift during a G7 summit, Biden's first official overseas engagement meant to normalise the United States' trans-Atlantic relations with its allies in Europe and Asia after a tumultuous Trump regime. The British prime minister hailed the newly crowned president of the United States of America as "a big breath of fresh air", as the countries pledged to work with each other on a host of issues ranging from coronavirus disease (Covid-19) management to climate change and security.The British mural presented by Johnson depicts Frederick Douglass, Black 19th-century abolitionist who escaped slavery in the United States, later going on to become an abolitionist leader who toured Britain and Ireland, with which Biden has ancestral ties. The black-and-white mural is painted on the wall of a residential street corner in Edinburgh, a city where Douglass stayed on his tour, by artist Ross Blair who used the hashtag #blacklivesmatter when first unveiling the piece online in 2020. Douglass' mural portrait was photographed by dual British-US national Melissa Highton.Appreciating the UK prime minister's gift, Biden reciprocated by presenting Johnson, a keen cyclist, with an American-made bicycle and helmet.The US president also gave a silk scarf and leather bag made by military wives for Johnson's wife Carrie. The UK side, in return, presented US first lady Jill Biden with the first edition copy of 'The Apple Tree' - a collection of short stories by 20th-century British author Daphne du Maurier, who lived in Cornwall, the picturesque corner of England that is hosting the G7 summit.The United Kingdom is keen to collaborate with the United States of America on a host of issues with prime minister Boris Johnson playing down differences with Washington over the impact of Brexit on the peace in Northern Ireland. "You know, I'm optimistic," Reuters quoted him as saying, "There’s complete harmony on the need to keep going, find solutions."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-uk-s-boris-johnson-gifts-joe-biden-mural-of-19th-century-abolitionist-frederick-douglass-101623377062480.html

"The shooter is one of the deceased."The shooter turned his gun on himself, Teri Barbera, spokeswoman for the sheriff's office, told AFP.This was the latest shooting in south Florida in recent days.On Sunday, three people were killed and five wounded at a graduation party in Miami.Two people were killed and at least 20 wounded a week earlier when three shooters fired "indiscriminately" into a crowd outside a concert in the Miami area, police said.Mass shootings have taken place across the United States this year in a surge of violence that President Joe Biden has branded an "epidemic."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-including-child-killed-in-shooting-in-florida-101623377435116.html
11-06-2021||World||South African woman gives birth to 10 babies, govt says will verify||A 37-year-old old woman from South Africa has claimed she has given birth to 10 babies earlier this month and which will most likely get her listed in the Guinness Book of Records for delivering the most number of babies at once. The image of Gosiame Thamara Sithole with an over-expanded stomach went viral like wildfire on social media and led to the coining of the term ‘decuplets’.However, the babies have not made a public appearance yet, prompting speculation that the claim made by the parents may be fake. The South African government, meanwhile, has still not been able to verify how many babies the 37-year-old from the Tembisa township near Johannesburgactually delivered.According to the Associated Press, the department of social development in the Gauteng province said they have traced Sithole and spokesperson Feziwe Ndwayana said they would make an announcement after meeting with the family. AP also reported that another local government department said earlier this week that it had no record of the babies' births in any of the province's hospitals.Sithole’s news comes just a month after a Malian woman gave birth to nine babies in Morocco, the first case of nonuplets. Pretoria News newspaper reported citing her husband Teboho Tsotetsi that Sithole gave birth at a hospital in Pretoria. The newspaper further reported that all the babies were born prematurely.The couple already has twins aged six and now the family will have a dozen kids.“It’s seven boys and three girls. She was seven months and seven days pregnant. I am happy. I am emotional,” Tsotetsi said, adding the birth of 10 babies at once was a big surprise as doctors only found eight in prenatal scans - which use sound waves to form images that show a baby’s shape and position.But relatives and neighbours of the family have insisted the news is indeed true. Speaking to AP, Wilson Machaya, a neighbour of Sithole, said it was a blessing to have 10 babies at once and he would assist the family in any way possible.(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/woman-from-south-africa-gives-birth-to-10-babies-govt-says-will-verify-101623375504821.html
11-06-2021||India||SC stops Ahmedabad hospitals from being shut down, seeks ‘workable solution’||The Supreme Court on Friday ordered Ahmedabad municipal corporation not to shut down hospitals in the city that do not have necessary clearances to ensure that their patients don’t suffer and asked the Gujarat government to come up with a “workable solution” within four weeks.The interim direction by the top court, which struck a middle path between the need to protect the lives of patients in these hospitals and to comply with law, allows hospitals without no objection certificate (NOC) from fire department or building use certificate to continue for the time being.But the judges made it clear that the hospitals will have to set their house in order. “Incidents of people dying in fire in hospitals is absolutely atrocious. We cannot permit hospitals or nursing homes to operate without clearance or certificates,” the bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian said.The municipal corporation’s crackdown on private hospitals came after eight people died in a fire at a private hospital in Ahmedabad in August 2020. A PIL was filed before the Gujarat High Court which brought to the fore how Shrey Hospital was allowed to function out of a residential building.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Gujarat government, agreed that they needed to find a way. “It would be hazardous to give up on so many hospitals. We have to come up with a solution where law is complied with, and no harm is caused to people,” he said.Tushar Mehta sought time to consult medical professionals and come out with a via media.The order came as a reprieve for the hospitals served notices for closure by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. The hospitals, under the banner Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA), had challenged these notices before the Gujarat High Court which refused to come to their aid. However, the high court granted protection from any coercive action till June 17.On February 22 this year, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation issued a public notice which made it mandatory for all commercial establishments to obtain building use permission under Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporation Act and Fire NOC under Fire Safety Measures Act before occupying any premises. Three days were granted for establishments to comply or face sealing of their premises. Many hospitals approached the municipal authority but, in the meantime the corporation partially sealed many hospital premises.Appearing for the association, senior advocate Maninder Singh told the Supreme Court that almost all hospitals under the Association had obtained fire department clearance. He proposed forming a committee that could help prepare documents considered necessary to obtain a building use certificate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stops-ahmedabad-hospitals-from-being-shut-down-seeks-workable-solution-101623435748153.html
11-06-2021||India||United Kingdom reports two cases of monkeypox, initiates contact-tracing||Two cases of monkeypox were identified in the United Kingdom’s (UK) North Wales on Thursday, according to a report by news agency BBC. Health officials familiar with the developments said that both the cases belong to the same household.Monkeypox falls in the same category of viruses as smallpox but it is considered less severe and experts also highlighted that the chances of infection are low. The virus occurs mostly in remote tropical rainforests of central and West African countries. It has two main strains --West African and Central African. Monkeypox, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) is a zoonosis, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans.Public Health Wales (PHW) said that the initial cases were acquired overseas. The PHW also highlighted that the risk to the general public is low and contact-tracing has been initiated. One of the patients has been released while the other continues to be hospitalised. The Public Health England is also monitoring the situation.“Confirmed cases of monkeypox are a rare event in the UK, and the risk to the general public is very low,” a PHW official was quoted as saying by news agency BBC.“We have worked with multi-agency colleagues, following tried and tested protocols and procedures, and identified all close contacts. Actions have been put in place to minimise the likelihood of further infection,” he further added.The UN health body highlighted that it has found evidence of the monkeypox virus in squirrels, Gambian pouched rats, dormice, different species of monkeys and others. It also said that several other animals in the rainforest were seen to carry the virus.Fever, headaches, swellings, back pain, aching muscles and fatigue are the most common symptoms of monkeypox. A rash may develop following a fever often beginning in the face and then spreading to other parts of the body.It commonly occurs in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The rash is extremely itchy and changes and goes through several stages before forming a scab. The scab later falls off but the lesions can cause scarring. The WHO says that the detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred method of testing for monkeypox.The infection clears up on its own and lasts between 14 to 21 days. Most of the monkeypox are mild resembling chickenpox and clear up on their own. The disease can however become severe and has caused deaths in West Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/united-kingdom-reports-two-cases-of-monkeypox-initiates-contacttracing-101623431928213.html

11-06-2021||India||BJP puts up undeterred front but cracks begin to show after Mukul Roy’s exit||The Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday tried vehemently to put up an undeterred front after the departure of its national vice president Mukul Roy, but the cracks within became more conspicuous as a section of leaders blamed the party for Roy’s exit. “Any person can go anywhere. We are more concerned with the party workers who are under attack. I don’t know what the loss (after Mukul Roy’s departure) would be. I didn’t see any gain (when he joined the party),” said Dilip Ghosh, who some BJP party leaders said, shared a strained relationship with Roy. Top leaders of the BJP’s Bengal unit and the party’s spokesperson said that it won’t affect the party as the BJP was not a party driven by any single person. A few other leaders slammed Roy. “In 1968 when CPI was formed, former CPM leader Hare Krishna Konar had said that humans don’t become weaker by answering nature’s call. They get stronger. I want to reiterate this today for those turncoats who had come to BJP and are now going back,” said Tathagata Roy, veteran BJP leader and former governor of Meghalaya and Tripura. Former TMC MLA Baishali Dalmiya who joined the BJP in January 2021, just ahead of the assembly polls went to the extent of sating that the party should get rid of garbage. “I would request BJP leader of Bengal Hon. MLA Shri @SuvenduWB ji to expel all the garbage out of our BJP party as soon as possible,” tweeted Dalmiya. On the other hand, party’s national secretary and former MP Anupam Hazra, however, criticized the BJP for Roy’s exit. “During the assembly elections, the party went crazy with one or two leaders. Many others leaders were not utilized. There was lobbying. This needs immediate repair else the state BJP will face more trouble in the future,” he said. The TMC, however, accepted Roy saying that the son has returned home as he could not take the policies of the BJP.“They went to BJP for some reason. But they have understood that the policies of BJP be it that of Covid-19 management or its economic policies are not in favour of Bengal. So they don’t want to stay in that party anymore,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson. Other political parties including the CPIM and the Congress reacted to the event. “That Mukul Roy may return, the hint was given by Mamata Banerjee in her election campaign. Roy who had vowed to evict the TMC has once again surrendered before the TMC along with his son. This gharana of turncoats is a new identity of Bengal politics,” said Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Bengal Congress president and Congress MP. “It reminds me of a Bengali song. For a long time we have been seeing a section of leaders moving to and fro between the TMC and the BJP. It is a relation between the two parties,” said Ashok Bhattacharjee, veteran CPIM leader and mayor of Siliguri Municipal Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-puts-up-undeterred-front-but-cracks-begin-to-show-after-mukul-roy-s-exit-101623431188360.html
11-06-2021||India||India’s aspirational districts programme resulted in sectoral growth: UNDP report||An independent appraisal report by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) lauded India's Aspirational Districts Programme (ADP) and said it has resulted in sectoral growth and improvements in governance and administration."A very successful model of local area development" that "should serve as a best practice for several other countries where regional disparities in development status persist for many reasons," the UNDP report said.Also read: At the United Nations, Delhi showcases its women powerThe set of pre-determined indicators provided by the programme has helped the district administration to focus on specific targets and sectors instead of broad government schemes or new initiatives, the report claimed.The report, which was handed over by UNDP India resident representative Shoko Noda to NITI Aayog vice-chairman Dr Rajiv Kumar and CEO Amit Kant analysed the progress of ADP and made recommendations for improvement.The UNDP report analysed progress across five sectors of the ADP —health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water resources, basic infrastructure and skill development and financial inclusion.Suggesting that the programme has acted as a catalyst for development, it found that Aspirational Districts (AD) outperformed non-ADs.Across the sectors of health and nutrition, the report found that 9.6% more home deliveries are attended by a skilled birth attendant and 5.8% more pregnant women with severe anaemia were treated. As for financial inclusion, the report found registration of 1,580 more accounts per one lakh population under the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana.The ‘Malaria Mukt Bastar Abhiyaan’ in Bijapur and Dantewada, which has reduced malaria incidences in these districts by 71% and 54% respectively, was recommended as one of the ‘best practices’ found in ADs, as per the report.Other best practices undertaken by the ADP, the report found GoalMart, an e-commerce portal launched by Assam’s Goalpara district administration ‘to promote rural, ethnic and agrarian products of the district in the national and global markets’ as noteworthy. The report said that the initiative helped the farmers and retailers during the Covid-19 lockdown and was also profitable for the farmers.Another such initiative lauded by the report was Uttar Pradesh’s Chandauli district's decision to experiment with the cultivation of black rice. Due to its high global demand and good profit margins, the project was a success and high-quality black rice from the district is now exported to Australia and New Zealand, the report found.Also read | Japan, UNDP to provide 8 oxygen-generation plants to NE: Union ministerThe UNDP report also commended the delta rankings provided on the programme’s Champions of Change dashboard. "The competitive and dynamic culture fostered by it has successfully pushed several low performing districts (as per baseline rankings) to improve their standing in the past three years. Simdega (Jharkhand), Chandauli (Uttar Pradesh), Sonbhadra (Uttar Pradesh) and Rajgarh (Madhya Pradesh) were found to have progressed the most since the beginning of the programme," it said.The ADP was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January 2018 as part of the government's efforts for inclusive growth under 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'."ADP is ‘aligned to the principle of “leave no one behind”—the vital core of the SDGs. Political commitment at the highest level has resulted in rapid success of the programme’," the report said.It also recommended revising a few indicators that are slightly close to reaching its saturation or met by most districts like ‘electrification of households’ as an indicator of basic infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-aspirational-districts-programme-resulted-in-sectoral-growth-undp-report-101623426058129.html

On suggestions — offered by Indian experts — that Covid-recovered people do not require vaccine and therefore can be left out of the vaccination drive, the ministry clarified that such debates should be there in the public domain. But any decision to change the present vaccination guideline will have to consider the bigger picture, "This is a dynamic process. There is no hardcore ideology in science. Our experts will go through the latest developments and take a call," VK Paul, Niti Aayog member (health) said on Friday.In India, the gap between the two doses of Covishield was widened to 12 to 16 weeks. The gap was widened based on international studies which claimed that the protection offered by the first dose of the Covishield vaccine lasts long. Hence, the second dose can be delayed.But a more recent study by Public Health England claimed that the protection offered by the first dose of the vaccine could be lower than what was thought before. Following this, authorities have already started reducing the gap between vaccine doses. For example, Northern Ireland has reduced the gap from 10 to 12 weeks to eight weeks for all vaccines available there.The new study says the first dose of Astrazeneca (Covishield) provides 33 per cent efficacy in preventing Covid-19 infection by the Delta variant, the one first reported in India. The second dose improves the protection against the Delta variant to 60 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dynamic-process-centre-on-whether-gap-between-covishield-doses-will-be-revised-again-101623417752118.html
11-06-2021||India||‘Homecoming,’ says CM Mamata as she welcomes Mukul Roy back to TMC||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national vice-president Mukul Roy on Friday afternoon returned to the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the party he left in 2017 after a 19-year long association, with chief minister Mamata Banerjee describing it as “homecoming of the family’s boy”. “Our party is already powerful. We won a landslide victory. Mukul is an old boy of our family. Nobody can stay in the BJP. They do not allow anyone to live with dignity and peace. Mukul was threatened by probe agencies. His health was getting affected. He will have mental peace here,” Banerjee said at a brief press meet. Roy’s son, Subhranshu, a former legislator, also returned to the ruling party. Roy is an accused in the 2016 Narada sting operation case that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing. On May 17, the CBI arrested two TMC ministers, Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, MLA Madan Mitra and former party leader Sovan Chatterjee. Declaring that more leaders from the BJP will join the ruling party in the coming days, Banerjee said, “But traitors who joined the BJP before the elections for money will not be taken back.” Banerjee got agitated when reporters pointed out that Roy had made remarks against her after leaving the party. “I never had any differences with Mukul. Please do not ask questions aimed at individuals. Mukul did not say a word against us during the elections. The traitors who left us during the polls and helped the BJP will not be taken back. Do not ask about ideology. I cannot satisfy the BJP media. We do not break political parties like the BJP. We are taking him not because we are scared about numbers. He is here out of his own will. BJP is a party of landlords. It controls the agencies,” said Banerjee. “I never had differences with Mamata Banerjee, I don’t and I never will in the future,” quipped Roy. Saying that he would issue a written statement on why he left the BJP, Roy said, “I am happy that I have been able to come out. I can see the old faces here. I am happy that Bengal will regain its old glory under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee who is a national leader.” “We will decide later what post Mukul will hold. He was a vice-president of the BJP. Since he has left, it is clear that he was not satisfied working with them. More people will come. But those who betrayed our party for money will not be considered. We will take only those who do not spread bitterness,” Banerjee added. She abruptly ended the press conference when Roy was asked a question on Suvendu Adhikari who joined the BJP in December last year and defeated Banerjee in the recent polls. BJP leaders said Roy’s absence will not affect the saffron camp in any way. “We congratulate Roy on his new political journey. The BJP is the world’s largest political party. It is not run by a dynasty. One individual does not make any difference. This was his personal decision. Since he won the Krishnanagar North assembly seat in Nadia district on a BJP ticket we hope he will resign as legislator and start with a clear conscience,” said BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar. “However, it would be an insult to Roy if someone says he was in the BJP because he was scared by probe agencies. He is not a child,” added Majumdar. There were strong rumours since morning that Roy might join the TMC during the day. “I cannot speculate on rumours,” Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said at a press conference in Delhi. Roy left his Salt Lake residence at 2 pm and headed for the TMC headquarters at the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. He was escorted by the Kolkata Police. The chief minister also left her residence at Kalighat in south Kolkata at 2 pm. Several former TMC leaders who joined the BJP have publicly appealed to Mamata Banerjee to forgive them. They include the chief minister’s former aide Sonali Guha. Others, such as former forest minister Rajib Banerjee, have written critical posts against the BJP. On June 3, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up Roy to inquire about the latter’s ailing wife, Krishna Roy, who is undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at a private hospital in east Kolkata. Though Roy did not comment on the conversation that, according to BJP leaders, lasted around two-three minutes, the phone call made news as Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee had visited the hospital the night before. His visit triggered speculations about Roy’s next political move. Around two hours after Banerjee’s visit, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh also went to the hospital. The next day, Mukul Roy denied having any knowledge about Ghosh’s visit. “I don’t know who he came to visit,” said Roy. The incident indicated that Roy was distancing himself from the BJP. On May 29, Subhranshu Roy wrote on his social media page that self-criticism is more necessary than criticizing a government elected by people. Though he did not name any party or state, social media users took it as an obvious reference to Bengal. Mukul Roy won the Krishnanagar North seat in the recent assembly polls, while his son was defeated from the Bijpur seat that he held in North 24 Parganas district. Subhranshu Roy joined the BJP in 2019. On Friday, Abhishek Banerjee felicitated the father-son duo with shawls and formally inducted them into the TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/homecoming-says-cm-mamata-as-she-welcomes-mukul-roy-back-to-tmc-101623418346362.html

The Uttar Pradesh chief minister also met home minister Amit Shah on Thursday and the BJP party chief later on Friday.Yogi Adityanath's visit comes amid the BJP holding a series of review meetings allowing space for speculation that a ministerial reshuffle is on the cards in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the legislative assembly elections that are to be held next year.His two-day visit to Delhi and meetings with PM Modi, Amit Shah and JP Nadda also comes amid reports of dissidence in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttar Pradesh, according to a report by HT. The report said that the incidents of dissidence occurred due to Uttar Pradesh's handling of the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. It also highlighted that not only the opposition but also the party's own members questioned the way the government handled the pandemic. The state government refuted these allegations and said that the administration controlled the second wave within a week.Following the meeting, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said, "Heartfelt gratitude to the respected Prime Minister for providing time and kind guidance amid his busy schedule."

On June 3, the biopharmaceutical company announced that it has secured exclusive rights to commercialise Covaxin in Canada. The company also said that it has begun discussions with Health Canada for regulatory approval, reported PTI."The company will pursue expedited authorisation for the vaccine under the Interim Order Respecting the Importation, Sale and Advertising of Drugs for Use in Relation to Covid-19 in Canada," PTI reported the company as saying.Also read: Bharat Biotech's Covaxin not getting US nod won't impact India, clarifies GovtOcugen said that for the amendment to expand its rights to commercialize Covaxin in Canada it will make an upfront payment of $15 million to the Indian drugmaker. In a regulatory filing, the company said it has agreed to pay another $10 million to Bharat Biotech within a month from the commercial launch of the vaccine in the country."As we work towards the submission of the emergency use application in the US, we will simultaneously seek authorization under interim order for emergency use in Canada. We believe Covaxin has the potential to play a key role in saving lives from Covid-19 in the US and Canada, as well as across the globe, due to the strong immune response it generates against multiple antigens,” Dr Shankar Musunuri, chairman of the board, chief executive officer, and co-founder of Ocugen said.Ocugen also said that following the same pattern of the US profit sharing agreement, the company will retain 45 per cent of the profits from the sales of Covvaxin in Canada.Meanwhile, the company on Friday saw a major setback that delayed the vaccine launch in the US. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended Oucgen to go for the Biologics Licence Application (BLA) route with additional data, shadowing the hopes of emergency use approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-ocugen-to-seek-emergency-use-approval-for-covaxin-in-canada-101623413440831.html

Pilot, who left for Delhi on Friday after participating in a protest related to inflation, is likely to meet her on Sunday, they added. A Pilot loyalist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the former deputy chief minister is in touch with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and she has assured him of resolving the issues and asked him to be patient. The meeting is expected in the backdrop of demands for cabinet expansion and political appointments by Pilot’s loyalists. They have been questioning the delay in addressing the issues even as a panel was setup last year for it.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra played an important role in resolving the political crisis when Pilot rebelled against chief minister Ashok Gehlot last year. Pilot is also expected to meet Rajasthan Congress in charge Ajay Maken and general secretary KC Venugopal, the members of the panel, who are yet to submit their report. Also Read | Congress leader Sachin Pilot disses Rita Bahuguna Joshi’s claim he will join BJPPilot rejected Bharatiya Janata Party leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi’s statement that she had spoken to the Congress leader about joining her party. He added Joshi does not have the courage to speak to him. “Rita Bahuguna Joshi said she spoke to Sachin. She might have spoken to Sachin Tendulkar. She does not have courage to speak to me,” Pilot said.Pilot this week expressed his displeasure over the lack of action even as the committee was formed last year to address the issues he raised against chief minister Ashok Gehlot.HT has reported the central leadership of the Congress was trying to work out a cabinet reshuffle in Rajasthan. Pilot told HT this week the Congress high command has failed to deliver on the promises that were made to him when he along with 18 legislators returned to the party after a month-long rebellion. In July last year, Pilot and his supporters left Jaipur to camp at a secret location in Haryana, threatening the stability of the Gehlot government. Pilot was removed as Pradesh Congress Committee president, and it was only when the Gandhis intervened and set up a committee under general secretary Ajay Maken that he returned to the fold. Lawmaker Hemaram Choudhary, who resigned last month, met Pilot on Friday. When asked if Pilot asked him withdraw his resignation that is pending with Speaker CP Joshi, he said, “I did not resign because Pilot asked me to. I resigned listening to my conscience. People can appeal me but it is I who has to make a decision.” PR Meena, another lawmaker from Pilot camp, said the cabinet expansion and political appointments should be done. On Thursday, lawmakers Ved Pakash Solanki, Mukesh Bhakar, Vishwendra Singh, Rakesh Pareek, Suresh Modi and Ramniwas Gawriya met Pilot at his residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-likely-to-meet-priyanka-gandhi-as-dissent-in-rajasthan-congress-resurfaces-101623415466361.html

Within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), ministers are now vowing to be more cautious than the first time round when Goa made entry free to the state. “Tourism industry should not open up till Covid-19 cases are in control all over India; When it opens, it should be in a phased manner,” Michael Lobo a minister in the Goa government who represents the Calangute constituency, arguably the epicentre of tourism in the state, said. On May 31, Lobo had argued that any kind of restrictions on the movement of people into the state would sound the death knell of the industry. “If you make SOPs stricter and you harass tourists, which tourist will come to Goa? We have to take precautionary measures, but at the same time you cannot stop business because Covid-19 cases are increasing,” he had said. Also Read | Goa govt employees approach HC on withdrawal of housing schemeHowever, as the situation worsened, he was among the first to change his stance and ask the villages falling under his constituency to “lock down”.For his part, tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar has suggested that only completely vaccinated should be allowed in the state once it is unlocked.However, the Opposition has questioned the need to reopen and suggested that tourists shouldn’t be welcome until all the residents of the state are vaccinated. “Opening tourism is not based on allowing fully vaccinated tourists. It should be thought about once all Goans are fully vaccinated -- so that Goa becomes a safe tourism destination. This is the global practice. Before opening tourism, the government of Goa must ensure that all Goan-owned businesses and workers receive all the support and incentives they can to recover. We must protect Goan livelihoods first, if we truly want to recover Goa’s tourism industry,” Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai said. Till date, Goa has vaccinated nearly 400,000 persons with at least one dose -- around 25% of its population -- while around 100,000 people have received both the doses. This way, it will take at least another six months before much of the state is fully vaccinated with both the doses. The state’s Covid tally stands at 161,000 and nearly 3,000 people have died. After the initial lockdown last year, Goa’s tourism sector witnessed a revival of sorts across the months of November to January with flight arrivals and tourist footfall on the main beaches nearly matching those of previous seasons.According to state government figures, around 2.5 million tourists visited Goa till December last year, which is a little over a quarter of normal arrivals. Prior to the pandemic, the state witnessed close to 9 million tourists, including around 900,000 foreigners.As per a survey by Goa Tourism Development Corporation on the impact of the pandemic on the state’s tourism Industry, the overall loss of earnings during lockdown has been estimated at Rs2,062 crore. Potential loss of earning for the 2020-21 season has been pegged at ₹7,239 crore and the potential job cuts were to the tune of 122,000 (58%).Goa’s tourism sector directly contributes 16.43% towards the state Gross Domestic Product and also provides employment to nearly 35% of the state’s population, according to official estimates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tourism-season-months-away-ministers-mull-best-way-to-open-goa-up-to-tourists-101623415046068.html
11-06-2021||India||Goa govt employees approach HC on withdrawal of housing scheme||About 400 Goa government employees have approached the high court earlier this month over the state government’s decision to “arbitrarily and unreasonably” withdraw House Building Allowance (HBA) scheme. This includes as many as 240 police personnel and a host of other employees -- from judicial officers to clerks.Under the scheme, in force since 1988, the Goa governmentstood as a guarantorfor the loan granted to government employees, and offered a subsidy on the interest. Employees, depending on their rank, were eligible for housing loans of up to ₹36 lakh and the quantum to be admissible depended upon the employee’s length of service left and their repaying capacity at a concessional rate of 2% per annum. The difference between the rate charged by the bank and the interest at subsidised rate payable by the employee was borne by the government. It worked out to approximately ₹19.70 crore per year for 1,955 beneficiaries.Also Read | More relaxations in Pune from Monday if infection rate remains lowThrough an order dated May 15, 2020, which was sent to all heads of departments, the government decided to withdraw/close the HBA extended to its employees without citing any reasons.As a consequence, all those who had applied for and were granted the benefit, suddenly saw their easy monthly instalments recalculated according to the prevailing bank rate without any subsidy from the government.The government also refused to entertain objections/representations from the employees claiming that was final but giving the employees the opportunity to transfer the load to a financial institution of their choice.In effect the government employees who were repaying their housing loans at the rate of 2% per annum are now liable to pay an interest rate of 10.20% per annum.After the employees approached the high court, the government upgraded the office order, and promulgated an ordinance to declare the scheme as withdrawn without giving any reason for the same.“By unilaterally changing the rules of the game, without any opportunity and condemning the petitioners behind their back [causing] grave detriment and prejudice [that] the very livelihood of the petitioners is at stake,” the policemen said in their petition. The petitioners claim that the government breached its end of the contract by withdrawing the scheme after commitments were made. The government had a deal with HDFC which agreed to disburse loans subject to the state government taking responsibility towards payment of the principal and interest to the bank at the rate of interest charged by it while the government would recover the principal and interest at its prescribed rate for HBA from the employees.The high court has granted three weeks to the Goa government to reply.The Opposition has demanded that the scheme be restored. “The government must be spending around ₹12 to 14 crore a month on the subsidy, which is a paltry amount. It could have enhanced the rate of interest on the scheme instead of doing away with the scheme,” Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Digambar Kamat said. “Many of these employees have approached me and I find the decision of the state government to be highly unreasonable, based on incorrect assumptions, without any thought of welfare for its employees and most regressive,” he said.The Goa government has, however, stuck to its guns despite the demands. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, had, however defended the decision, saying the scheme was essentially “complicated” but hastened to add that the government would come out with a one-time settlement scheme for those unable to pay their dues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-govt-employees-approach-hc-on-withdrawal-of-housing-scheme-101623414626084.html

A living-donor liver transplant involves the removal of a portion of the liver from a healthy person for the one with the dysfunctional organ.The patient, Raghul Gandhi, a Kabaddi player from Puducherry, developed acute liver failure and he was brought to MGM Healthcare in a comatose stage two days after being diagnosed with the disease. A liver transplant is performed on patients who are uninfected and have end-stage liver disease. In the case of Covid-19 patients, it can be performed on those who have had a recovery period of over four weeks and show two successive negative RT-PCR tests.Gandhi was positive for the disease when he was brought to the hospital in a critical situation. “He was brought to us with a day or two to live. The transplant was to be done within 24 hours or it would not have been possible to resuscitate him,” said Dr Thiagarajan Srinivasan, Director, Institute of Liver Diseases, Transplant and HPB surgery, MGM Healthcare. The patient’s condition was first stabilised with intubation.Also Read | Keeping Covid-19 vaccine wastage below 1% possible, health ministry explains howSrinivasan said following their procedure, the Liver Transplant Society of India has issued guidelines to allow liver transplants among Covid-19 positive patients. The team created a secluded Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for Gandhi in accordance with Covid-19 protocol where he underwent continuous plasma purification, toxin filtration, and liver dialysis. This was around the time when Covid-19 infections in Chennai were peaking in May and the state was facing an oxygen crisis.The factor that worked in the patient’s favour was that his CT scan did not show any impact on his lungs. The liver disease had not affected his brain. The Covid-19 infection was the cause of his liver failure.The hospital consulted experts across the country as well as the Liver Transplant Society of India. They arrived at a consensus to conduct the transplant. “Our biggest hindrance came in the form of very limited functioning of the cadaveric organ donation system with only one liver donation in May in Tamil Nadu,” said Srinivasan.The only option was to identify a donor. But two of Gandhi’s family members were also positive. So, his younger brother was rushed in from Puducherry, which is over 150km from the hospital. He turned negative and presented good antibodies, indicating he has been exposed to the infection but recovered completely.“The transplant workup procedure which normally takes 3-4 weeks was accelerated at a rapid pace to complete the work up in a record 6 hours,” said Dr Karthik Mathivanan, a liver transplant surgeon.A bio-bubble was created to separate the team of doctors working for the donor and recipient. Covid-proof transport corridors, ICUs, wards, and operation theatres were implemented throughout the pre-and post-op procedures that spanned 15 days. “Usually, surgeons, perfusionists, and staff nurses move around. But, in this case, we did not just need more manpower, but we had to involve two different teams for the donor and recipient which included technical staff and assistance,” said Mathivanan. The transplant surgery took 12 hours.None of the surgery team members were infected by Covid. A system for the airflow from the ventilators was used along with filters to keep the air clean in the ICU and the operation theatre to reduce the chances of the team contracting the virus.Gandhi has recovered from Covid-19 and has a new functioning liver. “I feel normal,” said Gandhi at a press conference on Thursday.Mathivanan said Gandhi would be able to resume Kabaddi after six months to a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-doctors-conduct-liver-transplant-to-save-covid-19-patient-101623412286014.html
11-06-2021||India||Bharat Biotech's Covaxin not getting emergency approval in US will not impact India's vaccine plan, says Centre||Bharat Biotech's Covaxin being denied of emergency use approval by the United States' Food and Drug Administration will have no bearing on India, Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul said on Friday during the press briefing of the Union health ministry. Welcoming their decision, Dr Paul said that every country has its own benchmark for such approval. But as India's drug regulator was satisfied with the data that the Hyderbad-based vaccine maker produced, the FDA's decision will have no bearing in India. "We are happy as we have gone through their safety data," Dr Paul said.A vaccine manufactured in India may not be equally effective in Argentina, Dr Paul said, citing the example of the Rota Virus for Children. The nutrition level, the gut flora of the population make a difference in the effect of the Rota Virus. "This may lead to some differences especially in countries where science is strong, and our manufacturing is strong," Dr Paul said.The FDA has not given emergency use approval to Covaxin and sought more data on the clinical trials. Bharat Biotech's American partner Ocugen has now decided to go for full approval, with complete data.Dr Paul also expressed hope that the vaccine maker will comply with what the FDA has wanted."Every country has a different regulatory system. The scientific framework might be the same but nuances change depending on the context. They have their own parameters which we respect. Our regulatory authorities too have separate parameters. When our vaccine makers make vaccines for our children, the nutritional status, the genetic background are taken into account to find out whether the vaccine will be fully effective. If one vaccine is effective on our children, it may not work in Argentina. That is a different cohort of people," Dr Paul said.Bharat Biotech's application before the World Health Organization for emergency use approval is also pending. But the company is not seeing FDA's disapproval as a setback as no vaccine manufactured or developed in India has ever received emergency use approval or full licensure from FDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-s-covaxin-not-getting-emergency-approval-in-us-will-not-impact-india-s-vaccine-plan-says-centre-101623410392584.html

Hundreds of Congress workers were seen gathering near petrol pumps in many states including Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Karnataka, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and raising slogans against the government.“When the UPA was in power, tax on petrol and diesel was ₹9.20. Now, it is ₹32. We demand complete rollback of excise duty hike on petrol-diesel. Fuel should come under the purview of GST,” said Congress leader KC Venugopal while protesting against the fuel price hike in Delhi.Venugopal also rode a horse cart as a mark of protest.On Thursday, Venugopal released a statement saying that protests will be organised by the local units of the party and Covid-19 protocols prescribed by the local, district and state administrations will be followed. The statement further added that there will be no public meetings.The party, from its official Twitter handle too, urged people to raise their voice against ‘BJP’s tyranny’ on June 11.“Even during the pandemic, BJP’s great India loot continues. With 47 (fuel) hikes in 2021 alone, Indian pockets are on fire,” Congress had tweeted while using the hashtag #BJPLootingIndia.Indian Youth Congress members also sent bicycles through courier to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah as a mark of protest against the fuel hike.Also read: 30 Congress workers detained in Delhi for protests against rising fuel prices“Inflation is already on the rise. We demand that the increased (fuel) prices are withdrawn with immediate effect and relief should be given to the people suffering from inflation and recession by returning the hike in excise duty,” Congress youth president, Srinivas BV said.Meanwhile, at Vaniyambadi in Tamil Nadu, AICC member Dr Aslam J Basha was seen holding placards with other Congress workers, saying, “Congress party has always stood by the citizens of India and it will not allow the BJP government to continue exploiting people.”In Uttar Pradesh, many Congress workers were detained by the police as they protested against the hike. Ajay Kumar Lallu, president of the Uttar Pradesh Congress committee too was detained after he was seen protesting the fuel hike.“…Will not tolerate loot from the public in diesel-petrol. This fight against the slave government of the capitalists will not stop,” Lallu tweeted while sharing his photos where police were seen pushing him inside a police van.Hitting out at the police, Lallu said, “Our workers are not afraid of the police dictatorship of the Yogi government. We will fight the people’s fight till the last breath.”Meanwhile, national convenor of Congress, Saral Patel said, “Across Uttar Pradesh… leaders are being detained and put under house arrest to stop them from raising their voice against rising petrol and diesel prices. Why so scared Yogi Adityanath?”In Mumbai, Congress workers protesting the hike were seen wearing facemasks with pictures of Baba Ramdev on them. Ramdev, along with few more Indian businessmen, has been the eye of the storm for quite some time now as the BJP government has often been blamed for unjustified support to the business ventures of these people.Also read: K’taka Congress launches “100 not out” campaign against rising fuel pricesIn several districts of Odisha too, workers were seen holding protest placards as they sat in huddles in front of petrol pumps across the state.Niranjan Patnaik, Odisha Congress committee president, described the BJP’s rule as ‘tyrannical’. “India is already witnessing a spiralling rise in prices of essential commodities,” he said.Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also took to Twitter to criticise the government for the price hike. Gandhi wrote, “GDP crashing, Unemployment soaring, Fuel prices skyrocketing. In how many more ways is #BJPLootingIndia?”HT reached out to BJP for a comment on the issue. BJP’s national spokesperson Gopal Agarwal said that the onus of price rise lies more on the side of states.He said that the resources generated by the government are much below the estimated target while the expenditure has been constantly increasing. “So, governments, both Centre and the states have to generate revenue,” he said.“Centre also shares its resources with the states by seeking taxes, so the major expenditure lies on the Centre. Thereby, the onus (of price hike) is more on the states right now.”Agarwal added that the other reason for price rise is the new mechanism of taxation based on open market global pricing which was started under the UPA.“The UPA at their time played the politics of issuing the oil bonds to the companies instead of lending them direct oil subsidies. Now, this liability has also fallen on the current government’” he said.He added that at the moment it is clear that Congress is just playing politics. While he said that as the revenue through direct and indirect taxes increases for the government, there might be a withdrawal in the hike, he however added that at present it is the states which should reduce their component of taxes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-delhi-to-tamil-nadu-congress-mounts-natiowide-protest-against-fuel-hike-101623411085812.html

In an editorial published in the party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, it highlighted Prasada’s family ties to Congress, his days in the Manmohan Singh cabinet as a minister, and his continued defeat in elections."Prasada, who had faced defeat in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, has finally joined the BJP. Prasada’s family members were Congress loyalists. He was a minister in former prime minister Manmohan Singh’s cabinet. However, he kept losing assembly and Lok Sabha elections. The BJP has now started celebrating his induction into the party fold,” the editorial said.“The caste politics of Uttar Pradesh is behind it. Eye on UP’s Brahmin vote bank is being said to be behind Prasada’s induction into the BJP," it added.The editorial posed the question of Prasada’s influence over Bramhin votes, too. "But if Prasada had a hold over the Brahmin votes, why these votes weren't transferred to the Congress?" it asked.Prasada who joined the BJP on Wednesday alleged that he could not work for the country while being in Congress and his desire to work for the “new India PM Modi is building” as the reason for shifting camp ahead of the elections in UP.The Sena opined that young leaders like Prasada, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot have to shoulder high expectations, and the death of old timers like Ahmed Patel and Rajeev Satav due to Covid-19 has created a vacuum in the party and young leaders leaving does not bode well for it."Jitin Prasada, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin pilot were young leaders and there were high expectations from them. There is already a vacuum in the Congress after the death of Ahmed Patel and Rajeev Satav. It is not good that young leaders are going the BJP way," the Sena said."Despite being in position to win Kerala and Assam, the Congress couldn't do so. It lost Puducherry. But there is no discussion on what the Congress should do next and how it should resurrect itself. Except in Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka, the Congress is fighting for its survival everywhere else. This political imbalance is harmful to democracy," it saidThe editorial also talked about the contributions made by Congress so far and tasked Rahul Gandhi with the responsibility of creating a strong team to answer the challenges before the party."Congress president Sonia Gandhi has ably carried out her responsibility in the party. Now, Rahul Gandhi has to create a strong team, which will be the answer to the challenge before the party," it stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-up-s-brahmin-vote-shiv-sena-hits-out-at-jitin-prasada-s-induction-into-bjp-ahead-of-elections-101623409421851.html

11-06-2021||India||Bharat Biotech pursuing full approval for Covaxin in US||Bharat Biotech’s American partner, Ocugen, has received a recommendation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to pursue Biologics License Applications (BLA) path, or full license, for its Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, the Indian company said in a statement on Friday. It said the BLA path is for full approval instead of emergency use authorisation. “All applications have to follow the BLA process, which is the standard process for vaccines,” it said. The company added, therefore, for BLA, data from an additional clinical trial will be required to support the marketing application submission for Covaxin. It added the process was likely to extend their overall timelines.The company said that no vaccine manufactured or developed in India has ever received emergency use approval or full licensure from FDA. It added, therefore, it will be a “great leap forward” for vaccine innovation and manufacturing in India if Covaxin is approved in the UN.As the Covid-19 cases have been reducing in the US because of good herd immunity and the vaccination of a significant percentage of the population, the FDA has announced no new emergency use authorisation would be approved for new vaccines.Covaxin is one of the Covid-19 vaccines being administered under India’s immunisation programme. It has received emergency use authorisation from 14 countries. More such authorisations are under process in at least 50 other countries.Covaxin, which has been co-developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research, is a whole virion inactivated vaccine. Inactivated vaccines contain viruses with destroyed genetic material. They cannot infect and trigger an immune responseBharat Biotech has partnered with Ocugen for commercialisation of the Covaxin vaccine in the US. On June 3, Bharat Biotech announced that they have amended their co-development, supply, and commercialisation agreement to expand Ocugen’s exclusive territory to commercialise Covaxin to also include Canada.In a statement earlier, Krishna Ella, chairman, and managing director, Bharat Biotech, said Covaxin has demonstrated an excellent safety record in human clinical trials and in vaccine administration under emergency use in India. “Our goal for all vaccines developed at Bharat Biotech is to provide global access. With its potential effectiveness against multiple existing and emerging variants, we believe that Covaxin is an important vaccine for everyone, including children, based on its unique yet traditional vaccine platform. We are diligently working with Ocugen to bring Covaxin to the US market and now to the Canadian market.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-pursuing-full-approval-for-covaxin-in-us-101623409226190.html

Vaccination drives have to organised in a way that there is minimum wastage and many states have done that, the health ministry said, adding that vaccinators have a significant role to play in it. Since the vaccines being administered now can not be left open, the vaccinator must ensure that when a vial is opened, it has to be used within four hours."The vaccinator is advised to mark the date and time of opening each vial and all open vaccine vials need to be used/discarded within 4 hours of opening. Several states have organized COVID-19 Vaccination in such a way, that not only there is no wastage but they are able to extract more doses from the vial and thus show a negative wastage. Hence, the expectation that vaccine wastage should be 1% or less is not at all unreasonable. It is reasonable, desirable and achievable," the ministry said.The data of vaccine wastage is being centrally monitored as Prime Minister Narendra Modi stressed reducing the wastage. According to Centre's data released on Friday, Kerala and West Bengal recorded negative wastage of vaccine in May while Jharkhand reported the highest with 33.95 per cent wastage. Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh reported vaccine wastage of 15.79 per cent and 7.35 per cent, respectively. Jharkhand, however, refuted the claim and said that the Centre was basing its argument on old data. The state government said its vaccine wastage is 1.5 per cent.Accommodating at least 100 people per session can reduce vaccine wastage, the Centre has said. However, areas which are sparsely populated can not stick to this rule, but they have to ensure enough beneficiaries turn up in a session so that vaccine is not wasted."All States/ UTs have also been advised that each vaccination session is expected to cater to at least 100 beneficiaries, however, in the case of remote and sparsely populated areas, the State could organize a session for a lesser number of beneficiaries while ensuring that there is no vaccine wastage. A session may be planned only when adequate beneficiaries are available," the Centre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keeping-covid-19-vaccine-wastage-below-1-possible-health-ministry-explains-how-101623406022403.html

The party workers on Friday held protests against the rising petrol and diesel prices across the country as they demanded a complete rollback of the price hike.Police detained over 30 protesters from the spot of the demonstrations for not following Covid-19 protocol.

Mohan, a district secretary of the Communist Party of India in Tamil Nadu state where left-wing ideology still burns red-hot."My first son was born during the fall of the Soviet Union and everywhere in the news I was reading that this was the end of communism," Mohan told AFP."But there is no end for communism as long as the human race lives on, so I named my first-born Communism," he said.His next two sons were named Leninism -- whose five-month-old son Marxism will also attend the nuptials on Sunday -- and Socialism, the groom.Pictures of the invitation to the wedding, embossed with hammer-and-sickle emblems, have gone viral on social media.Socialism's bride-to-be meanwhile is P. Mamata Banerjee, named by her grandfather after a firebrand left-wing politician in West Bengal.The fact that this other Banerjee ended several decades of communist rule in 2011 in the eastern state to become chief minister isn't spoiling the party.India leaned more towards the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and names like Stalin, Lenin, Trotsky and even Pravda -- the name of the USSR's state newspaper -- are not unheard of, particularly in the south.Tamil Nadu's current chief minister is M.K. Stalin, named by his father in honour of the Soviet communist dictator just days before he died in Russia.Mohan said that there was nothing unusual about his sons' names -- some of his "comrades" gave their children names such as Moscow, Russia, Vietnam and Czechoslovakia.But he admitted that his boys, especially Communism, were sometimes teased at school. One hospital refused to admit Communism when he was three years old."They were scared of the name Communism and initially I faced a lot of troubles. But over time, things smoothed out," he said.All three sons, now in their 20s, are fellow members of the local communist party, and Leninism named his son after none other than Karl Marx."Now I am waiting for a grand-daughter from one of my sons, who I will name Cubaism," Mohan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/socialism-gets-indian-wedding-communism-and-leninism-to-attend-101623406815898.html

He has said control rooms be set up at sub-divisional levels and asked officials to notify the helpline numbers.Officials said Langer reviewed the situation and inquired about the hours of power supply, curtailment in rural and urban areas, and available buffer stock of transformers, functioning of workshops, and timelines for replacement of damaged transformers.A load distribution chart, accessed by HT on Thursday at 4.30pm, showed that the Kashmir Valley has been allotted 1,050 megawatts compared to 737 megawatts to the Jammu region. During summer, the Valley remains cooler than Jammu.An engineer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Kashmir gets more electricity supplies compared to the Jammu region as successive governments upgraded the power infrastructure in the Valley. “Even if we want to strike a balance, we cannot because the power system in the Jammu region has not been upgraded. If we try to strike a balance and increase power supply to the Jammu region, the power distribution system in Jammu will not sustain it...”The engineer said when it comes to power revenue, Jammu contributes more, around 70 to 80%, compared to Kashmir. “That is why the authorities never share the break-up of revenue from Kashmir and Jammu regions and present clubbed figures of entire Jammu & Kashmir.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-official-directs-action-amid-power-cuts-in-jammu-despite-rising-mercury-101623405866574.html

Out of the 10,600 employees at CMC, as many as 8,991 had been vaccinated between January 21 and April 30 this year, with 94.3% of them being inoculated with Covishield, as per the research team.The study showed that two doses of Covishield rendered 65% protection against infection, 77% against hospitalisation, 92% against the need for oxygen, and 94% against the need for admission in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), reported news agency ANI.The research revealed that fully vaccinated individuals, however, did contract Covid-19, with 679 (9.6%) contracting it within 47 days (34-58) following their second dose, and 33 individuals contracting it within two weeks of the second dose.Some staff members however did not receive their second dose due to a shortage of vaccines and a change in guidelines on the required gap between the two doses.The study also stated that the only Covid-related fatalities were witnessed in the beginning of the pandemic in HCWs who had multiple comorbidities and hadn’t been vaccinated."The only staff member who died since the beginning of the pandemic had multiple comorbidities and had not taken the vaccine," ANI said, quoting the study.The study could not determine the efficacy of the two vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) administered to the staff at CMC, as a sub-group analysis was not possible due to the miniscule percentage of HCWs who were jabbed with Covaxin."Subgroup analysis on the efficacy of the two vaccines was not possible due to few HCWs receiving Covaxin," it stated.CMC’s findings, which sheds new light on the results of vaccinating frontline workers, comes on the heels of the Centre’s decision to train 1,00,000 healthcare workers ahead of a possible third wave of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccinated-healthcare-workers-run-lower-risk-of-covid-19-infection-than-unvaccinated-ones-study-101623405344825.html

To buy the medicine, his parents mobilised ₹16 crore through crowd-funding in a span of three-and-a-half months from 65,000 donors.The medicine, imported from Novartis, USA, landed in Hyderabad on June 8 after the Centre waived the import duty and even exempted Goods and Services Tax (GST), both to the extent of ₹6 crore.It all began on February 4 when Ayaansh’s parents, Yogesh Gupta, who is from Chhattisgarh and works in a private firm in Hyderabad, and Rupal Gupta, posted a request on social media platforms and began the campaign to raise funds. By May 23, they had mobilised ₹16 crore they required with their donors including celebrities such as India team cricket captain Virat Kohli and his actor wife Anushka Sharma, Emraan Hashmi, Dia Miza, Javeed Jaafri, Rajkumar Rao, Arjun Kapoor, and Sara Ali Khan.Also Read | Ahead of third wave, Centre to create trained workforce to handle healthcareThe drug was administered to Ayaansh on Wednesday morning at Rainbow Children’s Hospital at Vikrampuri in Secunderabad.

While the process was completed within and hour and there were no complications, doctors have advised the parents to take extreme care of the boy for another two months, keeping him under strict quarantine. “Since his immune system is weak, there is a possibility of him getting other infections.

PIB says no way||A video doing the rounds on the internet claiming Covid-19 vaccines can make people "magnetic" are baseless, the government has said and urged people to get vaccinated against the coronavirus disease. The video shows objects sticking to the arms of a vaccine recipient and is also being shared widely on social media, fuelling rumours about the safety of the vaccines.The Press Information Bureau's (PIB) fact-checking arm, PIB Fact Check, has said these claims about Covid-19 vaccines are "baseless". "Vaccines cannot cause a magnetic reaction in the human body. COVID-19 vaccines are completely safe and do not contain any metal-based ingredients. It is common to experience mild side-effects like mild headaches, pain or swelling at the injection site, and mild fever after getting the COVID-19 vaccine," it said. "Do not fall prey to misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines and get vaccinated," added.Several posts/videos claiming that #COVID19 #vaccines can make people magnetic are doing the rounds on social media. #PIBFactCheck: ✅COVID-19 vaccines do NOT make people magnetic and are completely SAFE Register for #LargestVaccineDrive now and GET VACCINATED ‼️ pic.twitter.com/pqIFaq9DytReports said that the video is of a 71-year-old man from Nashik in Maharashtra, who claimed that objects were sticking to his arm after he took the second dose of the vaccine.

Experts have said that those vaccinated against Covid-19 cannot experience magnetism at the injection site.Also read | Traders in Odisha town offer 5% discount on groceries to fully vaccinated peopleThey said even if Covid-19 vaccines did contain metals, they would not cause a magnetic reaction. They also said that humans are all naturally “a little bit magnetic”, because we contain tiny quantities of iron. “The amount of metal that would need to be in a vaccine for it to attract a magnet is much more substantial than the amounts that could be present in a vaccine's small dose,” medical professionals at the Meedan Health Desk said, according to Reuters.Professor Michael Coey from the School of Physics at Trinity College Dublin said the claims about the Covid-19 vaccines were  “complete nonsense”. Coey told Reuters that people would need about one gram of iron metal to attract and support a permanent magnet at the injection site. “By the way, my wife was injected with her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine today, and I had mine over two weeks ago. I have checked that magnets are not attracted to our arms!” he wrote to Reuters.The country-wide vaccination drive was first rolled out on January 16 and is currently in its third phase.

He was 78 and is survived by three daughters.Radha Mohan, who retired as a professor of economics, was suffering from bronchial asthma along with other co-morbidities, and was admitted to hospital a few days ago when his health deteriorated.Condoling his death, PM Narendra Modi tweeted: “Prof Radha Mohan ji was deeply passionate about agriculture, especially adopting sustainable and organic practices. He was also respected for his knowledge on subjects relating to the economy and ecology. Saddened by his demise. Condolences to his family and admirers.”Odisha Governor Ganeshi Lal also condoled his death. ‘He will always be remembered for his unique organic farming techniques,” said Lal.Chief minister Naveen Patnaik tweeted, “Deeply saddened to know the passing away of Gandhian and Padma Shri awardee Prof Radha Mohan.

Three decades ago, the father-daughter duo started Sambhav, a resource centre for farmers where many vanishing food crops such as clove bean, jack bean, black rice and sword bean were grown through organic means.They began by buying an acre of degraded land in Nayagarh district and started planting trees on it. Over time, that one-acre land transformed into 890 acres of forestation with three rainwater harvesting ponds and 500 varieties of rice. It is also home to nearly 1,000 species of plants including trees such as mango, lichi, jackfruit, chiku, and several timber varieties.Through Sambhav, they implemented organic farming techniques and used cattle manure, bio-gas slurry, used agro-waste and mulching. They trained local farmers on sustainable agriculture and biodiversity conservation. They also started ‘Adopt a seed’ programme in which interested farmers were given climate resilient indigenous seeds and asked to take oath to preserve them.Born in 1943 at a small village in Nayagarh district, Radha Mohan graduated in Economics from SCS College in Puri and completed his post-graduation in Applied Economics from Utkal University in 1965.Radha Mohan was appointed as state information commissioner in 2011 after his retirement as the principal of SCS College.

Senior leaders of the Congress party, including state president DK Shivakumar, former chief minister Siddaramaiah, RV Deshpande and Dinesh Gundu Rao, took part in the protest. Their colleagues held similar protests at landmark fuel stations across Bengaluru.

Shivakumar said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had held similar protests against the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government when fuel prices saw a marginal increase but were silent even as petrol and diesel prices have crossed ₹100 per litre. The BS Yediyurappa government in Karnataka is already under fire for increasing electricity tariff during the pandemic, garnering sharp criticism for adding to the problems of people suffering from loss of income due to Covid-19 induced lockdown. “Increasing taxes make petrol cross ₹100 a litre. In Karnataka, BJP has also increased electricity rates. Whether you stay in or move out, BJP wants to empty your wallets. Like a gun point robbery.

The party is busy working for people, the TMC leader said adding that BJP's Amit Malviya should not comment on this either as it would not be good for the BJP too if a debate starts now.On Thursday, BJP leader Amit Malviya questioned Nusrat Jahan's statement that her marriage with Nikhil Jain was never valid in India and asked whether the TMC MP lied standing on the floor of Parliament. The BJP leader also added that he raised the question only because Nusrat Jahan is a public representative and her marital status is part of Parliament record, according to which Nusrat Jahan is married to Nikhil Jain. Malviya also shared the clip of Nusrat Jahan taking the oath as Nusrat Jahan Ruhi Jain.প্রসঙ্গ নুসরত জাহান: বিষয়টি ব্যক্তিগত। এর সঙ্গে রাজনীতি বা দলের কোনো সম্পর্ক নেই। বিজেপির মালব্য এসব নিয়ে টুইট না করাই ভালো। তর্ক শুরু হলে বিজেপির পক্ষে ভালো হবে না। তৃণমূল মানুষের কাজ নিয়ে ব্যস্ত।#aitmc #mamataofficial #avishekaitmc #derekobrienKunal Ghosh's tweet has made it clear that the Trinamool Congress is not interfering in the issue and will maintain distance from Nusrat's personal matters.The Basirhat MP has not been visible in political activities after TMC's win in the West Bengal Assembly elections, though she was active on her social media account. Last month, she launched a free safe Covid home for patients with mild symptoms in her constituency.On speculations over her personal life, Nusrat on Wednesday released a statement saying that her marriage to Nikhil Jain was conducted under Turkish Marriage Regulations and was not tenable in India. Hence, she does not require a divorce to end what was, according to her, more like a live-in relationship. She has also accused Nikhil of stealing money from her bank account and his family of forcefully holding her belongings. The allegations have been refuted by Nikhil Jain who said though there was no registration of their marriage, they lived like husband and wife and introduced themselves as a married couple in society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nusrat-jahan-case-has-no-connection-with-politics-party-busy-to-serve-people-says-tmc-101623394659878.html

Talks between the Centre and National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN-IM) have had to be suspended this year owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.In February this year, the state assembly adopted a resolution to urge the government of India and Naga groups for early conclusion of political talks and bring about “one solution”. Subsequently, an all-party delegation led by chief minister Rio and Leader of Opposition TR Zeliang met Union home minister Amit Shah and leaders of NSCN-IM in March. The all-party assembly delegation represented the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) and its ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Independent MLAs and Opposition Naga People’s Front (NPF).Also Read | Assam to raise 10 commando battalions on lines of NSG to fight crime, border issuesOn Thursday, news about Nagaland government constituting a core committee consisting of both ruling and opposition MLAs to facilitate Naga peace talks circulated on social media platforms. Opposition leader TR Zeliang confirmed that Rio has convened a meeting on June 19, but he said the formation of such a committee was not notified.A government official, on the condition of anonymity, said a notification on the constitution of core committee would be brought out soon. A round of dialogue scheduled to be held in April-May in New Delhi was postponed indefinitely owing to the second wave of Covid-19. Sources in the group said NSCN (IM) general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah and some other leaders of the organisation are in their designated camp Hebron in Dimapur and are unlikely to return to Delhi any time soon to resume the talks unless the Covid situation improves.The NSCN (IM) entered into a ceasefire agreement with the Centre in 1997 and the two have been holding talks since then, while a conglomerate of seven different Naga national political groups (NNPGs) also got into separate talks with the Centre since 2017.The Centre signed a “framework agreement” with NSCN (IM) in 2015, and an “agreed position” with the NNPGs in 2017. However, the NSCN (IM)’s demand for a separate Naga flag and constitution has been a delaying factor in signing a final deal on the protracted Naga political issue.The NSCN (IM), in the May issue of its bi-monthly newsletter “Nagalim Voice”, reiterated that the Naga people held two things dearly- their political identity as symbolised by the Naga national flag and the “Yehzabo” (constitution). “These two issues are not negotiable. It cannot be bartered away in exchange for any temporary gains. History will not forgive NSCN if we sell out Nagas’ historical and political rights for the sake of concluding the Indo-Naga political dialogue,” the NSCN (IM) stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-cm-convenes-all-party-meeting-on-june-19-to-push-naga-peace-talks-101623393444973.html
11-06-2021||India||Fishermen killings case: SC to close proceedings against Italian Marines||The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to close all proceedings in India against the Italian marines who killed two Indian fishermen off the coast of Kerala in 2012, saying it will pass the formal order on Tuesday next week. “We accept what you are proposing. We will pass our order on Tuesday,” said the bench of justices Indira Banerjee and MR Shah, after being informed that the compensation of ₹10 crore for the victims has been deposited in the registry of the top court. The bench also said that it was of the view that the compensation money should be transferred to the Kerala high court so that disbursement could be properly monitored and not frittered away. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Central government, accepted the court’s suggestion, so did the counsel for the Kerala government and the Republic of Italy. Also Read | Supreme Court amused by Centre’s zeal in Italian marines caseIn April, the Centre had informed the Supreme Court that the families of two Indian fishermen killed by Italian marines have been “adequately” compensated as it sought expeditious closure of proceedings before the top court and a criminal trial pending before a special court in Delhi. According to the Centre’s compliance affidavit dated January 5, which HT has reviewed, the Italian government offered to pay a total of ₹10 crore in damages. The families of the two deceased fishermen have agreed to a compensation of ₹4 crore each in addition to the ₹2 crore already paid by the Italian government. The injured owner of the boat had also consented to receiving damages of ₹2 crore. As per the affidavit, the Kerala government also accepted this proposal from the Italian government and the consent letters from the legal heirs of the deceased and the boat owner were sent to the foreign secretary in the ministry of external affairs. Mehta informed the bench headed by then Chief Justice of India SA Bobde that the victims’ families were paid the compensation, as ruled by an international tribunal in May 2020. However, on being informed that the compensation of ₹10 crore, as agreed upon by the Italian government, was yet to be disbursed to the families of the slain fishermen and the injured boat owner, the top court asked Italy first to deposit the money with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). The bench added that the MEA will subsequently deposit the compensation in the Supreme Court for releasing it to the victims as it deferred the hearing to a future date. The case pending before the Supreme Court is an appeal filed by the two marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, against a May 2012 judgment of the Kerala high court, which held that Kerala had jurisdiction to try them. The high court ruled that the marines enjoyed no state immunity since their act of shooting at the fishermen was in defence of neither the vessel nor the state. Also Read | Italy has assured to prosecute marines for killing Indian fishermen: CentreThe marines and the Italian government moved an appeal before the top court, which shifted the trial to a special court in Delhi in 2013 where it went on till the Supreme Court stayed it in 2015 after taking note of proceedings pending before the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at the Hague, Netherlands. In the meantime, the marines were allowed to go back home on a personal undertaking by the Italian ambassador that they would come back as and when required. The arbitral proceedings before the PCA were instituted under the United Nations Convention on Law of Seas (UNCLOS) on June 26, 2015 after Italy served a notice on India under the UNCLOS. The UNCLOS is an international agreement that defines the rights and responsibilities of nations with regard to their conduct and use of world seas and oceans and management of natural marine resources. In May 2020, the international tribunal ruled that the marines enjoyed immunity since they were exercising official functions in their capacity as Italian state officials when the incident occurred. It, therefore, ordered India to stop criminal proceedings against them. At the same time, the tribunal also held that Italy had violated India’s right to navigation by firing at the fishing boat and said that the country would have to compensate India for loss of life and damage to property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fishermen-killings-case-sc-to-close-proceedings-against-italian-marines-101623392425397.html

Here's what we know so far||Covaxin, Bharat Biotech's India-made vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), was not given approval for emergency use in the United States by the country's top public health regulator -- the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Rejecting Covaxin's application for emergency use authorisation in the US, the FDA sought more data on the clinical trials for the vaccine, the complete extent of which is still lacking.

Govt answersThe FDA rejected Bharat Biotech's proposal for emergency use approval of Covaxin, the Covid-19 vaccine, in the US because the company submitted partial trial data from March this year. According to an official statement, the FDA has asked Ocugen to submit additional trial data so that it can file for a Biologics Licence Application (BLA), which is a full approval, instead of the emergency use approval.Revising its guidelines for emergency use authorisation, the US FDA earlier said that it will entertain no such new requests. Despite this, Ocugen remained hopeful last month that its Covaxin proposal would be considered by the FDA due to a series of discussions since late last year, the company informed its investors in a May 26 statement. "We believe that the FDA's new guidance confirms that Ocugen continues to meet all criteria for the submission of a EUA," the statement read.Covaxin's lack of Phase-3 trial dataBharat Biotech, which is currently carrying out the Phase-3 clinical trials for Covaxin, informed news agency ANI on Wednesday that it will make the data public during July, following which the company will be applying for full licensure of the Covid-19 vaccine. "Once data from the final analysis of phase III studies are available, Bharat Biotech will apply for full licensure for Covaxin,” Bharat Biotech told the news agency.Bharat Biotech added that Phase-4 trials are also being done to check the "real-world effectiveness" of the vaccines" and to meet scientifically approved standards for safety and efficacy.Covaxin's faces hurdle with foreign approvalBharat Biotech's Covaxin Covid-19 vaccine has been facing hurdles gaining foreign approvals since the Phase 3 trial data is essential for validation from the World Health Organization (WHO), which will allow the Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company to export its Covid-19 vaccine and make it a part of the much-coveted "vaccine passport".Also Read: Covaxin efficacy 78% in Phase 3 analysisHowever, without the Phase 3 trial data, Covaxin has been facing remains unapproved in several countries, where it is failing to gain access in strictly regulated markets. At a time when authorisation from top health regulators at the US, the European Union, or the WHO is needed for a vaccine to cross borders, the India-made Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin remains unrecognised, as some foreign countries are even considering Indian students vaccinated with Covaxin as "unvaccinated". "We are aware that Bharat Biotech has sought the WHO emergency-use listing for Covaxin. We hope that the process of getting this approval is completed at an early date," said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi at an online briefing on Thursday, speaking on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-was-bharat-biotech-s-covaxin-covid-19-vaccine-not-approved-in-us-here-s-what-we-know-so-far-101623387176530.html

11-06-2021||India||IIT Kharagpur researchers say their technique can detect cyclones much in advance||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur and Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research in China have developed a technique that can detect the forming of cyclone in the North Indian Ocean region much in advance. “Before they are picked up by the weather satellites orbiting the Earth,” the researchers claimed.“Basically eddies are disturbances that we find in the atmospheric column where the cyclone initiates. A cyclone is first formed 7-8 kilometres in the upper atmosphere. The instability in the higher atmosphere leads to eddies that are weather instabilities. So, we found that pre-cyclonic eddies form in the atmosphere and after they grow they start migrating up and down. However, this detection was possible only after the system developed as a well-marked low-pressure system over the warm ocean surface. Our study can detect a possible cyclone from the time the eddy is formed,” said Prasad K Bhaskaran, IIT Kharagpur.The study conducted under the Climate Change Program with support from the Centre’s Department of Science and Technology, and published in the journal Atmospheric Research, identified pre-cyclonic eddy in the upper atmosphere before they turned into depression and subsequently into cyclonic storms.The research team, comprising Prasad K Bhaskaran and Jia Albert of IIT Kharagpur and Bishnupriya Sahu of Yantai Institute of Coastal Zone Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yantai, China, claimed that it can detect at least 90 hours before the weather satellites pick up the data from the ocean surface.The research team which analysed four post-monsoon severe cyclones — Phailin (2013), Vardah (2013), Gaja (2018), Madi (2013) - and two pre-monsoon cyclones Mora (2017) and Aila (2009) that developed over the North Indian Ocean, came out with a threshold value of a parameter called Okubo-Weiss Zeta Parameter. “When the parameter crossed the threshold value, it resulted in the formation of a cyclone,” he said.Bhaskaran said once the satellites detect the depression, then weather agencies like the India Meteorological Department (IMD) run the weather models predicting the cyclone’s landfall. “The model that we have developed gives a larger time gap between the detection and the cyclone’s landfall that would help in evacuation activities. Currently, cyclones take anything between 5 and 7 days between their formation and landfall. Our model would give 4 days of additional lead time to governments in preparing for the cyclones and save lives,” he said.The research team found that the bottom of the oceans are getting much warmers and this could lead to stronger cyclones in the future. “Warm ocean temperatures are what fuel cyclones. With ocean temperature, 500 metres below the surface, warmer than what it is on top, we expect the cyclones to be much more intense. Earlier, most cyclones were formed in the Bay of Bengal. Now the Arabian Sea is going to be the breeding place of stronger cyclones,” the team found out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-kharagpur-researchers-say-their-technique-can-detect-cyclones-much-in-advance-101623391705047.html

Why experts suggest this||The Union health ministry's latest guideline said those who tested Covid positive should wait for three months after recovery to get vaccinated, as they have natural antibodies present. However, a group of public health experts, which includes doctors from AIIMS and the members of Covid-19 national task force, has suggested that there is no need to vaccinate people who had documented Covid-19 infection.Do Covid-infected people not require vaccination? Here is what we know> In the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, there have been instances of reinfections. AIIMS Delhi has conducted a study on breakthrough infection — infections after partial or full vaccination — which reveals that vaccination stops the reinfection to become severe, but it does not guarantee protection from reinfection.> A Lancet study on reinfection has said the risk of reinfection gets reduced for up to 10 months following the first infection. The study conducted by the researchers from the University College London is based on antibody testing of people who are previously infected and those who are not. The study was conducted in the UK> According to the Indian experts' report, there is not enough evidence that vaccine is beneficial after natural infection. "There is no need to vaccinate people who had documented Covid-19 infection. These people may be vaccinated after generating evidence that vaccine is beneficial after natural infection," the report said.> As the objective of the vaccination drive should be to control the disease, those who have been already infected should not be the priority, as they are naturally protected, the report suggested.> Is the suggestion of keeping once-infected people out of vaccination for now influenced by vaccine crunch? Yes, the report clarified that the present situation of the pandemic in the country demands that prioritisation instead of opening it to all. "Moreover, we can conserve considerable resources if we exclude adults who have recovered from natural infection," it said.Here are the other vaccine-related suggestions of the expert group> Vaccination strategy should be guided by repeated, local, real-time serosurveys to map the vulnerability at the district level.> More research on reinfection, infection among vaccinated and non-vaccinated people. Such cohorts should be followed up for a long period for better findings.> Unplanned vaccination can trigger mutant strains, the experts said, referring to vaccination of age groups, which are not yet supported by evidence.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-no-need-to-vaccinate-people-once-infected-by-covid-why-experts-suggest-this-101623389249657.html

He said on Twitter the UP administration reduced the daily Covid-19 case count by 93% within five weeks. He also praised the decision to vaccinate parents of children below 12 years of age and said it a wise move amid apprehension that children may be affected more in the probable third wave of the pandemic.However, the central leadership has ruled out any change in state leadership, throwing their weight behind the Yogi Adityanath administration. It has also ruled out any change in the BJP’s organisational structure and said any change to the council of ministers would be carried out following consultation with the chief minister.The Uttar Pradesh assembly elections are scheduled to take place in 2022. The BJP stormed back to power in the state in the 2017 assembly polls.

(SPL) for the process technology transfer and manufacture of the anti-Covid drug Molnupiravir. The new agreement comes days after the Hyderabad-based CSIR-IICT entered into a similar MoU with Lee Pharma on process technology transfer and the manufacture of Covid-19 drug 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose (2-DG).The anti-viral drug Molnupiravir, now meant to fight Covid-19, was initially developed for the treatment of influenza but has since been repurposed. CSIR-IICT said Molnupiravir can completely suppress Covid-19 virus transmission within 24 hours, citing a study published in the research journal 'Nature Microbiology'. With such a rapid means of tackling the SARS-Cov-2 virus transmission, anti-Covid drug Molnupiravir can be a complete gamechanger in India's fight against the coronavirus disease pandemic, said the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology.A press release issued by the CSIR-IICT detailed how the synthetic process know-how for Molnupiravir was sourced from CSIR-NIIST and the process to scale it up was successfully carried out by CSIR-IICT. It said that the complete technology know-how will be transferred to SPL and the company, would in turn manufacture and launch the anti-viral drug Molnupiravir in the market as an effective medication for patients affected with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). CSIR-IICT would also provide the process know-how for the manufacture of new anti-Covid drug 2 -DG to treat moderate and severe Covid-19 infected patients to reduce their oxygen dependency, as per the agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/csiriict-ties-up-with-suven-pharma-for-new-anti-covid-drug-molnupiravir-101623385235875.html

11-06-2021||India||New moon tide to hit today, coastal districts of Bengal on alert||The West Bengal government has alerted three coastal districts of East Midnapore, North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas, as the perigean tide, coinciding with the new moon today, could send saline water from the sea again into some of the villages, inundating the low-lying areas.The tide is expected to hit around 10am on Friday. According to the forecast of the Kolkata Port Trust, the water level may reach up to 5.1m at Sagar, located at the confluence of river Hooghly and the Bay of Bengal.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier said that at least 20,000 people were to be evacuated from two islands – Sagar and Mousuni – where breaches in the embankments, caused by Cyclone Yaas on May 26, were yet to be repaired. Also Watch | Revealed: What Mamata Banerjee, Rakesh Tikait discussed in meet “We are all prepared. Villagers have been alerted. A few thousand people from some low-lying areas have been evacuated and shifted to relief camps. Most of the vulnerable and damaged portions of the embankments have been strengthened and repaired,” said Bankim Chandra Hazra, Sunderban affairs minister. Cyclone Yaas, which coincided with the perigean spring tide on May 26, inflicted heavy damage to the river embankments in the Sunderbans, flooding several villages. Many are still inundated under a few feet of water. Over and above this, a low pressure has developed in the Bay of Bengal which may trigger rain. Monsoon is also likely to hit anytime. In Kolkata too, the city’s civic body and police are on alert as river water may enter some of the low-lying areas, located along the banks of river Hooghly and the Tolly Canal. At Garden Reach near Kolkata, the tide height may hit 5.38m in the afternoon. “The Kolkata municipal corporation and Kolkata police have taken all steps. School buildings have been kept open so that, if necessary, we can shift some of the slum dwellers from the low-lying areas. Pumps have been kept ready so that water can be drained out. The lock gates have been closed so that river water doesn’t enter when the water level rises,” said Firhad Hakim, state minister. Officials, however, said another perigean tide that coincides with the full moon would hit around June 25 – 26. The height of the water would rise further during that tide. At Sagar, it may reach up to 5.67m. “Such tides are nothing new but this time we are concerned because Cyclone Yaas has left breaches in the embankments through which the water may enter the villages,” said an official of the disaster management department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-moon-tide-to-hit-today-coastal-districts-of-bengal-on-alert-101623385284242.html
