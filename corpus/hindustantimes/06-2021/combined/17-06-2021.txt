Manjit confirms that she never underwent radiotherapy (RT) or chemotherapy and only surgeries were performed. Oncologists say it is a matter of investigation how a patient does not require any other chemo/RT or tablets (as for blood cancer patients) for a disease that spreads very fast in the body. The story of the woman had invited a sympathetic reaction on social media after a section of the media reported the alleged inability of the family to pursue her treatment. People have started sending in money, confirms the family.Bathinda civil surgeon Dr TS Dhillon said a panel, comprising a gynecologist, surgeon and a physician, examined the patient on Wednesday and several tests were conducted.“Since Manjit could not produce any document of her stated treatment, the health department decided to get her examined medically. She could not even tell in which organ the malignancy was treated. Reports of mammography, ultrasound and X-ray were found normal. Pap smear report is expected to come later this week,” said Dhillon.He clarified that Manjit’s malignancy in the past, if any, cannot be determined on the basis of her recent tests. “It is to be examined if the stated surgeries were related to the removal of benign cysts or fibroids in the breast or uterus or other ailments,” said Dhillon.After her story surfaced on news channels on Sunday, district administration rushed a team to the village the next day. Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said the health department was directed to get her examined and assure treatment at Bathinda-based Advanced Cancer Institute (ACI).The woman’s father, Major Singh, a casual labourer, said he needs ₹3 lakh for Manjit’s surgery at a Jaipur hospital, the name of which the family could not recollect.“About ₹25 lakh has been spent on my daughter’s treatment. We deserve support else I will have to sell my house. My ailing son does not earn enough for our family of seven persons,” he said. Sarpanch of Mehma Sarja Kulwinder Singh said the family never approached the panchayat for any financial support. “I do not know if Manjit was living with her father. No one from the family approached me for a travel pass since strict travel restrictions were issued after the Covid-19 outbreak since March last year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tests-find-no-trace-of-cancer-in-bathinda-woman-who-claimed-father-put-up-house-for-sale-for-treatment-101623954020179.html

Jaswant Saini, 51, an old party hand, who was the vice chairman of the Uttar Pradesh State Commission for Backward Classes, was made chairman of the crucial body, an appointment that came a day after the party revamped the state-owned SC/ST commission and accommodated 25 more cadres on Wednesday. “We will work towards ending exploitation of backwards,” said Saini who has served in various capacities in the BJP and hails from Saharanpur. He said there were about 7,000 complaints that the commission had received since the BJP came to power in the state and added that half of them had been addressed. “These are markedly less than what used to be the case earlier,” Saini said referring to previous non-BJP governments. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath congratulated Saini on his elevation to the Uttar Pradesh state commission for backward classes that was set up in 1993 and has since received variety of complaints, mostly pertaining to reservation in jobs, in educational institutions and of police harassment among many others. Two vice chairmen, Heera Thakur, who shifted from the BSP to BJP and Prabhunath Chauhan from Ghazipur also made it to the backward body along with 22 members, mostly BJP hands. Some BJP men indicated that some allies like Apna Dal and Nishad party too might have found some representation though there was no confirmation on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-revamps-backward-classes-commission-101623953959246.html

The reason: these villages are not covered under the canal irrigation system.A little digging into history reveals that in the 1880s when canal irrigation was being developed in Punjab, the then Nawab of the princely state had “refused to provide land” for the project, the ripple effects of which are being felt now in these villages.Adding to their woes is the fact that the government has stopped issuing new tubewell connections here due to the dark zone tag.“We don’t get a single drop of canal water in our villages. Successive governments did nothing to bring our village into the canal irrigation system,” says Ravinder Singh, a Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) leader from Kasampur.As per information, land was acquired in Jhaner, Manki, Sandaur and Panj Garai villages in 1986 to develop canal irrigation system and the compensation against the acquired land was also paid to the farmers but the project never took off. In 2014, the then deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal laid the foundation stone for renovation of Kanganwal and Rohira distributors, at a cost of about ₹25 crore, to consolidate and increase the capacity of canal irrigation in Malerkotla and Amargarh areas but these too met the same fate.“Almost all villages in Malerkotla are dependent on tubewells for irrigation.Our repeated requests to develop canal irrigation system fell on deaf ears,” said Major Singh (55), a former sarpanch of Burj village.A former additional deputy commissioner (development) and resident of the area, Bahadur Singh, who raised the issue with the previous Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party government, said, “The Malerkotla Nawab had refused to give land, construction cost and royalty to the private company which developed the canal irrigation system. It was a big mistake.”Sangrur chief agriculture officer Jaswinderpal Singh Grewal, who caters to the Malerkotla area, said, “Canal water is a boon for crops. It is all the more important as several blocks of Sangrur, Barnala and Malerkotla are in the dark zone and extracting groundwater through tubewells will only aggravate the problem,” added Grewal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/a-royal-mistake-that-deprives-60-malerkotla-villages-of-canal-water-101623953899747.html

Ajit Deshmukh, deputy commissioner, Solid Waste Management, PMC, said, “We are collecting and disposing of garbage within the city limits. In certain villages not part of the PMC yet, garbage is the responsibility of the gram panchayat.”“The problem is that garbage is being dumped in non- habituated areas along the highways and roads, which either belong to the PWD, forest department or to NHAI. Although these public spaces are not under the gram panchayat, they have been cleaning up the areas. Tt is difficult to catch the perpetrators who are constantly dumping garbage,” Deshmukh added. Residents have raised this issue. “Piles of garbage are lying on the path leading to the forest ahead of Naren Hills, opposite Anandvan. Is this PMC’s idea of Swachh Pune, Sundar Pune? Literally all kinds of rubbish is being dumped here,” said a resident of Kondhwa, who asked not to be named.National Society for Clean Cities (NSCC) member Maithily Manakwad said, “The road connecting Krishnanagar, which falls in Hadapsar ward, probably needs a camera. It will help us catch those littering.”She added, “NSCC from the very beginning has been insisting that the responsibility of door-t-door collection lies with PMC. If the citizens get their garbage collected from their doorsteps, why would they throw it on the roadsides?”ZP has been working on a programme launched in June 2021, where gram panchayats will be provided with ₹150 crore to set up garbage treatment plants. For now though, key roads on the outskirts of the city are littered with garbage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/key-roads-on-outskirts-of-the-city-littered-with-garbage-101623953839338.html

As it is situated within in the blue line of the riverbed, there have been restrictions on development. Kumar has now promised a final sanction at the earliest. Former deputy mayor Siddhartha Dhende was also present during the visit, along with representatives from both the communities.The property is located on survey number 115.Commissioner Kumar said that a special meeting with government officials will be held in Mumbai, seeking permission for the graveyard and following that, the site will be developed.Dhende said, “The total population of Wadgaonsheri is 0.750 million, and Muslims and Christians together account for 0.150 million in the area. The Muslims have two graveyards in Yerawada and the Christians have one cemetery here. Often, Christians have to go as far as Hadapsar to bury their dead. The areas of Tingarenagar, Kalas, Viman nagar, Lohegaon, Kharadi, Wagholi, Vishrantwadi, Dighi, Mhaskevasti and Dhanori, have shown a significant increase in population of minorities. Since 2001, citizens have been agitating for their graveyard here.”“In the 2011 , the revised PMC development plan (DP) has the graveyard on the map. However, the area is in the blue line of the riverbed.

Afraid of going to their fields, they have demanded that the felines be caught to immediately and relocated deep into the jungle. Pawati, Jhadina and Nayagaon villages are situated close to the boundary of Hastinapur wildlife Sanctuary in Garh tesil of Hapur. A resident of Pawati spotted a leopard while he was returning to the village on Sunday night. The leopard killed a rabbit on the muddy road and the villager made a video of the incident on his mobile. He shared the incident with other villagers which made them aware about the presence of the leopard in their vicinity. The next day (Monday), villagers spotted a family of leopards in the jungle of Jhadina village. On Wednesday, reports of their presence in the neighbouring Nayagaon also surfaced. The leopard sightings in the area scared the villagers and farmers avoided going to their fields. Sripal Choudhary of Pawati shared that farmers initially avoided going to their fields but now they moved in a group of 4 or 5 so that some of them could keep a watch during work. “People are scared and demanding that the catch animals be caught,” said Choudhary. Range officer of Garh forest range Mohan Bisht said that the foresters spotted a family of leopards in the jungle of Jhadina village and were carrying out intensive combing in search of the animals. He advised the villagers to go to their fields in groups to ensure their safety and to not harm the animals because it may attract imprisonment of more than six years. Bisht said that a cage would be placed to trap the animal and his team was identifying a suitable location. “We are combing the area daily and have shared our contact numbers with villagers so that they inform us immediately after spotting the animals,” said Bisht who is hopeful of catching the leopards soon. Bhushan Tyagi of Jhadina anticipated that animals like leopards moved closer to villages because of less movement of villagers and farmers during lockdown of two months. “We may come across with similar incidents in other villages in coming days,” said Tyagi who believes that forest officials should be alert and government should provide them resources to minimize possible man- animal confrontation in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-scared-after-leopards-spotted-near-hapur-villages-101623953782520.html

However, this year, only 250 such pledges have come to us. Through this pledge, people who wish to donate their organs after their deaths can enrol with us.

Once you scan the QR code, it directly takes you to the website where form number 7 is. The volunteers have to simply fill in their details, like name, address, blood group and organs they wish to donate after their death,” said Gokhale.This data is then sent to the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO).“As soon as you fill in the details, ZTCC Pune sends in an auto generated email. Your donor card is emailed to you. You can save this card on your phone or print it out and carry it in your wallet,” said Gokhale.

Any other information via social media just increases anxiety,” said Dr Devashish Shukla, senior consultant (psychiatry) at Balrampur hospital. “Kids have already lost their natural lifestyle of going to school and playing outdoors for the one and a half years. The barrage of horrifying information is making them troubled. Many parents are calling up to know how to manage such kids,” said Dr Shukla. “Being cautious is all right but many parents over-react to the risk which is not correct. Parents should remember their behaviour impacts their kids, hence if they over-react their wards will have higher anxiety levels,” said Dr Adarsh Tripathi, senior faculty, department of psychiatry, the King George’s Medical University. Dr Pooja Mahour, an expert in child psychology and faculty at King George’s Medical University’s department of psychiatry said, “Unnecessary exposure can be avoided and various sources of information, including social media and even television, should be allowed only under parental supervision.” “The best way is to keep the kids well informed about Covid, related illness and prevention and restrict screen time or use of cell phones. But do not impede the natural inquisitiveness in the child,” said Dr BSK Chauhan, chief medical officer of Barabanki. Doctors said children should not be cut off from the internet. “Do not cut children from the outer world as they pick up new social and cognitive skills via internet also as they are not able to go out. But update them on what information is correct for them,” said Dr Vinod Jain, dean, paramedical sciences, at the King George’s Medical University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/keep-kids-away-from-too-much-info-on-covid-say-doctors-101623953359141.html

The incident took place around 2am but the family discovered the theft the next morning. The burglars reportedly also took the cash that Kala and his son had kept in their pockets. However, the weapon possessed by the family is safe as burglars were unable to find it. The family has a petdog but it did not bark, leading the police to suspect the burglars may have sedated the dog before entering the house on Sham Singh road.Kala told the police that due to some health issues, he normally wakes up in the middle of the night at least a couple of times but on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday, he didn’t wake up even once. Other family members also complained of minor headaches.According to sources, the burglars have decamped with ₹4 lakh cash, 150gm gold jewelry and other valuables. There are no closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in the house but the footage from cameras in the neighbourhood showed some persons scaling the wall to enter and exit the house. Kala lives with his wife, son and daughter-in-law in the house. They have employed a domestic help as well. Police are looking into the possible role of the domestic help. The incident brought major embarrassment to the police as the house is merely 50 metres away from the office of the Ludhiana police commissioner. Police officials too were reluctant to share details about the incident. Narinder Kumar Kala, who is himself a councillor from ward number 66 of Ludhiana, is yet to file a complaint. Sub-inspector Rajinderpal Singh, station house officer of Division number 8, said CCTVs caught some persons scaling the wall of the councillor’s house. “We are waiting for the family to provide details of the loss to lodge an FIR,” said the cop.Mamta Ashu, councillor and wife of cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, said they came to know about the incident on Thursday morning when they received a call from Kala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/burglars-sedate-minister-ashu-s-cousin-his-family-decamp-with-cash-jewellery-101623952999713.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi government resends file on its doorstep ration plan to L-G||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has sent the doorstep delivery of ration scheme file back to Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal, contending that its provisions are in accordance with the National Food Security Act, 2013, and that it will simultaneously ensure the implementation of the Centre’s “One Nation, One Ration Card” scheme.Kejriwal wrote a note to the L-G on Wednesday, in response to Baijal’s comments asking the CM to reconsider the proposal and seek the Centre’s approval citing an ongoing court case in the matter.The L-G’s office did not comment on the matter.In his note, Kejriwal said that every decision taken about on the scheme, since its first approval in the Delhi Cabinet in 2018, was communicated to the L-G, who did not express any difference of opinion till February this year. He cited at least five occasions over the past three years when the L-G was informed about the scheme and its modalities.“There appears to be a serious misunderstanding. The instant matter before the L-G is not ‘approval’ of the scheme of doorstep delivery of ration. The scheme has already attained finality,” said the note, which HT has seen.He said that it only was in March, when the Delhi government issued another notification changing the scheme’s name -- from Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna, as asked by the central government -- that the LG responded with his objections. “It is this new notification which is the subject of instant consideration. The LG has to decide whether he agrees with the new notification, removing objections of the central government. The whole scheme is not the subject of instant consideration,” Kejriwal said.This is the second time this year that the scheme has been stalled due to differences between the Delhi government and the Centre. The scheme was to be launched on March 25, but the Union food and consumer affairs ministry wrote to the Delhi government on March 19 raising two objections— the use of the term “mukhyamantri (chief minister)” for a scheme involving the distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and that any change in the delivery mechanism requires an amendment in NSFA that can be done only by Parliament.The Delhi government, on March 24, passed a Cabinet decision to remove the name “Mukhyamantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna” for the scheme and to implement doorstep delivery of ration as part of the existing NFS Act, 2013.Last Friday, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the plan was a false promise and a scam at the behest of the “ration mafia”, drawing a sharp response from Kejriwal, who accused the Centre of obstructing a public welfare initiative.The CM, in a three-point rebuttal to the Centre’s view that the Delhi government’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme is in contravention of NFSA, and that implementing it would dent the pan-India public distribution system. He said states such as Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, and cities such as Faridabad, Ambala and Karnal (all in Haryana) have already implemented the doorstep ration delivery model. He said state governments under section 12(I) are empowered to undertake “targeted public distribution system”, including introduction of new scheme to ensure that the food grain entitlements reach the targeted beneficiaries.“The central government, itself, through an order on February 1, 2018, directed states and Union territories to adopt a system of home delivery of food grains for persons above 65 years of age and differently abled persons. The scheme is squarely and indisputably within the ambit of NFSA and should not give rise to any concern on this front,” Kejriwal wrote to the LG.On the objection raised by the Centre that the Delhi government will make the beneficiaries pay an additional sum under the scheme, which is not in accordance with the NFSA, Kejriwal said the charge was in the manner prescribed by the central government. He said that any beneficiary who avails doorstep delivery of ration will have to pay ₹2 per kg only for processing the wheat into flour, and that this does not include services such as cleaning, packaging and transportation, and is based on a letter issued by the Union government’s department of food and public distribution on November 3, 2014.“Last year India ranked 94 out of 107 countries in the Global Hunger Index, whereas in 2019, we were ranked 102 out of 117 countries,” he said.Delhi currently has around 1.78 million ration card-holder households, which according to government records, translate to 7.2 million beneficiaries. Ration is currently distributed to them through a network of 2,000-odd fair price shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-government-resends-file-on-its-doorstep-ration-plan-to-l-g-101623952519059.html
17-06-2021||Lucknow||17 former SGPGI doctors awaiting retirement dues||About 17 doctors who served the Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) since its inception are allegedly running from pillar to post to get their gratuity and leave encashment for the last two years after retirement. The 17 retired doctors have written a letter to the Uttar Pradesh governor, who is also the visitor of the institute, to ensure fair treatment, considering their “outstanding record and dedication to the institute”.Dr KN Prasad, one of the 17 doctors waiting for gratuity, said, “We are extremely pained to inform you that even after working hard day and night for more than three decades, we, the retired faculty members of SGPGIMS, have been deprived of our retirement dues e.g. pension, commutation of pension, gratuity, leave encashment, etc even after several months to more than a year after our superannuation.”One of the retired faculty Dr TN Dhole has passed away and his wife is still waiting to get the money earned by him.“We have represented to the President SGPGIMS (chief secretary of UP) and sought an appointment with him but have not received any response. Now we have written to governor of the state for releasing our dues,” he added.He said, “The Governing Body decided the parity of SGPGIMS with AIIMS in 1997. The GO dated 10.3.2004 increased the retirement age of SGPGIMS faculty from 60 to 62 years-retirement benefits were not changed. Besides GO dated 12.6.2012 increased the retirement age of SGPGIMS faculty from 62 to 65 years, retirement benefits were not changed. As per GOs with regard to pay scales, NPA, allowances etc as were applicable at AIIMS-New Delhi were made applicable to the faculty members of SGPGIMS Lucknow. The rules clearly mention that faculty members at AIIMS who retire at 65 years get gratuity of maximum ₹20 lakh, 40% commutation of pension and leave encashment. which we are denied here in PGI.”Another retired faculty member said, “Before 2018, all retiring faculty members were getting their retirement dues i.e. pension, commutation of pension, family pension, gratuity, leave encashment, etc. at par with AIIMS, New Delhi within a very reasonable time after their retirement. However, for the last about two years, this practice was surprisingly interrupted, and the release of various retirement dues of faculty members was delayed causing stress and anxiety to not only us who have retired but also to those who are due to retire in the near future.”Dr AK Shukla, former faculty of SGPGI, said, “This imbroglio needs personal intervention from the visitor of institute (governor) to resolve this long- pending matter and release all our pending retirement dues, including pension, commutation of pension, family pension, gratuity, leave encashment, etc as per the Seventh Pay Commission and as prevalent at AIIMS-New Delhi to all those who have already retired.”Have sent proposal to state govt: PGI directorWhen contacted, SGPGIMS director professor Radha Krishna Dhiman said, “I have recommended parity for retired doctors and sent the proposal to the state government for further action. However, the state government has some issues about parity with AIIMS for those retiring at 65 years of age. The issue would be amicably sorted out soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/17-former-sgpgi-doctors-awaiting-retirement-dues-101623952459808.html
17-06-2021||Other||PSPCL told to run own plants before drawing power from northern grid||Patiala The Northern Regional Load Despatch Centre (NRLDC), the apex body to ensure integrated operation of power system in the northern region, has warned the Punjab State Power Corporation (PSPCL) against drawing the maximum limit of power from the northern grid, without running its own thermal units at Ropar and Lehra Mohabbat.For the past fortnight, Punjab has shut its own power plants and is drawing power from the grid. This power is available at half of the state’s generation cost. Punjab has been generating around 4,500 MW, but is drawing almost 7,000 MW from the grid. The generation cost is higher due to fixed charges for setting up a plant, and variable charges for coal. From the grid, Punjab is getting power at an average rate of ₹2.9 per unit, while its own production cost is above ₹4.“With negligible generation at PSPCL’s own thermal unit, there is an imbalance in Punjab’s transmission system, and overloading in certain pockets of the state. Punjab’s buying so much power also violates NRLDC instructions,” reads the letter from chief engineer, State Load Dispatch Centre (SLDC) to chief engineer, power purchase and regulations, at PSPCL. The letter adds, “According to load conditions in Ludhiana and Gobindgarh areas, thermal units at Ropar need to be given priority for proper balancing of the state’s generation and reliable operation of Punjab’s power system. NRLDC has objected twice over Punjab’s policy.”The letter also clarifies that the available transfer capacity of between 7,300 MW and 7,900 MW was subject to the condition that all its thermal units, especially 220 KV level generation at Ropar thermal and Lehra Mohabbat thermal and GVK Goindwal, are running at full load.Acting on the letter, PSPCL has asked GVK Goindwal to light up both its units, while two of four units from Ropar thermal plant will be made operational soon. The Lehra Mohabbat plant has been also started by lighting up one unit to generate 150 MW power. SLDC chief engineer has also asked Punjab to adhere to NRLDC guidelines. “The state must ensure proper balancing of state generation, with inter-state import of power,” he adds in the letter. PSPCL director (generation) Paramjeet Singh said that because of storm, some power plants had been shut down. “We have started all plants in Punjab and will ramp up generation, as the load increases,” he said, adding that the state was committed to meet all NRLDC requirements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pspcl-told-to-run-own-plants-before-drawing-power-from-northern-grid-101623952343106.html

And this despite that this age group was included in inoculation drive after many rounds for senior citizens, people over 45 years, healthcare workers and frontline workers. Till date, as many as 829,388 persons have taken their first dose of vaccine against Covid-19, while 113,273 have taken both their shots,” said district magistrate Suhas L Y.On whether this meant that the vulnerable group, 45+ years, were being left out, the DM said that 114,000 people from this group had got both their shots.“Till date, exclusive vaccination sites for 45+ age have seen good turnout. We are working to ensure providing at least one dose of vaccination to everyone till July 31. The cause of higher turnout in the 18-45 age group is because they comprise nearly 55% of the district’s population eligible for inoculation,” he said.The district administration has also chalked out plans to inoculate the 1.6 million eligible population at least once by the end of July this year. The state government had earlier ordered all districts to start inoculating 1 million people every day beginning July 1.The DM also said this will begin with a mega vaccination drive in Dadri and Jewar blocks from June 21.“Each block will be divided into 10 sectors – from where the dedicated health officials will keep a tab on the speed of vaccination in those areas,” he said.Chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri, said that a total of 62,994 cases have been recorded in the district so far, and the recovery rate has now crossed 99% with 62,379 recoveries out of it.“After a security and fire safety solutions firm put lakhs of residents of the district at risk of contracting the virus in April last year, we were left with no solutions on how to make them safe. But, timely tracking, testing and treating the patients finally brought out desirable results. It was really a commendable effort of our teams of doctors and health workers, we put all areas under strict surveillance and started massive testing, particularly in critical areas. We’ve so far tested 1,245,470 samples in the district. Now, while our recovery rate is over 99%, the fatality rate is nearly 0.74%,” the CMO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/over-50-of-total-jabs-go-to-18-45-category-in-noida-101623952341600.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||Six, including husband-wife, held for selling infant to childless couple||On Wednesday night, when a Delhi police team alerted their counterparts in Uttar Pradesh (UP) police about a couple who had allegedly kidnapped a six-day old infant and was on their way to Bihar on board the Swatantrata Senani Express, the UP police team hurriedly reached the station before 2.30 am and waited for the train to arrive. Delhi Police had informed officials of the Harbans Mohal police station in UP’s Kanpur that the train was scheduled to reach the Kanpur railway station at 2.30 am, according to the Indian Railway’s train tracking system. At the station, the UP police team traced the couple, Vidyanand Yadav (50) and his wife, Rampari Devi (45), and the infant, and took them to the local police station. “As soon as we received the information from the UP police, our teams quickly went to Kanpur. But when we met the couple, they denied kidnapping him. They said they had bought the infant after paying money. It was surprising. They also had what they said was an agreement letter. We were treating this as a kidnapping case,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur. On Thursday afternoon, Thakur said they arrested six persons including the infant’s biological parents for allegedly selling their child, and two men for reportedly mediating the deal with the second couple for buying the infant. Explaining the sequence of events, police said that on Tuesday evening, the police control room received a distress call from a couple Govind Kumar (30), and his wife Pooja Devi (22), who alleged that their infant child had been kidnapped by a relative named Haripal Singh (50). The couple said Haripal had come to her house to stay for a few days and kidnapped him on the morning of June 15. Police now suspect that the couple filed a false case and also gave misleading information to the control room. Govind and his wife Pooja, who work as labourers, had many discrepancies in their statement, police said. “Maybe the mother had a change of heart after selling the child. The couple told us about Haripal’s house in Aya Nagar but they did not know the exact house number. When we caught Haripal, he told us that the couple had in fact sold the child for a sum of ₹3.6 lakh. Haripal knew a man named Raman Yadav, who was looking to buy child for his relatives Vidyanand and Rampari. Vidyanand and Rampari were married for over 25 years but did not have any children,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, Harsh Vardhan. During investigation police found that the infant was born at a Gurugram hospital on June 8, after which the infant and his mother was discharged on June 10. Police learnt that all the six people involved in the case, had met at Haripal’s house in Aya Nagar. “As decided, the infant’s parents were paid ₹2 lakh in cash. An agreement was also signed between the two couples and four cheques of ₹60,000 each were handed to Govind and Pooja. Maybe they had a change of heart and then called the police with the fake complaint after three days,” the additional DCP said. The child was produced before a Child Welfare Committee, which sent the infant to a children’s home in south east Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/six-including-husband-wife-held-for-selling-infant-to-childless-couple-101623952340928.html
17-06-2021||Noida||11 hospitals in GB Nagar denotified as Covid facilities||Noida: With just 148 active cases in the Gautam Budh Nagar, the chief medical officer on Thursday de-notified 11 hospitals as Covid hospitals. This leaves the district with 18 Covid hospitals with about 100 patients still admitted.The denotified hospitals are- Kailash Hospital’s branches in Sectors 27 and 71, Jewar and Greater Noida; ESI Hospital in Sector 24, Sharma Medicare Hospital, JR Hospital and Sanjeevani Hospital in Greater Noida; and IndoGulf Hospital in Sector 19“The hospitals have been denotified as per the beds availability and the number of positive cases coming here. The number of beds reserved for Covid at some hospitals have also been reduced,” said Dr Sunil Dohare, district surveillance officer, GB Nagar.The number of Covid beds at Metro Hospital in Sector 11 have been reduced from 150 to 25 and at Fortis Hospital they have been reduced from 150 to 20.“GB Nagar now has 3337 Covid beds across 18 hospitals of which 7 hospitals are government-run and 11 are private.

17-06-2021||Noida||Muslim man assaulted: New video of victim before thrashing incident emerges, cops make more arrests||The Ghaziabad incident in which a 72-year-old man was assaulted and his beard cut off has turned murkier with the emergence of a new video, which suggests that the victim knew his attackers. Police said their investigation found inconsistencies in the victim’s statement and the root of the matter was a monetary dispute between two groups.Police have so far arrested nine people in the incident. The main actors in the case, they said, were Pravesh Gujjar of Loni, in whose house the assault took place, Intezar, the victim Abdul Samad and local politician Ummed Pehalwan.Police said Intezar owed Gujjar money.“Samad used to sell amulets that were claimed to have magical powers. Intezar hoped to use Samad’s help to influence Gujjar. He sent Samad to Gujjar’s house with his brother-in-law Saddam on a scooter on June 5,” said a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named. “But Gujjar was wise to Samad’s act and forced him to confess on video that he was there at Intezar’s behest.”HT has seen the video, in which Samad is seen with his beard intact, but cannot independently verify its authenticity. The officer quoted above said later, Gujjar called Intezar to his home and confronted him with the video. “Cornered, Intezar turned on Samad and the two groups assaulted him, and a man named Kallu Gujjar cut off Samad’s beard,” he said.The video of the assault, with its audio overwritten with music, went viral online on Monday and allegations were raised that the victim was forced to chant “Jai Siya Ram”. Police said Samad had got an FIR lodged on June 7 at the Loni police station, in which he had stated that he did not know his attackers. The FIR also stated that the victim was abducted from Loni in an autorickshaw by the driver and a few fellow passengers. On Thursday, police arrested Intezaar and Saddam, and four other persons who they identified by their first names as Himanshu, Anas, Babu and Shavez. “We have call records that showed that Intezar, Gujjar and Samad were in touch for a long time, including on June 5,” said Atul Kumar Sonkar, circle officer of Loni.Meanwhile, another video surfaced on Thursday in which Saddam is purportedly heard saying, “I took Samad to Gujjar’s house. Gujjar called more people when he came to know that Intezar had roped him (Samad) in.... Thereafter, Samad was thrashed. I was at Gujjar’s house during the incident, and it was Kallu Gujjar who chopped off the beard.” HT cannot vouch for the authenticity of the videoGujjar was arrested earlier as part of a June 10 extortion case that Intezar had lodged against him. Gujjar has since been in judicial custody.“We will seek his police custody now as he is yet to be questioned in connection with the assault case,” said Sonkar.The “Jai Siya Ram” allegation was raised by Samad during a live video with politician Pehalwan on June 7. Police said this led to the incident being labelled “communal”.Since then, police lodged three more FIRs -- one against Twitter, the platform where the video was shared, a second one against journalists who shared it, and one against Pehalwan.Samad’s family maintains that he was not into selling amulets and that he did not know the suspects.Samad’s son Babbu said, “Once my father recovers from his injuries, we will talk about the details and controversies. We do not have a copy of Pehalwan’s video. We have nothing to say about the claims and counterclaims.”On Thursday, the Bulandshahr police also registered an FIR against five identified persons and about 90-100 unidentified people for violating the Covid-19 curfew protocols during Pehalwan’s live video.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/muslim-man-assaulted-new-video-of-victim-before-thrashing-incident-emerges-cops-make-more-arrests-101623952220944.html
17-06-2021||Other||CBSE should have cancelled Class 12 exams before Supreme Court’s intervention: Sisodia||New Delhi Hours after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced the alternative assessment policy for Class 12 students on Thursday, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said the Centre should not have waited for the Supreme Court’s intervention to cancel the Class 12 board exams. He also urged the Centre to start working on the criteria to assess students next year. The CBSE on Thursday informed the Supreme Court that it will evaluate Class 12 students based on a formula giving 30% weightage each to results of classes 10 and 11, and 40% to Class 12 pre-board exams. Last week, Sisodia wrote to the Union education ministry suggesting a similar formula.In a statement issued by his office on Thursday, Sisodia said, “The decision to cancel the board exams was a welcome one, keeping in mind the safety and security of our 1.5 crore Class 12 students. The evaluation criteria which we had suggested, looking at the performance of students in classes 10, 11 and 12 has been taken into account. We should have considered cancelling the board exams a long time back, instead of waiting for the Supreme Court to intervene in the matter. It is unfortunate that the Supreme Court and the state governments had to intervene and protest to cancel the board exams. If our central government had adopted a more humane approach and heard the plea of our students, we could have managed the situation better. Nevertheless, I am happy that this decision was finally taken in the interest of our students.”Stressing on the need to adopt similar or improved criteria for next year, Sisodia said, “While we have made detailed evaluation criteria for this year’s board exams owing to these unprecedented conditions, similarly, we have to look at developing criteria for assessing students in the board classes next year. We cannot think that normal conditions will prevail anytime soon.”“To avoid another situation next year, where we have to rush and take decisions with regard to conduct of the board exams, we should already start developing a plan taking into account online exams and the modalities to conduct assessments and projects if schools have to open partially,” he added.The education minister said that he hopes the Centre is also preparing alternatives for entrance exams as well. “College admissions will be conducted based on the mark sheets of students at the end of July, put together by the CBSE. As far as the entrance examinations are concerned, I am sure certain alternatives will be prepared for them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbse-should-have-cancelled-class-12-exams-before-supreme-court-s-intervention-sisodia-101623952220224.html
17-06-2021||Other||Schools welcome CBSE formula, few raise concern over inclusion of class 11 score||Most schools in the national capital called the CBSE’s Class 12 results formula “student-friendly”, even as some institutions flagged concerns over including the Class 11 scores in the criteria, arguing that the jump from Class 10 often results in students scoring poorly in the first set of exams.According to a formula submitted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in the Supreme Court on Thursday and notified later that evening, the board will accord 30% weightage each to the Class 10 and 11 scores, and 40% weightage to the Class 12 scores. The Class 10 marks considered will be the average of the best three performing subjects out of the main five subjects in theory exams. The Class 11 marks taken will be of the theory component of the final exams, and in the case of the Class 12 scores, marks will be allotted on the basis of unit tests, or mid-term or pre-board exams, as schools find convenient. These theory marks will be added to the practical or internal assessment marks schools as provided by the schools.The heads of several private and public schools said the formula is the best possible choice, out of the “limited choices” available amid the pandemic.Ashok Pandey, director of Ahlcon Schools in Delhi, said, “Few options were available to assess Class 12 students without actually conducting exams. It was also not justifiable to evaluate students only based on the Class 12 internal exams or pre-boards.”The class 12 exams were cancelled on June 1, more than a month after class 10 exams were cancelled on April 14.For Class 10 — which follows a complicated assessment system based on internal test scores and a detailed moderation policy — the board asked its schools to submit compiled marks by June 30.Ameeta Wattal, principal of Springdales School on Pusa Road, said it was vital to consider students’ Class 10 and 11 performances. “The Board conducted the Class 10 exams and evaluated the results externally. For Class 11, most schools finished their final exams before Covid-19 hit the country. Besides, Class 12 remained completely online. This formula comprises a perfect hybrid of online and offline learning. This gives a good understanding of the fact if children had a good idea of the stream they had taken. It also reinforces that continuity of learning is very important,” she said.However, several school officials questioned the inclusion of the Class 11 performance as part of the formula.Manju Sethi, principal, Bluebells School International, said, “Every year there is a sudden drop in marks when students move from Class 10 to 11 due to complete change in the subjects and learning pattern. A student who scores 90% or above in Class 10 often gets 65%-70% in the first Class 11 exams. Most schools follow a strict marking scheme in Class 11. Besides, some students also pursue hobbies, prepare for entrance exams and build their portfolio in Class 11.”Awadhesh Kumar Jha, school head of the Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini’s Sector 8, said, “The board should have given 10% weightage to Class 11 scores. We mark very strictly in Class 11. Those who get 70% in Class 11 often score 90% in class 12 here.”However, to this, Pandey said, “If some people think including the Class 11 marks will disadvantage students, they should also consider that the best-of-three marks in the Class 10 weightage will compensate for it. Overall, the formula is student-friendly.”Several principals favoured CBSE’s decision to implement a moderation policy to prevent marks from being “inflated”.Harpreet Kaur, principal of Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Tilak Nagar, said, “It was necessary to fix a reference year to avoid marks being inflated. It won’t be an issue for Class 12 since most schools have consistent performances, unlike Class 10, where students switched back to board exams in 2018 after a gap of 10 years, as a result of which performances have varied a lot in the last three years.”CBSE has asked schools to keep their average marks in line with their best performance in class 12 in the last three years (2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/schools-welcome-cbse-formula-some-raise-concern-over-inclusion-of-class-11-performance-101623952099655.html
17-06-2021||Other||Many students, parents concerned about inclusion of internals in CBSE’s Class 12 score formula||New Delhi Though the revised formula to evaluate Class 12 results, notified by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Thursday, has put an end to months of uncertainty, many graduating students and their parents have raised concerns over inclusion of internal scores of classes 11 and 12 while calculating the final marks.Endorsing the inclusion of Class 10 board exam marks in the results for the sake of uniformity and standardisation, Riya Chauhan (17), a Class 12 student at Modern Public School in Shalimar Bagh, however, said that taking internal test scores of classes 11 and 12 may put students at disadvantage.“The internal assessments in classes 11 and 12 is always tough. Besides, students were appearing for various competitive examinations while preparing for their pre-boards. The current evaluation pattern will put students at a disadvantage because these marks will be used for our higher education prospects as well,” she said.Following the cancellation of Class 12 CBSE exams on June 1 amid rising Covid-19 cases, the education board on Thursday told the Supreme Court that it would compile the Class 12 results on the basis of the Class 10 board exam (30%), Class 11 annual exam (30%), and Class 12 pre-boards, mid-terms as well as unit test scores (40%).Some students said that they gave a satisfactory performance in the Class 10 boards and subsequent internals, but expressed concern about classmates who often study at the last minute. Kunal Singh, a Class 12 student at a government school in Nand Nagri, said, “I have scored good marks in all three years. But not every student has the same studying pattern. Many study better at the last minute and perform well in the boards as compared to school exams. Switching to online learning during the final year of school and the pandemic-related anxieties will also have an impact on the Class 12 internal test scores which carry the maximum weightage.”Prachi Kacker, whose daughter studies in Class 12 in The Indian School, said they have “accepted the criteria” and want to focus on the future now. “Class 11 students are not serious with their academics because they have just appeared for one board exam and have to prepare for another next year. The same batch of students was pushed towards isolation in Class 12 last year and that too impacted their studies. Though CBSE has given an option to reappear for the exams if they are not satisfied with the marks, it is not practical because it would mean losing another year. These children have to move on.”Aprajita Gautam, president of Delhi Parents Association and the mother of a Class 12 student, said schools must keep these factors in mind while marking students. “Class 11 students take some time to settle in with their new subjects and curriculum. Schools also do strict marking in Class 11 to prepare them for boards. Class 12 pre-boards were also conducted amid the chaos of the pandemic. These factors call for a humanitarian approach while compiling results by schools.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/many-students-parents-concerned-about-inclusion-of-internals-in-cbse-s-class-12-score-formula-101623952039665.html
17-06-2021||Mumbai||‘Form a panel of Ram Bhakts to oversee spending of funds for Ram Temple’: NCP||The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Thursday said a ‘non-political committee’ of devotees needs to monitor the spending of funds collected for the construction of the Ram Temple of Ayodhya. NCP’s demand comes at a time when allegations of scam arose regarding the purchase of land in Ayodhya which the Ram Temple trust has denied.“A non-political committee of Ram bhakts (devotees) should be entrusted with the task of maintaining transparency in the spending of funds for temple construction,” Maharashtra minister and state NCP chief Jayant Patil was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.“The Ram temple's sanctity should be maintained. All Ram bhakts feel that the temple should be constructed in complete faith and trust. The allegations of corruption show how Lord Ram was used for political and economic gains,” he further added.Allegations of scam in the purchase of land for the Ram Temple also led to clashes between Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party on Wednesday. The Sena mouthpiece Saamana had earlier sought clarification regarding the allegations levelled by AAP’s Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh and a former minister in the Samajwadi government, Pawan Pandey who alleged the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust general secretary Champat Rai along with Anil Mishra purchased a piece of land worth ₹2 crore at an inflated price of ₹18.5 crore for the Ram Temple premises.Earlier on Tuesday, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar also said the facts should be brought to the fore. “If there are allegations, facts need to be brought before people whose money and sentiments are attached to the project,” Pawar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The BJP has faced criticism from the Opposition parties regarding the allegations of corruption. Shiv Sena also questioned UP CM Yogi Adityanath and said that he should also provide clarification since he was present at the bhoomipujan ceremony. “The Trust formed for the construction of the temple should clarify if the allegations are true or false. The temple's 'bhoomipujan' ceremony was also attended by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. They should also speak out,” Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/form-a-panel-of-ram-bhakts-to-oversee-spending-of-funds-for-ram-temple-ncp-101623950924679.html
17-06-2021||Noida||Inclusion of Class 11 score a worry for students, parents as CBSE reveals evaluation formula for Class 12||Noida: The formula to evaluate Class 12 results, notified by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Thursday, has put an end to months of uncertainty, but several students and parents have raised concerns over including the internal scores of class 11 while calculating the final marks.Astha Singh, a resident of Noida Sector 53 and a Class 12 student of Amity International School, is worried as Class 11 marks are also being taken into account. “Students are usually unable to score well in Class 11 because the syllabus is huge. With Class 11 score being taken into account, I feel my percentage will go down. However, I may explore the option of appearing in exam,” she said. Saksham Sharma, a Class 12 student at DPS Noida, said that he had scored 70% in his Class 11 exam. “Though I didn’t score good marks in Class 11 exams, I am better placed compared to my classmates most of who barely scored 40-50%,” said Saksham who plans to pursue B.Arch.However, Rahul Tandon, another student of the school, is happy that he would score over 85% in Class 12. “I have predicted my score to be around 89% as per the formula given by CBSE,” said Tandon, a Sector 28 resident who plans to pursue computer science in a university in Canada.Renu Singh, principal of Amity International School, Noida, said that the weightage to Class 11 should not have been more than 15%. “In Class 11, many students are in-between their subjects and streams as they are still figuring out what to opt for. In such a case, many are unable to score good marks. Moreover, teachers do strict marking in order to prepare them for Class 12. Hence, I feel CBSE should have not given more than 15% weightage to Class 11 results. About 40% weightage should have been given to Class 10 marks,” she said.Manoj Kataria, president of Gautam Budh Nagar Parents’ Welfare Society echoed the similar opinion. “Class 11 session starts in July after Class 10 board exam results are declared and then the final exams of this standard are also held in February. So, a student only gets around nine months for Class 11 and the syllabus is vast. In such a situation, students are unable to score well. Giving 30% weightage to Class 11 will severely affect Class 12 scores.”However, Kamini Bhasin, principal of DPS Noida, said that the evaluation formula is extremely comprehensive and that it was the only option left in the current scenario.“For classes 10 and 11, CBSE has allowed to use marks of best of three subjects which is an advantage for the students. Moreover, schools have been asked to moderate the scores of these two standards as well. I believe in the current scenario, this is a sincere effort by the Board to evaluate and give justice to the students,” Bhasin said.Rajiv Bansal, director (operations) at Global Indian International School, Noida, said that the assessment based on marks obtained throughout the past three academic years ensures that every student gets a fair chance of comprehensive performance evaluation. “Class 12 students of the academic session 2020-21 have faced extremely uncertain times and deserve effective evaluation to move ahead with their academic and vocational pursuits. This well-defined, time-bound criterion is in the best interest of the students,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/inclusion-of-class-11-score-a-worry-for-students-parents-as-cbse-reveals-evaluation-formula-for-class-12-101623951438939.html

Officials familiar with the development said a search is on for the mastermind and the owner of the apartment.On June 11, the Sector 39 police had apprehended six persons and recovered gold bars, jewellery and cash worth ₹8.25 crore from the suspects. It was later revealed that the goods had allegedly been from a flat in a high-rise society located under the Surajpur police’s jurisdiction. The total cost of the valuables robbed was above ₹30 crore and included at least 40 gold bars which were divided equally between the 10 robbers, four of whom, including the alleged mastermind Gopal, are yet to be nabbed.Sources said the apartment allegedly belongs to a lawyer.“The flat is in a third person’s name. We cannot share details of what all was found there as it is all under investigation but the clues are being analysed,” said a senior police official, on the condition of anonymity.He also said that while the lawyer is not in the country, his parents are and are currently in hiding.Police have already interrogated the lawyer’s wife and other family members and staff, however, not much has come to light. Eight teams have been formed to investigate the case.“Our top priority right now is to nab the mastermind, who can shed more light on the case. A search is on for him and his three accomplices, along with the lawyer’s father,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP), zone 1, Kumar Ran Vijay Singh.Reports claimed that the police have arrested more people in the case but the ADCP denied them, saying that only the six robbers have been nabbed so far. But several more are being questioned, he said.Police further claimed that so far, they have not found any clues from the recovered gold bars as well, which appear to be locally made and not smuggled. The joint commissioner of police had also written to the Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate, whose teams have visited Noida for their own separate investigation, officials added.Till now, the Noida police have identified 23 cases against the father-son (the lawyer and his father) duo in Delhi, Haryana and with the Central Bureau of Investigation, though they have not yet been booked in Noida. Police had earlier suspected that the lawyer’s educational credentials may be fake, though that is also under investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/unreported-theft-case-cops-identify-noida-flat-that-was-looted-search-on-for-mastermind-101623951318840.html

17-06-2021||Gurugram||Waterlogging issues to be resolved by quick response teams||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) has formed a quick response team to manage waterlogging issues during monsoon, officials said on Thursday. The authority has also identified 20 critical waterlogging points across the district.Sudhir Rajpal, chief executive officer (CEO), GMDA, said that the authority has set a target of June 25 to ensure that appropriate machinery is deployed at all critical points to tackle waterlogging during the monsoon. “A quick response team has been formed, which will also have officials from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), to solve waterlogging issues at the earliest. The team, equipped with machines and mobile pumps, will be stationed at Tau Devilal Stadium so that it can quickly respond to waterlogging problems,” said Rajpal.Officials said that depending on the jurisdiction, traffic police and officers from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will also be roped in.The GMDA is also trying to complete the expansion of a 33-metre stretch of Badshahpur drain, near Khandsa, by June 25. Earlier, the authority had set a deadline of July first week.“Waterlogging at Hero Honda Chowk was primarily due to the narrow width of Badshahpur drain near Khandsa village. The drain is being expanded so that it can carry 2,300 cusecs of water instead of 800 cusecs. We are trying to complete the expansion by June 25,” Rajpal added.The authority has also formed a committee that identified 20 critical waterlogging points across the city, out of which, 15 points are under the GMDA, four points under the MCG, and one point under the Delhi Land & Finance (DLF).Officials said that the work to manage waterlogging at 16 points has been completed. Last month, people from various parts of the city reported waterlogging issues following heavy rainfall. Some of the worst-affected areas were Narsinghpur-Khandsa stretch, Sohna Road, Sector 9, Sector 10, Gurugram bus depot, CH Bakhtawar Singh Road, and Rajiv Chowk.In 2021, the GMDA has also planned to ensure that rainwater is stored in dams in the Aravallis, for groundwater recharge and to prevent runoff. “Bundhs in Aravallis have been strengthened so that the water from the mountains is stored there itself. This will help in groundwater recharge and improve the condition of green belts in the city,” said Rajpal.Meanwhile, according to a statement released by the district administration, the MCG will rent 113 pumps, 32 suction tankers, and 32 JCBs during this monsoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/waterlogging-issues-to-be-resolved-by-quick-response-teams-101623948622875.html
17-06-2021||Gurugram||Fortis to provide Sputnik jabs in Ggm from June 19||The Russian-made vaccine against Covid-19, Sputnik V, will be rolled out in Gurugram for the first time, at Fortis Memorial Research Institute from June 19. Gurugram will be the first district in Haryana to begin the inoculation of Sputnik on a pilot basis.Doses will be initially administered to the hospital staff, said health officials on Thursday.Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer (DIO), said, “The hospital had sought permission from the Haryana health department to start Sputnik V vaccination, which has now been granted. Hospital staff are likely to be vaccinated in the pilot roll-out.”The hospital has procured the vaccine directly from Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, and as part of the limited pilot roll-out, it will give the two-dose vaccine in Gurugram and Mohali.Dr Ashutosh Raghuvanshi, managing director and chief executive officer, Fortis Healthcare, said, “Our units were only providing Covaxin and Covishield. The hospital, in collaboration with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, is now among the first to provide a third vaccine option (Sputnik V), with the dual objective of expanding and scaling up the vaccination drive, and also lowering infection risks to future mutations of the coronavirus.”According to a statement issued by the hospital, “Some recent trials have shown that Sputnik V has an efficacy of more than 90%, and it will bring down symptomatic Covid-19 cases by over 90%, saving the large population in India from infections from future Covid-19 strains.” Sputnik V, including administrative charges, has been priced at ₹1,145 per dose, according to the hospital. There is, however, no announcement on the number of doses available with the hospital.Meanwhile, the Gurugram administration is also planning to provide Sputnik V jabs in government healthcare facilities, district deputy commissioner Yash Garg said on Thursday. “Sputnik V inoculation will start in the district soon. The administration is in the process of getting the doses under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Gurugram has more than 20 deep freezers to maintain the cold chain for the vaccine storage. A team from Dr Reddy’s Lab has inspected the arrangements, and expressed satisfaction,” Garg said in a statement issued by the administration.During a meeting on Thursday, senior officials of the district administration and the health department said that they aim to vaccinate the maximum population before the third wave of Covid-19 strikes the district in the next few months.“We are aiming at vaccinating the maximum number of people in the 18-45 age group to prevent the deadly impact of Covid-19. Data shows that at least 51% of the population in Gurugram has already been vaccinated. It is the highest in India,” said chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Virender Yadav.Sputnik V is the third vaccine approved by the Centre to combat the coronavirus infection. The first phase of the Sputnik V rollout by Apollo Hospitals and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories had started on a pilot basis in Hyderabad on May 17, 2021. The vaccine is developed by Gamaleya Institute in Russia, and it shows over 91.6% efficacy against Covid-19. The vaccine has to be kept at -20° to -25° Celsius. It has to be kept outside for 15-20 minutes, before being administered to the people.So far, 907,121 doses have been administered to the people in Gurugram, out of which, 12,059 doses were given on Thursday. It includes administration of at least 4,518 doses in government facilities, and 7,541 in private facilities.

Some 9,716 in the 18-45 age group, and 2,051 above 45 years took the Covaxin or Covishield doses on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fortis-to-provide-sputnik-jabs-in-ggm-from-june-19-101623948621361.html
17-06-2021||Gurugram||6-8% of private hospital staff infected with Covid-19 after vaccination||As many as 6-8% of healthcare workers at private hospitals got infected with Covid-19 after vaccination, as per results of surveys of healthcare workers done by three hospitals. As per an internal survey by Fortis Hospital, nearly 6% of 16,000 healthcare workers across the country, who were administered with first and second doses of vaccine between January 2021 and May 2021, got infected post-vaccination. A similar result, an infection rate of around 6%, was reported by Max Hospital, where the survey was done among its 14,000 employees who received both jabs. At Artemis Hospital, at least 8.3% (135 out of 1,628 staff ) of breakthrough infections were reported after two doses of Covishield. The district health department, however, did not collate any data on infections after vaccination. At Fortis Hospital, among those who got infected after getting fully vaccinated, 92% were mildly infected cases while 7% developed moderate illness, requiring oxygen support and only 1% developed severe illness requiring ICU care/ ventilation. “The study clearly brings out important findings that the vaccines available do provide protection against the virus even in healthcare workers, who are at most risk and vulnerable to get infected with the virus. While India has sound vaccine manufacturing capacity at its disposal, what is really needed is a comprehensive and multi-pronged mass education strategy to achieve last mile delivery,” said Dr Bishnu Panigrahi, group head – medical strategy & operations, Fortis Healthcare Ltd, in a statement. In the case of Artemis Hospital in Sector 51, there are a total of 1,848 healthcare workers at the hospital, of whom 1,628 (88.09%) had completed two-dose vaccinations. The data shared by the hospital showed that a total of 135 (8.3%) breakthrough infections were reported. The mean interval between vaccination and infection was found to be 54 days (range of 20-78 days). Infections were reported in 66 males (48.9%) and 69 females (51.1%). There was no hospitalisation reported. Dr Namita Jaggi, the chairperson of lab services and infection control and the chief of education and research, Artemis Hospital, said, “The majority of them were infected in April. They were all mild and no hospitalisation was reported.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/68of-private-hospital-staff-infected-with-covid-19-after-vaccination-101623948620828.html
17-06-2021||Gurugram||Covid-19: Gurugram to augment paediatric care infra ahead of third wave||Gearing up for a possible third wave of Covid-19 the district health department has begun its preparation to augment paediatric care infrastructure in the district. Private hospitals have been directed to strengthen their Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) and Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Data is being collated on the beds available in different hospitals. “With the younger population likely to face the impact in the third wave, a 20-bed paediatric facility will be set up at the polyclinic in Sector 31. If required, the makeshift Covid care centre at Tau Devi Lal Stadium will be converted into a paediatric ward. Likewise, out of the 350 beds at M3M Covid care centre, about 100 will be reserved for children,” said Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, during a meeting with Gurugram MP Rao Inderjeet Singh. In a recent all-India serological survey by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences conducted among children of two to 17 years from March 15 till June 10, seroprevalence was found to be 55.7% and 63.5% in those more than or equal to 18 years of age. The survey had 4,509 participants, of whom 700 were younger than 18 years and 3,809 were 18 years or older. According to the study, seropositivity among children was high and comparable to the adult population. “It is unlikely that a future third wave by prevailing Covid-19 variant would disproportionately affect children of two years or older,” read the study. A state-level serological survey to cover children has also been planned by the state health department but was postponed earlier this week. The survey is important as the population younger than 18 years is not being covered under the vaccination drive. Undisrupted oxygen supplyDuring a meeting with Garg, the Gurugram MP was told at least six oxygen plants were set up and five are in the process of being set up. Two oxygen pants have been set up at Civil Hospital in Sector 10, one plant each at ESIC Hospital in Sector 9A, ESIC Hospital in Manesar’s Sector 3 and the subdivisional hospital in Pataudi. More plants will be set up at Sector 31 and Sohna polyclinics. During the second Covid-19 wave in April and May, oxygen supply for Covid-19 patients was badly affected due to a lack of infrastructure. According to Garg, the district administration is preparing to set up an oxygen cylinder and oxygen concentrator bank. It will have a capacity of 800 cylinders and 700 concentrators, which will be provided to the patients based on the requirement. Also, private hospitals with bed capacity above 50 were directed to install oxygen plants before June 30.

The father was also shot at and is in a critical condition, undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Rewari, the police said.The four suspects, identified as Harish, Naveen, Paramjeet and Yaman of Rewari, were arrested on Thursday from Jatshahpur. They were produced before a district court and taken on two-day police remand.A case under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Arms Act was registered against them at the Pataudi police station.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that Parveen Kumar, a resident of Khalilpur village, was having a feud with a man identified as Harish Kumar since the last month after they argued over drinks. Last week, Parveen assaulted Harish in public. “Harish threatened Parveen of dire consequences and was looking for an opportunity to take revenge. His friends arranged for weapons and they planned to kill him on Wednesday,” he said.“They found Parveen in the outer area of the village and shot at him. Assuming him to be dead, they went to his house and shot at his son who was playing in the open area near the house. Two of them fired several gunshots at the boy and one bullet hit him on the chest,” he said.Hearing gunshots, locals and relatives of the two victims gathered at their house and arranged for a vehicle to take both of them to the hospital. Doctors declared the boy brought dead and Parveen critical.“They opened fire only on my son. They did not harm me even though I was sitting nearby. They intended to kill my son,” said Bharti, the boy’s mother.Sangwan said, “The assailants had the intention to kill the father and the son. We suspect a personal rivalry behind the killing. It appears that the family is not sharing complete information with us. We will seek more information during the remand.”A forensic team visited the crime spot on Thursday and empty cartridges were retrieved from the spot. The police said that they were seeking information from neighbours about the rivalry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fouryearold-shot-dead-by-father-s-rivals-in-pataudi-101623948619297.html

The man was befriended by a member of a honeytrap gang on social media and during a meeting at a hotel near Nehru Place in Delhi on June 10, he was offered drinks laced with sedatives. The gang took compromising photographs of the man and the woman, following which they extorted ₹2 lakh from him, the police said.However, the gang was asking him to pay ₹12 lakh more and he was not in a position to do so, the police said. The suspects were identified as Jeenat, Nazia alias Juhi, Aashiya alias Ruhi, Eba and Arbaaz of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. OP Singh, the commissioner of police, Faridabad, said that they received a call around 3.15pm about a man doused in petrol setting himself ablaze on a road near a school in Sector 17. “The police team took him to a nearby hospital where doctors declared him brought dead. The police found his purse at the spot, using details from which they contacted his son. He told us that a honeytrap gang was harassing his father,” he said.The police immediately scanned the phone records of the businessman and zeroed in on the gang. They were booked under sections 384 (extortion), 306 (abetment to suicide) and 120 (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code in an FIR registered at the Sector 17 police station on Wednesday. The police said that one of the suspects had befriended the businessman on social media last month and after a few phone conversations, invited him to meet her. “She offered him drinks laced with sedatives. When the victim gained consciousness, he found himself naked on the bed. The suspects had filmed videos and clicked pictures of their victim with the woman and threatened to implicate him in a fake rape case. They also threatened to send the recordings to his family and transferred nearly ₹2 lakh from his account. Since he didn’t have any more money in his account, they asked him to arrange for ₹4 lakh,” OP Singh said. Following the incident, the businessman confined himself to his residence in Sector 17 and stopped taking all calls. He shared his ordeal with his son and contacted a few lawyers, who later tried to extort money from him, the son said.The police identified Nazia alias Juhi as the kingpin of the gang. They would “trap” businessmen in Faridabad and Delhi, and extort their victims by threatening to implicate them in fake cases or revealing the videos and photos to their family members. Due to fear of being exposed, no cases were filed, the police said. They were operational for the past three years and had made more than ₹50 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/honeytrapped-businessman-sets-himself-on-fire-over-extortion-threats-101623948438590.html

The ministers of his government have been already asked to camp at the development block levels to connect with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers and review the projects there.The chief minister, who was in his home district Gorakhpur on Wednesday and Thursday, is scheduled to visit Ballia and Varanasi on Friday.In Gorakhpur, he visited hospitals and reviewed development works.“Yes, the chief minister’s programme for visits to all the districts is being worked out. He is scheduled to visit Ballia and Varanasi on Friday. He will visit other districts, too, in the coming weeks,” an official spokesman said.Ballia is the home district of leader of Opposition in the assembly and Samajwadi Party MLA Ram Gobind Chaudhary while Varanasi is the Lok Sabha constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Chaudhary represents Bansdeeh assembly constituency in Ballia.Although a detailed programme for the chief minister’s visit to Ballia is being given final shape, those aware of the developments said he would visit a village, speak to the beneficiaries of government schemes and meet public representatives, besides reviewing Covid-19 management, development works and the law and order situation. In Varanasi, he is scheduled to visit a community health centre, meet public representatives, review development projects and the law and order situation, inspect the Rudrakh convention centre, visit Kashi Vishwanath temple and take stock of the Kashi Vishwanath corridor project before coming back to Lucknow.“Mass contact is very important in politics. When the chief minister visits districts in the coming weeks, he will obviously meet the people and his party workers there. The UP government’s ministers are already touring and camping at the block level as part of the BJP’s strategy. The CM’s tours will have a different meaning and will obviously mark the preparations for the 2022 assembly elections,” said SK Dwivedi, former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.Ram Gobind Chaudhary said he had no information about the chief minister’s proposed visit though he should have been informed about the same in accordance with the protocol. Chaudhary alleged the chief minister’s tours were an attempt to divert attention from developments in the BJP.“These visits now have no meaning. The BJP governments at the Centre and in the state have failed in Covid-19 management. The people of the state have suffered a lot. The farmers are upset as procurement centres are not procuring wheat. I am getting calls from farmers from different places that they are waiting in the rain but their wheat is not being procured at the procurement centres. The BJP obviously wants to divert attention from the failures of its government as it prepares for the 2022 assembly elections in the state,” said Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-begins-touring-uttar-pradesh-districts-to-feel-people-s-pulse-review-schemes-101623947898965.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi Metro issues new timings for first and last trains on Green Line||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Thursday announced the construction of an additional interchange facility connecting the Metro’s Green Line (Inderlok/Kirti Nagar-Bahadurgarh) and Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) at the Punjabi Bagh West Metro station. For the construction of this facility, from June 18 to September 30, the timings of the first and the last train on the Green Line will be altered slightly, a DMRC statement said. The DMRC said that the first and the last metro train services between Brigadiar Hoshiar Singh (Bahadurgarh) and Inderlok/Kirti Nagar will be regulated from June 18-19 night till September 30, the DMRC statement issued on Thursday indicated. “This is the first time that such a special ‘halt platform’ is being planned to connect two already operational Metro corridors. This halt platform will provide interconnectivity between the Green and the Pink Line at the Punjabi Bagh West Metro station of the Pink Line,” the statement read. “There will not be any ticketing facility on the interchange platforms, but boarding and de-boarding facilities will be available as a result of which passengers who want to interchange trains between the two lines, will be able to use the facility. The platforms will be connected by a 230-metres long foot over bridge (FOB), which will connect the platforms with the Punjabi Bagh West Metro station of the Pink Line,” it added. DMRC said that from June 18 night, between Brigadiar Singh (Bahadurgarh)-Inderlok the first train will now start at 7am and the last train will leave the station at 9 pm. On the Brigadiar Hoshiar Singh-Kirti Nagar section, the first train will start at 7.18 am, while the last train is now timed at 9.10 pm. Between Inderlok and Brigadiar Hoshiar Singh and Kirti Nagar and Brigadiar Hoshiar Singh sections, the timing of the first train will now be 7.25 am, and the last time will be 9.30 pm. On Sundays, in each of the sections the starting time of trains will be an hour later than the schedule. The timing for the last train will however, remain the same. The DMRC also said that the platforms will be 155-metres in length and will be connected with the FOB by two additional lifts with a capacity of 26 passengers each and staircases. “The total height from the platform level of the new platforms to the concourse of the Punjabi Bagh West station of Pink Line is 16.75 metres. Therefore, the passage has been planned at two levels. The passengers after coming down the staircases or lifts from the platform will again have to take the stairs, two escalators or a through movement lift to finally reach the concourse area,” the DMRC statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-metro-issues-new-timings-for-first-and-last-trains-on-green-line-101623947839177.html

The Congress is the mastermind behind this while the JMM is cooperating and collaborating to keep it going,” Prakash said after meeting the Governor.“Thakurani iron mine in West Singhbhum district was earlier allotted to Padma Kumar Jain, but the state government cancelled the lease of this mine spread on 84.6 hectares in 2019. Before this, the Supreme Court had ordered to collect fines from 347 mines for illegal mining in 2017. A fine of ₹334.47 crore was levied on Padma Kumar Jain too. The court ordered to collect the fine amount by auctioning the previously mined stocks of iron ore,” said Prakash.He alleged that the state was losing huge revenue worth crores due to the negligence of the state government and vested into the interest of certain mining department officials. “I have requested the Governor to stall the Jharkhand State Mineral Development Corporation (JSMDC) tender order for auction, besides doing grade rating of the ore samples by a competent agency outside the state and taking strong action against officials found guilty,” Prakash said.He has given copies of the tender document, grade rating order on May 30, mining plan submitted to Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) and monthly returns filed by the company with the state government and IBM to the Governor.Meanwhile, former CM Madhu Koda has also warned against imminent iron ore scam in the district again. “Iron mines in the district are closed on paper, however, illegal mining hasn’t stopped. The state is losing revenue worth crores in the form of iron ore coming from Odisha in connivance of mining officers and local police,” said Koda, who was himself a convict in a coal scam worth ₹4000 crore and an accused in the iron ore scam worth over ₹2000 crore.“I have been keeping CM Hemant Soren informed about the grading of iron ore in Thakurani Mine in Gua. Now mining department has come out with an amended notification extending the date of the JSMDC tender. But I had demanded a fresh grading as Padma Kumar Jain has claimed the grade of ore and fines to be 55-65 in its report to IBM whereas government laboratory has put the grading at 39-55,” Kulwant Singh Bunty said.“The state may lose ₹5000 per tonne due to this difference in grading percentage. The ore and fines with the grading of 55-65% are currently priced at ₹9000 per tonne. If the grading comes out below this, the price will fall to ₹3000 per ton, resulting in loss to the tune of ₹50-60 crore,” added Kulwant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-former-cm-koda-warn-of-iron-ore-scam-in-jharkhand-101623947778380.html
17-06-2021||Ranchi||Preparing for third wave: J’khand launches Pneumonia vaccination drive for children||Jharkhand on Thursday became the sixth state in the country that rolled out the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) drive to make children’s immunity stronger in a bid to protect them from the probable third wave of coronavirus, officials said. State health minister Banna Gupta said, “The government is concerned as according to the experts and scientists, the probable third wave of Covid-19 might hit children. So, our government is taking all possible steps to protect children. The PCV drive will prove to be a milestone in this regard.” The minister said that pneumonia has been the main cause of disease and deaths in children below five years of age. “There will be a huge reduction in such cases after this vaccination campaign,” he said. Ananya, a two and half-year-old child, became the first in Jharkhand to receive the first shot of the vaccine on the occasion of the launch programme. Jharkhand has set a target to vaccinate around 8.5 lakh children. The vaccine in three doses. The first dose is given when an infant completes 45 days of birth, the second dose at 90 days and the third is given when the baby is nine months old, an official said. Five states, including Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, have already started the drive. Jharkhand has received 77,200 vaccine doses from the centre to begin the drive, officials said. The drive holds significance for Jharkhand, as the cost of the vaccine is very high. Additional chief secretary Arun Kumar said, “One dose costs around ₹1600, which is expensive for many families in the state.” The health minister said, “The state government is trying to give better healthcare facilities to people of the state in limited resources. The health indices of some programmes are ahead of the national average, while efforts are on to bring rest of health indices at par with the national average.” The infant mortality rate in the state has come down from 34 to 29 per thousand, while the national average is 33. “If we talk about maternal mortality rate, it has come down from 165 to 76 per lakh, while the national average is 122,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/preparing-for-third-wave-j-khand-launches-pneumonia-vaccination-drive-for-children-101623947719688.html

The district has been struggling to convince people to get vaccinated due to some rumours, like impotency and death, spreading among villagers. Only 6% or 42,754 people could be inoculated, out of the target of 7,16,583 people in West Singhbum, the lowest in the state. As many as 134 persons have died of Covid-19 in the district so far.“We will give coupons for 1-litre petrol for free to 200 people in the age group of 18-44 years and above 45 years after they get vaccinated at the camp near Shahid Chowk set up by us and IOC,” Rahul Saraf, Rotaract Club-Chaibasa member, said. Earlier, the Chakradharpur unit of the Marwari Yuva Manch (MYM) and IOC had given coupons of 1-litre petrol free to 240 persons for getting vaccinated on Monday.CCCI president Nitin Prakash said that 5100 such coupons were given to the West Singhbhum district deputy commissioner (DC) Ananya Mittal for distribution purposes on Wednesday. “Such incentives are helping us increase the rate of vaccination as more people are now turning at the vaccination centres. It is further dispelling their fear of mishaps due to vaccination and bridging the gap created by misinformation,” Ananya Mittal, West Singhbhum DC, said.“We trained two teachers per block who in turn trained three teachers per panchayat regarding merits and effects of vaccination. Now they are conducting village meetings to make people aware of correct facts. We also held a meeting today in which Chaibasa MLA Dipak Birua urged the manki and Mundas (village heads) to convince people the need to get vaccinated and urged them not to pay any heed to rumours,” added Mittal.The overall vaccination coverage is also slow across the state as of now. As per state health department data, only 11.69% of people have been administered the first dose and only 2.16% of people out of the estimated state population of 3.77 crore have taken the second dose of anti-Covid-19 vaccine. Only 2% of people in the state took both vaccine doses, while 90% of people in the 18-44 years age group across 21 districts were yet to take the first dose. Altogether 32.50% of people above 45 years have taken the first dose, while only 5.32% of people in the same age bracket have took both doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/get-free-petrol-discount-coupons-after-first-dose-of-vaccine-in-w-singhbhum-101623947720248.html

The incessant rain has caused damage to several bridges, a flood-like situation in low lying areas, besides overflowing rivers and dams. However, the ongoing rain would boost the Kharif crops scenario in Jharkhand, experts said.Weather officials said that the incessant rainfall pattern would continue for at least the next 48 hours. The state has received 149.8mm rain from June 1 to June 17 against the normal 77.88 mm.Lohardaga district recorded the highest 283% surplus rainfall, followed by Palamu 265% and Garhwa 217% from June 1 to June 17.Officials at Ranchi centre of India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that out of 24 districts, four recorded above 200% excess rain, 10 districts recorded above 100% surplus rain and 10 districts recorded normal rainfall during the period.“As per the current record, we can say Jharkhand has so far received highest rain this year between June 1 and June 17 as compared to past one decade. As per the current prediction, the incessant rainfall would continue at least for the next two days,” said Abhishek Anand, senior scientist at Ranchi IMD centre.He said a cyclonic circulation over East Uttar Pradesh and neighbourhood is causing good rain in north Jharkhand. Besides, a trough now runs from West Rajasthan to the Bay of Bengal across northwest Madhya Pradesh, southeast Uttar Pradesh, south Bihar, Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal, which is also offering good rain across the state, he said. Amid the good monsoon rains, farmers of six districts, including Khunti, Gumla, Simdega and East Singhbhum, have started direct sowing of paddy crop. As per the record by the agriculture department, paddy used to be sown on 9,000 hectares of land. The state has set the target to grow paddy on 18 lakh hectares of land. Meanwhile, the state agriculture secretary Abu Bakr Siddique directed the officials to ensure 100% distribution of seeds among the farmers within a week. He also asked the officials to ensure the sale of fertilizers only through the e-PoS machine to curb black marketing.The rain caused damage to many bridges in the state. A bridge being built at the cost of ₹8.34 crore in the Panki block of Palamu district collapsed on Wednesday. Due to incessant rainfall, three sluice gates of the Tenughat dam were opened, which increased the water level in the Damodar river.

The fresh deadline for uploading the scanned copies of documents is July 20.“If the teachers don’t upload the documents, it will be assumed they have nothing to say in this regard and due process will follow as per rules,” he said, adding that so far 1.25 lakh teachers had not provided their documents for verification despite repeated reminders.Earlier, Bihar’s vigilance investigation bureau’s (VIB) has expressed inability to complete its probe into the appointments even after over five years since the Patna High Court ordered the investigation. The VIB has cited education department’s failure to provide missing folders. The department, in turn, blamed non-cooperation by many recruiting agencies under the panchayati raj system. In January this year, the state government shifted the onus of document verification on teachers themselves.The HC bench of the then chief justice L Narasimha Reddy and justice Sudhir Singh, while ordering a vigilance probe in 2015, had observed: “The extent to which the candidates with fake certificates have been appointed as teachers in the past decade is a matter of deep concern. The state government has soft-pedalled the issue for the past one decade… We direct the director general, vigilance, to immediately swing into action and verify the genuineness of certificates of the teachers who have been appointed since 2006.”The court had also expressed displeasure over the delay in the completion of probe and even threatened action.“Despite repeated reminders form the education department and the probe agency, most teachers have not made the documents available. Now we are giving them one final chance to upload their documents, failing which it will be assumed they have nothing to say,” the minister said.Earlier, director (primary education) Ranjit Kumar Singh had written to all the district education officers (DEOs) and district programme officers (DPOs) about an alternative mechanism for verification of documents of teachers’ appointment made between 2006 and 2015, necessitated due to non-cooperation by many recruiting agencies under the panchayati raj system. “Prime facie, their appointment will be considered illegal and irregular and suitable action will be taken if the teachers don’t comply. They will be served show cause and their service will be terminated and the process initiated for recovery of salary drawn by them as per the provisions in the public demand recovery act,” said the letter from the director.The department has now decided to verify documents before issuing appointment letters to teachers. “The government is already in the process of appointing nearly 1.25 lakh teachers. Now, the effort is to monitor the recruitment process online through a system located centrally in Patna without diluting the role of PRIs and urban local bodies,” said the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teachers-in-dock-yet-to-submit-papers-for-verification-minister-warns-of-action-101623946520306.html

In East Champaran, major rivers like Gandak, Lalbakeya and Sikrahna continued to be in spate for a second day on Thursday, though no untoward incident was reported. “We have evacuated around 1,500 people from Sangrampur and Kesariya blocks. The water level is expected to rise further because of 4.12 cusecs of water was released from Valmikinagar barrage on Wednesday. We are alert,” said Shirshat Kapil Ashok, district magistrate, East Champaran. A team of National Disaster Response Force (NDFR) has been deployed at Sangrampur, he said. In Gopalganj district, a large number of villages in Baikunthpur, Gopalganj (Sadar), Barauli, Kuchaikote, Majha and Sidhawaliya blocks continued to reel under heavy waterlogging following incessant rainfall over the last 48 hours. “Around 800 people have been evacuated in Baikunthpur and Ahirauli Don areas of the district,” said Upendra Pal, subdivisional magistrate (SDM), Gopalganj.“Water level in Gandak has increased by 12-18 cm at places in the district. It could rise by another 8-12 cm, going by the discharge made from Valmikinagar barrage. We are expecting the water discharged to pass through district by Saturday afternoon,” said Dr. Naval Kishor Choudhary, Gopalganj’s district magistrate (DM). The administration has identified 16 to 18 sensitive spots on embankment over Gandak river in Gopalganj district. “We have intensified our patrolling of embankments.

17-06-2021||Other||Bihar overshot other states in single-day shots on June 16||PATNABihar achieved a small milestone on Wednesday when it not only recorded its highest ever single-day Covid-19 vaccinations, but also shot to top position in the country, at least for the day. Officials said more than 6.62 lakh doses were administered in the state on Wednesday, though the CoWIN portal, through which vaccination is monitored, recorded 5.03 lakh doses. Officials said some information on inoculations done on Wednesday was uploaded past midnight and this it reflected in Thursday’s vaccination figures. On Wednesday, Uttar Pradesh administered 3.64 lakh doses, Madhya Pradesh 3.38 lakh, Tamil Nadu 3.35 lakh and Maharashtra 2.34 lakh, as per the CoWIN dashboard.Bihar’s previous highest single-day vaccination was on April 10 when 3.60 lakh doses were administered to beneficiaries. The Centre had pulled up Bihar for its low vaccination in the past. Bihar is the second last state after Uttar Pradesh in terms of vaccination. It has inoculated around 18% of its 7.22 crore target population, most having been administered the first dose only so far. As many as 4.78 crore people in the 18-45 years age group and another 2.44 crore have to be vaccinated against coronavirus. State health officials, however, defended themselves, saying the supply of vaccines from the Centre was insufficient, which resulted in low vaccination coverage. Though supply of vaccines has increased every month since the national Covid-19 vaccination drive began on January 16, it dipped in May as compared to the vaccines made available in April, said officials. Bihar is scheduled to receive 36,47,230 doses of vaccines this month, of which it had already received 1,28,17,460 till Wednesday. Another 6 lakh doses of vaccine were scheduled to arrive, which would leave the state with a stock of 13 lakh doses of vaccine. Amid flood fears, Bihar is desperate to speed up its vaccination drive. Chief minister Nitish Kumar has already asked officials to complete inoculating the remaining six crore people in the next six months. The countrywide vaccination drive was rolled out on 16 January this year. The vaccination of healthcare workers (HCWs) and frontline workers (FLWs) began from February 2. The second phase of Covid-19 vaccination commenced from March 1 for those who are over 60 years of age and for people aged 45 and above with specified co-morbid conditions. The third phase was rolled out from April 1. Executive director State Health Society, Bihar, Manoj Kumar, also the state’s nodal officer for vaccination, did not respond to phone calls or text message.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-overshot-other-states-in-single-day-shots-on-june-16-101623946518314.html
17-06-2021||Patna||Paras is new LJP chief, announces his faction; Paswan trashes move||PATNA: The bitter power struggle for control of Bihar’s Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) escalated on Thursday as the faction led by Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras was named the party chief by his faction in Patna while his nephew and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan’s faction rushed to the Election Commission in Delhi to stop Paras from using the LJP symbol and flag at their meetings.Chirag Paswan also declared that he has convened a meeting of the party’s national executive committee on Sunday, his counter to Paras who was said to have been unanimously elected the party’s national president by the national executive a few hours earlier. Paswan, according to news agency PTI, insisted that the meeting held in Patna was “unconstitutional” and lacked a quorum.The Paras faction of the party “removed” Chirag Paswan from the president’s post on Tuesday, and appointed a loyalist, Suraj Bhan Singh as working president. On Thursday, Singh announced that 68-year-old Paras was the party’s new president.“I will try to take the party forward by taking all sections of the society together,” Paras told reporters in Patna soon after his faction named him the new party chief.The crisis in the LJP began on Sunday, when five LJP Lok Sabha members replaced Chirag Paswan with Paras. On Monday, the Lok Sabha secretariat issued a notification recognising Paras as the parliamentary party chief.Paras blamed his nephew for the family feud. “When a nephew becomes dictator, what will the uncle do,” he said, rubbishing Paswan’s insistence earlier that he could not be removed as the party chief.Paras said nobody can be the party president for life in a democratic system. “The president has to be elected after a period. According to the constitution of our party, the president has to be elected every 2-3 years,” he said.Chirag Paswan’s last-minute move to convene a meeting of the national executive is seen as a show of strength to counter the perception that he, after losing control of the parliamentary party, had lost the support of the executive as well. A LJP leader said Paswan could also use the proceedings of the proposed meeting on Sunday to back up its case before the Election Commission.Patna high court lawyer Amit Shrivastava said as and when the dispute formally reaches the Election Commission, the panel would be guided by the LJP constitution.“The provisions and clauses in the LJP’s party constitution will be the determining factor in deciding whether any decision regarding appointment or termination of membership taken by the party top leaders is right or wrong, if any of the parties move court. The LJP is a recognised party by the Election Commission and is guided by the party constitution,” said Shrivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/paras-is-new-ljp-chief-announces-his-faction-paswan-trashes-move-101623945259560.html

17-06-2021||Lucknow||BSP a banyan tree, won’t wilt, says Maya’s nephew Akash||Akash Anand, nephew of party president Mayawati, is fast emerging as the youth face of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).Appointed national coordinator of the BSP in 2019, Akash, 26, had been managing party affairs in various states after the party broke ties with the Samajwadi Party.With the BSP chief launching fresh attack on the Samajwadi Party over engineering split in the party, Akash, in a tweet on Thursday, said, the BSP was not a plant that had grown in a pot and will dry up if water was not given for a while.“In fact, BSP is a banyan tree, if one branch of which is cut, thousands of other branches grow on their own,” he said.Reminding the people of the development and welfare schemes launched by the BSP government in Uttar Pradesh, he said criminals were put behind the bar, the officers used to be present in their office on time, they also used to visit the villages to review the progress of the development projects.“Good governance had become synonymous with Mayawati,” he said.Insisting that the BSP is with the farmers, Akash reminded how Mayawati had been urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to withdraw the three farm laws. “The farmers have also realized that BSP is their only well-wisher party,” he said. In a separate tweet, he called upon the youths to work with missionary zeal to bring the BSP to power again.“It is the duty of the youths in the party to accomplish the mission of the party,” he said while urging other to join him.Welcoming the alliance of the BSP with Shiromani Akali Dal for Punjab assembly election, he urged the party workers to work hard for the victory of the alliance in the 2022 assembly election.The party workers should support the alliance whole heartedly by joining the election campaign with the alliance partner, he said.He had campaigned for the BSP-SP alliance in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.However, after the defeat of the alliance, he had been maintaining low profile.While Mayawati and national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra can be seen managing the party affairs, many insist, Akash is working from behind the curtains.“It is he who finalizes the meetings with alliance partners, collects feedback from office-bearers and reviews the meetings organised by the zonal coordinators in various districts. He is present in the meetings of the party leaders organised under the chairmanship of Mayawati,” said a BSP leader. An MBA from a prestigious institute in London, Akash is assisting the party national president in drawing the election campaign strategy for the assembly election.During 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he campaigned for the BSP and had addressed joint rallies with SP chief Akhilesh Yadav.To thwart the challenge posed by Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, the BSP had projected Akash as the youth face of the party, the BSP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bsp-a-banyan-tree-won-t-wilt-says-maya-s-nephew-akash-101623944838662.html

Wanted in the region for a number of crimes, Bhullar was killed in an encounter in Kolkata on June 9.His father, Bhupinder Singh, a retired police inspector, had demanded that Bhullar’s autopsy be conducted again, either at the PGIMER Chandigarh; AIIMS, Delhi; or some independent medical institute, to the know the exact details and nature of the injuries caused to him. The first postmortem was conducted at Kolkata. The father had claimed that Bhullar was killed in a fake encounter, which according to him was substantiated from the injuries that were noticed on his son’s dead body.The bench of justice Manjari Nehru Kaul dismissed the plea observing that it was not maintainable before this court. It said that in view of the fact that the first postmortem was conducted in Kolkata, it would be beyond the jurisdiction of this court to issue any directions. Bhupinder Singh’s counsel had also argued that as the dead body was lying at Ferozepur, the jurisdiction of this court could be invoked. However, court was of the view that one cannot lose sight of the fact that the plea impugnes the first postmortem, which was conducted at Kolkata, beyond the jurisdiction of this court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-dismisses-plea-for-gangster-jaipal-bhullar-s-second-autopsy-101623944418607.html

I have written twice or thrice to the Prime Minister seeking his withdrawal from the state,” Mamata said.The chief minister has shared a strained relationship with Bengal governor Dhankhar since his appointment and her party has often accused the governor of acting as a mouthpiece of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on multiple occasions. Dhankhar has continually alleged that the TMC was involved in retributive post-poll violence in Bengal and claimed that several BJP workers have lost their lives due to the violence. Mamata on Thursday called the governor ‘Centre’s man’.State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said the chief minister has no respect for the Constitution in response to her comments. “The governor is doing the right thing, and that is why the TMC dispensation does not like it. The Centre appoints him, and it is obvious that he has to report various developments to the Union government,” Dilip Ghosh said.Jagdeep Dhankhar met Union ministers Prahlad Joshi and Prahlad Singh Patel on Wednesday. He also met with President Ram Nath Kovind at Rashtrapati Bhavan and is scheduled to meet home minister Amit Shah as well.Several TMC leaders, including MP Mahua Moitra, asked the governor not to return to the state. “Uncle Ji is going to Delhi on June 15, he says. Do us a favour WB Governor Sahib - don't come back,” the Lok Sabha MP said via a tweet.Sougata Ray said that the governor has violated every constitutional norm. “According to our Constitution, the governor is supposed to act as per the instructions of the council of ministers headed by the chief minister. But he doesn't follow any such norm and acts as per his whims and fancies,” Ray said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/wrote-thrice-to-pm-seeking-governor-s-withdrawal-mamata-on-jagdeep-dhankhar-101623940874723.html

17-06-2021||Kolkata||Centre trying to bulldoze Twitter, my govt as it failed to control them: Mamata||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday lashed out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over its allegations of post-poll violence in the state and the Centre’s efforts “to control” Twitter. She dismissed allegations of political violence in the state as BJP’s gimmicks while saying the Centre was trying to bulldoze Twitter after failing to control it. The government and Twitter have faced off over the new guidelines that require digital companies to change how they regulate content, appoint nodal officers for compliance and grievance redressal, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification. There have also been disagreements over the government’s orders to Twitter to take down posts. Twitter has also raised concerns regarding the safety of its employees in the country and police intimidation.Also Read | Centre removes Mukul Roy’s Z-category VIP security coverBanerjee said the Centre cannot also control her and hence also wants to bulldoze her government and the Trinamool Congress (TMC)...”“It is unfortunate. One day there will be an end to this.”The BJP and TMC have been continued to target each other since Banerjee swept back to power last month after a bitter campaign during the assembly polls in March and April. West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and BJP leaders have been attacking TMC over the alleged post-poll violence.Banerjee insisted there is no political violence. “It is BJP’s gimmick. There is no atmosphere of violence that they (BJP) are trying to create. We do not support violence and if there are one or two sporadic incidents, strong action is taken,” said Banerjee. “These are all pre-planned incidents. BJP is not ashamed of the humiliating defeat and is sending central agencies. This is their habit. Soon after the election results were declared and law and order were still with the ECI (Election Commission of India), there were some incidents. But not all were political and there were some incidents of personal enmity,” she added.BJP leaders insisted even though incidents of post-poll violence have come down after the Calcutta high court’s intervention, but they are still continuing. “There is hardly any law and order in West Bengal. After the court intervened, the scale of post-poll violence may have reduced but it is still going on. Some of our workers, who abandoned their houses and fled, are now returning. But still, a few thousand workers have not been able to return home because of violence,” said state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh.Dhankhar, who is on a three-day visit to Delhi, was scheduled to meet Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday evening. On June 15, Suvendu Adhikari, BJP leader and leader of the opposition, met Dhankhar before the governor slammed the state administration over the alleged post-poll violence. He also wrote to Banerjee the same day saying the state was witnessing the worst form of post-poll violence after Independence.Banerjee was dismissive about Dhankhar’s meetings, saying he may meet anybody. “You can scold a child to stop him...He (Dhankhar) is their (BJP) man.”Ghosh questioned what the harm is if as governor, he meets the President, Prime Minister and Union home minister. “Why he met them and what was discussed is up to them. It is his duty to report to the Centre. TMC is suffering from a mental problem which aggravates whenever they see the governor,” said Ghosh..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/centre-trying-to-bulldoze-twitter-my-govt-as-it-failed-to-control-them-mamata-101623934097857.html

17-06-2021||Delhi||Pet care amid Covid scare: Challenges and the road ahead||The fierce second wave of Covid-19 saw a sharp spike in cases, impacting many more people than the first wave. The constant fear of contracting the virus, curbs restricting outdoor movement and a work-life balance that’s gone for a toss – all these factors increased irritability and anxiety among many individuals. However, the ill-effects of the pandemic aren’t just limited to humans but have also led to many challenges for our four-legged friends.“Since April first week, I haven’t been able to take my dog for a walk which was routine for him for years. It isn’t easy for him to adjust to this new life, where almost all of his time is spent indoors. There is a palpable change in his behaviour but I don’t think we can do much about it. My father had contracted the virus in May, and it was a very tough phase. Luckily other family members have managed to stay safe from the virus so far, but we don’t want to take any risk. We are trying to avoid going out as much as possible,” says Kriti Gupta, 42, a homemaker from Noida.Amit Thakur, a certified dog walker from New Delhi, agrees that there has been a significant decline in demand for his services and most pet parents have safety concerns that often make them override the essential needs of their pets. “Most people don’t want to let us in their homes or take their dogs for walk, as they think that any outsider can be a carrier of the virus. But one has to understand that this virus is going to remain for quite some time, and one shouldn’t compromise with the needs of their pets. A walk is quite an important activity for a dog, and they wait for that throughout the day. Putting it completely on hold may impact their well-being,” says Thakur, adding, “Agar logon ko khud baahar jaane mein dikkat hai to wo professional dog walkers ki help le sakte hain. We are following all precautions.”The challenges have only intensified for those individuals who had got their first pet in recent months. Even as they were adapting to the new responsibilities, the pandemic-induced changes caught them completely off-guard. Sharing her experience, Swadha Jaiswal, 29, a freelance academician from Delhi says, “We got a German Shepherd pup in February first week. He is our first pet and has brought so much happiness into our lives. Every pet requires a lot of vaccines in their initial months of growing up and this pandemic has made it so difficult. In May we had to miss his vaccination schedule as we were both down with Covid. Now our veterinarian has said the whole cycle of that medicine has to be repeated again, as we can’t have such long gap in the booster dose.”And even though pet care and veterinary centres remained open during the lockdown — as part of essential services — most of them catered to only essential requirements. Akshay Mahendru, 35, owner of Pet Point, New Delhi, that provides pet grooming facilities, boarding options as well as veterinary solutions, says, “Being part of the essential services, our centre wasn’t closed, but yes, given the enormity of the second wave of Covid-19, we had heightened our precautions. We do not entertain walk-ins and only important services are available on appointment basis. As vaccination of pets, deworming etc are important services, hence we continued to provide these. Parents accompanying their pets aren’t allowed beyond a specific point to ensure social distancing and masks have been mandatory for long.”Also read: Ratan Tata helps paralysed dog find a forever homeTalking of how it impacted their services, he adds, “Start of the summer is when most pets come for grooming; however, given the Covid scare we are only able to serve those for whom it’s medically important. We are only providing essential services for now but wish for things to get back to normal soon, so that we can start serving our four-legged friends with complete efficiency.”Elaborating on the challenges of the new normal, New Delhi-based veterinarian Dr Abhay Triguna, 51, says, “While our clinics remained operational, it was a challenge for many pet parents to come to us as many policemen aren’t well sensitised about the need of pets and why even a vet visit is very important. Moreover, unlike super-speciality hospitals, most veterinary clinics in the country don’t have large waiting areas. In the dimensions that they function, maintaining social distancing is a challenge. Yet, every veterinarian did their best to serve during the pandemic. We would take the history of pet parents too and ask them if they have any symptoms of Covid.”He further shares that pandemic-induced precautions are still being followed and they are avoiding routine surgeries at the moment. “What’s important is being done but if something can be delayed without aggravating the problem, then that’s also an option. Telephonic consultation is also available for the issues that don’t require a physical examination,” he adds.While the pandemic situation seems to be improving now, experts have warned of a third wave, urging people to not be complacent about Covid-19. So, how does one ensure good care of their pets without comprising with one’s own health and safety? Dr Sanjeev Kumar, 34, from Panacea clinic, New Delhi, shares, “We have to strike a balance between ensuring our safety and well-being of our pets. Dogs are sensitive to sanitisers and using them in spray form may impact their lungs, hence that should be avoided. Also, if one is taking them for a walk outside the house, make sure to wash and clean their legs before getting them inside. If someone in the family has Covid-19, ensure that the pets too – dogs or cats – maintain same distance from them as you do. Following precautions may help us all sail through these trying times.”Author tweets: @kediashish||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pet-care-amid-covid-scare-challenges-and-the-road-ahead-101623932119325.html

17-06-2021||Chandigarh||Homebound in pandemic, extrovert turns homebody||Coronavirus has brought life, as we knew it, to a standstill and the phrase, twiddling your thumbs, has taken on a whole new significance. Today, confined to the house, I can vouch for its popularity and success because it has come to play an important role in passing the interminable hours between rising in the morning and going to bed at night.During the day, you are likely to come across me staring into space in a state of solitude induced numbness, attempting to induce my lethargic brain into a state of meditation, as advised with nauseating regularity on television and newspapers. I am unable to decode the convoluted and inscrutable expressions like, become one with one’s self and plumb your inner worth, because try as I may, I have arrived at the conclusion that I am not made to be a Solitary Reaper. To bloom and thrive, I need a garden full of company.I have this recurring image where I probably make a complete spectacle of myself, babble incoherently and fall hysterically on the shoulders of family and friends, one by one, once this nightmare of a lockdown is over but it will be one outburst to cherish.Incarcerated in our houses, as with all inmates in similar circumstances elsewhere, things are coming to a head. My dubious energies, having no other outlet are getting focused on the family and they are not a little displeased by this new avatar I have metamorphosed into.The gardener avoids me, shrinking into the bushes and is suddenly tone deaf to my shouts. He looks at me warily, taken aback, while I pace the garden, inspecting flower beds and pointing out the weeds with the fervour of the military and also now question him on his daily output. He obviously preferred me only complimenting his efforts on the foliage and resents my remarks on his idle loitering and numerous tea breaks.The helps in the kitchen are at their wits’ end because of my new interest in the mysterious depths of the refrigerator from where I unearth forgotten jars and boxes of leftovers. I interrogate them on the whereabouts of old utensils, and forgotten crockery which come to mind now that I am homebound. I am at loggerheads with them constantly while they mutter to each other, probably also ruing the day Covid made us all a part of a lockdown and transformed me into a nit-picking shrew.My children, working from home, are tearing their hair out because they find me constantly knocking or peering into their rooms, commenting on the disarray and mess, offering and cajoling with a tray of fruit or juice in hand. “Mom, you cannot just barge in like that with your questions, I am in a meeting,” is the exasperated refrain. They haven’t seen their mother so domesticated in quite a while.Husband dear is the only one gloating. The lockdown has managed to achieve what he never could. pallavisingh358@gmail.comThe writer is a Jalandhar-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/homebound-in-pandemic-extrovert-turns-homebody-101623929717540.html
17-06-2021||Pune||Taste of life: Bulk-buying set-up rescues kitchen at Poona’s “Fever Hall”||When Dr Phillipe Gousse, a Scottish doctor, was asked to move to King George’s War Hospital in Poona from Bangalore, in August 1917, the First World War was nearing its end. The Great War had not reached the shores of India and he expected to go back to Europe in a couple of years. He was a “camp-follower” – a slightly derogatory term used for doctors of the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), whose job it was to tend to wounded soldiers, and look after the sanitation of camps.Gousse and five other doctors from the RAMC rented a bungalow, known locally as the “Fever Hall”, next to the Empress Gardens, from a Parsi race-horse owner. The hospital still had no patients in it. The inhabitants of Fever Hall had employed a butler who was paid a fixed sum per head. It was left to him to feed them, engage and pay a cook, and supply everything down to wood for the kitchen fire and oil for the lamps. This arrangement, which sounded simple, was supposed to save the doctors from all the worries of housekeeping. What actually happened was that the butler underpaid the cook, bought the very cheapest meat, and smothered it in strong curry powder. “It is curry for breakfast, curry for lunch and curry for dinner, and bellyache all night”, wrote Gousse in his diary.So Gousse sacked both the butler and the cook, and engaged a new butler, Wharri Ahmed, a dignified gentleman with a flowing black beard, and a “Goanese” cook. The cook wore a “topee” on his head so that he could claim to be of European descent. His name was Manuel Joao Domingo Francisco de Xavier Jesus de Gama.Every morning Wharri and Gousse discussed the day’s bill of fare. It was a tiresome and irritating proceeding, “for there was not only the language difficulty, but the utterly incomprehensible oriental mind of Wharri, and to Wharri, no doubt, my own equally inscrutable occidental one”, wrote Gousse. Anyhow, the new system worked well for a time and the doctors got somewhat tasty European food, properly cooked by Manuel de Gama.There were, however, drawbacks to this method. It was annoying to have to order daily small amounts of everything and check the cost of each item in Wharri’s account, and there was also the expense. Gousse wrote in his diary – “Wharri’s daily household accounts cover the whole one side of a sheet of foolscap paper, and contains thirty-two separate items with the price of each. When it is remembered that the Indian rupee was worth one shilling and six pence, an anna one penny and a pie about a third of a farthing, the reader of these lines, will appreciate the trouble I had brought upon myself”.“Here are a few entries as a sample of the rest, in the order in which Wharri wrote them down: Soopa – 3 annas, Underpart Beef – 8 annas, Kiddney – 2 annas, New green stuff – 9 pies, Frut – 4 annas, passly and salry – 6 pies, oranges – 5 annas, curry stuff – 2 annas, cocknut – 2 annas, munkeynut – 1 anna, char col – 1 anna, 6 pies, firewood – 12 annas, oil 2 bottles – 4 annas, 6 pies, coolis – 6 annas”.Wharri also received an infinitesimal commission from the vendor at the bazaar, where he spent his mornings shopping and bargaining. Wearied of this retail way of housekeeping, Gousse decided to step in. Instead of buying a day’s supply of firewood at a time for the cook’s fire for twelve annas and paying two “coolies” six annas to bring it to the bungalow from the bazaar, he purchased a whole bullock-cart load of firewood for twelve rupees and paid twelve annas for having it brought up. “In the old way this firewood would have cost us fifteen rupees and about six rupees for the coolies who brought a little quantity each day”, Gousse wrote.From then on, everything was purchased in the same way, even things which they used in small quantities daily, such as charcoal, salt, and curry powder. Under the new regime, Gousse bought all the necessary articles in bulk, kept them locked up, and served out what was wanted each morning. This method was troublesome too, but much less so than the daily wrangling over each account, and their household expenses fell by nearly 50 per cent.The Australian nurses employed in the Camp and the hospital soon learned about Gousse’s modus operandi and decided to buy groceries in bulk.Europeans living in British India often found themselves in similar situations. The Raj had introduced a completely new style of kitchen to India, with upright stoves and shelves, benches, sinks. The cook had to learn to work at the bench to chop vegetables and meats. The butler had to learn English in order to understand what the memsahib wanted for lunch. They both had to struggle with the European dishes and their ingredients.In the eyes of both the European memsahib and her Indian butler, “Europe articles” held great prestige. These were available at the local “Europe shop”, of which there was one in almost every army station. To help the memsahib (and her butler), Raj-era cookbooks and domestic manuals often contained a “Bazaar list”. This list was meant to help with the purchases. It contained names of common ingredients and their prices. There were separate lists for bazaars in Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore, and Deolali.I have found only a couple of cookbooks that had the “Bazaar list” to be used in Poona. More about them next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-bulk-buying-set-up-rescues-kitchen-at-poona-s-fever-hall-101623928999248.html
17-06-2021||Patna||3 men arrested in Bihar’s Buxar village for printing fake currency notes at home: Cop||PATNA: Three men have been arrested in a Bihar village on charges of printing counterfeit currency notes, police said on Thursday after recovering fake notes of the face value of ₹3.12 lakh from a house in Buxar district’s Manoharpur village.Police said the prime accused, Dharmendra Singh, ran a private security agency in Hyderabad but returned to his village about 200 km from state capital Patna due to the Covid-19 lockdown in August last year. The other two accused are his father, Subhash Singh, and uncle, Ashok Singh.But he had been planning to get into the fake currency notes enterprise for longer.Buxar superintendent of police Neeraj Singh said Dharmendra told the police that he saw some YouTube videos and initially experimented with printing fake currency notes using a laptop and printer while he was still in Hyderabad. But he wasn’t satisfied with the notes that he printed.Before returning home in August, he was able to get in touch with some people who taught him a few tricks over a three-month period including guiding him on the choice of paper to use, Neeraj Singh said.Once back home, police said Dharmendra Singh appears to have started out by printing counterfeit notes of smaller denominations that he circulated without arousing suspicions of the villagers. Gradually, he gained the confidence to print notes with the face value of ₹200 and ₹500 as well.One of the tricks that he had learnt was printing images that looked similar to the watermark of Mahatma Gandhi and the ₹500 in bold green on the notes.Police said Dharmendra Singh has claimed in his initial interrogation that he started circulating the fake notes only a couple of months earlier. But the police aren’t so sure. The Buxar SP said this was an aspect, like many others, which the police still have to investigate in detail. Another aspect, he said, was the role played by the individuals in Hyderabad identified by Dharmendra Singh. A team would be sent to Hyderabad to gather further details, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/3-men-arrested-in-bihar-s-buxar-village-for-printing-fake-currency-notes-at-homecop-101623928997759.html

The appointments have been made to strengthen the cell up to the grassroots level. The unit was formed following JD(U)’s poor performance in the assembly election on the lines of its minority, Dalit, Mahadalit, and Other Backward Class cells.The upper castes have traditionally been known as the main support base of JD(U)’s ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“...the exercise is to strengthen the party up to the panchayat level by adding upper caste to the party fold by making them aware of the Nitish Kumar government’s inclusive development and welfare schemes and how it has helped all the sections in equal measure. Now district executive committees will be formed in the second phase,” said Nitish Kumar Tantan, the upper caste cell chief.Also Read | Bihar municipal staff fraudulently withdraws money using dead man’s ATM cardJD(U) managed to win just 44 seats in the 2020 election and BJP 74 seats in the 243 member House. The National Democratic Alliance has a wafer-thin majority in the assembly.Tantan said the JD(U) is the first party to have formed an upper caste cell and that it was committed to inclusive politics. He said they will complete the exercise of the cell’s expansion in a few weeks. “The (Covid-19) lockdown slowed our work a bit, but we are focused, and all senior functionaries of the party are supporting it. Many people are showing interest in working for the cell.”Former AN Sinha Institute of Social Studies director DM Diwakar said the JD(U) was trying to consolidate its position by reaching out to upper castes, which it feels have been alienated. “How the BJP will take it, time will tell, as this section has been traditionally known to be with it. It will also be interesting to watch how far the JD(U) is able to convince the upper castes. For that, it will have to match political action with government efforts by giving space to upper caste in regular appointments, else it will be difficult to reach out the way the party wants.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jdu-works-on-expansion-of-its-upper-caste-cell-101623925577086.html
17-06-2021||Mumbai||'Overconfidence': Shiv Sena replies to Nana Patole's 'will go solo' comment||Shiv Sena on Thursday attacked Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole over his statement where he had said that the party will contest the next Assembly polls on its own and not as a part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition.Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana said Patole’s political ambition is not wrong but to become the chief minister of Maharashtra, he has to ensure that he has 145 MLAs with him as ‘parliamentary democracy is a game of political figures’. The editorial said that without having a majority such comments are a display of ‘over-confidence’.“Parliamentary democracy is a game of majority figures. Those who will win the game will sit on the throne. There is nothing wrong in having desire and ambition in politics. Hence there is no point in such walking and talking if you do not have a majority figure on your side,” the editorial said.“The Maharashtra Congress chief is a grassroots leader. Patole asserted that he will bring his party to power by contesting alone in the upcoming elections and will make a Congress leader the chief minister. This announcement has been made in over-confidence. He has no doubt regarding who will be the chief minister,” the editorial further added.Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole on Monday said he was ready to contest as the party’s chief ministerial candidate citing Congress’ displeasure over the profile given to the party in the MVA alliance.The editorial likened Patole to Fadnavis and said that the former chief minister was confident of a return but his party’s majority of 105 went in vain as Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Shiv Sena formed an alliance. Shiv Sena also attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and reminded them that nothing is permanent in politics. Saamna’s criticism of the BJP was in response to Union minister Raosaheb Danve’s recent comments where it had said that BJP too will contest the polls alone.Shiv Sena while pointing out that Congress is an important part of the alliance also said that if both national parties decide to fight the polls alone then the party has to join hands with the NCP.“Nana Patole's party is in power in Maharashtra. Congress is an important component in Maha Vikas Aghadi. The 2024 Lok Sabha and assembly polls are far away, but major political parties are suddenly talking of contesting the elections independently. Are there any plans to have mid-term polls?” the editorial said.“If the main political parties are speaking of going alone, the other two parties - Shiv Sena and NCP - will have to join hands in the interest of the state. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar have already spoken about it,” Shiv Sena further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/overconfidence-shiv-sena-replies-to-nana-patole-s-will-go-solo-comment-101623924149065.html

The two, Vaddu Nageshwar Reddy and Vaddu Pratap Reddy, 43, were associated with the opposition Telegu Desam Party (TDP). Sridhar, a local police officer who uses one name, said three of their relatives were also injured in the attack.Police cited the initial probe and said the brothers were going to a crematorium to collect the ashes of their cousin, who died three days ago, when a group of five to six men waylaid them. The assailants first knocked the brothers down and then attacked them with sharp weapons including sickles. “The brothers died on the spot, while the three relatives sustained injuries,” Sridhar said. He said murders were a fallout of a feud they were involved with a family in their village for decades. “There had been no major incidents of factional violence in the last 25 years in the village. We are probing the reasons for today’s killings,” Sridhar said.Also Read | Six Maoists shot dead in Andhra encounterDeputy police superintendent Chidananda Reddy rushed to the murder scene with an additional police force to ensure there were no retaliatory attacks.Sridhar said they have registered a case of murder and attempt to murder even as the assailants were on the run. “We have launched a manhunt,” he said.TDP leader and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu expressed shock over the killings and said the law-and-order situation in the state has completely deteriorated.

In the recording, Lokesh Kumar Jangid, the IAS officer, is heard expressing displeasure over his transfer to the principal secretary of the General Administration Department (GAD).Jangid, 35, who at the time was the additional collector of Barwani district in Madhya Pradesh, was on May 31 transferred to the state capital of Bhopal as the mission director of city-based Rajya Shiksha Kendra. This, according to Jangid, was his ninth transfer in just 54 months.“I shared the audio with four IAS colleagues on personal chats. This was done after the transfer orders were issued in writing by the GAD and updated on its website. I shared it in good faith and in a personal capacity when they asked me why I was suddenly transferred,” Jangid said. "Since I was not given any reason, I shared the audio with them saying this is what the GAD principal secretary told me. I didn’t share it on any group," Jangid said about the 30-second clip.The officer said he did not violate the conduct rules as the information was neither confidential nor personal in nature. He also denied that it was a violation of the GAD principal secretary’s privacy. “This audio was from May 31 and I was issued notice on Wednesday, after a gap of 17 days. I would respond to the notice at my own time,” the 2014-batch officer, who hails from Maharashtra’s Parbhani, said.However, Deepti Gaur Mukherjee, the GAD’s principal secretary, said Jangid’s conduct was a breach of her privacy. “Jangid has been asked to reply in seven days. The matter pertains to a conversation he had with me. My job is only to tell the officers that they’ve been transferred. But he taped the conversation, which is an unbecoming act from a government officer,” Mukherjee said.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-ias-officer-records-conversation-with-official-shares-it-on-messaging-app-101623922672264.html

The government's decision to intervene in the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines for private hospitals comes after the Karnataka High Court on May 27 raised concern to the central government over the bulk purchases of vaccines at unregulated prices by private hospitals, reported Prajavani. The high court pointed out that over 25 per cent of the production has been procured by private players.“There was a lack of transparency in procurement of vaccines,” reported Prajavani.According to data, only 20.33 per cent of the state's residents has been given the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and merely 4.33 per cent have got both doses. Demand for vaccination against Covid-19 has increased in the state following the relaxation of lockdown, the newspaper noted.Private hospitals have been allowed to purchase 266 million Covid-19 vaccine doses but the health department of the state's statistics have data of only 156 million doses. According to an official of the health department, private hospitals will be able to procure only 25 per cent of the production from Monday onwards and it will be supplied by the government.The additional chief secretary of the health department, Javed Akhtar, said the department will ask private hospitals to regulate the volume of Covid-19 vaccines well in advance which will be then sent forward for approval to the central government, Prajavani e-paper reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-to-procure-vaccines-for-private-hospitals-as-well-report-101623918668471.html

Two years ago, they shifted base to Karimganj after receiving threats from some local groups, he said. Also Read | Don’t ‘slacken’ vaccination drive against Covid-19: Assam CM tells officialsA fan of the Fast & Furious movies, Haque always wanted to drive sports cars such as Ferrari or Lamborghini. Last year’s lockdown forced him to sit at home with no work. That’s when he started toying with the idea of building his own Lamborghini replica. “First, I bought a second-hand Maruti Swift and removed its body. I started building parts of a Lamborghini model by watching YouTube videos,” he said. “But I didn’t realise that it would be a costly affair. From buying the engine and the raw material to giving it the final shape, the total expenditure was around ₹620,000. I am not sure if even developing such a replica is legal. I want to drive the car across the state and I hope the police won’t arrest me and seize my car.”Haque has become quite a local celebrity after posting pictures of his car on social media. He is willing to sell the car, but only to someone equally passionate about it. “I am willing to sell this car but it has to be someone who understands the value of this model. Only a sports enthusiast can relate to my passion,” he said.Next on his wish list is a ‘Ferrari’. He said, “I am planning to make a customised replica of Ferrari soon. But it all depends on my Lamborghini experience. If the local administration grants me the permission to ride this car, I am going to make more of these models.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-mechanic-turns-own-car-into-lamborghini-replica-101623922217767.html

Deputy commissioner of police (south east) RP Meena, said that on June 12, a police team raided a building (acting on a tip) and found about 10 men inside an illegal hookah bar. Police arrested them and cracked down on similar illegal hookah bars operating in the area.

Police said that while dine-in services are allowed at 50% seating capacity, running hookah bars in Delhi is illegal and the people caught had flouted social distancing norms.“Twenty customers and two cafe owners were arrested and three hookahs were seized from the spot. The owners of the cafe were identified as Karan Nayyar and Aditya Dixit,” said DCP Meena.Police said the four owners do not have a record. The four told police they opened the hookah bars to make money. In 2017, hookah bars were banned by the Delhi government, which cited studies showing a hookah was more harmful than a cigarette. The government had asked civic agencies to cancel the licence of eateries that continued to serve hookahs. But the civic agencies find it a challenge to implement it as many eateries still run hookah bars surreptitiously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-raid-2-illegal-hookah-bars-arrest-over-2-dozen-people-101623917895994.html

The federal agency has so far arrested five persons in connection with the two cases, including three Mumbai police officers - controversial police officer Sachin Vaze, Riyazuddin Kazi, Vaze’s colleague at the Criminal Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai police crime branch, and inspector Sunil Mane.Besides, NIA has also arrested former police constable Vinayak More, a life convict in the fake encounter killing of Lakhan Bhaiya, and cricket bookie Naresh Gor, both of whom allegedly helped Vaze execute the suspected murder.Vaze was originally in charge of the investigation of the Antilia explosives scare case, but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, the owner of the SUV who had reported it stolen on February 17, 2021. It subsequently emerged that Vaze had borrowed the SUV in November and returned it in early February.According to NIA, Mane was present at the criminal intelligence unit of the Mumbai crime branch on March 2 and 3, when Vaze purportedly tried to convince Hiran to take the blame for placing the explosives-laden SUV near Antilia. NIA officers claimed that Vaze had assured the trader that he will get Hiran out on bail in a few days. The plan to eliminate him was allegedly hatched after he refused to get arrested in the case.NIA has also claimed that it was Mane who had made the last call to the victim around 8.30pm on March 4 and had drawn him out of his Thane home on the pretext of a meeting along Ghodbunder Road.Meanwhile, Mane’s lawyer Aditya Gore moved an application seeking permission to meet him in prison. The plea will be heard on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-scare-nia-searches-former-encounter-specialist-s-residence-101623909614807.html
17-06-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata waterlogged due to overnight heavy rains||Several parts of Kolkata reported waterlogging on Thursday morning following heavy overnight rains. The early morning high tide in Hooghly river added to the problem. “The western parts of the city experienced a downpour. There was also a high tide in the river and the lock-gates, which allow the storm water to drain out, had to be kept shut. As a result, several areas were submerged in knee-deep in water,” said a senior official of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC). The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional office in Kolkata reported around 144mm of rain till Thursday morning. According to the data shared by the KMC, the rain was heavier in the southern and western parts of the city. While Behala received around 163 mm rain, Mominpore and Kalighat received around 179 mm and 168 mm rain respectively. Compared to this, Salt Lake and Dum Dum recorded only around 73mm and 51mm rain respectively. “Because of the high tide, the lock gates had to be shut down from 4am to 8am amid the rain. The water level in the streets has begun receding now that the lock gates have been opened. But the gates would again have to be closed from 4pm to 8pm because of the high tide. If there is more rain then, there would be waterlogging again,” said the KMC official cited above. Park Street, Camac Street, MG Road, College Street, Minto Park, Theatre Road, Behala, Park Circus, Southern Avenue were all submerged in knee- to waist-deep water. The IMD has warned of more rains across West Bengal on Thursday and Friday. Kolkata too is expected to receive moderate rain with one or two spells of heavy rain. Heavy rain is also expected in north Bengal and adjoining Sikkim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/kolkata-waterlogged-due-to-overnight-heavy-rains-101623909494670.html
17-06-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata shopping malls reopen after 45 days, get mixed reception||The malls in Kolkata received a mixed reaction on Wednesday when the facilities reopened after being closed for 45 days due to restrictions imposed by the West Bengal government to check the spread of coronavirus.As the Covid situation improved, the state administration allowed malls to operate with 25% staff and a maximum of 30% footfall capacity from 11 am to 6 pm for stores and 8 pm for restaurants.Mall managers said all employees deployed on Wednesday are vaccinated and the premises have been sanitised."About 90% of stores opened. Vibes are positive but footfall is not very high due to lack of public transport and restriction on movement of private cars," Acropolis Mall head K Vijayan said.South City mall management said they received a better response this time than the first day of the reopening after lockdown 1."We had a footfall of around 10,000 today which is higher in comparison with the first day of previous unlock when we had received about 7,000 footfalls. Sales were also higher by 15-18% than the previous unlock. The trend is very positive," South City head Manmohan Bagree said.A few managers said that malls that have a good catchment of visitors did well compared to standalone malls due to curbs on transport facilities.Malls do not foresee footfall restriction hurting their business at least for now as actual footfall is far lower than respective permitted numbers."We encourage the visit of only serious shoppers. All new malls have footfall scanners so managing 30% of capacity will not be difficult," Bagree said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/kolkata-shopping-malls-reopen-after-45-days-get-mixed-reception-101623906136174.html

He added that while Friday has been fixed for such hearings, it could be extended to two days later.He said this should save time and money spent in travelling to district headquarters to meet senior police officers and also safeguard people from getting infected by Sars-Cov-2.“This practice will also make senior police officers more approachable to the people,” Md Intikhab, a social activist said, appreciating the initiative.However, some residents feared the initiative may not deliver its objective due to perceived lack of cooperation from local police stations. “The idea is good but at police stations everybody knows what happens” said Md Jahangir, a resident of Dighalbank area in the district.However, the SP said the programme was also meant to keep a close watch over policing in the rural and remote areas and police stations had been directed to ensure its success. “There is a network problem at some police stations but it will be resolved soon and if police officers at police stations don’t cooperate with people, stringent action will be taken against them,” SP Kumar Ashish said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/kishanganj-police-to-become-1st-in-bihar-to-hear-public-grievances-virtually-101623904034374.html

17-06-2021||Patna||Bihar speeds up seed distribution for early sowing of paddy||With Bihar experiencing early monsoon, the agriculture department aims to distribute subsidised seeds to registered farmers including at their doorstep by June 25 to ensure early sowing of paddy as part of the state’s climate resilient agriculture programme. It is also encouraging crop diversity to guard farmers against losses caused by damages to conventional crops due to exigencies of weather.The department has set the target of distributing 113,000 quintal seeds (mainly paddy) for the kharif season, of which, 37,000 quintal has been distributed including delivery of around 10,000 quintal at farmers’ doorsteps, a programme launched last year.Officials in the department said 1.443 million farmers have applied online for subsidised seed or its home delivery. Last year in the kharif season, 53194 quintal subsidized seed was distributed among 680,466 farmers, including delivery of 3,805 quintals of seed to 49,241 farmers at their doorstep.“Our subsidised seeds distribution programme plus the doorstep delivery of seeds to farmers has evoked huge response especially in the last one month during the lockdown. We have kept the target of providing seeds to 1.50 lakh farmers at their doorstep this year in the kharif season, which is much higher than last year,” said N Saravana Kumar, secretary, agriculture department. The seed distribution budget this year is ₹90 crore as against ₹76 crore last year, officials said.Kumar said the department is hoping for a good kharif crop this year due to early rains and the government’s impetus on seed distribution to help farmers sow the paddy crop early.“If there is early sowing, the harvesting of kharif crop will be timely and will subsequently, help in early sowing of the rabi crop. We are expecting to check the stubble burning by farmers by ensuring the timeline of crop cycle is maintained. We have managed to bring about a change in mindsets by explaining the advantages of early sowing to farmers,” Kumar added.Bihar is targeting to produce around 7 million metric tonnes of rice in 30.37 lakh hectares of land this fiscal. Last kharif season, the state produced 6.827 million metric tonnes of rice, 435,000 metric tonnes of maize and 48,500 metric tonnes of pulses, as per the third estimate released in April this year.Besides, the agriculture department is this year providing subsidized seed for coarse cereals like soyabean, linseed, sesame so that farmers take up multi crop production in kharif and rabi seasons. “Our emphasis is to enable farmers to go for crop diversity to tackle any exigency like floods, drought or damages to conventional crops,” said another agriculture officer.Bihar government has procured 456,000 metric tonnes of wheat till June 15 from farmers in the current rabi season. On Wednesday, chief minister Nitish Kumar, expressed happiness over the higher procurement of wheat.“In my review meeting on June 12, there was an expectation that 350,000 metric tonnes of wheat would be procured by June 15. But it is a matter of joy that 456,000 metric tonnes has been procured. This is an encouraging achievement. We will increase the procurement of wheat and rice more next year so that farmers get proper prices,” Kumar said. He said ₹6,736 crore was given to farmers for procurement of 3.558 million metric tonnes of paddy this year.Bihar had extended the deadline of wheat procurement from May 31st to June 15 due to low procurement. The state was targeting to procure 7 lakh metric tonnes of wheat following harvesting of rabi crops this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-speeds-up-seed-distribution-for-early-sowing-of-paddy-101623899474651.html

Total number of beneficiaries in the age group for which inoculation was rolled out only about a month ago, was just over 29 lakhs. Only a little more than 5,000 people in this age group have taken both shots. The number of shots administered during the day has been the highest for the state ever since inoculation drive began in January this year. The feat was achieved through events like a "mega inoculation" drive carried out in Patna district where a target of 43,500 jabs across all administrative blocks had been set by Chandrashekhar Singh, the District Magistrate. Last week, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had announced that six crore people of the state will be vaccinated in the next six months. Total population of the state is about 13 crore.

17-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Landmark, with only a bit of land||It’s a mishmash of canvas and cloth. The wooden counter is so weathered by the years that it is of no colour. In the lockdown, the empty stall looked like a superfluous debris of yesteryear. In a heavy storm some days ago, the canvas roof collapsed (see left-side photo).A few days after the lockdown, the self-proclaimed Sultani Hotel in Hazrat Nizamuddin Basti is back in business—its roof restored with a new canvas. It is astonishing that one of Delhi’s best halwa-paratha establishments has such a provisional appearance.“Because it’s on the footpath, we can’t make it pucca,” explains Abdul Salim, the owner—better known as Ustad, or master cook. The stall was founded 40 years ago by his “walid saheb”, his father. “My father, late Abdul Rahim, was a khandani cook... his own father was a cook, and his grandfather too.” The founder, his son explains, came from Shahjahanpur in UP, and settled his base on this central Delhi spot. But the establishment was mobile, and would each year travel across various cities in UP, stopping by for a few days in the annual melas, or fairs, taking place across towns such as Aligarh and Bulandshahr, and of course in the famous Nauchandi Mela of Meerut. “The melas have ended with the coronavirus,” says Mr Salim.The stall has two other cooks—they sit on the counter facing the lane that goes straight to poet Ghalib’s tomb. The halwa-paratha arranged on the counter looks more monumental than the Barakhamba monument behind. Studded with cherries, karonda, magaz, the sooji halwa is spread out in a gigantic thaal—the platter holds 40kg of halwa. The paratha, too, is the size of the thaal. Watching it being deep fried in a cauldron makes you at once upload the scene in your mind’s Instagram. The paratha’s dominion keeps decreasing as Mr Salim cuts it bits by bits, with each new order by a new customer.The place is open daily from 10 in the morning to 8 in the evening. The halwa-paratha serving is so filling that you may not need any dinner plans later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-landmark-with-only-a-bit-of-land-101623891415799.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||Old temple land deal was junked before inflated one signed: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Uttar Pradesh in-charge and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh on Wednesday made fresh allegations with new documents regarding the land deal in which a plot worth ₹2 crore was purchased by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust at over ₹18 crore within “minutes”.Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Singh said the previous agreement was cancelled before the new agreement was signed in March 2021, refuting the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) defence that the price increased over a period of time.Singh alleged that Champat Rai, the general secretary of Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, purchased 1.208 hectares of land worth ₹2 crore in Ayodhya’s Bag Bjaisi village for ₹18.5 crore with the help of trust member Anil Mishra. The land, he claimed, was purchased from people who brought it for ₹2 crore minutes before.The AAP has now sought a probe into the matter by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).The temple trust has denied all allegations, saying the land deal was done quickly, but in a transparent manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/old-temple-land-deal-was-junked-before-inflated-one-signed-aap-101623890436543.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||‘Centre nixed Delhi’s O2 deaths panel’, says Manish Sisodia||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday alleged that the Centre has dismissed a committee constituted by the Delhi government to investigate Covid-19 deaths that took place due to a shortage of oxygen in the city over the past two months as the Capital dealt with a brutal fourth wave of infections.Addressing a digital press briefing, Sisodia said the Delhi government on May 27 issued an order setting up a six-member committee to assess every Covid-19 deaths that took place due to a scarcity of oxygen and approve compensation of up to ₹5 lakh for their families. The committee comprised five doctors from Delhi government hospitals and one member from the state director general of health services’ office.“As all of you know, there was an oxygen crunch during the previous Covid-19 wave in Delhi. Oxygen supply was diverted to other places [states]. There were also some deaths due to the lack of oxygen supply in the city. Following the court’s directive, the Delhi government constituted a committee of health experts to look into the incidents and ascertain what led to these deaths. It is extremely saddening that the central government has dismissed this committee. I don’t understand why the central government has an issue with this,” he said.The Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, justified the move, since a similar committee was constituted weeks ahead of the city administration’s order, on the direction of the Supreme Court.Central government spokespersons did not respond to requests seeking comment.Delhi struggled with a shortage of medical oxygen during a crippling fourth Covid-19 wave between April and May, leading to the Supreme Court stepping in and ordering the Centre to ensure the Capital’s oxygen requirements were met.Sisodia on Wednesday also accused the Centre of regularly interfering with state governments, and preventing them from doing “good work”.“As a responsible government, the Delhi government wants to offer compensation of up to ₹5 lakh to the families of those who died and investigate and confirm what led to these deaths. The central government is not letting this happen. Why does it like to obstruct any good step taken or work being done by the state governments? This is not just about Delhi. Many other states including West Bengal, Maharashtra, and Jharkhand are facing different kinds of obstructions from the Centre,” he said.“The decision to dismiss the committee is unreasonable and has no logic. I appeal to the Centre to stop their childish practices. The people of Delhi want the government they elected to work without any obstructions, but the Centre has continued to act as an obstruction to the rights of the people,” he said.The Delhi unit of the BJP, in turn, accused Sisodia of “dirty politics” over compensation for families of Covid-19 patients who “died due to the negligence of the Delhi government”.“The Supreme Court of India already formed a committee with regards to oxygen deaths compensation on May 6, 2021, comprising Dr Randeep Guleria (director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi), Dr Sandeep Budhiraja (director, Max Healthcare) and one joint secretary-level officer each from the Centre and Delhi government. This Supreme Court committee was working for 10 days when the Delhi government jumped in to form a separate committee on May 27,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.The state BJP appealed to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Sisodia to focus on preparing for a potential third wave of Covid-19 and augmenting health infrastructure accordingly.“Today (Wednesday), in light of the fact that a high powered four-member committee with the Delhi government’s representation is working on the matter, the city administration has been asked to disband its committee,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-nixed-delhi-s-o2-deaths-panel-says-manish-sisodia-101623888100951.html

17-06-2021||Chandigarh||2 months on, Ludhiana gyms off to a slack start||With lockdown restrictions easing, gymnasiums across the district reopened on Wednesday, after two months of closure, to a low turnout. As per the latest directions, gymnasiums can reopen at 50% capacity, provided they vaccinate their staff and ensure that Covid protocols such as thorough sanitisation, use of face masks and social distancing are followed. Gymnasium owners are optimistic that business will gradually get back on track and are relieved to have a chance to reach break-even point after being out of business for months.There are around 800 gymnasiums across Ludhiana, which have incurred losses during the lockdown, says Gym Ekta Welfare Association president Monu Sabharwal. “The footfall was low on the first day as people are afraid to step out. We are encouraging our customers to vaccinate themselves and follow all precautions while in the gymnasium. We have set up batches to stagger customers’ entry and prevent crowding,” he said. The proprietor of Concept Fitness Gymnasium, Model Town market, Simardeep Ahluwalia, said, “We were struggling to bear fixed charges such as rent, staff salaries and power bills. With customers beginning to trickle in, we will at least be able to meet our expenses, if not make a profit right away.” A gymnasium goer, Chanpreet Singh of Kundan Nagar, said it was high time that fitness centres were allowed to open as people were facing health issues such as obesity while staying cooped up at home. “People are well aware of the risk and will take all precautions to keep themselves and their families safe,” said Singh. Confused by contradictory orders issued by the state government last week, many gymnasiums had opened their doors on June 14. The government had ordered closure of gymnasiums on April 20 amid a spurt in coronavirus cases across the state. Gymnasium owners had been demanding that the order be rolled back since the last week of May citing losses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2-months-on-ludhiana-gyms-off-to-a-slack-start-101623877572898.html
17-06-2021||Chandigarh||Man arrested, mother booked for dowry death in Chandigarh’s Dhanas||A Dhanas resident and his mother were booked for dowry death four days after his wife had allegedly hanged herself, the police said on Wednesday.The accused identified as Budh Ram, alias Deepak, 25, a resident of small flats in EWS Colony, Dhanas, was arrested, while his mother Naina Devi, 46, is yet to be held.The case was registered after the victim’s father, Billguram Gupta of Mauli Jagran, told the police that he had married his eldest daughter in April 2016 to Deepak. After a few days of marriage, however, the husband and his mother started harassing his daughter for more dowry, the complainant said.He added that in 2019, his daughter had lodged a complaint of dowry harassment, but the matter had ended in compromise. But the harassment hadn’t stopped, he said.On June 10 at around 11pm, his daughter had called him crying and urged him to take her back home, allegedly for fear of being killed by the husband. But the complainant along with his family were in Uttar Pradesh at the time, so he reassured his daughter.On June 11, Deepak had called the complainant asking him to take back his daughter. But after sometime, he had called and informed them that their daughter had hanged herself. She was declared brought dead at PGIMER. The victim’s family on Tuesday had held a protest outside Sarangpur police station seeking registration of the case against the accused. A case under Section 304B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code was registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/man-arrested-mother-booked-for-dowry-death-in-chandigarh-s-dhanas-101623877273759.html
17-06-2021||Chandigarh||Dine-in insufficient, open bars for brisk business: Ludhiana restaurateurs||Ludhiana With the government permitting dine-in facility at 50% capacity, hoteliers and restaurateurs had reason to cheer after two months of business being in a slump as they opened their gates to customers on Wednesday.Stakeholders, however, say delivery and dine-in are not enough to recover the losses incurred during the Covid-induced lockdown and have demanded that bars be allowed to reopen as well. The administration has allowed the restaurants to open from Monday to Saturday till 7:30pm, while home delivery of cooked food is allowed till 9pm on all days, except Sunday. Restaurateurs say dine-in will only bring back 30-35% of the business and the sector will remain in the doldrums unless the bars are reopened. Vishal Malhotra, proprietor of Flamme Bois Restaurant, Pakhowal Road, says, “The announcement has undoubtedly come as a relief for the sector but the restaurant business mostly depends on bars. We might be able to meet our expenses now, but the sector will truly be on the track of recovery once the bars open.” Hoteliers say the timings leave much to be desired as most customers visit their establishments after 8pm. With most of their staff already vaccinated, hoteliers say they should be allowed to at least stay open till 10pm. The turnout in restaurants also remains low with people wary of stepping out. Amarjit Singh, who owns Green Hotel on Railway Station Road, says the footfall in the hotels is less than 5%. “Opening restaurants till 7:30pm will not make any major difference as most customers have dinner only after 8pm.”Owner of Club 69ml, South city Area, Bonny, says, “The government should allow us to reopen bars as we are already expecting a third wave, which may cause another lockdown to be imposed. The government should give us a chance to earn profits so that we may survive through the third wave.”Struggling to make ends meet and forced to pay fixed charges including rent, salaries, power bills even during the lockdown period, he hotels and restaurant owners demanded that the government announce a relief package for the sector. Hotel And Restaurant Association president Amarvir Singh said the hospitality sector has been among the worst affected during the pandemic. “We have sought monetary relief in terms of property tax, fixed charges on power supply, and bar fee, but no relief has been provided as yet. The government should open bars at the earliest.” Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal stages protest, wants Sunday lockdown lifted (BOX)  With lockdown restrictions gradually easing, Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal (PPBM) members staged a protest against the state government’s decision to continue with Sunday lockdown at Ghas Mandi on Wednesday.The traders raised slogans against the government and said the lockdown and curfew had caused considerable financial losses to both traders and industrialists. They said if the Sunday lockdown was not lifted, protests will be staged across Punjab over the next three days.Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal general secretary Sunil Mehra said, “We are glad that all traders have been allowed to open their shops till 7.30pm from Monday to Saturday. However, wholesale shops in Chaura Bazaar, Akalgarh Market and Gandhinagar Market witness more footfall on Sunday than any other day of the week and customers from other districts also visit the shops for bulk shopping.”The district administration has said the Sunday lockdown will remain in force as per the state government’s instructions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dinein-insufficient-open-bars-for-brisk-business-ludhiana-restaurateurs-101623877272661.html

17-06-2021||Chandigarh||Gangster out on bail shot dead in Ambala||A day after a 35-year-old criminal out on bail was shot dead by two assailants near Hathikhana Mandir in Ambala Cantt, police are still clueless about the shooters’ identity.Victim Jeetu, alias Diwakar, who ran a dairy business, succumbed to multiple bullet injuries at the civil hospital. After the autopsy report, police said that seven shots had hit him.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP, Cantt) Ram Kumar said, “Five police teams are on the assailants’ trail, but none has been arrested so far. A probe is on and we expect a breakthrough soon.”The CCTV footage of the incident showed that multiple shots were fired by the bike-borne assailants. The victim was first shot in the back, then in the chest and head, until he collapsed, the police said.Victim’s sister Hans Kumari told the police that Jeetu and their servant Kapil had gone near the temple to tie the cows. “Kapil returned on a bike and told us that Jeetu was lying injured on the road. We took him to a hospital, but he died during treatment. I am sure that he was shot by Saurabh, alias Mau, of Chidimaar Mohalla, and Arjun, alias Ajju, of Kumhar Mohalla,” she said.Victim attacked previously in 2019Kumari said that in December 2019, the two shooters along with seven of their accomplices, had attacked her brother.An FIR was lodged under Sections 34, 120B and 302 of the Indian Penal Code and under the Arms Act against the duo and seven others identified as Shammi Pandit, Sonu, alias Gajju, Monu Daggar, Aman Gappu, Arjit, Splendor Singh and Randheer.Investigators believe that Mau and Ajju are the prime accused in the case, who had earlier tried to kill Jeetu in 2019 when he was released on bail in a kidnapping case, but he had survived the attack after treatment at PGIMER.“Jeetu had also attacked Mau’s gang members in 2017-18 and this murder is a result of ego clash. Both the parties have a criminal background of kidnapping, scuffle and other crimes. Shooters were out on bail too,” said one of the investigating officers, pleading anonymity.In another gang war between Bhupi Rana and Lawrence Bishnoi, blood was spilt on the streets of Ambala on March 25 as two men were shot dead and two were seriously injured. The shooters are still at large.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gangster-out-on-bail-shot-dead-in-ambala-101623876972946.html

17-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh yet to get fully functional waste processing plant||It has been a year since the municipal corporation (MC) took over the Sector-25 solid waste processing plant from a private firm, but the city is yet to get a fully functional facility. The MC General House had terminated Jaypee Group’s contract in March last year and taken over the plant in June. The MC’s contention for the takeover was that despite being set up in 2005, the plant had not been operating to its optimum capacity. A report by the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, in August last year, had stated that at the time the plant was working at only 10% of its 500 metric tonne (MT) capacity. MC commissioner KK Yadav, however, said that even after being operated by the civic body, it was processing only 70 MT waste. The city produces nearly 450MT of solid waste per day. Devinder Singh Babla, Congress councillor and leader of opposition, said, “The private firm running it was processing much more waste than what the MC is doing, which as per MC’s own records is around 30 MT.” The plant when run by the firm was processing anywhere between 120 MT to 200 MT waste per day, as per MC officials. Even as the MC continues to dump most of its solid waste without processing, the decision to finalise the technology for upgrading the plant has not been taken yet. Set up new plant: IIT Roorkee report Recommending setting up of a new “modern” waste processing plant at the existing site in Dadumajra, IIT in its report had stated that even after the existing machinery is repaired, the plant could at best run at only 40% of its total capacity. The plant was constructed in 2008 as per the Municipal Solid Waste, 2000 (MSW), guidelines. The department of civil engineering, IIT Roorkee, in its “Status report of 500 TPD solid waste processing plant, Chandigarh” had stated: “The best way is to set up a new modern 500 TPD (tonnes per day) plant for dry and wet waste treatment in the given plot. For the wet waste stream, biological treatment will be required to meet Solid Waste Management Rules (SWM), 2016.” Why the delayFor nearly 10 months now, the MC has not been able to decide which technology to use to upgrade the plant. Thirteen companies had submitted their expression of interests (EOI) in January this year after an EOI was floated by the MC last year. A technical committee was constituted to examine all options. Detailed presentations were made by the firms and the report was tabled before the MC General House in April this year. No decision was taken. Most councillors had demanded the 13 companies make the presentations to them again. In the next House meeting when the agenda was again tabled, the councillors expressed yet again their inability to fully understand the technologies. They demanded a tour of sites where these technologies were being used. Now, the decision is likely to come after visits to two plants in Delhi, one in Ambala and one in Nasik. On Wednesday, a MC team comprising Mayor, joint commissioner and eight councillors visited two waste processing plants in Delhi on Wednesday. Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said, “We will complete the visits within this month. The technology will be finalised by month-end. If needed, after a special MC House meet, we will finalise and float the tenders in July itself. We expect that by August-end, we will allot the work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-yet-to-get-fully-functional-waste-processing-plant-101623875352713.html

The accused, Anand Yadav, Ansari’s aide, was arrested from Faizabad road on the charges of forgery and cheating for his alleged involvement in the registration of the ambulance, superintendent of police Yamuna Prasad said, adding he had a reward of ₹25,000 on his arrest. The SP said that firearms were carried in the ambulance but didn’t share detail in this regard. Doctor Alka Rai (of Mau’s Shyam Sanjeevani Hospital), who was arrested earlier in connection with the case, told police that that Ansari and his aides, Mujahid and Rajnath Yadav, forced her to sign some documents for getting the ambulance transferred in the name of the hospital. She had also accused them of preparing her forged voter card to get the ambulance registered with the road transportation office (RTO). Rajnath Yadav was arrested on April 4 from Mau and Shyam Sheshnath Rai on April 19. Anand Yadav has confessed the role of other people in this case, the SP said, adding efforts were on to arrest other accused in the case – Mujahid and Shahid – both carrying a reward of ₹25,000 each. On Monday, a Barabanki court had remanded mafia don-turned-BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari to judicial custody in a case of alleged forgery and cheating in the registration of a bulletproof ambulance used to ferry him between courts and jail in Punjab. Barabanki Chief Judicial Magistrate Kamalapati remanded Ansari to a 14-day judicial custody after the local police put the Mau MLA under arrest in the ambulance case and produced him in the court through video-conference from Banda Jail. After having been brought from the Ropar jail in Punjab recently, Ansari was lodged in the Banda jail as an undertrial in a slew of criminal cases. The case against Ansari was registered after it was found that a bulletproof ambulance with a Barabanki number was used to ferry him from Ropar jail to a Mohali court near Chandigarh in an extortion case. The case was filed against Alka Rai at Barabanki’s Kotwali police station in connection with the registration of the ambulance (UP 41 AT 7171) without proper documents and a valid certificate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ansari-ambulance-case-cops-say-vehicle-was-used-to-carry-arms-1-more-arrested-101623875292696.html

The non-permanent teachers said that more than four years had gone by since then, but they were still struggling.The union leaders, Jhujar Singh Sangrur and Ranjit Singh Bhattiwal, said that Captain in 2016 had come to their protest site and promised that once his government came to power, in the very first cabinet meeting they would regularise the services of teachers. “More than four years have passed, but Captain government has not lived up to their promises. So we have decided to hold massive protests till someone from the Captain government comes and gives us assurance. We also demand that our lump sum salary must be increased to ₹40,000,” they added.The employees of the education department and the education board after 5pm were forced to leave their vehicles inside the premises and scale the walls of the office buildings to go back to their homes, as the entry and exit points were seized by the protesting teachers.Till the filing of the report, the teachers were still protesting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/contractual-teachers-seize-control-of-pseb-edu-dept-offices-in-mohali-101623875172973.html

The state also failed to improve the infrastructure and tighten the noose around the transport mafia, due to which the roadways is reeling under losses,” said Singh.Union leaders Jaspal Sharma and Gurkirat Singh said the roadways is continuously running into losses due to the inefficient policies of the state government and few depots are even struggling to get fuel for their buses.

17-06-2021||Chandigarh||It’s mid-June, and Chandigarh’s Sukhna Lake is nearly full||Even as Chandigarh has yet to face the full unfolding of monsoon, Sukhna Lake is already brimming with water within first fortnight of June. On Wednesday, its water level was at 1,156.4 feet, highest in June in the last seven years. Compared to 170.3mm rain during June last year, the city has already received 125.7mm in the month this year following the early arrival of monsoon on June 13.The lake’s flood gates are opened when its water level reaches 1,163 feet. An alert is sounded the moment the level inches towards 1,162 feet. UT chief engineer CB Ojha said, “Generally, the water in the lake recedes between March and June. But the city has recorded good rainfall in the last couple of years. So this year, even before proper advancement of monsoon, the lake is already full of water.” The immediate jump in its levels can also be attributed to the UT engineering department recently releasing upstream water into the lake after the water level on the other side of the inlet gate touched 1,160 feet. The lake is considered to be drying when the water recedes to 1,152 feet, as seen in June 2017. In 2015 and 2016, it was tad higher at 1,153 feet. It rose to 1,155.2 feet in June 2018 and 1,156 feet the next year. Last year too, the water level hovered around 1,155 feet. In August last year, incessant rain in the catchment area had forced the UT officials to open two floodgates of the lake after the water level crossed the danger mark of 1,163 feet. Before this, flood gates were also opened in September 2018, a first since a similar situation was witnessed in 2008. “The water level in the lake crossed the danger mark mainly because of the heavy rainfall in the hilly regions and its catchment areas. The local city’s rain had limited impact,” said Ojha. Synonymous with Chandigarh, Sukhna Lake was created by Le Corbusier in 1958. By 1988, 66% of the original water holding capacity of the lake was lost due to silting. Following this, check dams were constructed in the catchment area. The man-made lake now has a capacity of around 500 hectare metres against the original capacity of over 1,074 hectare metres. On the north side, the lake is surrounded by 26 square-kilometre area of wildlife sanctuary. The high court is also monitoring the protection of the lake after initiating a suo motu petition in 2009. UT asks Mohali to clean up Sukhna ChoeLast year’s opening of flood gates had led to flash floods in the Sukhna Choe, leaving Zirakpur’s Baltana area inundated, and causing damage to many residential and commercial structures. To avoid a repeat, the UT administration has written to Mohali to finish cleaning the choe in its jurisdiction. “The cleaning work in our area is nearing completion. But, if it is not taken up in downstream Mohali, it will again lead to flooding in Zirakpur areas,” said a UT official. The UT engineering department has also deputed three sub-divisional engineers to keep a 24-hour tab on the lake’s water levels, which will be recorded every two hours as monsoon picks up pace in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/its-mid-june-and-chandigarh-s-sukhna-lake-is-nearly-full-101623874757230.html

The third leg was neurologically intact although the power in that leg was compromised.Deep Hospital director Dr Baldeep Singh said the patient’s MRI scan indicated the presence of femur tibia fibula and the knee joint in the additional leg. The expert panel of doctors at the hospital decided to perform a corrective surgery to remove the third leg.The surgery required a multi-disciplinary approach and was carried out by neurosurgeon Dr RK Kaushal, orthopaedic surgeon Dr Mohammad Yamin, paediatrics surgeon Dr RJ Singh and senior plastic surgery consultant Dr RavindraTah.Dr Kaushal said, “There was a spinal cord connection of the third leg with an associated meningomyelocele (MMC). The MMC was repaired and the nerve connections to the accessory leg were detached carefully sparing the nerve fibres of the normal lower extremities.”“The rudimentary leg showed an additional femur and other lower limb bones, but the shape and anatomy of those bones were not normal. So, the amputation was done extremely carefully keeping in mind the presence of nerve bundles and spinal vertebrae.” said Dr Yamin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-doctors-successfully-remove-infant-s-third-leg-in-six-hr-surgery-101623874752702.html

17-06-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal BJP seeks report card of ministers, legislators||Aiming to win the upcoming bypolls as well as achieve ‘Mission Repeat’ next year, the Himachal Pradesh unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has sought report card from its ministers, legislators and leaders to assess their performance in order to chalk out a strategy accordingly. A three-day review meeting of the party is currently underway at Shimla to assess the government’s efforts in combating the pandemic and plan of action for byelections to Mandi Lok Sabha and Fatehpur and Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly seats likely to be held in August, besides the assembly polls next year. Party sources said the state leadership has sought report card from ministers and the legislators about the work they have done in the last more than three years. The party leaders, who contested the 2017 assembly elections but lost, have also been told to submit their report card. Besides, they have been asked to specify plans and goals they have set for their respective constituencies for the remaining 18 months. It has been learnt that the party also discussed the probable candidates for the Mandi Lok Sabha and Fatehpur and Jubbal-Kotkhai assembly segments.Among the candidates in the race for ticket from Mandi are Ajay Rana, Praveen Sharma and Brig Khushal Thakur (retd). Former MP Kripal Singh Parmar is vying for ticket from Fatehpur assembly segment, while Chetan Bragta and Neelam Sirkaik are front-runners from Jubbal-Kotkhai. The party has already appointed in-charge and conveners for Mandi and Fatehpur segments. BJP’s core committee on Wednesday appointed Suresh Bhardwaj as the in-charge for Jubbal-Kotkhai, while Rajeev Bindal would be the coordinator.The Lok Sabha and assembly byelections would be a litmus test for the BJP. The party which was on a winning streak since 2017 suffered a setback in the civic body elections when it lost Palampur and Solan municipal corporations and also fell short of majority in Dharamshala. The only civic body it had a thumping mandate was in Mandi. Moreover, the party is embroiled in an intense infighting. While a letter bomb against a minister has left party red-faced, the faction owing allegiance to former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal has started asserting itself again. Meanwhile, the BJP has also started planning for the elections to the Shimla municipal corporation. One of the oldest civic bodies in the country would be going to polls next year just ahead of assembly elections.The Shimla MC is currently ruled by the BJP. Like ministers and legislators, the party has also sought a report card from the councillors of Shimla MC. Meanwhile, while addressing a press conference, BJP’s chief spokesperson Randhir Sharma said the core committee has reviewed the works done by the party during the pandemic. He said the party workers distributed ration kits to 9,500 households, meals to 15,190 people and masks to 11.78 lakh. Besides, the party legislators and leaders distributed oximeters and thermometers to Covid patients under ‘Seva Hi Sangathan-2’ programme. Sharma said the party has decided to continue the programme. He said June 25 will be observed as a ‘black day’ as emergency was imposed on this day in 1975. Sharma said a virtual meeting of the state working committee will be held on June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-bjp-seeks-report-card-of-ministers-legislators-101623873732539.html

Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda, upon instructions from the state transport commissioner, told the high court bench of justice AG Masih that no orders are likely to be passed till July 2. The court was hearing pleas from dozen-odd transporters who have challenged the show-cause notices issued to them by the transport department.T Earlier, transporters had told court that hearings were going on and orders are likely to be passed on the show-cause notices slapped on them. “It is beyond comprehension that when the pandemic situation is at its worst, instead of adjourning the hearing, the government (transport commissioner) has fixed the same…This not only smacks of mala fide but also shows prejudice and pre-determined mind,” the plea of M/S Rajguru Bus Service said. They claimed that notices amount to review/ recalling of the permits granted earlier for which state transport commissioner does not have any power. The show-cause notices were slapped to cancel variations in original permits allowed to transporters in recent years. The government feels the additions and deletions in routes allowed to transporters, especially during previous regime suits, more to the transporters than public. Thus, these should be cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-decision-likely-on-bus-permits-till-next-month-punjab-to-high-court-101623873675980.html
17-06-2021||Bangalore||K’taka reports 100k more deaths in first 6 months compared to pre-pandemic years: Data||Bengaluru: Compared to pre-pandemic years, Karnataka reported an excess of over 1,00,000 deaths between January 1 and June 15 this year. According to the data from the civil registration system (CRS) of the Registrar of Births and Deaths, in these first six months, Karnataka reported 3,37,000 deaths. While the official website didn’t have data for the year 2020 due to technical issues, the data for years 2018 and 2019 were available. According to the data, between January and June in 2018, 2,24,000 deaths were reported while in 2019, the number of deaths stood at 2,35,000. The figure of 1,02,429 deaths raises concern about underreporting of Covid-19 cases since the excess is around five times more than the government’s Covid-19 death tally. As per the Karnataka health and family welfare department, 21,048 deaths were reported in the first six months of this year. “There is certainly no underreporting in the state. We are releasing the data that is available to us every day. If people are not reporting Covid-related deaths it needs to be looked at,” said a senior health department official, who didn’t want to be named. Despite the denial, the numbers tell a different story. Between 2015 and 2019, on an average, Karnataka issued 4,57,669 death certificates for five years with the number of mortalities showing a gradual increase over the years. As per the data, most of the deaths in the state were reported in Bengaluru city. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has approved 87,082 applications for death certificates from January 1 to June 15, this year. While data on the deaths reported in the BBMP jurisdiction is not provided by the department for the pre-pandemic years, Bengaluru Urban district — which includes BBMP — recorded only 37,195 deaths between January 1 and June 30 in 2019. In 2018, during the same six-month period, Bengaluru Urban recorded 35,262 deaths. A comparison of the cases in the month of June 2019 and 2021 shows a 48.7% increase in the number of deaths. While the pandemic was at its peak, an allegation was levelled against the BBMP for under-reporting Covid deaths. Between March 1 and April 26, the state government reported 1,422 Covid-related deaths in Bengaluru, However, data collected from crematoria showed that 3,104 Covid protocol cremations were done in the same period. The BBMP had then claimed that bodies from neighbouring districts were being buried in the city, to justify the difference in numbers. Karnataka health minister and BBMP commissioner didn’t respond to HT’s calls for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-reports-100k-more-deaths-in-first-6-months-compared-to-pre-pandemic-years-data-101623871631662.html

The newly inaugurated CoEs will help farmers in Karnataka to choose and adopt the technology that suits them best, with the goal of doubling their income,” the statement stated.Karnataka has tried since long to push the Israel model of agriculture to be implemented in the state, especially in the northern parts which are home to the second most arid regions in the country after Rajasthan.The CoE for mango was established under IIAP with a total outlay of ₹198 lakh from the Centre and ₹360 lakh from Karnataka.Karnataka, however, faces extremes of droughts and floods in most parts, leaving a significant number of people with rising debts on account of problems like poor prices for produce, rising input and transport costs and higher pressure on smaller holdings.With most urban centres under various stages of Covid-19 pandemic induced lockdown, a higher number of people have returned to their villages and increased the dependence on agriculture. The new centres of excellence will use advanced technologies like high and ultra-high density planting, rejuvenation, canopy management, automated drip irrigation and fertigation technology among others to help improve yield and the quality of mango, pomegranate and vegetables.The CMO stated that exotic varieties of mango like tommy atkins, kent from Florida & Maya, lilly from Israel have been introduced to know the performance of these varieties & supplying of these planting materials to the farmers.The statement added that 50–55-year-old and unproductive trees have been rejuvenated to increase yield per unit area.The CoE for pomegranate has an outlay of ₹343 lakh from the Centre and ₹156 lakh from the Karnataka government.The CoE for vegetables has an outlay of ₹500 lakh from the Centre and Rs.260 lakh from the state government.The joint venture will, in the future, look at adoption of villages to demonstrate innovation developed in these CoE’s, the CMO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-sets-up-3-centres-of-excellence-under-indo-israel-project-101623871511613.html

17-06-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka BJP in-charge hold talks amid crisis||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Karnataka in-charge, Arun Singh, has started meetings and consultations with leaders amid simmering dissent in the party’s state unit against chief minister BS Yediyurappa.On Wednesday, the first-day of his three-day visit, Singh met all ministers of the Yediyurappa government in the presence of the CM and state BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel in Bengaluru. On Thursday, the meetings will be open to any legislator who wishes to meet him, people aware of the developments said. The party’s core committee meeting will be held on Friday.“Whether it is the party legislator or worker, they should always be aware not to bring any kind of harm to the party. No one should give any such statements, or any actions or talks which will cause harm to the party. They should think before they speak on if it will cause any harm,” Singh said at Wednesday’s meeting, during which Yediyurappa was sitting with him on the dais.The chief minister is confident of remaining power for the remainder of his two-year term, but is fortifying his defences on any move by the party to dislodge him by mobilising support from within the party and by reaching out for support to prominent seers of the Lingayats, the single largest caste group in the state that has firmly backed Yediyurappa in recent years.The rumblings and factionalism within the state government and the BJP have come out in the open in recent weeks, with several leaders seeking the ouster of 78-year-old Yediyurappa.Prominent among them are Basanagouda Patil, CP Yogeshwara and Arvind Bellad, who met senior party leaders to complain against Yediyurappa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/ktaka-bjp-in-charge-hold-talks-amid-crisis-101623871332261.html

Health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu, industries minister Sunder Sham Arora, MPs Mohammad Sadiq, and Jasbir Singh Gill and MLAs Lakhvir Singh Lakha, Sukhwinder Singh Danny, Nazar Singh Manshahia and Surinder Singh and Amritsar Improvement Trust chairman Dinesh Bassi were among the dozen-odd party leaders, who met the CM at his residence, sources said. One of the MLAs said they met him regarding pending works and for expediting ongoing development projects in their areas. “There was also a discussion on the strategy and preparations for the state assembly elections (due early next year),” he said. On Tuesday, the CM had met medical education minister OP Soni, Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu and MLAs Ramanjit Singh Sikki and Navtej Singh Cheema, and Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh. Amarinder has held a series of meetings with ministers, MLAs, MPs and others since the three-member committee set up to resolve infighting in the state unit met 150-odd state leaders to hear their suggestions and grievances. During these one-to-one meetings, several MLAs had complained about the CM’s lack of accessibility and over-reliance on bureaucrats. The CM’s meetings are being seen as an attempt to demonstrate the support he has in the party and dispel the impression about his accessibility. Last week, Amarinder had held meetings with all eight Lok Sabha members of the Congress from Punjab, who reposed faith in his leadership and ability to successfully lead the party. The CM’s detractors are, meanwhile, waiting for the party high command to act. The three-member committee headed by leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge had submitted its report to Congress president Sonia Gandhi a week ago and then briefed Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi on Sunday about their suggestions to end the squabbling in the state. Though there is talk in Congress circles that Amarinder, Navjot Singh Sidhu and two other leaders may be called to Delhi on June 20 and 21 before any decision is taken, one of the committee members and state leaders said this was news to them.KHARGE PANEL MEETS RAHULA three-member Congress committee set up to resolve infighting in the party’s Punjab unit met former president and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi in Delhi on Wednesday for another round of discussion on its report. The panel headed by leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge has All-India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former Delhi MP Jai Prakash Agarwal as members. This was their second meeting with Rahul in four days. AICC general secretary, organisation, KC Venugopal was also present. One of the committee members said the discussion revolved around the options before the party to defuse the factionalism in the state Congress. “The situation is complex due to the rigid stand taken by state leaders involved in the present situation,” another party leader aware of the developments said, indicating that ending the stand-off may take time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amarinder-continues-meetings-with-congress-leaders-101623870912266.html

Four-and-a-half-month after she filed a complaint, the Kunjpura police have registered an FIR (on June 15) under Sections 363, 368, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 34 of the IPC and Sections 80 and 80 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.Jyoti has alleged that before birth of her child, she had come in contact with Dr DP Shrivastav and his gynaecologist wife Dr Sashibala through a friend for consultation.Four days after his birth at Karnal’s KCGMCH, Dr Shrivastav told her that the baby has respiratory problems and will get better treatment at their hospital in Meerut free of cost. They took her signatures on a blank stamp paper and took the baby.A month later, she reached the couple who refused to return the child and threatened her of dire consequences, she alleged.In February this year, she approached the Karnal police and her complaint was forwarded to protection-cum-prohibition officer Rajni Gupta.Rajni said the doctor couple had taken the child and handed him over to a Meerut-based couple - Vishal and Neha Shrivastav.“Vishal said he adopted the boy with consent of Jyoti and had agreed to return the boy on June 1. But did not turn up, following which an FIR was registered,” she said.In the birth certificate of the child from Meerut MC, Vishal had claimed that Neha gave birth to the child at home.Rajni said as per the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, the child cannot be adopted just by inking an agreement.She said Dr Srivastva did not join the probe and his advocate sent a legal notice claiming that the woman had taken the boy to Meerut and given him to the couple with consent.On delay in registration of FIR, Karnal SP Ganga Ram Punia said the FIR was registered after investigation by the protection officer as the accused doctor did not record his statement.The SP said the Karnal police will soon reach Meerut and the child will be handed over to the woman.When HT contacted Dr Shrivastava on registration of FIR against him and his wife, their daughter responded and said, “We don’t know why the FIR is registered against them. They were only witness to the adoption. The FIR should be registered against people who adopted the baby.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/9-months-on-karnal-woman-yet-to-get-her-child-back-101623870851608.html
17-06-2021||Other||Yamunanagar turmeric farmers lack market||Despite availability of subsidised seeds and better moisture content for its growth, number of farmers opting for turmeric farming has gone down in Yamunanagar. Reason –absence of a sale mechanism.As per the horticulture department, turmeric farming is done on foothills of the Shivalik range passing through Chhachhrauli, Sadhaura and Bilaspur blocks. Nearly 30% farmers here are engaged in turmeric farming, but none on a large scale.District horticulture consultant Dr Davinder Singh said the crop requires less water and as the region is an industrial hub of plywood and related products, turmeric is grown along with poplar trees as intercropping provides good binding support.“Sowing starts in March-April and cultivation after 12 months. Here, farming is done on roughly 300 acre and crop yield is nearly 35 quintal each acre,” Singh said. Area under turmeric crop was 500 acre in 2014-15.Most farmers HT spoke to highlighted the poor seed quality and closure of state’s only turmeric processing plant in 2016 which was set up in Raduar in 2009.Narwail Singh Lobyo, of Ledi village, said, “My family did this farming for five years on four acre along with poplar and Eucalyptus trees, but had to abandon it. Post-cultivation, turmeric has to be peeled, boiled and roasted but even then it went unsold.”Another farmer from Jairampur Khalsa village, Narinder, said he had grown the crop on six acre in 2013 and had to give it to his friends after not getting a suitable price.Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni) district president Sanju Gudiana said before the plant’s closure, there used to be bumper crop of turmeric in district.“Now, there is no centre to sell the crop and turmeric farming is reduced for personal use,” he said.In February this year, state tourism minister and Jagadhri MLA Kanwar Pal, who was on an official tour of Kerala, announced that spice farming will be promoted in the Shivalik region.An official, pleading anonymity, said quality parameters of the seed started failing due to water content. Later, farmers were asked to bring the crop after boiling and roasting it and due to the labour cost involved, its farming diminished.Pawan Kamboj, manager of the plant, said since the plant was customised in manual mode, higher authorities asked us to modernise it and start automatic processing.“The state government has approved automation and the plant is expected to restart after tender is floated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/yamunanagar-turmeric-farmers-lack-market-101623870793845.html
17-06-2021||Chandigarh||Paddy fields of 8 Haryana districts to demonstrate new technique to grow rice||Farmers of eight districts of Haryana under the watch of experts will grow paddy on 20,000 acre during the current paddy cultivation season, in what is the first-of-its-kind incentive-driven push to promote direct-seeded rice (DSR) technique.Farmers opting for this cost-effective and less water-consuming method of growing rice will receive ₹5,000 per acre. Each farmer opting for this scheme can grow the crop using DSR technique on maximum 2.5 acre. This piece of land will be called ‘demonstration plot’ to popularise the technique among the peasants.Growing rice by sowing the seed is already prevalent in few rice-producing pockets of Haryana. The government is promoting this alternative way of cultivating rice instead of transplanting paddy by developing demonstration plots.The traditional paddy transplantation practice is labour and water intensive, while DSR doesn’t require labour and water of the size and scale of the traditional method and can reduce water consumption and production cost by 15-20%.“It’s a new initiative. Our target is to give incentive and support to 20,000 farmers and exposure and education to one lakh farmers,” said Dr Sumita Misra, additional chief secretary (ACS, agriculture), who has held meetings with district agriculture officials, directing them to achieve the DSR targets and educate farmers about the technique.This money-linked scheme will be implemented in Ambala, Yamunanagar, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Panipat, Sonepat and Jind districts.Dr Misra said DSR-cultivated paddy demonstration plots will spread across 4,000 acre in Kaithal, 3,000 acre each in Karnal and Kurukshetra, and 2,000 acre each in Sonepat, Panipat, Jind, Ambala and Yamunanagar.An official of the agriculture department said 6,500 farmers have already given consent for the scheme.Sources say the state government has also received in principle approval from the Centre for this policy under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY-Raftar).The RKVY is an umbrella scheme for development of agriculture and allows states to choose their own agriculture and allied sector development activities.Official say basmati rice can be grown as DSR under non-puddle conditions and it can be done in almost all type of soils suitable for rice growing. The sowing is done in second and third week of June.Without hand holding of government, Sukhwinder Singh, of Rasulpur village in Kaithal, has planted seven acre using DSR method as water table of his area is going down. “If the yield remains good this year, next year I will plant my entire 50-acre using DSR method,” he said.Another farmer, Ajay Kumar, who owns 12 acre in Radauri village of Yamunanagar, said he has dumped the DSR technique after four years as it requires more labourers and herbicides. “The yield was equal to traditional method, but uncontrolled weed was a major headache in DSR technique,” he said.GOVT INITIATIVESLinking promotion of DSR technique with financial help is yet another policy decision of Haryana government to nudge farmers to opt for crop diversification or reduce area under paddy cultivation or go for eco-friendly farming techniques.Under ‘Mera Pani, Meri Virasat’ policy, farmers switching over to alternate crop in place of paddy are paid ₹7,000 per acre incentive.Under ‘Kheti Khaali, Fir Bhi Khushali’, ₹7,000 per acre incentive is given to farmers if they do not grow any crop in their field during the paddy season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/paddy-fields-of-8-haryana-districts-to-demonstrate-new-technique-to-grow-rice-101623870732844.html
17-06-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks state to probe and explain how politician, actor got Remdesivir||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state to conduct a thorough inquiry into the alleged supply of Covid essential drugs by MLA Zeeshan Siddiqui and actor Sonu Sood from BDR Charitable Trust at Mazagaon and the pharmacy in Lifeline Hospital at Goregaon (East), respectively, and to find out how these two entities got the injections while supply of Remdesivir was solely at the prerogative of the Central government. The court also sought details on the research reports that indicated that smokers are more susceptible to Covid-19 and asked the Mumbai civic body about measures initiated to provide shelter and basic facilities to the homeless and pavement dwellers during the pandemic. A division bench of justice SP Deshmukh and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing a bunch of public interest litigations (PIL) filed by advocate Sneha Marjadi, activist Nilesh Navlakha and others on various issues pertaining to Covid management during the second wave and availability of drugs to treat mucormycosis, was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhaoni that the state had filed a reply to the queries raised by the court in the previous hearing. While responding to the query on how Siddique and Sood had provided injections like Remdesivir, Kumbhakoni submitted the inquiry into both the cases had revealed that while Siddique had directed people to procure the injections from the charitable trust at Mazagaon, Sood had procured the injections from a pharmacy located in a hospital at Goregaon. He further submitted that a criminal case had been registered against the trust while further probe into the pharmacy revealed that the injections were procured from the Cipla godown at Bhiwandi. When the court questioned why only the charitable trust and its trustees were booked and not Siddique, Kumbhakoni responded that the MLA had only diverted people to the trust. “But all this happened at the behest of one person, to direct someone is not an offence? In both these cases, we would expect the government to seriously examine role of the two,” said the bench. The court further said, “When they act as messiah, do they even check if the drugs are spurious? It is very easy that anyone would go to social media and say that I am the person coming to your help. Is it a good situation? The government is doing everything but at the same time you have a parallel agency? We are leaving it to your conscience to examine role of these two?” Kumbhakoni then assured the bench that as a first step they wanted to go to source of matter and then determine individual roles. The AG then responded to the query about smokers being more susceptible to Covid and said there were three reports by foreign researchers based on which an Indian doctor had concluded that smoking did have an effect. The court then sought opinion on what steps could be taken by the government as smokers were more vulnerable and what best possible steps could be taken along with data on how many such patients were admitted and treated. 7,511 mucormycosis cases in state so farThe state while updating the court of the mucormycosis cases informed that there were 7,511 mucormycosis patients till June 15, of which 4,380 were active cases and 675 patients died. On being asked if the deaths were due to the shortage of supply of Amphotericin-B injection, Kumbhakoni submitted that analysis of the deaths was going on. With regards to Mumbai, he submitted that there were 396 active cases, of which 114 were Mumbaiites while 282 were from outside the city. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh informed the bench that the Centre had imported mucormycosis treatment drugs from Gilead, USA and distribution was equitable among states. When the bench asked why only 18,450 vials were supplied between June 8 and 15 while the demand was nearly 17,000 per day, Singh said the drug was being supplied as per availability. Senior counsel Anil Sakhare for Mumbai civic body also informed the bench that there was a shortage of Amphotericin B, following which Kumbhakoni assured it would be taken care of to some extent with the supply of 22,000 vials from June 18 to 20 and 18,000 vials from June 21 to 30 by Haffkine Institute. The bench has posted hearing of the PIL’s to Friday, June 25. Mumbai civic body providing 10,000 packets of foodWhile responding to the query on measures initiated for the homeless and pavement dwellers, the counsel for the Mumbai civic body submitted that it was providing 10,000 packets of food for each meal through individual wards. It added that it also had 24 buses to reach food and basic necessities to the poor and needy thrice a day. The counsel also assured the bench that temporary shelters were being provided for the needy to safeguard them from the rains as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-state-to-probe-and-explain-how-politician-actor-got-remdesivir-101623870431557.html

NIA sought Mane’s custody to confront him with recently arrested accused Santosh Shelar and Anand Jadhav. The federal agency has claimed that the two arrested accused has played a role as conspirators in killing Hiran.Mane was arrested by NIA on April 23 and was remanded in judicial custody on May 13. He has been lodged in Taloja prison since then.On February 25, a Mahindra Scorpio was found abandoned near Antilia, the south Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, with 20 lose gelatin sticks and a threatening note addressed to Ambani family.A case was registered with Gamdevi police station in connection with the episode. Later, on March 5, Hiran, owner of the SUV, was found dead in creek near Mumbra, with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth and his face covered by a scarf. A separate case was registered with Mumbra police in connection with the murder. NIA subsequently took over both the cases and clubbed them for investigation purpose. The agency has so far arrested five persons in connection with the two cases, including three Mumbai Police officers — controversial police officer Sachin Vaze; Riyazuddin Kazi, Vaze’s colleague at the criminal intelligence unit (CIU) of Mumbai Police’s crime branch; and inspector Mane.NIA also arrested former police constable Vinayak More, a life convict in fake encounter killing of Lakhan Bhaiya, and cricket bookie Naresh Gor, both of whom allegedly helped Vaze to execute the suspected murder.Vaze was originally in charge of the investigation of the Antilia explosives scare case, but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran. It subsequently emerged that Vaze had borrowed the SUV in November and returned it in early February.According to NIA, Mane was present at the CIU on March 2 and 3 when Vaze purportedly tried to convince Hiran to take the blame for placing the explosives-laden SUV near Antilia. NIA officers claimed that Vaze had assured the trader to get him out on bail in a few days. The plan to eliminate him was allegedly hatched after he refused to get arrested in the case. NIA also claimed that Mane had made the last call to the victim around 8.30pm on March 4, and had drawn him out of his Thane home on the pretext of a meeting along Ghodbunder Road. Meanwhile, Mane’s lawyer Aditya Gore moved an application seeking permission to meet him in prison. The plea will be heard on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-scare-nia-moves-court-seeking-sunil-mane-s-custody-101623870432141.html

17-06-2021||Other||SC expresses shock over denial of hearing to bail plea, pending for a year||Chandigarh The Supreme Court has expressed its shock over not allowing hearing of a bail matter by the Punjab and Haryana high court, which was pending for over one year. “Normally, we do not interfere with an interim order passed by the high court, but we are constrained to pass the present order as we are shocked to see that the bail application, under Section 439 of the CrPC, is not being listed for hearing for over one year,” the bench of justice Hemant Gupta and justice V Ramasubramanian said, adding that the accused has a right to hearing of his application for bail and the denial of same is an infringement of his rights and liberty assured to him. Under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the high court has special powers regarding consideration of bail. On Tuesday, the SC was hearing a bail plea from Chunni Lal Gaba, a Goraya-based multimillionaire businessman, who is an accused in the Bhola drug racket case of 2013. The matters regarding hearing of this case have been assigned by high court to a special division bench presided over by justice Rajan Gupta after Supreme Court orders. Gaba had filed an appeal stating that a request for hearing of an application for bail is pending since February 28, 2020. “During a pandemic, when all courts are making attempts to hear and decide all matters, non-listing of such an application for bail defeats the administration of justice,” the SC bench observed, adding that under the prevailing pandemic, at least half of the judges should sit on alternative days, so that a hearing is accorded to the person in distress. “Non-listing of application for regular bail, irrespective of seriousness or lack thereof, of the offences attributed to the accused, impinges upon the liberty of the person in custody,” the apex court observed adding that it hoped that the high court will take up the application for bail at an early date. It also asked the registrar general of the high court to bring this order to the notice of the competent authority to take remedial steps at the earliest. Hearings are restricted at the high court due to the Covid-19 outbreak. On many occasions, lawyers have protested against the HC decision of not assigning more benches for virtual mode and delaying resumption of hearing through physical mode. At one point, the Punjab and Haryana high court Bar Association had even demanded the transfer of chief justice, RS Jha over the issue. ******************** BLURB The SC was hearing a bail plea from Chunni Lal Gaba, a Goraya-based multimillionaire businessman, who is an accused in the Bhola drug racket case of 2013 ********************BLURB The SC was hearing a bail plea from Chunni Lal Gaba, a Goraya-based multimillionaire businessman, who is an accused in the Bhola drug racket case of 2013||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sc-expresses-shock-over-denial-of-hearing-to-bail-plea-pending-for-a-year-101623870372404.html
17-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Turtle conservancy project sees record number of Olive Ridley hatchlings this year||A record number of Olive Ridley turtle hatchlings were released back into the ocean by the state forest department’s hatcheries in Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri and Raigad districts this year. At 23,706 hatchlings, this year’s count is nearly twice as much as 2020 when 12,149 hatchlings were released. It also marks the highest number of hatchlings seen in at least six years, since officials began collecting data on the subject.There are five species of sea turtles recorded in Maharashtra, and Olive Ridleys are the only one that nest in the state and have widest population distribution. HT had on May 9 reported that the number of Olive Ridley nests in these districts had doubled this year as compared to 2020. During nesting season which runs from December to March, a total of 451 nests were recorded through field observations, up from 288 recorded during the same period in 2020.The state’s sea turtle conservancy programme involves surveying of turtle nesting sites, excavation of eggs, and their relocation to a nearby hatchery. The hatchery is protected with garden fencing net to keep eggs sade from predators, flooding, and poaching. Subsequently, turtle hatchlings coming out of these nests are released safely to the sea by nest managers.“The number of nests of Olive Ridley turtles in all the three districts increased in 2020-21 as compared to 2019-20. This number fluctuates every year, but there is a specific increasing trend going back to 2014-15. Overall, more turtle hatchlings have been released back to the sea in 2021 than any previous year,” said Harshal Karve, a marine biologist with the Mangrove Foundation, an autonomous organisation under the state forest department.“It will require more study to understand why there has been a sudden jump this year, but my hunch is that this is a result of more than a decade of conservation efforts by the state. Hatchlings that were released from these same areas a few years ago are now coming back to lay their eggs as mature adults,” Karve added.Sea turtle conservancy has been a focus of not only the government, but also NGOs and local communities since the early 2000s. The movement can be attributed almost singularly to the work of an NGO named Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra (SNM), which started a marine turtle conservation programme in 2002 in Ratnagiri’s Velas village. Since then, a range of measures to conserve turtles have been implemented, including removal of ghost fishing nets from deeper waters and setting up of turtle treatment and rehabilitation centres in multiple districts.In 2018, a compensation scheme for fishermen under the Wildlife Protection Act was also implemented, which provides cash incentives to fishermen who may inadvertently catch sea turtles while fishing. So far, 96 Olive Ridleys, 52 green sea turtles, three hawksbill turtles and one leatherback sea turtles have been released under the scheme. A marine respondent group comprising forest department officials was also set up in 2018 to coordinate faster response to stranded cetaceans in Maharashtra, a significant majority of which includes Olive Ridleys.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-turtle-conservancy-project-sees-record-number-of-olive-ridley-hatchlings-this-year-101623870312264.html

Waghela is native of Rajkot and works as labourer, while Shah and Thakur are residents of Mulund and work as broker and television mechanic, respectively. Police said Waghela earlier lived in Mumbai but shifted to his native place in Gujarat a few years ago.According to police, an official of unit 4 got information that few people were allegedly going to illegally sell ambergris in Mulund. Ambergris comes from a species of whale which is endangered and protected under the Wildlife Act. “We informed forest officials. A trap was laid and we intercepted three persons with 2.7 kgs of whale vomit which was red brownish colour,” said a police officer.After confirmation by marine biologists, Mulund police registered a case against the trio under the Wildlife Act. During interrogation the arrested accused revealed that the main accused lives in Gujarat and came to Mumbai two weeks ago and gave the whale vomit to Waghela and his two associates and asked them to look for a buyer. He then left from Mumbai and went back to Gujarat. As per accused’s statement, Gujarat forest department arrested the main accused recently, a said crime branch officer.“We will contact the Gujarat forest department and will verify the facts. The sample of whale vomit has been sent to the forensic department in Kolkata for chemical analysis,” said assistant police inspector Rajesh Patil of the unit 4. The three accused were produced in the court and remanded in police custody till Monday for further investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-crime-branch-arrests-three-with-whale-vomit-worth-2-7-crore-101623870311649.html
17-06-2021||Mumbai||Colleges under University of Mumbai reopen, but still await clarity||Even as the University of Mumbai recently requested all affiliated colleges to start the new academic year online from June 14, colleges are awaiting clarity on certain issues, including fee payment. “Last year, when the pandemic first hit India, several families felt financial strain and were worried about being unable to pay their children’s college fees. This year, too, the situation hasn’t changed, and several students and parents are expecting concessions or fee payment in instalments,” said Anju Kapoor, principal of UPG College, Vile Parle, adding the college is finding it difficult to accommodate all. Last year, the university had requested colleges to cut down their original fee structure and make instalment facility available for students. This year, however, the MU has given no such intimation and colleges, too, feel it’ll be impossible to run the institute without full fees for another consecutive year. Many have decided to defer reopening of college by a week or two to accommodate students who are still to pay fees, so that no one misses lectures once the course commences. “In genuine cases, we are helping students in whatever way possible. In fact, nearly 25% of our batches across courses are yet to pay the fees, so we’ve decided to start skill-based lectures this week and wait for everyone to pay before starting regular lectures,” said Kapoor, adding the college hopes all students pay their fees by next week so lectures can commence for all batches at the same time next week,” she added. Last week, a handful of students of a college in Malad approached the management for concessions in the annual fee, but the college didn’t budge. “We will have to seek some documents from students to confirm their financial status. Last year, we allowed fee payment in instalments and some students had not paid their fee in full until March this year. How will we run our institute without the fees,” asked the principal of the college, on condition of anonymity. Colleges are also still unclear about the admission criteria for first-year undergraduate degree courses, now that Class 12 exams across boards have been scrapped this year. “Autonomous institutes have been demanding to be allowed to conduct admissions separately at their level. This way, we can start the process and complete it soon. However, there is no clarity from the university,” said Naresh Chandra, principal of BK Birla College, Kalyan. MU registrar (in-charge) BN Gaikwad told HT that the university has not yet received any complaints about fees from colleges or Students. “We will, however, release guidelines for this soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/colleges-under-university-of-mumbai-reopen-but-still-await-clarity-101623870251584.html
17-06-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay develops AI platform for real-time video surveillance||A state-of-the-art video surveillance platform developed by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) has found application in military surveillance as well as remote monitoring of social distancing norms violations amid Covid-19 pandemic. The platform Surakshavyuh, initially designed in 2017, has now evolved into an enterprise grade video analytics solution based on machine-learning-enabled technology that can detect physical intrusion and loitering, monitor perimeters and track objects, count crowds and recognise faces, among other features. It was designed under an industry collaboration between the National Center of Excellence in Technology (NCETIS) at IIT-B and SrivisifAI Technologies Pvt Ltd, a Pune-based company working on making artificial intelligence (AI) and video analytics technology affordable for mass consumption. While the team at IIT-B worked on the science behind the tools, SrivisifAI took the product to the market. “For any CCTV surveillance system, the footage needs analysis – either real-time or for retrospective diagnosis. We have developed these solutions with thorough ground studies, research iterations and by developing required algorithms that can alert end-users of products to take requisite actions. This is even as we continue researching to push the frontiers in detection of human-object interaction, unusual events, etc,” said Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Institute Chair Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, who led the team in the project. Unusual human activity includes loitering, sneaking in, intrusion, someone entering and exiting the premises. Surveillance currently primarily depends on CCTV camera footage. “CCTV footage videos are typically subjected to post-mortem analysis for events. What our tool does is give us real-time analysis,” said Ramakrishnan. Apart from Surakshavyuh, the team also offers Jigayasa, an offline analysis solution that works as a video repository and search platform with features such as text search and face search. The two can be used together, too. As an example use case, the models can be used to issue a trigger warning if more than five people gather at one place or if a person is not wearing a mask, features that can be used in the Covid-19 pandemic to detect adherence to rules in public spaces. A pilot project has been set up at the institute campus. Subhasis Chaudhuri, director of IIT-B, said, “Visual surveillance has become commonplace, be it in individual houses or at public places. It is also very important to have proper surveillance at vital installations. We are very happy that IIT-Bombay has come up with a very user-friendly and robust surveillance system, thanks to the effort of our scientists. I hope that various commercial users will also benefit from this system.” The algorithmic and data benchmarking suite called Visiocity provisions for condensing hours’ worth of video into a couple of minutes in a domain specific manner, by preserving key events and vignettes from the original video and removing repetitive visual information. Ramakrishanan said, “There are three solutions to look at, but as all are interdependent or complementing each other, the industry partner SrivisifAI Technologies can offer products and services which are combinations too — such as 3rdAI which is a combination of multiple solutions mentioned above. This is exactly the uniqueness that NCETIS has facilitated — the coming together of academia and industry as very strong partners.”Conventionally, deep machine learning models are trained on large data sets and require lots of computer resources such as multiple graphics processing units, both of which can be expensive. The design of Surakshavyuh is based on Data Efficient Machine Learning — learning with frugal amounts of data and learning efficiently, an attempt by the researchers at IIT-B to train state of the art models in resource constrained environments while minimally affecting the accuracy. “Humans, based on conscious thinking, can be fairer (if they decide to) and based on complex decision making, can be more precise than machines. Machines can be good at recalling, thanks to their memory and consistency in decision making. The data efficient machine learning paradigm that underlies our democratised AI effort in our products is critical to making this collaboration between humans and AI engine,” Ramakrishnan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombay-develops-ai-platform-for-real-time-video-surveillance-101623870072155.html
17-06-2021||Mumbai||Congress MLA writes to party high command against Mumbai party chief Ashok Jagtap||The tradition of infighting in the Mumbai Congress seems to continue with complaints lodged against recently appointed city Congress chief Ashok Jagtap. Congress’s Bandra (East) MLA Zeeshan Siddique has written a letter to party high command, complaining against Jagtap’s partisan approach towards him. Shaikh also alleged that Jagtap did not follow the protocol during public functions and supported party workers who worked against him in 2019 Assembly polls.In the letter to party chief Sonia Gandhi, former chief Rahul Gandhi, Siddique has reportedly alleged that Jagtap, after becoming the Mumbai chief in December last year, appointed local leaders who had worked against him during Assembly polls. The 28-year legislator and son of former minister Baba Siddique has also accused Jagtap of having threatened party workers to not support him during the Mumbai Youth Congress elections held last year.Siddique refused to comment on it while adding that he expects the appropriate steps to be taken by the party leadership. “It would not be appropriate to speak on the internal communication to the party leadership. I am not aware how did it got leaked, but I had marked the copies of the mailed letter to state and Mumbai leaders too,” he said.Jagtap said, “We believe in democracy and the channels to make complaints to high command are always open. I will speak to Siddique to redress his grievances as chief of Mumbai unit. If the party leadership asked me about it, I will explain my stand on it. He is talking about the breach of protocol, but I have been receiving similar complaints against him from the workers from his constituency. Secondly, he has complained for not inviting him at a programme held at BKC recently. He cannot blame me for it, as it was not Mumbai Congress’s event, but was organised by Indian Youth Congress.”He added, “As far as his complaint about me supporting his competitor Suraj Singh Thakur in the Youth Congress elections is concerned, the election was held before I became Mumbai president. As a leader I supported Thakur as I feel he is a better leader, keeping party interest in mind.”Recently, Siddique had a spat with transport minister and Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab for not calling him for an inauguration of vaccination centre in Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-mla-writes-to-party-high-command-against-mumbai-party-chief-ashok-jagtap-101623870071577.html

17-06-2021||Chandigarh||MGNREGA works: Moga DC flags ₹2.5-crore irregularities||The Moga deputy commissioner has red-flagged the purchase of interlocking tiles, sand and other materials worth at least ₹2.5 crore for development works carried out in at least 65 villages of the district under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme. Deputy commissioner Sandeep Hans has asked the rural department officials to scrutinise records after the district administration found information about the material procurement missing from the MGNREGA records. Even mandatory approvals were not taken for starting projects and allotting works to firms, it has come to light.“I have informed the state government about the irregularities in records of material procurement and works worth around ₹2.5 crore under MGNREGA. Though the works have been done, the official concerned did not adhere to the procedure or maintain records,” said Hans. “I have deployed an official to peruse the records. Later, a thorough investigation will be conducted and strict action will be taken against those guilty.” According to officials, the irregularities came to the fore when a few contractors went to court for non-payment of funds against the purchased material. Their payments were stopped because the rural development and panchayat department did not find the relevant records. Out of the 65 villages, 50 fall under Kot Ise Khan block, 10 under Moga-1, four under Moga-2, and one under Baghapurana, said an official, requesting anonymity.  “At some places, the material never reached the villages. At some villages, works were done but there is no mention of labour charges incurred,” he said, adding that irregularities could be up to the tune of ₹8 crore if the administration reviews records of other villages as well.“No approval was taken from my office,” said Moga additional deputy commissioner (development) Subash Chander. “The villages need to pass a resolution and obtain permission from the ADC office. We have sent all case files and court notices to the concerned block development and panchayat officers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mgnrega-works-moga-dc-flags-2-5-crore-irregularities-101623869894734.html
17-06-2021||Chandigarh||New study challenges argument on existence of Saraswati river||A study conducted by the Centre of Excellence for Research on the Saraswati River (CERSR) at Kurukshetra University has concluded that all major archaeological sites in Haryana - Siswal, Rakhigarhi, Banawali, Bhirrana, Kunal, Balu, Thana – were located at a radial distance of less than 500m from the paleochannels of Saraswati or the Drishadwati rivers.A paleochannel is a deposit of sediment filling the course of an ancient river.The study was conducted to find out why only Saraswati river which was spatially sandwiched between Yamuna and Sutlej rivers went into oblivion while all other rivers mentioned in the Rig Veda still exist.The findings of this study have been published in United Kingdom’s peer reviewed SCI International Journal of Archeological Prospection by John Wiley Publishing Group.CERSR director Prof Akshey Rajan Chaudhri, who conducted the study to understand disappearance of Saraswati, said the new findings have shattered the belief that Saraswati river was a paleochannel of old Sutlej river.“This is not a fact. A general belief has been made that Saraswati river was merely 10,000 years old. Research carried out on Ghaggar-Hakra (GH) system which is a further extension of Saraswati river system revealed that the GH system was more than 86,000 years old,” he said.‘HARAPPAN SETTLEMENTS PROSPERED DUE TO SARASWATI’Prof Chaudhri said the Harappan settlements in Haryana and Rajasthan nucleated and prospered in the fertile channel bars and interfluves of this river system.“The presence of significant clay beds indicates that around 14,000 years, 6,000 years and 4,000 years ago there was a weakening of monsoon and drought conditions which resulted in near absence of flow in the channels,” said Prof Chaudhri, who is also the chairman of the geology department.The study ‘Saraswati River in Northern India (Haryana) and its Role in Populating the Harappan Civilisation Sites’ has revealed that Saraswati river paleochannels formed a dense web of inter-connecting channels which were continuously networked for over 2,984km in Haryana.“Saraswati river system has two major paleochannels. One passes through Yamunanagar, Ambala, Kurukshetra, Pehowa, Kaithal, Jind, Fatehabad and Sirsa before entering Hanumangarh in Rajasthan. The other which represented Drishadwati river, a Vedic period tributary of Saraswati, passed through Yamunanagar, Karnal, Panipat, Sonepat, Jind and Hisar districts before passing through Rawatsar in Rajasthan,” said Prof Chaudhri.‘DIVERSION OF CONTRIBUTING CHANNELS CAUSED ABSENCE OF FLOW’The study found that Saraswati river was flowing in Haryana until 1402 AD and then there was a sudden absence of flow in the channel thereafter.This abrupt change appears to be consequence of sudden modification or diversion of contributing channels for constructing five canals (western Yamuna canal) starting from the foothills in Yamunanagar wherein there was a considerable anthropogenic rerouting of streams so as to make water available in Fatehabad and Hisar. “The channels of the Drishadvati river and the Chautang stream have been extensively utilised for routing this canal,” Prof Chaudhri said.“Apart from this, natural factors comprising weakened summer monsoon, shrinkage of glacial cover and melt waters, channel avulsion and channel capture, climate change and tectonic disruption of the input channels in the lesser Himalayan terrain also contributed towards the gradual decay and ultimate extinction of this mega river system,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/new-study-challenges-argument-on-existence-of-saraswati-river-101623869893527.html
17-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab polls: Sidhu, Captain supporters wage war of posters||The war of words between Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and dissident Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu is turning into a war of posters in Amritsar.Days after Amarinder’s local supporters installed hoardings claiming that he is the state’s only captain, hoardings backing Amritsar East MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu have now surfaced in the holy city.The hoardings that carry the former three-time Amritsar MP’s picture claim that “Sara Punjab Sidhu Naal” (whole Punjab is with Sidhu) and have been installed near the historic Hall Gate and a popular mall on the national highway. The two areas fall under Amritsar East, from where Sidhu was elected to the Punjab assembly in 2017, and Amritsar Central, represented by cabinet minister OP Soni.Rajbir Singh Johal, a local Congress worker who has installed the hoardings, said: “Whenever we go out, we hear only one voice that Navjot Singh Sidhu should be the state’s chief minister. He is one person who guards the truth and has the guts to speak against injustice.” Claiming that Sidhu will soon start “visiting people”, he said: “Our captain is only Sidhu”.Sidhu along with some ministers in the state government have been questioning Amarinder’s performance as the chief minister, prompting the party high command to intervene and ask the Punjab unit to accommodate all sections, including the dissident leader. Earlier this month, Amritsar mayor and Captain loyalist Karamjit Singh Rintu and National Student Union of India state president Akashay Sharma had installed big hoardings mentioning “Punjab Da Ik Hi Captain” (Punjab has only one captain) in the holy city, especially in Sidhu’s constituency. Before that, a non-government organisation had pasted Sidhu’s “missing” posters in his constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-polls-sidhu-captain-supporters-wage-war-of-posters-101623869892371.html
17-06-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab BJP plans action against Joshi for outburst on farm laws||The Bharatiya Janata Party is likely to take disciplinary action against former Punjab minister Anil Joshi, who has been critical of the state and central party leadership on their dealing with the ongoing farm protests. According to a senior party functionary, who did not wish to be named, the Punjab BJP will issue a show-cause notice to Joshi for his outburst. “The former minister gave a series of interviews to attack the party on the critical issue of farm laws and minced no words in cornering the party leaders. The state BJP will issue him a notice, asking him as to why no action should be initiated against him in view of his indiscipline,” said the functionary, who is at the helm of affairs.Joshi in his interviews has termed the anger of farmers against the BJP a result of the “utter failure” of the state leadership. He has not only targeted the state leaders by name, but has also slammed the Centre for failing to handle the situation wisely. The former local bodies minister’s outburst has got support from other party colleagues as well. Those who have endorsed his views include former chief parliamentary secretary and former Jalandhar North MLA KD Bhandari, former state youth wing chief Mohit Gupta and state executive member Kamal Chaitley.This has further embarrassed the saffron party, which was already on the back foot on the issue of three contentious farm laws.Joshi has been particularly critical of state BJP Ashwani Sharma and farmer faces Harjit Grewal and Surjit Jyani for giving “wrong feedback” to the party high command on the farmers’ issue.“These leaders give statements against the farmers, who in return attack the common party workers. Our leaders are surrounded by hundreds of security guards, whereas nobody comes when the common worker is attacked,” he had said in a recent interview. Issue discussed with party high command tooThe senior party functionary said the issue was also discussed in the meeting of the state core group leaders held in the national capital on Tuesday.Home minister Amit Shah and BJP national president JP Nadda had chaired the meeting in which the party’s strategy for the 2022 Punjab polls was discussed.“The party high command is of the view that either such leaders (Joshi) should fall in line or face action,” said the party functionary. BJP’s Punjab affairs in-charge and Rajya Sabha member Dushyant Gautam preferred not to say anything on the action being taken against Joshi, but said the former minister should at least recognise what the party has done for him. “It was only because of the BJP that Joshi Ji became the local bodies minister at such a young age. He should think over whether what he is doing in the media is good for the party or not,” said Gautam, adding that Joshi had talked to him three-four days back on the issue. “I even invited him to meet me in person to discuss his grouse, if any. He is yet to turn up,” he said.Joshi, when contacted, said that he would reply to the notice as and when it is issued.“But let me tell you that the party is in such a crisis in Punjab as state leaders target whosoever asks vital questions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-bjp-plans-action-against-joshi-for-outburst-on-farm-laws-101623869832121.html
17-06-2021||Mumbai||BMC plans to increase property tax by 14%; panel doesn’t pass it||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday proposed to increase the property tax by 14%, in a proposal tabled before the civic standing committee. However, the proposal was not passed by the committee. The opposition said it needed more time to study the document and understand its financial burden on common man in the middle of a pandemic, which had led to a loss of many jobs or cuts in salaries, leader of Opposition and Congress corporator Ravi Raja said. The proposal tabled by the assessment and collection department on Wednesday proposed that hotels will get their status changed from commercial to industrial, bringing them relief in various taxes. It also proposed that property tax be calculated as per the ready reckoner rate as of April 1, 2021. With the revised ready reckoner rate, property tax on all properties will go up by approximately 14%. This will not affect the rebate given to properties below 500 sqft. When passed by the standing committee, this revision of rules will be applicable for a period of four years, from April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2025. With this, BMC’s property tax income is expected to go up by ₹1,000 crore, Raja said. As per the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, property tax is revised every five years. The revision can increase the property tax by upto 40%. The last revision in property tax was made in 2015, and the next one was due in 2020. However, due to the pandemic, the revision in 2020 was not done by BMC. As per the proposal, however, the BMC will not revise the property tax rates for these four years, as scheduled by the MMC act, as there is a case pending in Supreme Court and outcome of the case could affect revision rules. The Standing Committee has kept the proposal pending citing that they will need more time to study its impact on citizens. A senior civic officer from the property tax department said, “This proposal is not for increasing the property tax. We are not revising rates as planned every five years. However, we are taking into consideration, the changed ready reckoner rate, which can increase property tax on all properties upto some extent.” The opposition criticised the proposal. Raja said, “With the change in status, hotels will get relief in property tax. However, this proposal will lead to increase in tax for common man. Even if the administration defends the decision by saying it is not revising property tax rates, as scheduled every five years, it should not take a decision that will burden common man. The Congress will oppose this proposal. We did not let it pass today, as we needed more time to study it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bmc-plans-to-increase-property-tax-by-14-panel-doesn-t-pass-it-101623869412558.html
17-06-2021||Mumbai||Maratha outfits begin silent agitation; state invites them to talk||The Maratha community outfits on Wednesday began the next phase of their statewide silent agitation to press for reservation in government jobs and education, which was scrapped by the Supreme Court last month. Responding to the launch of the agitation under the leadership of Rajya Sabha MP Sambhajiraje, which was attended by MPs, MLAs and Opposition leaders, Maharashtra government is expected to meet the Maratha leaders on Thursday to apprise them about the steps taken on legal and administrative fronts.The Supreme Court on May 5 quashed 12% and 13% quota given to Marathas in education and jobs under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, 2018. The state plans to file a review petition in the SC, as recommended by a committee of retired high court judge Dilip Bhosale to study the ruling and recommend a way forward.The protest, termed as silent march, was held at Shahu Samadhi Sthal, the resting place of Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj, a reformer king of the princely state of Kolhapur and a descendent of Maratha warrior king Shivaji, in Kolhapur on Wednesday. Shahu Maharaj, grandson of Rajarshi Shahu and Sammbhajiraje’s father, and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi chief and BR Ambedkar’s grandson Prakash Ambedkar too participated in the protest.The organisers requested the participating politicians to put forth their individual stand and not the agenda of their parties. BJP’s state president Chandrakant Patil was requested by Sambhajiraje to not speak at the protest as it would give a political colour to the protest. Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati demanded immediate steps by the state to restore the reservation and extend the benefits to the community.The community has been holding district-wide meetings and statewide protest to push its demand of restoration of the quota. Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, the face of the community, has announced similar protests in Nashik, Aurangabad, Amravati, Raigad till month-end and a march from Pune to Mumbai in August if the demands are not met by then.“Respecting the request by honorable Sambhajiraje, I did not speak at the protest venue. The organisers have allowed the elected representatives only from Kolhapur to speak. I will speak when it is held in Pune. We will give a memorandum of support from our party,” Chandrakant Patil said.Minister of state for home and Kolhapur’s guardian minister Satej Patil, minister Hasan Mushrif, minister of state Rajendra Yadravkar, MPs Sanjay Mandalik (Shiv Sena), Dhairyasheel Mane (Shiv Sena), MLAs Prakash Awade (independent), Chandrakant Jadhav (Congress), Vinay Kore (Jansurajya Shakti) participated in the protest.Shahu Maharaj said the Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi should clear their stand on reservation. “The state has been doing its job, but there are limitations to their powers on legal grounds. We were told that PM Modi assured the CM Thackeray-led delegation last week to take positive steps on reservation. But Modiji needs to clarify on his stand on reservation to Marathas. Reservation can be restored only by adopting legal options in Parliament and for this, garnering support of all parties and all states is important,” he said.Satej Patil invited Sambhajiraje and other Maratha leaders for talks with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and other senior ministers. “I thank Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati for his amicable stand to not resort to any aggressive protest amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The state is 100% sympathetic towards the demands by the community. We are in favour of strengthening of SARTHI and its district level branches, more funding to Annasaheb Patil Arthik Vikas Mahamandal, expedite the legal proceedings in Kopardi case and filing a review petition in the Supreme Court,” he said.Thackeray, Ajit Pawar, public works minister Ashok Chavan and other senior ministers are expected to meet the Maratha delegation at 5pm on Thursday. It will be followed by the meeting of the cabinet sub-committee headed by Ashok Chavan to take a review of the compliance of the assurances given to the community.Sambhajiraje has demanded review and curative petitions in the Supreme Court, petition to the Central government for the reservation from the Central list and constitution of the state backward class commission. He has also demanded extension on the benefits of the quota to the youths from the community in jobs and education by making special financial and administrative arrangements. He has also demanded that the elected representatives from all parties push the demand for the reservation in ensuing monsoon session of the state legislature.“Even if the state powers to give quota are restored, it would not work, unless the 50% cap on reservation was removed,” said a Congress leader. “We wanted the elected representatives to speak up on their stand on the reservation, as ultimately they have to push it in the state legislature. We are not fully satisfied with the government’s stand,” said Virendra Pawar, one of the organisers of Maratha Kranti Morcha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-outfits-begin-silent-agitation-state-invites-them-to-talk-101623869292669.html

The officer of the Respondent No.7 Contractor, Sharpoorji Pallonji, revealed to the Applicants and other local residents, who were completely taken aback upon the arrival of these machines, that he was here to perform development works upon the direction of the Respondent Fisheries Department,” the NGT has noted in its June 15 order. It has also been alleged by the applicants that the work undertaken is in excess of upgrading the fish landing centre, and “involves new, disproportionate and excessive constructions beyond what the fisherfolk require”. The NGT has not issued individual notices to the respondents in the matter. However, it has constituted a monitoring committee to ensure strict compliance with the environmental management plan (EMP) prepared by the fisheries department, and with the conditions on which the project has been granted environmental and CRZ clearance.The committee will consist of nominees of the MoEFCC, CPCB, MCZMA, SEIAA, Maharashtra pollution control board, forest department the area District Magistrate. The NGT itself has not sought a report from this committee, but has instructed that the minutes of the meeting be uploaded on the website of the MCZMA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/chimbai-work-ngt-forms-monitoring-committee-101623869291526.html
17-06-2021||Mumbai||Sena, BJP workers clash near Sena Bhavan||High-voltage drama was witnessed near Shiv Sena’s headquarters, Shiv Sena Bhavan in Dadar, on Wednesday afternoon, as workers of the Shiv Sena and the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) clashed over the Sena’s criticism of the alleged scam in the land deal for Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Tuesday published an editorial saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi must intervene to ensure there is no “blot of scam” on the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Consequently, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) activists held a protest near Sena Bhavan. The activists alleged Sena workers attacked them after the protest ended. Sena MP and its chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant called the protest a “stunt” and said the clash was a reaction to the attack by BJP workers. BJP leader Ashish Shelar asked the Sena not to attack from behind and challenged the Sena to come “in the battlefield”. Sada Sarvankar, Sena MLA from Mahim and area’s vibhag pramukh, said, “When we got to know that they were planning to come and attack Shiv Sena Bhavan, the Shiv Sainiks (Sena workers) who were in Sena Bhavan came on the streets. They (BJP workers) had picked up stones, bricks and lathis at Raja Bhadhe Chowk [near Sena Bhavan]. We also got to know that some women workers were also coming in the protest, so Sena’s Mahila Aghadi (women’s wing) also came here. They hurled abuses at our workers. It was not correct to hold a protest at Shiv Sena Bhavan. They want to show that Shiv Sena has abandoned Hindutva.” Former city mayor and Sena leader Shraddha Jadhav dismissed the allegation that Sena workers attacked the protesters. “We are cultured and we have morals taught by Balasaheb Thackeray. We did not initiate the clash; they attacked us first,” she said. BJYM activist Akshada Tendulkar said that she was allegedly attacked by Sena workers. Speaking to reporters, she said, “We finished our protest and were heading to our cars parked on the opposite side of the road. They attacked us from behind. I was pushed and my dupatta (scarf) was pulled. They kept attacking us in front of the police.” Shelar slammed the Sena saying that since Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has become God, the Sena thinks that people like Tendulkar are their enemies. He said that BJYM carried out the protest with permissions. “After the protest was over, they sneaked and attacked a woman. Shiv Sena has shown that their culture is of Aurangzeb. When Sonia and Vadra became their god, Tendulkar, Sathe and Amberkar (names of those who were allegedly attacked) became their enemies. Tendulkar, a woman party worker, was beaten up by everybody. Don’t hide behind the police and attack us. Come in the battle field, the BJP will defeat you. We condemn this attack on our workers,” he said, outside Mahim police station. “For every action there is a reaction,” said Sawant, adding if the BJP cared for law and order, they should not have taken to the streets in times of Covid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sena-bjp-workers-clash-near-sena-bhavan-101623869231505.html

The residents, alleging lack of maintenance by the developer, also lodged an FIR at Kaushambi police station. The high-rise has several residential towers having about 620 flats. The residents said that it was about 1.15pm when they heard a loud sound and rushed out of their flats. “When we moved to the tower, we saw that thousands of litres of water was gushing out from the main water tank installed on the roof of tower A. The flow of water damaged boundary walls of the floors and window glasses of five flats were also damaged,” said Arun Singh, general secretary, Express Green RWA. “We have several maintenance issues in different towers, and it is due to negligence on part of the developer that the incident took place,” Singh said, adding that the maintenance staff were trying to install a new water tank. Shraddha Garg, resident of tower A, said that she called up emergency number for help. “I was not at home. I got a call from my home that the water tank had burst and window glasses of several flats were damaged. When I reached, I found that 9th, 10th and 11th floors were damaged and several feet of water was flooded over the ground floor,” Garg said. “Doors of the electricity panels were also damaged. Water had also entered the lifts and there was no electricity till 7pm,” she added. The residents approached the Kaushambi police and gave a complaint for lodging of an FIR. Mahendra Singh, station house officer, Kaushambi police station, said that police registered an FIR under IPC sections 288 (negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings) and 427 (causing damages). “The FIR is lodged against five named officials of the builder’s firm,” he added. Officials of Express Properties, the developer, said that the new water tank is being installed. “Our staff are taking up the repair work at the site. It has been 11 years since we constructed the building, and a firm is looking after the maintenance work. We help in case any problem arises. We cannot say if some bolts got loosened up or anyone tampered with the setup. The tank had a capacity of about 10-12 thousand litres,” said Amit Goel, head (marketing) at Express Properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/flats-damaged-as-vaishali-high-rise-water-tank-bursts-101623868271574.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||Bus purchase on hold, Delhi government to wait for L-G’s inquiry||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has put on hold its plan to procure 1,000 air-conditioned (AC) low-floor buses through the state-run Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), three months after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led opposition complained to the city’s anti-corruption branch (ACB) and Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal about the allegedly high cost of the annual maintenance contract (AMC) of these buses.“The matter was examined in this (transport) department. We have been directed to convey that the process of procurement of 1,000 buses and their AMC be kept in abeyance till further orders. This (has been) issued with the approval of the transport minister,” said the order issued by the state transport department to DTC on June 11.On March 12, seven BJP MLAs, led by Rohini legislator Vijender Gupta, complained to the ACB that the Delhi government plans to spend ₹875 crore to procure 1,000 new buses under the DTC. In addition, the Delhi government is ready to pay nearly ₹3,500 crore only for annual maintenance of these new buses for 12 years. The BJP MLAs asked how the cost of maintaining the new buses could be higher than their purchase.Transport minister Kailash Gahlot, however, said the warranty of these new buses does not cover at least 71 parts, for which a separate tender for AMC was required. “The BJP has complained to the L-G, who has set up an inquiry on their complaint. We have stopped the process of procuring buses until the report on the inquiry committee comes. The BJP should get its investigation done, we are ready to be investigated in every way. The truth will come out during the investigation.”BJP MLA Gupta said, “We appeal to the L-G for a CBI investigation into the matter to ensure the guilty are bought to book. To scuttle the matter, the government has put the procurement of the buses in abeyance in a hush-hush manner,” he said.Gahlot refuted the claims and said by putting the procurement of 1,000 buses on hold, the Delhi government showed it is a transparent administration and is open to scrutiny.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-puts-on-hold-plan-to-procure-1k-ac-buses-to-wait-for-l-g-s-probe-101623868151498.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||‘Sushil called up gangster day after stadium brawl’, says Delhi Police||Two-time Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar called up gangster Sandeep Kala, alias Kala Jathedi, on May 5 morning -- a day after a fight in which wrestler Sagar Dhankad died and his friend Sonu Mahal, Jathedi’s nephew, was injured -- to convey that he only wanted to threaten them. Kumar was allegedly involved in the May 4 brawl that took place inside the Chhatrasal stadium.A police officer, who asked not to be named, said, “We recovered Kumar’s phone from his accomplice Anirudh last week (June 10). Anirudh was the tenth person to be arrested in the case. During the probe, we learnt that Kumar called Jathedi and conveyed to him that he only meant to threaten Dhankad and Mahal.”Jathedi is one of Delhi’s most wanted gangsters, and is allegedly operating from Dubai.Delhi Police arrested Kumar in connection with the case on May 23. A video of the brawl that was widely shared on social media appeared to show Kumar and his associates beating up Dhankhad. However, Kumar who is currently lodged in Mandoli Jail under judicial custody, has denied his involvement in the incident.Police are taking extra precautions for the safety of Kumar and have not shifted him to Tihar Jail, fearing retribution from several members of Kala Jathedi’s gang who are currently lodged there.The police also shifted gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who is a close aide of Jathedi, from Mandoli to Tihar jail, in view of the threat assessment to the former Olympic medallist.On Wednesday, police arrested two more members of Jathedi’s gang in a separate case and sent them to Tihar jail.Prison officials said Kumar, who was set to be transferred to Tihar, after 14-day quarantine at Mandoli jail complex, will stay there for now because of the probable threat to his life inside Tihar.Currently, all new prisoners are kept in quarantine at Mandoli jail before being shifted to Tihar in view of the steps to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the central prison.Sushil Kumar’s counsel, advocate Pradeep Rana, dismissed the police’s claims. “I have spoken to my client, who has confirmed that he has no connection with any gangster. He did not call anyone and was not in touch with anyone.”Meanwhile, Delhi Police on Wednesday said they have arrested another person in connection with the case. A 32-year-old man named, Subhash (identified only by his first name in police records) from his house in Kirari Suleman Nagar around 9pm on Tuesday.Police said Subhash, who is a physical training teacher, and also a Judo coach, was present inside Chhatrasal stadium on May 4. He was allegedly part of the group that assaulted Dhankad and Mahal. So far, 11 persons have been arrested in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sushil-kumar-called-up-gangster-to-iron-out-differences-over-injuries-to-nephew-in-stadium-brawl-101623867913508.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi resumes jabs for 18-45 group as doses arrive||The Capital on Wednesday received fresh stocks of Covid-19 vaccines for those in the 18-45 age group, said Atishi, the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) MLA from Kalkaji, as the city administration reopened bookings on the Co-WIN portal for all its inoculation centres a day after shutting over half of them owing to a shortage of doses.Presenting the day’s vaccination bulletin, Atishi said Delhi was in a comfortable position in terms of vaccine stock. She said the Delhi government has Covaxin doses for the 18-45 category for six days and Covishield vaccines for 11 days. Covaxin doses for the 45+category will last for seven days, while Covishield stocks are sufficient for 42 days.On Tuesday, nearly half the vaccination centres for the 18-45 age group were shut for want of vaccines. As on Wednesday, Delhi has 161 operational centres for the 18-45 category and 581 for those aged 45 and above.“We have received 62,160 doses of Covaxin and 173,340 doses of Covishield. Till date, we have received a total of 1.27 million doses for young adults... Starting today (Wednesday), slots are available on the Co-WIN portal for the 18-45 age group as well,” she said.Atishi also said that the Delhi government has been unable to run its vaccination drive at the pace it planned due to a shortage of doses. “The only way to remove vaccine hesitancy is to vaccinate the youth. When the youth go to get vaccinated, they will also bring along their family members,” she said.Senior government officials said they are hoping that supplies will stabilise once the central government starts providing free doses to all states and Union territories from June 21. “But, there is not much clarity yet. We have not received any indication on when we will receive the free doses for the 18-45 category and in what quantity,” said a state government official who asked not to be named.The Centre already provides free vaccines to all states to inoculate those aged 45 years and above, while private hospitals offer paid vaccines to all groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-reopens-bookings-for-all-its-centres-as-fresh-vaccine-stocks-arrive-101623867911456.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||Chandni Chowk a no-vehicle zone now||The Delhi government on Wednesday notified the proposal to stop all motorised vehicles from entering the main Chandni Chowk road between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid between 9am and 9pm. According to the gazette notification, several roads leading to Chandni Chowk have, however, been kept out of the purview of the restrictions.The 1.3-km stretch was envisaged as a pedestrian-only zone as part of the Chandni Chowk redevelopment project but a final legal stamp on the plan was pending. The notification will pave the way for a range of reforms planned by the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), the nodal agency for the redevelopment of the heritage market, officials said.The initial deadline for the project was fixed for March 2020, but it was revised to March 2021 due to the pandemic and related factors. Work resumed on the site after construction activity was permitted as part of the unlock proceedings.“Work on streetlights, CCTV and signage on the main stretch is currently on. Work on building toilets and police post is also going on. Both should be ready by July 31. Besides, work has begun on one half of the Red Fort crossing,” said Nitin Panigrahi, deputy general manager, SRDC.According to the gazette notification issued by KK Dahiya, special secretary (transport), restrictions on the movement of motorised vehicles will only be relaxed to allow emergency vehicles. Fire tenders, ambulances, hearse vans, and vehicles carrying patients will be allowed along with vehicles deployed for enforcement and maintenance services. Through the gazette notification, the Delhi Lieutenant Governor has directed the deputy commissioner of police (traffic) to operate under section 115 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for imposing further curbs on the said area.Anil Pershad, 77, one of the owners of Chandni Chowk’s iconic Chunnamal Haveli, said senior citizens will face some problems due to the ban.“We will be meeting all concerned stakeholders and agencies for the implementation of the order tomorrow. We will implement it soon,” said a traffic police official who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chandni-chowk-a-no-vehicle-zone-now-101623867852107.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s iconic Town Hall to be leased out||Delhi’s Victorian-era Town Hall, the headquarters of the erstwhile unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) in Chandni Chowk, will be leased out for 33 years on a monthly fee of ₹1.92 crore to be turned into a heritage hotel or a museum, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, the custodian of the building, said on Wednesday.The corporation issued a tender document on Wednesday, three years after the proposal to lease out the iconic building was cleared in 2018.The Town Hall was built in the 1863. It was initially known as Lawrence Institute and housed Delhi College of Higher Studies before it was bought by the municipality for ₹1,35,457 in 1866.It served as the seat of the MCD until the corporations shifted to the Civic Centre near Ramlila ground in 2012. A senior north corporation official privy to the development said, “The move will boost our revenue and help conserve the building. The restoration of the Town Hall will also be in tune in with the redeveloped Chandni Chowk. Tenders for the project have been floated and technical bids will be opened on August 5.”Former North MCD mayor Jai Prakash said the civic body has been spending ₹2-3 lakh every month on the upkeep of the building. “So it was decided to bring a scheme to rent out the Town Hall for 33 years to any private group, preferably from hospitality industry, so that commercial activities like a heritage hotel can be taken up here. It will bring the funds to the corporation and give a new lease of life to the historical building,” Prakash said.Veena Virmani, former chairman of the standing committee which approved the move, said “The proposal to rent out the building has clear instructions that the restoration and adaptive reuse of the Town Hall has to be in sync with the norms of the central government’s Heritage Conservation Committee (HCC),”Swapna Liddle, a historian and the author of Chandni Chowk: The Mughal City of Old Delhi, said: “The best use of the Town Hall building is turning it into a city museum so that people can come here and know more about the rich culture of Delhi. Now that Chandni Chowk has been redeveloped, the footfall here will increase so it makes more sense to develop a museum here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/victorianera-town-hall-in-chandni-chowk-to-be-leased-out-for-33-years-101623867791470.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||Woman alleges rape by Lok Janshakti party MP, police yet to register case||A woman has filed a complaint at the Connaught Place police station alleging that she was raped by Lok Janshakti Party (LJP)’s member of Parliament (MP) Prince Raj Paswan on the pretext of marriage. The police on Wednesday said the alleged incident took place last year and added that an FIR is yet to be registered on her complaint, which was filed last week.A police officer, who asked not to be named, said the woman, too, was a member of the party and the parliamentarian from Samastipur, Bihar, allegedly sexually assaulted her after promising to marry her.The police’s comments came a day after Prince’s cousin, Chirag Paswan, who was removed as chief of the party amid a feud in the family on Tuesday, shared on Twitter a letter dated March 29, 2021, which he wrote to his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras, a party MP from Hajipur in Bihar, mentioning the rape allegations against his cousin.In his letter, Chirag stated that the woman has been blackmailing Prince. Chirag wrote that when he did not receive any response from Pashupati on this matter, he had advised Prince to approach the police with a complaint about the alleged blackmail.In February, Prince filed a complaint against the woman at the Parliament Street police station, in which he accused her of extortion and blackmail. The probe in that case is underway, the senior police officer said.The officer said, “We received the woman’s complaint last week. We are conducting an inquiry and taking a legal opinion before proceeding further. The MP Prince Paswan had in February filed a case of extortion and blackmailing against the woman. We are probing that case too. No one has been arrested in that case.”HT tried contacting Prince and Pashupati for their comment but their cellphones came as switched off. The officials, who answered calls to the landlines at their Delhi residences, said the leaders were currently in Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/woman-alleges-rape-by-lok-janshakti-party-mp-police-yet-to-register-case-101623867551369.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt may move SC or NGT to seek changes in norms for old vehicles||The Delhi government will approach the Supreme Court or the National Green Tribunal seeking relaxation in norms under which 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles are automatically deregistered, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said on Wednesday.Gahlot said Delhi is in a “peculiar situation” compared to other states because certain sections of the Centre’s proposed scrapping policy will not apply to the Capital, owing to orders by the apex court and the NGT.The Centre’s policy allows 15-year-old private vehicles to ply, but with a much higher re-registration fee and strictly on the basis of a fresh fitness certificate. On the other hand, the top court, on October 29, 2018, prohibited 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles in the National Capital Region, and directed the transport department and police to impound such vehicles.The rule in Delhi applies to cars and two-wheelers.“Directions have been given to the transport commissioner to move an application immediately before the appropriate forum. The Union transport ministry mentions in its guidelines that those vehicles with proper fitness even after their expiry can ply, but the situation in Delhi is peculiar. In Delhi, the registration is automatically suspended after completion of the vehicle’s life span,” said Gahlot.Senior officials said it was due to this stringent rule in the Delhi-NCR region that the city’s scrapping policy has not been abe to gather steam. Delhi was the first state/UT to frame a vehicle scrapping policy in 2018. Government records show that from 2018 to May 31, 2021, only 2,879 old vehicles registered in Delhi have been scrapped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-may-move-sc-or-ngt-to-seek-changes-in-norms-for-old-vehicles-101623867491413.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||CBSE likely to declare Class 10 results in July third week||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is likely to announce Class 10 results in the third week of July, after compiling marks submitted by the schools on a formula devised after the examinations were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.CBSE officials said they will declare the exact date for the results after Thursday, when the board submits its Class 12 results formula to the Supreme Court.The class 12 exams were cancelled on June 1, more than a month after class 10 exams were cancelled on April 14., and CBSE said it will come up with “well-defined objective criteria” in a timebound manner to assess students for the important school-leaving year.For Class 10 — which follows a complicated assessment system based on internal test scores and a detailed moderation policy — the board asked its schools to submit compiled marks by June 30.“Generally, we take around 15 days to compile the results because there are numerous checks and balances in the process. Along with this, there are some administrative issues. If we are busy with the Class 12 results, there may be a delay of a day or two as well. We will only be clearer [about the dates of results] after tomorrow [Thursday],” said Sanyam Bhardwaj, Controller of Examination.The board announced the assessment pattern for Class 10 students on May 1.Under the system, individual scores will be calculated on the basis of a student’s performance in a unit/periodic test, the half-yearly or mid-term exam, and the pre-board examination. These together will account for 80 marks while the remaining 20 will be based on internal assessments that were likely completed by most schools as part of the usual board exam evaluation in the run-up to March.In order to check for inflation of marks, the board asked schools to pick the year with the highest average pass percentage in board exams in the past three years as a reference year and mark students only in the range of two points of the subject-wise average scores of that particular year.CBSE initially asked its schools to submit the compiled marks by June 5, but the board extended this deadline to June 30 due to the surge in infections and consequent lockdowns in several states.The Delhi government in May wrote to the education board, requesting a review of the timeline, since several of its teachers were involved in Covid-19 duties, including a door-to-door survey in hot spots, and monitoring duties at the vaccination and food distribution centres. Around 1,030 government schools in the city are affiliated with CBSE.Sukhbir Singh Yadav, principal of Government Co-Ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 21, Rohini and president of the Vice and Principals’ Association of Delhi (VPAD) said, “The extension allowed by CBSE came as a breather, and most schools are done with the work. Many have even submitted the marks. Since the number of Covid-19 cases also reduced in the city in the past few weeks, we were able to finish the work as teachers were not wary of coming to school for compiling the results.”Several private schools in the Capital said they either uploaded the marks on the CBSE portal or were likely to do so by the end of the week. Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini and a member of the Action Committee for Unaided Recognized Private Schools (ACURPS), which has around 450 schools under its ambit, said around 40-45% of schools have already submitted the marks.“We have also nearly finished compiling the Class 10 results and will be able to submit them in a few days. We were waiting for the additional FAQs uploaded by the board to review the marks before submitting it to the board,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbse-likely-to-declare-class-10-results-in-july-third-week-101623867432569.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||Elected unopposed, Delhi’s three civic bodies get new mayors||The three municipal corporations — North, East and South — elected new mayors and deputy mayors on Wednesday. GTB Nagar councillor Raja Iqbal Singh was elected mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, Raghubarpura councillor Shyam Sundar Agrawal will be the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) mayor and Sagarpur councillor Mukesh Suryan was elected mayor of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).Archana Dilip Singh (North DMC), Kiran Vaidya (EDMC) and Pawan Sharma (SDMC) have been elected deputy mayors.All the new mayors and deputy mayors, except Raja Iqbal Singh, were BJP nominees, and were elected unopposed since the party has a comfortable majority in all three corporations. Of the total 272 councillors in the three MCDs, the BJP has 181 members, the Aam Aadmi Party 49, and the Congress 31.North MCD mayor Singh is a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillor from the GTB Nagar ward. His election as mayor comes months after the party severed ties with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) over the three farm laws.The BJP and the SAD contested the 2017 municipal elections in an alliance. The SAD won five municipal wards. Last year, when the SAD parted ways with the BJP, SAD councillors resigned from their posts, but Singh, who was then the chairman of the Civil Lines zonal committee, did not follow the party diktat. He continued his association with the BJP and was nominated for the post of mayor in north corporation.The new mayors will replace Jai Prakash (north corporation), Anamika Mithilesh (SDMC) and Nirmal Jain (EDMC).Elections were due in April but were delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Talking about his priorities, Singh said, “I will work to save Delhi from the third wave of Covid-19, provide proper sanitation facilities, good education and health facilities. The stress will be on making the corporation self reliant and expediting the ongoing projects.”SDMC mayor Suryan said his priority will be to effectively deal with the pandemic. “Due to Covid-19, the civic body is facing financial challenges so we need to focus on a better revenue generation plan to deal with the situation,” Suryan said.Newly elected EDMC mayor Shyam Sundar Aggarwal said his priority will be to make the East body self-reliant. “I will work to improve sanitation and public health. Our primary responsibility is to keep the area clean, so sanitation work will be improved,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/elected-unopposed-delhi-s-three-civic-bodies-get-new-mayors-101623867431387.html
17-06-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh’s SC/ST Commission revamped, BJP cadres get a look-in||A day after seeking details of vacancies in the government-owned corporations and boards in Uttar Pradesh, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) began the much-in-demand process of accommodating cadres to these positions. The Yogi Adityanath government reconstituted the state’s SC/ST commission by making 18 appointments to the body. Former BJP lawmaker and an allopathic doctor from Agra Rambabu Harit was named chairman of the SC/ST Commission. These appointments, cleared by governor Anandiben Patel, would be for a year from the date when the nominated people take charge. Uttar Pradesh is due for assembly elections in early 2022, in about nine months’ time.“The party has always looked after its cadres and more would be accommodated in the coming days against vacancies,” a BJP leader said, admitting that the process of accommodating old hands got a move on after party’s national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh’s three-day feedback session. Mithilesh Kumar, a Dalit leader from Shahjahanpur who had contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls on the Samajwadi Party symbol, has been appointed one of the two vice chairpersons of the commission, the other being Ram Naresh Paswan, a Dalit cadre from Sonbhadra. “The party has picked cadres and this is welcome recognition,” said Ram Singh Valmiki, former secretary of the UP BJP’s SC/ST cell who has been named member of the SC/ST commission. Valmiki had been a regular feature of “samarasta bhoj” (social harmony lunches) organised by the BJP and RSS to build bridges between upper castes and Dalits.For Valmiki, along with Ramesh Toofani (another old party hand who figures on the list of cadres from Lucknow), this is their first appointment to the SC/ST commission. For few others like sadhvi Gita Pradhan from the Samajwadi Party bastion of Sambhal and Om Prakash Nayak from Aligarh, this is their second term as members of the SC/ST commission.“Our term has been renewed for a year and I am thankful to the party,” said Nayak, a former state chief of state BJP’s Dalit wing who enjoyed the status of minister of state during defence minister Rajnath Singh’s stint as UP chief minister.

Post-surgery, doctors have claimed that the dog lost over 5 kgs in just a week. Just like adults, animals too could suffer from serious health issues due to obesity. Ms Yasmin Daruwala, a resident of Karvenagar, was worried as her dog avoided participating in any physical activities almost 7-8 years ago. He said, “We had neutered our dog, Deepika, 5 years ago. Initially, she would run around the house, help me with some of the household chores, play with me, go for walks, won’t get irritated easily, follow my instructions, eat properly, exercise with me, help me fetch things, and was attentive. A few years down the line, I noticed her rapid breathing, inability to walk and breathlessness. She was 5-6 years old when she lost interest in all the activities. She would just sit on the couch being lazy, salivating, panting severely for breath. With time her condition deteriorated,and we spent about ₹10,000 every month on medicines and food.” After consulting many doctors, Daruwala came across Dr Narendra Pardeshi of Small Animal Clinic, Pune, and tried various ways to reduce weight by prescription diets for obesity, cardiac food and joint foods. “Dr Pardeshi suggested laparoscopic sleeve gastronomy surgery and so we consulted Dr Shashank Shah, leading laparoscopic bariatric surgeon, Laparo Obeso Centre, Pune,” she said. Dr Shah said, “Like humans, obesity is a silent killer in animals too. Animals can become obese owing to the lack of exercise and excessive food intake. Labrador, Pug, Golden retriever, boxer, St. Bernard are more predisposed breeds along with Indian dogs who are fed more on carbohydrate-rich food. Like humans, this dog had a history of obesity, high blood pressure, dilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart), thyroid problem (hypothyroidism), higher Body Mass Index (BMI), panting, salivation (watery discharge) from the mouth, joint problems and bluish tongue (cyanosis).” Dr Pardeshi said the normal lifespan of a dog is 12 -15 years and tends to reduce by six years if they are obese and fail to seek timely treatment. He said, “The joints of dogs get degenerated because of obesity and have less physical activity. This dog underwent various medical tests like humans to check for the fat percentage by measuring the ratio of the stomach and hind legs.” The surgery was conducted on June 6 and the dog had to fast for 12 hours prior to surgery and on a liquid diet for 5 days with protein-rich powder in liquid form. The dog’s weight was 50 kgs before going for surgery which should have been about 18 -20 kgs. After being on a liquid diet for seven more days, the dog lost four kgs in just five days and more than five kgs in a week. Ms Daruwala said that the surgery had now helped the dog move easily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/overweight-dog-undergoes-surgery-in-pune-loses-over-5-kg-in-a-week-gains-her-pace-101623860410993.html

This is a serious illusion,” the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister tweeted in Hindi.On Tuesday, six rebel BSP MLAs met SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in the party office. After the meeting, the group’s leader Aslam Raini announced that 11 rebel BSP MLAs would launch a new political party. The MLAs who met Akhilesh were suspended from the party long back for colluding with the SP and an industrialist during the Rajya Sabha polls for defeating a Dalit candidate, she said.SP spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi said: “Mayawati ji’s allegations are baseless.

The Maratha Kranti Morcha launched the rally with its first sit-in agitation at Kolhapur under the leadership of Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati who is nominated by BJP as a Rajya Sabha MP. Vanchit Bahujan Aghadhi’s (VBA) leader Prakash Ambedkar participated in the sit-in agitation in support for reservation for Marathas. Bharatiya Janata Party state unit president Chandrakant Patil attended the sit-in agitation. Patil said, “We will support every move to get reservation for Marathas. As a citizen of Kolhapur I am present here, but I will also express my stand in Pune as I am the city’s elected representative.” Elected representatives from Kolhapur district participated in the agitation. Kolhapur district guardian minister Satej Patil said, “The Maharashtra government is positive about Maratha reservation and related demands. The state government would take all necessary steps towards it. It is my appeal that Sambhajiraje and their representatives should come to Mumbai and discuss their demands with the chief Minister and state government.” Rural development minister Hasan Musrif said, “It is accepted by all that the Marathas need reservation. Our government would ensure it and take whatever steps needed to address the reservation issue.” All MPs and MLAs from Kolhapur district attended the first sit-in. Sambhajiraje said, “The Maratha Kranti Morcha had organised a march earlier also. There is no need to hold rallies every time. It is time the elected representatives from all parties express their stand. Now elected members would speak and we would listen.” Huge gathering in the face of Covid protocol A large number of people attended the sit-in agitation, despite authorities’ plea to follow Covid norms. Yuvraj Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati said, “By considering Covid-19, we had appealed to the people from neighbouring districts not to come to Kolhapur. This is not a rally or march. It’s just a sit-in agitation where elected representatives would speak and people will listen. We even instructed the participants to strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/agitation-on-maratha-quota-begins-in-kolhapur-101623857410859.html
17-06-2021||Pune||Reservation issue takes centre stage in Maharashtra politics||Pune: For the next few days, the Maharashtra politics would again revolve around the reservation issue. While the Maratha rally started from Kolhapur on Wednesday, organisations affiliated to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) have announced to launch their agitations from June 17. Maratha Kranti Morcha launched its state-wide agitation from Kolhapur on Wednesday with the support of leaders across all party lines. Vanchit Bahujan Aghadhi’s (VBA) leader Prakash Ambedkar also took part in the sit-in agitation at Kolhapur. Ambedkar said, “Both the state and central governments are responsible for not providing reservation to Marathas. As the two governments failed to take a decision at the right time, the Supreme Court scrapped the decision approved by the state government. The Maratha reservation issue is between the poor and rich people of the community. Along with the Maratha issue, the governments should also address the OBC and Scheduled Castes reservation issues.” Meanwhile, members of various organisations from OBC conducted a meeting related to holding of rallies. Akhil Bhartiya Mahatma Phule Samata Parishad (ABMPSP) representatives said, “Reservation of other communities is in danger. If the Marathas are getting reservation without affecting other communities, it is good. The authorities should ensure that the rights of other communities should not suffer.” Dilip Khaire, ABMPSP Nashik district president, said, “We have decided to hold rasta roko.” Satej Patil, Kolhapur district guardian minister, has appealed to the Maratha Kranti Morcha leader Yuvraj Sambhajiraje to hold discussion with the state government at Mumbai. Sambhajiraje has welcomed the state government’s stand that they are ready to meet the Maratha leaders. “We would keep the doors open for discussion, but at the same time agitations at various places would continue,” said Sambhajiraje.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/reservation-issue-takes-centre-stage-in-maharashtra-politics-101623856390802.html
17-06-2021||Pune||Pune in pre-final round of 2021 Global Mayors challenge||The city has entered the pre-final round of the 2021 Global Mayors Challenge, a worldwide competition for its proposal on early adoption of electrical vehicles (EV) to reduce vehicular pollution and provide clean air and health to residents. Bloomberg Philanthropies conducts Global Mayors Challenge; a worldwide competition annually. They announced 50 champion cities on Tuesday which are representing the boldest urban innovations of the past year that will advance to the finalist stage of the 2021 Global Mayors challenge. This year’s Bloomberg Philanthropies’ program focuses on elevating the most important public innovations generated in response to the global Covid-19 pandemic. In 2021 Global Mayors challenges, 631 cities from around the world submitted applications earlier this year and from those a committee of global experts has selected the 50 most innovative urban solutions to emerge in the wake of Covid-19 to advance in the competition. Of these 50 cities, 15 will win one million dollars each-to help them implement their breakthrough ideas and ultimately to spread their ideas to other cities around the world. The final round will be conducted from June to October 2021. For this, Pune city has submitted an innovative idea of building the foundation for an all-electrical vehicle future. Murlidhar Mohol, Pune mayor said, “We thanked the Bloomberg Philanthropies for proposed electrical vehicle initiative of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). We want to give clean air and healthy environment to our citizens. We sent proposal to Bloomberg Philanthropies to provide us funds to make action plan to develop infrastructure related to electrical vehicles and start services as early as possible. PMC will make comprehensive action plan which will include giving concession for electrical vehicles, install charging stations, promote electrical vehicles, raise fund, and conduct seminars.” He further added, “The PMC will use Bloomberg Philanthropies fund to prepare a city EV readiness plan and set up city EV fund.” Mangesh Dighe, environment officer of PMC said, “We have entered the pre-final round of the 2021 Global Mayors challenge. Pune city has given idea of electric mobility. We will run a pilot project on electric mobility. Bloomberg Philanthropies will select 15 cities innovative ideas and those will give one-million-dollar prize to run in full scale.” PMC proposal on EV adoptionPMC submitted a proposal to support early adoption of EV and provide fund, prepare a city EV readiness plan and set up a city EV fund. PMC mentioned in proposal, “ The city EV readiness plan would create an EV adoption scenario, identify actionable strategies for increasing EV adoption in the city, and outline operational guidelines for PMC. The city EV fund would use the recommendations from the city EV readiness plan to design a pool of fiscal incentives for vehicles, charging stations, and potentially other related items. Together, these will help electric vehicle sales and usage pick up in Pune city, reducing vehicular pollution, thus cleaning the air and benefitting the health of Punekars. Why is Pune shortlisted?As mentioned in the Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge statement about Pune innovative idea, “Among Indian cities, Pune has some of the highest rates of vehicle ownership, and vehicles contribute nearly 25 percent of particulate pollution in the city. To increase early adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), Pune proposed to prepare a city EV-readiness plan and establish an EV fund that incentivizes use. This idea stands out because Pune is seen as a city at the vanguard of India’s national smart cities push and a hub for innovation. Success in Pune could allow solutions to scale across India and achieve broad impact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-in-pre-final-round-of-2021-global-mayors-challenge-101623855790727.html
17-06-2021||Pune||Parisar survey claims 80% of vehicles violating Pune city speed limits||Increasing traffic and a lack of devices to track speed-limit rules have given rise to an increase in speed violations on Pune’s roads, as per a survey conducted by NGO Parisar.Of the 5,356 vehicles surveyed, two- and four- wheelers, on eight major roads (see box), 80% of the vehicles were found violating speed limits.“Our survey shows that vehicles are speeding with impunity. This is despite the fact that there is a minimum fine of ₹1,000 for this offence. The Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety has also asked states to take ‘strong and urgent measures to deal with over speeding’ and directed them to suspend the violator’s licence for a period not less than three months. Clearly, enforcement of the speed law is not happening adequately,” said Ranjit Gadgil, programme director, Parisar.As per the survey report, major speed violation occurred on Shivajinagar –Baner road, followed by the Savitribai Phule Pune University road.Sandeep Gaikwad, senior programme associate said, “It is a well-known fact and road-crash data has been consistently showing that speeding is a major reason for fatalities. We need to see enforcement agencies showing an urgency to enforce speed laws on the road.”“Speed violation incidents have risen in the city, but there is no rise in fatal accidents. In 2020, there were 143 fatal accidents and most of them were on highways. Even in 2021, we don’t have more fatal accidents happening on city roads,” said Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (traffic).“Roads in the peth areas and other parts of the city have been dug up for repairs. The speeds of two- and four-wheelers have reduced. Our speed detection devices are deployed on highways as major incidents of speed violations happen there. For city roads we don’t have more devices and due to heavy traffic, it is hard to place such devices on all the city roads,” added Shrirame.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parisar-survey-claims-80-of-vehicles-violating-city-speed-limits-101623854410624.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||Police move SC against bail to students, ask trial court for time to process release||Delhi Police moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday for an immediate stay of Delhi high court orders on bail to three student activists Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha, arrested for allegedly instigating the February 2020 Delhi riots, claiming that the orders were not only “perverse” but also based on a “social media narrative”.It also simultaneously filed an application in a Delhi court seeking time to verify the addresses of the three, and their Aadhaar numbers before it can go ahead with the formalities of their release. The court will rule on this on Thursday after the judge said an “order could not be passed” on Wednesday on account of the number of “bail applications before the undersigned”. The police have sought time till June 21 for the verification of the “outstation addresses” of Kalita and Tanha and June 19, for that of Narwal.If the apex court hears the appeal on Thursday and stays the high court’s order, the three activists will remain in jail -- where they have been since last May.Challenging the high court’s orders in the apex court in less than 24 hours, Delhi Police contended that bail for Jawarharlal Nehru University (JNU) students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, and Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha was premised “on a preconceived and a completely erroneous illusion”, resulting in “perverse findings”.The appeal disputed the finding of the high court that the case under the anti-terrorism law seemed to have been made out by the government in its anxiety to suppress dissent, calling it “an insinuation” and a finding beyond the purview of the bail pleas.Communal riots broke out in north-east Delhi in February 2020, leaving 53 people dead and more than 400 injured. Over 750 FIRs were filed and several people arrested. The three were named in one of these FIRs, accused of orchestrating the blocking of roads in an area where riots broke out. Narwal and Kalita have already been granted bail in two other cases, in which they are accused of unlawful assembly and inciting riots. Tanha has already got bail in another case that alleges he was part of a “premeditated conspiracy” to orchestrate the riots.The judicial scrutiny, the appeal said, seems to have been not to ascertain whether the evidence on record showed a prima facie case (under the anti-terror UAPA law) but to establish that it was a case of a protest by students and suppression of dissent by the government of the day. This, the plea said, was “without any foundation and appears to be based more on the social media narrative than the evidence gathered and elaborated in the charge sheet”.Pressing for an urgent hearing and a stay on the three separate but similarly worded bail orders, the police said the high court “erroneously” interpreted certain provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and watered down its provisions that will have far-reaching consequences for cases before investigating agencies.Also Read | Right to protest is not a terror act: Delhi high courtWhile the petition was filed on Wednesday with a plea for urgent listing as soon as possible, a time is yet to be fixed for the hearing.Delhi Police rushed to the apex court after a harsh indictment by the high court in its orders on Tuesday. The high court termed the charges against the student activists “stretched”, “verbiage”, and “hyperbole” while adding that the state may have, by going after the protesters, blurred the line between the “right to protest” and “terrorist activity”.Clearing the decks for the release of the three after more than a year’s incarceration, the high court held that the foundations of the nation stood on surer footing than those likely to be shaken by a protest, however vicious, organised by college students who operated from the confines of a university.In all three orders, the high court criticised the invocation of the anti-terrorism law against the students by Delhi Police and said there was “absolutely nothing” showing the possible commission of a terrorist act; or an act of raising funds to commit a terrorist act; or an act of conspiracy to commit a terrorist act.In its appeal before the Supreme Court, Delhi Police complained that the high court considered the matter as a case of protest by students while simply discarding the evidence and the corroborations that revealed a sinister plot of mass-scale riots being hatched by the accused.The petition said the high court read down Section 15 of UAPA that defined a terrorist activity by holding that the provisions of the Act could only be applied to deal with matters of profound impact on the “defence of India”, nothing more and nothing less. Apart from the interpretation of the law being an irrelevant consideration to grant bail, the police contended, it will impact several other pending cases under the anti-terrorism law.The appeal said the high court order was in breach of the Supreme Court’s 2019 judgment in Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali’s case which ruled against conducting a mini-trial and determining admissibility of certain evidence at the time of deciding a bail plea.Delhi Police said the high court order was “unsustainable in law” and had to be stayed immediately since it directed release of persons accused of serious offences under UAPA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-move-sc-against-bail-to-students-ask-trial-court-for-time-to-process-release-101623843310971.html
17-06-2021||Bangalore||Campaign to get official language status for Tulu gains momentum on social media||Bengaluru: The demand for official language status for Tulu was trending on social media in Karnataka on Sunday. Spoken by over 1.8 million people in the state, Tulu language is yet to get its due, activists said, adding that the social media campaign was part of a larger movement.Even though Tulu is considered one of the Pancha Dravida Bhashas (the five prominent languages of South India), it never found a place in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution as an official language, while the other four – Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, and Telugu – made it to the list.Tulu is spoken in the Tulunadu region, which consists of coastal Karnataka and parts of Kerala. However, according to the Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger, published by Unesco, Tulu is now considered a vulnerable language.Mahesh Mulki, one of the volunteers who organised the online campaign, said more than 400,000 tweets demanding official status for Tulu were published on Sunday. “This was to show that there is a big demand for this (official recognition). People from various organisations and in their private capacity, have joined this campaign,” he said.Mulki added that apart from the social media campaign, they have also approached legislators and parliamentarians from the region to highlight the demand. “One of our first demands is to make Tulu an official language in Karnataka itself. For which, the MLAs and MPs have agreed to take up the matter with the government,” Mulki said.Dayanand Kattalsar, president of Tulu Sahithya Academy, said Tulu is often misrepresented as a dialect, which is far from the truth. “The script and the language are different. One of the reasons why we are demanding official status is so that we are able to preserve our identity and our literature,” he said.Kattalsar added that there is a big push to promote the language in the region where the language is spoken. The Karnataka Tulu Sahitya Academy has been promoting Tulu as the third optional language in over 200 schools in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts in coastal Karnataka, he added.The campaign has been reignited as the Tulu film industry is celebrating its 50th anniversary. Enna Thangadi in 1971 was the first movie made in Tulu and now, more than 10 movies are made in the language every year. Devadas Kapikad, one of the prominent Tulu theatre artistes and filmmaker, said movies have been a uniting factor for this movement.“In Tulu speaking regions, there is an increasing demand for good Tulu movies. There are issues with getting theatres whenever a big Kannada movies release, but people’s response gives us teeth to demand more screens. Over the years, many youngsters are coming with fresh ideas to make good Tulu movies and it is inspiring. However, the industry has been hit badly due to the pandemic,” Kapikad said.According to experts, the irony is that the end credit of Tulu movies always rolls out in the Kannada script. Although the script of Tulu is available, it is not very popular, and people continue to write it in the Kannada script.“Tulu was predominately a spoken language, and as Kannada was taught from a very young age, the practice of writing Tulu in Kannada became common. Very few in the Tulunadu region can read or write in the Tulu script,” said Tulu writer Vaman Nandavar.However, there are some developments on this front as well. An attempt is currently underway to revive and standardise the Tulu script. At the same time, a Tulu script keyboard has been created to make writing Tulu on the computer easier.Activists argued that official status for the language will help in reviving Tulu, which is struggling to find its place in the language politics of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/campaign-to-get-official-language-status-for-tulu-gains-momentum-on-social-media-101623840069896.html
17-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi to train 5,000 nurses for next Covid wave: Arvind Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday announced that the Delhi government will build a force of 5,000 “community nursing assistants” in the Capital to help medical professionals as the city prepares for a potential third wave of Covid-19 infections.This force will be trained in paramedics, life care, home care, first aid, administering injections including vaccines and sample collection, setting up oxygen concentrators and cylinders, checking basic vitals of patients, and other patient care activities, the CM said.Those who are 18 and above, and have graduated from Class 12, will be eligible to apply, and online applications will open from Thursday (June 17).The selected assistants will be trained by IP University, and their role will be to assist doctors and nurses when requisitioned for their service during the next wave of Covid-19.“The advent of the third wave of Covid-19 has already begun in the United Kingdom. Preparations for the potential wave are on in full swing in the Delhi government. In the first and second waves in the country, we noticed that the huge surge in Covid-19 cases led to a severe shortage of medical and paramedical staff. Keeping that in mind, the Delhi government has made an ambitious plan to recruit and train 5,000 health assistants, who are technically called community nursing assistants,” Kejriwal said at a digital press briefing on Wednesday.He added that recruitment will be on first-come-first-serve basis.“These 5,000 nursing assistants will be given two weeks’ training each in batches of 500. Indraprastha University will impart the training in Delhi government’s nine major hospitals. These trained recruits will assist doctors and nurses, but they will not have the power to take any decision in patient treatment or anything related,” Kejriwal said.The city endured a punishing fourth wave of Covid-19 infections between April and May that left health infrastructure overrun, overwhelmed medical workers, and led to crematoriums running out of space.Over 760,000 people were infected in that period, while over 13,000 died of the infection between April and May alone. Cases in the city begin to peter out towards the middle of May on the back of a lockdown, which the state government imposed from April 19 onwards.The chief minister said this force will ensure improved efficiency of doctors and better patient care, adding that they will be deployed at temporary Covid Care Centres and health care facilities, along with other such facilities.“Training of these assistants will begin from June 28 and they will be called when needed. They will be paid according to the number of days they work. I hope with this move, Delhi government’s preparation for the third wave will be strengthened and the shortage of manpower that we faced in the previous waves will not reoccur,” Kejriwal said.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and infectious disease at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said addressing the shortage of health care staff is as important as arranging for sufficient medical infrastructure.“It is one of the main pillars of augmenting health care infrastructure. It will, of course, be important to keep this new force under close supervision whenever they are deployed on the field to avoid negligence or callousness,” Dr Kant said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-train-5-000-nurses-for-next-covid-wave-arvind-kejriwal-101623828910052.html

The White House announced last week that it was purchasing 500 million Pfizer Inc shots to donate to poorer countries in 2021 and 2022.Also Read | ‘Worst PR award’: Chinese media mocks US donation of 80 Covid vaccine vials to Trinidad and TobagoMore than 175 million Americans have received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose so far, and nearly 65% of US adults have received one shot. Meanwhile, countries such as India and Brazil have continued to face severe outbreaks of Covid-19 and are still in desperate need of shots.Zients said US cases and deaths are down more than 90% since late January and are at their lowest level since the start of the pandemic.But he cautioned he is concerned about low vaccination rates in some US communities, especially as a dangerous new variant first identified in India, known as the Delta variant, is spreading in the United States.Rochelle Walensky, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said her agency will present details on Friday about more than 300 confirmed cases of heart inflammation reported among the more than 20 million young adults and adolescents who have received Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-to-finish-allocating-80-mn-us-made-covid-shots-for-shipment-abroad-101623948888363.html

All but one "nay" vote came from Republicans, although at least 49 joined Democrats in favor of repeal.To be enacted, the measure must also be approved by the Senate - where its prospects are less certain - and signed into law by President Joe Biden, who has said he supports repeal.The US Constitution gives the power to declare war to Congress. However, that authority has shifted to the president as lawmakers passed "forever war" AUMFs, which do not expire - such as the 2002 Iraq measure, and one allowing the fight against al Qaeda and affiliates after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States."I look forward to Congress no longer taking a back seat on some of the most consequential decisions our nation can make," said Representative Greg Meeks, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, urging support for the repeal.Opponents worry that the repeal would dangerously limit the powers of the president and send the message that the United States is pulling back from the Middle East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-votes-to-scrap-2002-authorisation-used-for-iraq-war-101623945684282.html
17-06-2021||World||Pakistan 'indefinitely' suspends polio vaccine drive after attacks on health workers||Pakistan has "indefinitely" suspended its nationwide anti-polio campaign, to protect some 270,000 polio field staff from growing attacks.The anti-polio drive which was launched in April was suspended last week after the country's National Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) for polio directed all provinces to halt the drive, Deutsche Welle reported citing local media.Last week, two police personnel guarding a team of polio vaccine workers were shot dead in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Mardan district. Before that, two polio workers were gunned down in the line of duty in Swabi city."After the Peshawar incident, the uncertain and threatening situation for the frontline polio workers has emerged and we need to save the program from a further major damage," Dawn quoted the EOC as saying in a statement.It further said that the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (SPEI) partners had backed the move. "Hence, no further vaccination or catch-up activity will be conducted in any area for this campaign," said the EOC.Kamal Siddiqi, an Australian journalist of Pakistani origin, has said that these attacks are happening at a time when Pakistan is making strides in its battle against polio.In an op-ed for The Express Tribune, Siddiqi argued that the recent attacks on vaccine workers serve as a reminder how "Pakistanis of the level of ignorance prevailing in our country and the inability of the government to stamp out religious extremism."This comes as Pakistan is among only a few countries in the world where polio is still endemic. As many as 922,824 people have been infected with polio in Pakistan with 21,323 deaths so far.Slamming the Pakistani government, Siddiqi stressed that these attacks need to stop and the authorities need to trace those who are involved in these murders."As a nation, we are willing to bear the shame of being isolated and identified as a polio-positive country but cannot go after and punish the extremists who are responsible for this shame -- as this goes against our values," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-indefinitely-suspends-polio-vaccine-drive-after-attacks-on-health-workers-101623941178150.html
17-06-2021||World||Editors of Hong Kong newspaper arrested under security law||Hong Kong police used a sweeping national security law Thursday to arrest five editors and executives of a pro-democracy newspaper on charges of colluding with foreign powers — the first time the legislation has been used against the press in yet another sign of an intensifying crackdown by Chinese authorities in the city long known for its freedoms.Police said they had evidence that more than 30 articles published by Apple Daily played a “crucial part” in what they called a conspiracy with foreign countries to impose sanctions against China and Hong Kong.Apple Daily said in a statement that the move left it “speechless” but vowed to continue its reporting. The newspaper has long been one of the most outspoken defenders of Hong Kong's freedoms and in recent years has often criticized the Chinese and Hong Kong governments for walking back promises that the territory could retain those freedoms for 50 years after the former British colony was handed over to China in 1997.The newspaper has thus found itself a frequent target. Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai is currently serving a 20-month prison sentence after being convicted of playing a role in unauthorized protests in 2019, when Hongkongers took the streets in massive antigovernment demonstrations in response to a proposed extradition law that would have allowed suspects to stand trial in China. Protests grew to include calls for broader democratic freedoms, but the movement only appeared to harden Beijing's resolve to limit civil liberties in the territory, including by imposing the national security law used in Thursday's arrests.The legislation outlaws secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign collusion and has been used to arrest over 100 pro-democracy figures since it was first implemented a year ago, with many others fleeing abroad. The result is that it has virtually silenced opposition voices in the city — and drawn sanctions from the U.S. against Hong Kong and Chinese government officials.Those arrested Thursday included Apple Daily’s chief editor Ryan Law; the CEO of its publisher Next Digital, Cheung Kim-hung; the publisher’s chief operating officer; and two other top editors, according to the newspaper.Police also froze 18 million Hong Kong dollars ($2.3 million) in assets belonging to three companies linked to Apple Daily, said Li Kwai-wah, a senior superintendent at Hong Kong’s National Security Department.Trading in shares of Next Digital was halted Thursday morning at the request of the company, according to filings with the Hong Kong stock exchange.In an apparent show of force, more than 200 police officers were involved in the search of Apple Daily's offices, and the government said a warrant was obtained to look for evidence of a suspected violation of the national security law.Apple Daily published a letter to its readers, saying that police had confiscated many items during the search, including 38 computers that contained “considerable” journalistic material.“Today’s Hong Kong feels unfamiliar and leaves us speechless. It feels as though we are powerless to stop the regime from exercising its power as it pleases,” the letter read. “Nevertheless, the staff of Apple Daily is standing firm. We will continue to persist as Hongkongers and live up to the expectations so that we have no regrets to our readers and the times we are in.”Hong Kong Security Minister John Lee told a news conference that police will investigate those arrested and others to establish if they have assisted in instigating or funding the offenses.He alleged that the police action against the Apple Daily editors and executives is not related to “normal journalistic work.”“The action targeted the use of journalistic work as a tool to endanger national security,” he said.In a chilling warning, he said that anyone working with the “perpetrators” would "pay a hefty price.” He added: “Distance yourself from them, otherwise all you will be left with are regrets.”The Chinese government's liaison office in Hong Kong said in a statement Thursday that it supported police action, noting that while the city's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, guarantees the freedoms of speech and press, those rights cannot undermine the “bottom line of national security.”“Freedom of the press is not a ‘shield’ for illegal activities,” the liaison office said.Experts said that, with the arrests, the government has sent a message that certain topics are off limits.“This is a direct attack on Apple Daily, and on press freedom in Hong Kong,” said Thomas Kellogg, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Asian Law. “I fear that the arrests will send a message to media outlets across Hong Kong, that certain red lines will be enforced … and that those who cross them risk the possibility of arrest and of jail time under the national security law.”Hong Kong Journalists Association Chairman Chris Yeung echoed those concerns, saying the national security law was being used as a “weapon to prosecute media executives and journalists.”He said that the court warrant that allowed police to search the offices of Apple Daily had undermined journalists’ ability to protect their materials, a vital part of upholding press freedom.“Self censorship will get worse if journalists are not sure whether they are able to protect their sources of information,” said Yeung.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/editors-of-hong-kong-newspaper-arrested-under-security-law-101623941119364.html
17-06-2021||World||Israeli officer charged in killing of autistic Palestinian||Israeli prosecutors on Thursday charged a border police officer with reckless manslaughter in the deadly shooting of an autistic Palestinian man in Jerusalem’s Old City last year.The indictment came just over a year after the shooting of Eyad Hallaq, whose family has criticized Israel's investigation into the killing and called for much tougher charges. The shooting has drawn comparisons to the police killing of George Floyd in the United States.Rights groups say Israel rarely holds members of its security forces accountable for the deadly shootings of Palestinians. Investigations often end with no charges or lenient sentences, and in many cases witnesses are not even summoned for questioning.The officer, who remains unidentified in the indictment submitted to the Jerusalem District Court on Thursday, was charged with reckless manslaughter, and if convicted could face up to 12 years in prison.“We want justice for our son,” Hallaq's father, Khairi, said in response to the indictment. “Why is it that when an Arab kills they say he is a murderer and when an Israeli kills they say reckless manslaughter?”Hallaq, 32, was fatally shot just inside the Old City’s Lion’s Gate on May 30, 2020, as he was on his way to the special-needs institution that he attended. The officer's commander, who was also present during the incident, was not charged.The area is a frequent site of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces, and the Old City’s narrow streets are lined with hundreds of security cameras that are monitored by police. But as the investigation proceeded last summer, prosecutors claimed that none of the cameras in the area had worked, and there was no footage of the incident.The Old City is part of east Jerusalem, which Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed to its capital in a move not recognized by most of the international community. Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state, and the city's fate is one of the most divisive issues in the conflict.Prosecutors from the police internal investigations department said in a statement that the decision to charge the officer “was made after deep examination of the evidence, examination of all the circumstances of the incident and the claims heard during the officer’s hearing.” They said Hallaq's death was a “serious and unfortunate incident” and that the officer shot him “while he took an unreasonable risk that he would cause his death.”According to accounts at the time, Hallaq was shot after running away and failing to heed calls to stop. Two members of Israel’s paramilitary Border Police then chased Hallaq into a garbage room and shot him as he cowered next to a bin.The Justice Ministry said in a statement in October, when prosecutors recommended charges against the officer, that the wounded Hallaq pointed to a woman he knew and muttered something. The officer then turned to the woman and asked her in Arabic, “Where is the gun?”She replied, “What gun?” At that point, the officer under investigation fired again at Hallaq.The woman mentioned in the statement appears to be Hallaq’s teacher, who was with him that morning. At the time of the shooting, she told an Israeli TV station that she had repeatedly called out to police that he was “disabled.”In the charges filed Thursday, prosecutors described how the accused shot Hallaq in the stomach when he had his back against a wall in a corner, then shot him a second time in the chest while Hallaq was sprawled on the ground injured.Hallaq's family has expressed concerns the killing would be whitewashed, especially after the alleged camera malfunction. In cases of attacks against Israeli security forces, police often quickly release security-camera footage to the public.Palestinians and human rights groups say Israel has a poor record of prosecuting cases in which soldiers and police kill Palestinians under questionable circumstances.An Associated Press investigation in 2019 found that the Israeli military opened investigations into 24 potentially criminal shootings of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip over the past year. None had yielded convictions or even indictments, and in most instances, the army had not interviewed key witnesses or retrieved evidence from the field.The Israeli military says it investigates all cases in which Palestinians are killed and that its soldiers often have to make split-second decisions in hostile situations. Palestinians have carried out dozens of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks against Israeli security forces in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank in recent years.Hallaq's death prompted a series of small demonstrations in which Jews and Palestinians protested against police violence. Some evoked the killing of Floyd, which sparked a wave of protests across the U.S. demanding racial justice and police accountability. Israeli leaders expressed regret over the shooting death of Hallaq.Ayman Odeh, head of the Joint List of Arab parties in Israel’s parliament, criticized the indictment, tweeting that reckless manslaughter was “an infuriating and denigrating charge," given the gravity of what happened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-officer-charged-in-last-year-s-killing-of-autistic-palestinian-101623939070293.html
17-06-2021||World||US Supreme Court upholds Obamacare, preserving insurance coverage for millions||The Supreme Court has dismissed a challenge to the Obama era health care law, preserving insurance coverage for millions of Americans.The justices, by a 7-2 vote, left the entire law intact Thursday in ruling that Texas, other Republican-led states and two individuals had no right to bring their lawsuit in federal court.The law’s major provisions include protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, a range of no-cost preventive services and the expansion of the Medicaid program that insures lower-income people, including those who work in jobs that don’t pay much or provide health insurance.Also left in place is the law’s now-toothless requirement that people have health insurance or pay a penalty. Congress rendered that provision irrelevant in 2017 when it reduced the penalty to zero.The elimination of the penalty had become the hook that Texas and other Republican-led states, as well as the Trump administration, used to attack the entire law. They argued that without the mandate, a pillar of the law when it was passed in 2010, the rest of the law should fall, too.And with a more conservative Supreme Court that includes three Trump appointees, opponents of “Obamacare” hoped a majority of the justices would finally kill off the law they have been fighting against for more than a decade.But the third major attack on the law at the Supreme Court ended the way the first two did, with a majority of the court rebuffing efforts to gut the law or get rid of it altogether.Trump’s three appointees to the Supreme Court — Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — split their votes. Kavanaugh and Barrett joined the majority. Gorsuch was in dissent, signing on to an opinion from Justice Samuel Alito.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-upholds-obamacare-preserving-insurance-coverage-for-millions-101623939443157.html

Afghanistan is witnessing its worst Covid-19 wave since the start of the pandemic, with the curve of total active infection cases and related deaths showing an exponential rise. ICRC said that more than a third of Covid-19 tests last week came back positive.“Afghanistan is at a crisis point in the battle to contain Covid-19 as hospital beds are full to capacity in the capital Kabul and in many areas,” Nilab Mobarez, acting president of the Afghan Red Crescent Society, said in a statement released by the ICRC.Afghanistan’s health infrastructure has already been strained due to decades of war and violence has risen in recent months with the gradual withdrawal of US troops. Mobarez warned that the surge is rapidly spiralling out of control adding huge pressures on the country’s fragile health system and millions of people living in poverty“We fear that we are just a heartbeat away from the kind of horror that we have already seen in countries like India and Nepal,” she added.Also Read | US out, Taliban ride on violence, situation critical in AfghanistanAfghan health authorities on Thursday registered 2,313 new Covid-19 cases and a record 101 deaths from the infection in the last 24 hours. Officials and experts have said low testing means those official figures are probably a dramatic undercount. Meanwhile, Afghanistan is also dealing with a vaccine shortfall exacerbated by a high level of hesitancy, with less than 0.5% of the population having been fully vaccinated against Covid-19.“Covid-19 is another cruel blow for millions of Afghans already dealing with the constant threat of violence, displacement, food insecurity and poverty. We’re seeing large numbers of people having to make terrible choices between finding a way to feed their families and growing risks of getting sick,” Necephor Mghendi, head of Afghanistan country delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-at-crisis-point-as-covid-19-cases-up-2-400-in-a-month-101623936356033.html

He said negotiations would obviously have to be conducted quietly and in secret.Watch | ‘Consequences would be devastating’: Joe Biden warns Vladimir Putin on NavalnyPeskov, who attended the summit himself, said it had broadly unfolded as Russia had expected and that the meeting, from a Kremlin viewpoint, had gone smoothly."It went off rather well, with a plus sign," Dmitry Peskov told the Ekho Moskvy radio station."It was productive in the sense that the two leaders had the chance to directly explain their positions, more or less understand where they can cooperate, and where right now they can't cooperate because of categorical differences in their views. That also happened and that's also a plus," he said.Peskov singled out a joint statement that reaffirmed the two countries' belief that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought."It may be a short statement but...it reflects the special responsibility of our two countries not only before our own peoples but, as pretentious as it may sound, before the whole world," said Peskov.Also Read | Joe Biden gifts Vladimir Putin custom aviator sunglassesRussia's deputy foreign minister said separately that Moscow expected arms control talks with the United States, that were agreed at the summit, to start within weeks.He said Moscow felt reassured by the joint statement on the need to never wage nuclear war and to start arms control talks."The confirmation of the formula that there can be no winner in a nuclear war and that one must not be waged is a significant achievement," Ryabkov told the Kommersant daily newspaper."Frankly speaking, we had growing concerns in recent years about Washington's readiness to support this. This is not a figure of speech or lofty words but simply a reflection of reality."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-pleased-with-putin-biden-summit-hails-pledge-to-never-wage-nuclear-war-101623932947148.html
17-06-2021||World||Chinese crewed spaceship Shenzhou-12 docks with new space station module Tianhe||A Chinese spaceship carrying a three-person crew docked with China's new space station at the start of a three-month mission Thursday, marking a milestone in the country's ambitious space program.The Shenzhou-12 craft connected with the Tianhe space station module about six hours after takeoff from the Jiuquan launch centre on the edge of the Gobi Desert.The three astronauts are the first to take up residency in the main living module and will carry out experiments, test equipment, conduct maintenance and prepare the station for receiving two laboratory modules next year.The mission brings to 14 the number of astronauts China has launched into space since 2003, becoming only the third country after the former Soviet Union and the United States to do so on its own.The astronauts were seen off by space officials, other uniformed military personnel and a crowd of children waving flowers and flags and singing patriotic songs.The rocket dropped its boosters about two minutes into the flight followed by the cowling surrounding Shenzhou-12 at the top of the rocket. After about 10 minutes it separated from the rocket's upper section, extended its solar panels and shortly afterward entered orbit.About a half-dozen adjustments took place over the following six hours to line up the spaceship for docking with the Tianhe, or Heavenly Harmony, module at about 4 p.m. (0800 GMT).The travel time is down from the two days it took to reach China's earlier experimental space stations, a result of a “great many breakthroughs and innovations," the mission’s deputy chief designer, Gao Xu, told state broadcaster CCTV.“So the astronauts can have a good rest in space which should make them less tired," Gao said.Other improvements include an increase in the number of automated and remote-controlled systems that should “significantly lessen the pressure on the astronauts," Gao said.Two astronauts on those past missions were women, and while this first station crew is all male, women are expected to be part of future station crews.Also Read | China launches crewed spacecraft Shenzhou-12 in historic missionThe mission is the third of 11 planned through next year to add the additional sections to the station and send up crews and supplies. A fresh three-member crew and a cargo ship with supplies will be sent in three months.China is not a participant in the International Space Station, largely as a result of US objections to the Chinese programs secrecy and close military ties. However, China has been stepping up cooperation with Russia and a host of other countries, and its station may continue operating beyond the International Space Station, which is reaching the end of its functional life.China landed a probe on Mars last month that carried a rover, the Zhurong, and earlier landed a probe and rover on the moon's less explored far side and brought back the first lunar samples by any country’s space program since the 1970s.China and Russia this week also unveiled an ambitious plan for a joint International Lunar Research Station running through 2036. That could compete and possibly conflict with the multinational Artemis Accords, a blueprint for space cooperation that supports Nasa’s plans to return humans to the moon by 2024 and to launch a historic human mission to Mars.After the Tianhe was launched in April, the rocket that carried it into space made an uncontrolled reentry to Earth, though China dismissed criticism of the potential safety hazard. Usually, discarded rocket stages reenter the atmosphere soon after liftoff, normally over water, and don’t go into orbit.The rocket used Thursday is of a different type and the components that will reenter are expected to burn up long before they could be a danger, said Ji Qiming, assistant director of the China Manned Space Agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-crewed-spaceship-shenzhou-12-docks-with-new-space-station-module-tianhe-101623928640810.html
17-06-2021||World||China disease expert demands next Covid origin probe in US after new NIH study||A senior Chinese epidemiologist has demanded that the second phase of investigation into the origins of coronavirus should be conducted in the United States after a study showed the virus could have been circulating there as early as December 2019, according to a Chinese state media outlet. Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, reportedly told Global Times that the US was slow to test people for Covid-19 at an early stage of the pandemic and it possesses many biological laboratories all around the world."All bio-weapons related subjects that the country has should be subject to scrutiny," Global Times quoted Zeng as saying.China’s attempt to put blame on the United States for the devastating pandemic comes after the US National Institutes for Health (NIH) published a study that showed at least seven people in five states were infected with Sars-CoV-2 weeks before the country reported its first official cases. The researchers analysed more than 24,000 stored blood samples collected from across 50 US states between January 2 and March 18, 2020, through the NIH’s ‘All of Us Research Program’.Also Read | WHO chief asks China to cooperate with probe into origins of Covid-19As per the new findings of the study, researchers detected antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 in the samples of nine participants, all of them from outside the major urban hotspots of Seattle and New York City, believed to be key points of entry of the virus in the US. The study suggests that the positive samples came as early as January 7 from participants in Illinois, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.The origin of the coronavirus has become a source of political tension between China and the United States, which has further heightened after the US demanded a transparent second phase of investigation in China amid claims of possible virus leak at a Wuhan laboratory. Following an investigation by an international team of experts into the virus origins, a joint study by China and the World Health Organization (WHO) was published in March that said Covid-19 most likely originated in the country's wildlife trade, dismissing the lab leak theory as “extremely unlikely”.Citing virus outbreaks in China linked to the imported cold chain, the study also suggested that Sars-CoV-2 can persist in conditions found in frozen food, packaging and cold-chain products. While the report said that the findings raise the possibility for different potential pathways of introduction, Beijing promoted the theory that Covid-19 entered China from overseas via contaminated frozen food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-disease-expert-demands-next-covid-origin-probe-in-us-after-new-nih-study-101623926456768.html

The 1098-carat diamond was shown to Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi on Wednesday, two weeks after the diamond firm Debswana discovered it.The large gem-quality stone, which measures 73mm long, 52mm wide and 27mm thick, is slightly less heavy than the world's second-largest diamond ‘Lesedi La Rona’ which was also found in Botswana in 2015. The largest diamond unearthed to date, 3106 carat Cullinan stone, was recovered in South Africa in 1905."This is the largest diamond to be recovered by Debswana in its history of over 50 years in operation," Debswana’s acting managing director Lynette Armstrong said."From our preliminary analysis, it could be the world's third-largest gem-quality stone. We are yet to make a decision on whether to sell it through the De Beers channel or through the state-owned Okavango Diamond Company," she added.Also Read | Mystery stones spark diamond rush in poor South African regionMinerals minister Lefoko Moagi said the discovery of the yet-to-be-named diamond could not have come at a better time after the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic hit diamond sales in 2020. While an estimate of the diamond's potential cost has not yet been released, the cost of Lesedi La Rona, which was sold for $53 million in 2017 to a London jeweller, can be used to gauge the potential cost.Botswana government receives as much as 80 per cent of the income from Debswana's sales through dividends, royalties and taxes. The economic devastation caused by the pandemic impacted both diamond production and demand in 2020. Production at Debswana fell 29% to 16.6 million carats, while sales fell 30%to $2.1 billion.In 2021, Debswana plans to increase output by as much as 38% to pre-pandemic levels of 23 million carats as the global diamond market recovers with the easing of travel restrictions and reopening of jewellers.(With Reuters inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/diamond-believed-to-be-world-s-third-largest-unearthed-in-botswana-101623920970460.html

Regular hearings on the case will resume from June 23.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House of Representatives, in a setback to embattled Prime Minister Oli who was preparing for snap polls.Oli repeatedly defended his move to dissolve the House of Representatives, saying some leaders of his party were attempting to form a "parallel government".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/courts-can-t-appoint-pm-oli-defends-dissolution-of-house-of-representatives-101623919616616.html
17-06-2021||World||Major Australian banking, airline websites goes down briefly in broad internet outage||A plethora of websites operated by financial institutions, governments and airlines including Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. and Australia’s central bank went down briefly Thursday in the second global internet outage in as many weeks.Some of the outages, including those that affected Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp. and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., were linked to a failure at Akamai Technologies Ltd., which helps clients manage web services, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing internal affairs. The Reserve Bank of Australia was forced to cancel a scheduled bond-buying operation Thursday, blaming “technical difficulties.” A representative for Akamai in Asia didn’t respond to emails and calls seeking comment.The widespread downtime recalled an hour-long global outage earlier this month, triggered by a software failure at content delivery platform Fastly Inc. The resultant cascading failures, which affected services from Amazon.com Inc. to Shopify Inc. and Stripe Inc., served as a stark reminder of how exposed the world’s biggest websites are to the impact of disruptions ranging from simple human error to coordinated cyberattack.Website tracker Downdetector.com initially flagged hundreds of user complaints about outages affecting Southwest Airlines Co., Delta Air Lines Inc. and Automatic Data Processing Inc. Other websites pinpointed included those operated by Vanguard, E-Trade and Navy Federal Credit Union.Many of the websites affected on Thursday recovered within the hour, some after rerouting to other providers. Companies including Hong Kong’s exchange and Southwest said they were investigating the incident, without elaborating. “The pause in connectivity did not impact our operation,” Southwest said in an emailed response to questions.It was unclear what triggered the incidents Thursday. In Fastly’s case, a valid software configuration change by one of its customers triggered a previously undiscovered bug, introduced during a May 12 software deployment. Fastly quickly identified an issue with its content delivery network and announced it was rolling out a fix just 46 minutes after acknowledging a problem. Sites began to spring back to life soon afterward.Akamai is one of a number of high-level website and application hosting services that large enterprises use to serve content to millions of users simultaneously.Rather than hosting all website content on a single set of servers in one location, Fastly’s so-called “edge computing” model puts servers in dozens of locations, allowing websites to serve pages to users from physical locations closest to them. This cuts lag time, speeding up page-loading and spreading the burden on individual servers.These vast and complex setups are run by just a few companies, such as Fastly and Cloudflare Inc. The global edge computing market was valued at $4.68 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 38.4% from 2021 to 2028, according to a recent analysis by Grand View Research.While these setups usually work perfectly, their complexity means that even a simple error in a configuration file can trigger chain reactions of outages. For users, most of whom rarely need to think about how the internet works, that can come as a shock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bank-airline-websites-went-down-briefly-in-broad-internet-outage-101623913799947.html
17-06-2021||World||Covid-19 Delta variant, first identified in India, dubbed 'variant of concern' by US CDC||The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has classified the Delta variant of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), first identified in India, as a "variant of concern", news agency PTI reported on Thursday, citing an official statement by the US CDC. Previously, the Delhi Covid-19 strain was only considered a "variant of interest" by the US CDC, but its status was changed to a "variant of concern" after assessing the Delta variant's high transmissibility, among other factors.Along with the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of Covid-19, a few other variants circulating in the United States have also been classified as 'variants of concern', a CDC statement published on Tuesday read. These include the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.427 (Epsilon), and B.1.429 (Epsilon) Covid-19 variants.The CDC said the Delta variant shows increased transmissibility, potential reduction in neutralisation by some monoclonal antibody treatments under emergency authorisation, and potential reduction in neutralization from sera after vaccination in lab tests. A particular Covid-19 variant is only dubbed 'variant of concern' when scientists believe that coronavirus strain is shows increased transmissibility and a chance to cause more severe disease. Vaccines, treatments, and tests that detect the virus may also be less effective against a variant of concern.The Delta variant, which was dubbed a 'variant of concern' by the World Health Organization (WHO) on May 10, accounts for around 9.9% of all Covid-19 cases in the United States, the CDC estimates. However, to date, no variants of high consequence have been identified in the country, the public health body explained in its statement.US President Joe Biden and his Chief Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci last week have warned that the Delta variant of the novel coronavirus is highly infectious, which is now the dominant strain in the United Kingdom, spreading rapidly among young people between 12 and 20 years old.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-delta-variant-classified-as-variant-of-concern-by-us-cdc-101623905251183.html
17-06-2021||World||US ends strict Trump-era asylum rules for violence victims||The US government on Wednesday ended two Trump administration policies that made it harder for immigrants fleeing violence to qualify for asylum, especially Central Americans.Attorney General Merrick Garland issued new instructions to immigration judges to stop following the Trump-era rules that made it tough for immigrants who faced domestic or gang violence to win asylum in the United States. He also undid a policy that made it difficult for immigrants to obtain asylum based on threats to a family member.The moves could make it easier for immigrants to win their cases for humanitarian protection and were widely celebrated by immigrant advocates.“The significance of this cannot be overstated,” said Kate Melloy Goettel, legal director of litigation at the American Immigration Council. “This was one of the worst anti-asylum decisions under the Trump era, and this is a really important first step in undoing that.”Garland said he was making the changes after President Joe Biden ordered his office and the Department of Homeland Security to draft rules addressing complex issues in immigration law about groups of people who should qualify for asylum.Gene Hamilton, a key architect of many of former President Donald Trump’s immigration policies who served in the Justice Department, said in a statement that he believed the change would lead to more immigrants filing asylum claims based on crime and that should not be a reason for protections.The Biden administration changes come as U.S. immigration authorities have reported unusually high numbers of encounters with migrants on the southern border. In April, border officials reported the highest number of encounters in more than 20 years, though many migrants were repeat crossers who previously had been expelled from the country under pandemic-related powers. The number of children crossing the border alone also has hovered at all-time highs.Many Central Americans arrive on the border fleeing gang violence in their countries. But it isn't easy to qualify for asylum under U.S. immigration laws, and the Trump-era policies made it that much harder.More than half of asylum cases decided by the immigration courts in the 2020 fiscal year were denials, according to data from the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review. Four years earlier, it was about one in five cases.In the current fiscal year, people from countries such as Russia and Cameroon have seen higher asylum grant rates in the immigration courts than people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, the data shows.Immigration judges abide by instructions set by the attorney general, and their courts are within the Justice Department.In one of the reversals, Garland restored a 2014 case that defined married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship as a group deserving of asylum, a decision that eased the way for other victims of domestic violence. In 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions overturned that guidance and added that victims of gang violence also should be largely ineligible, extending the scope to large swaths of non-government actors.In another case involving a Mexican man who claimed his father was targeted by a drug cartel, Garland reversed a decision by former Attorney General William Barr that said such family ties were insufficient grounds for an asylum claim.Jason Dzubow, an immigration attorney in Washington who focuses on asylum, said he recently represented a Salvadoran family in which the husband was killed and gang members started coming after his children. While Dzubow argued they were in danger because of their family ties, he said the immigration judge denied the case, citing the Trump-era decision among the reasons.Dzubow welcomed Garland's changes but said he doesn't expect to suddenly see large numbers of Central Americans winning their asylum cases, which remain difficult under U.S. law.“I don't expect it is going to open the floodgates, and all of a sudden everyone from Central America can win their cases. Those cases are very burdensome and difficult,” he said. “We need to make a decision: Do we want to protect these people?'”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ends-strict-trump-era-asylum-rules-for-violence-victims-101623904795582.html
17-06-2021||World||Glacial outburst suspected for flash flood in Central Nepal||The flash flood incident of Tuesday in Sindhupalchok district of Nepal is suspected to be caused by glacial outburst in a high lying area bordering Tibet, said a government official.Speaking to ANI, Rudra Prasad Dulal, Ward Chair of Sindhupalchok ward 11 confirmed that the incident can be the result of a glacial outburst near Tibetan territory which has resulted in loss of millions of rupees."Reason behind this flash flood is attributed to heavy rainfall in upper lying areas. Shaken by the 2072 (Nepali date of 2015 earthquake) earthquake, creeks on the inner areas of the hills are suspected to be swept by large masses of ice and muds contained by it. We have suspected it to be a reason for flooding," Rudra Prasad Dulal said.He also added that incessant rainfall and movement of ice masses underneath the glaciers which ran down the hill have been dumped here in low lying areas."We are suspecting it to be a glacial outburst," Dulal stressed.Several people, who have been displaced due to floods as they have lost their houses and properties, are in state of shock.Melamchi town, once a brimming marketplace and centre of attraction, now remains submerged in a thick layer of mud, sand and water after the flood. As per the official, about 200 houses in town have been damaged partially or completely in mayhem which began with onset of monsoon.Hundreds of families who resided in the area have taken shelter in a local school, located a few hundred meters away from the main market square.Radhika Shrestha, one of displaced due to flood while recalling the incident said: "I just had returned back from my field, then brother-in-law who resides in "Dhap" (locality in Sindhupalchok) called me and warned to flee to safer ground stating a river has been blocked from flowing due to landslide which might burst and flood the town where we reside.""Till the time I received a warning call, I called my husband who was working in the field, to rush out from there. Later we ran to high edges without any second thoughts," she said.As the blocked river made its way down hill, it has completely changed the life of Shrestha's family of four who have lost all of their belongings in the flood compelling them to make a fresh start."As flood took away our land, properties and all key documents, our family has to survive whether by doing labour or any other means," Shrestha said.After the mayhem, a total of seven people have been confirmed dead by district administration and at least eight staffers of the Melamchi drinking water project have gone missing.Nepal Army along with Armed Police Force and the Nepal Police has been conducting a rescue and search operation in the flood ravaged area, which has continued to be submerged under a thick layer of mud and high flowing water."We are yet to think about making a new start. All the riches which we earned lies in that house which is now covered in mud and is not accessible. We don't have anything now and we are clueless where to go and how to go, a complete state of numbness reels over mind," Laxmi Prasad Shrestha, another flood victim from the area said.One of the epicenters of 2015 earthquake, Sindhupalchok has been witnessing damages due to floods and landslides on an annual basis. With the onset of monsoon in the Himalayan nation, incidents of floods and landslides are expected to rise further.Earlier, Meteorologists of Nepal and other South Asian nations had predicted that monsoon for the year 2021 will arrive earlier than last year and that Nepal and some other Asian countries are expected to receive normal to above-normal rainfall.As per Nepal's Meteorological Forecasting Division, monsoon has already hit Nepal from June 1 and it will continue for about 3 months.Last year, the monsoon entered Nepal on June 12, two days later than the normal onset date (June 10). In 2019, monsoon entered eastern Nepal on June 20, delayed by 10 days. Lasting for 105 days in Nepal, monsoon normally leaves the country by September end.Almost 80 per cent of the annual rain in Nepal is received during the monsoon (June-September). The average annual rainfall is 1,600 mm, but it varies by eco-climatic zones (3,345 mm in Pokhara and below 300 mm in Mustang).The Meteorological Forecasting Division (MFD) has estimated the high mountainous region of Nepal to receive 55 to 65 per cent rainfall (snow mainly) in 2021. Additionally, average rainfall is estimated to be anywhere between 35 to 45 per cent in Lumbini, Gandaki, Bagmati and in the western part of Province 2, while Terai region of Province 1 and eastern region of Province 2 are likely to receive less-than-average rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/glacial-outburst-suspected-for-flash-flood-in-central-nepal-101623904493595.html
17-06-2021||World||US Congress declares holiday for Juneteenth, marking end of slavery||The United States will soon have a new federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery.The House voted 415-14 Wednesday to make Juneteenth, or June 19th, the 12th federal holiday. The bill now goes to President Joe Biden’s desk, and he is expected to sign it into law.Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas — two months after the Confederacy had surrendered. That was also about 2 1/2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves in the Southern states.It’s the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was created in 1983.“Our federal holidays are purposely few in number and recognize the most important milestones," said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. “I cannot think of a more important milestone to commemorate than the end of slavery in the United States."Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, speaking next to a large poster of a Black man whose back bore massive scarring from being whipped, said she would be in Galveston this Saturday to celebrate along with Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas.“Can you imagine?” said the rather short Jackson Lee. “I will be standing maybe taller than Sen. Cornyn, forgive me for that, because it will be such an elevation of joy.”The Senate passed the bill a day earlier under a unanimous consent agreement that expedites the process for considering legislation. It takes just one senator’s objection to block such agreements.“Please, let us do as the Senate. Vote unanimously for passage," Rep. David Scott, D-Ga., pleaded with his colleagues.The vote comes as lawmakers struggle to overcome divisions on police reform legislation following the killing of George Floyd by police and as Republican state legislators push what experts say is an unprecedented number of bills aimed at restricting access to the ballot box. While Republicans say the goal is to prevent voter fraud, Democrats contend that the measures are aimed at undermining minority voting rights.Several members of the Congressional Black Caucus took to the floor to speak in favor of the bill. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., said she viewed Juneteenth as a commemoration rather than a celebration because it represented something that was delayed in happening.“It also reminds me of what we don't have today," she said. “And that is full access to justice, freedom and equality. All these are often in short supply as it relates to the Black community."The bill was sponsored by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and had 60 co-sponsors. Democratic leaders moved quickly to bring the bill to the House floor after the Senate's vote the day before.Some Republican lawmakers opposed the effort. Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., said creating the federal holiday was an effort to celebrate “identity politics."“Since I believe in treating everyone equally, regardless of race, and that we should be focused on what unites us rather than our differences, I will vote no," he said in a press release.The vast majority of states recognize Juneteenth as a holiday or have an official observance of the day, and most states hold celebrations. Juneteenth is a paid holiday for state employees in Texas, New York, Virginia and Washington.Under the legislation, the federal holiday would be known as Juneteenth National Independence Day.Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., said that he would vote for the bill and that he supported the establishment of a federal holiday, but he was upset that the name of the holiday included the word “independence” rather than “emancipation.”“Why would the Democrats want to politicize this by coopting the name of our sacred holiday of Independence Day?" Higgins asked.Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Mich., replied, “I want to say to my white colleagues on the other side: Getting your independence from being enslaved in a country is different from a country getting independence to rule themselves.”She added, "We have a responsibility to teach every generation of Black and white Americans the pride of a people who have survived, endured and succeeded in these United States of America despite slavery."The 14 House Republicans who voted against the bill were Andy Biggs of Arizona, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Ronny Jackson of Texas, Doug LaMalfa of California, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Tom McClintock of California, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Mike Rogers of Alabama, Rosendale of Montana, Chip Roy of Texas and Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congress-approves-bill-to-make-juneteenth-a-federal-holiday-101623904080593.html

The station is expected to be completed by 2022.Thursday’s launch is Beijing’s latest demonstration of its growing confidence and capability in space. In recent months, China has returned rock and soil samples to earth from the surface of the moon and landed a six-wheeled robot on Mars; it also landed a craft on the far side of the moon in 2019.Once built, China’s space station will be the only alternative to the two-decade-old, US-led International Space Station (ISS), which may be retired in 2024, Reuters news agency reported.The ISS – from which China is excluded – comprises Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, the US, and 11 member states of the European Space Agency.Also Read | A year on, Galwan braveheart’s kin wait for govt to keep its word“The mission’s launch was broadcast live on CCTV, China’s state broadcaster and also live streamed on China’s social media platforms on Thursday morning, drawing hundreds of millions of views and soon topping the trending list on China’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo,” a state media report said.Since 2003, China has launched six crewed missions and sent 11 astronauts into space, including Zhai Zhigang, who carried out China’s first spacewalk ever on the 2008 Shenzhou mission.On May 30, a cargo spacecraft carrying supplies including food and equipment docked with China’s first space station’s key module Tianhe as part of the preparation for the station to host three astronauts this month.The unmanned Tianzhou-2, or “Heavenly Vessel” in Chinese, docked with Tianhe (the key module).The launch and docking of Tianzhou-2 was carried out a month after Tianhe, the first part of the space station Tiangong, “Heavenly Palace” in Chinese, was launched.In late April, China sent to space Tianhe, the management and control hub of Tiangong, the permanent space station, which it plans to complete by 2022 as part of its ambitious space programme.The Tianhe, which was sent to orbit by a rocket, can provide electricity and accommodate three astronauts for up to six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-crewed-spacecraft-shenzhou-12-in-historic-mission-101623901874096.html

17-06-2021||World||China launches manned space mission: Veteran astronaut, treadmills and more||China sent three astronauts into orbit on Thursday in a high-stakes mission, the first of four crewed space flights to complete the country's space station by the end of next year. China launched Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo into orbit aboard the spacecraft Shenzhou-12 from Jiuquan in northwestern Gansu province, the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) has said.The astronauts are traveling in Shenzhou-12 or Divine Vessel spaceship launched by a Long March-2F Y12 rocket to Tianhe, which means Harmony of the Heavens, the core module of China's new space station. The mission will be China's longest crewed mission to date and the first in nearly five years, as Beijing pushes forward with its ambitious programme to establish itself as a space power.The menThe mission’s commander is Nie Haisheng and the most senior of the three is making his third trip to space. “The task is very arduous and there are many challenges. My colleagues and I will cooperate closely, operate carefully and overcome all difficulties,” Nie, the 56-year-old, said. Nie was among the first batch of Chinese astronauts selected for training in 1998 and is a decorated air force pilot. Nie, the oldest Chinese astronaut to go to space, has said he has packed "things for entertainment and for hosting mini get-togethers" for the long trip.The others in his team are also members of the Chinese military. Also read | A selfie from Mars: China's Zhurong rover spreads its 'wings' on Red PlanetLiu Boming’s previous flight in 2008 included the first spacewalk of China. The 54-year-old said there would be multiple such activities during the mission as the astronauts carry out their science experiments, conduct maintenance and prepare the Tianhe core module to receive two other modules to be sent up next year. China Global Television Network (CGTN) reported that Liu learned about manned space missions in high school and applied to become a military pilot without letting his parents know. According to the Chinese state media outlet, he became a fighter jet pilot in 1990 and has recorded more than 1000 hours of safe flying. He is a major general in the People's Liberation Army.Tang Hongbo, 45, is making his first flight since being selected among the second batch of astronauts in 2010. Tang is a second-generation astronaut with 11 years of experience, CGTN said.Tang said he had been training virtually nonstop for years. “There is pressure. But where there is pressure there is motivation and ... I have confidence in myself and have confidence in our team,” he said.Also read | China’s space ambitions: Robot on Mars, a human on the moonTang told state broadcaster CCTV that he had taken videos of everyday life with his son and wife to watch on the space station.The three men have undergone more than 6000 hours of training, including hundreds of underwater somersaults in full space gear, to get accustomed to their suits for spacewalks. They have prepared by working in a pool in spacesuits to simulate making repairs to the station during a spacewalk, officials have said.‘Space treadmills’The astronauts can choose 120 different types of food and "space treadmills" for exercise as they spend three months on the Tiangong station. They will be able to work off their range of dinner options, which officials have said were all nutritious and tasty, on the special treadmills or exercise bikes.https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-send-3-male-astronauts-for-3-month-stay-in-its-new-space-station-101622443019941.htmlTianhe, a cylinder 55 feet long and 14ft in diameter, has separate living areas for each of them as well as a shared bathroom, dining area and a communication centre to send emails and allow video calls with ground control.The planShenzhou-12 will dock with the main section of the Tiangong space station, Tianhe. Nie, Liu and Tang will be busy testing and maintaining the systems onboard, conducting spacewalks and undertaking scientific experiments.Officials have said another eight missions are planned over the next year and a half to complete the construction of Tiangong in orbit, including the attachment of solar panels and two laboratory modules. The main living section of the Tiangong space station was launched in April while the other two modules will be primarily for scientific work. China has earlier operated two experimental space stations. It also landed a probe on Mars last month that carried the Zhurong rover and earlier landed a probe and rover on the moon and brought back the first lunar samples by any country’s space program since the 1970s. The station, once completed, will allow for stays of up to six months, similar to the much larger International Space Station (ISS), which is nearing the end of its functional lifespan. Tiangong is expected to have a lifespan of at least 10 years. (With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-manned-space-mission-veteran-astronaut-treadmills-and-more-101623897207929.html
17-06-2021||World||UK Parliament approves extending Covid-19 restrictions until July 19||The House of Commons of the UK Parliament approved on Wednesday the government's proposal to postpone the deadline for lifting quarantine restrictions in England until July 19 due to the surge of Covid-19.In favor of extending social restrictions in England voted 461 members of parliament, against -- 60.The move was proposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on June 14 over concerns about the third wave of the pandemic and the spread of the Indian strain of Covid-19. The authorities planned to completely lift restrictions in England on June 21.Scotland earlier also refused to lift restrictions, planned for June 7, and tentatively pushed the date to June 28.According to Johnson, the authorities need more time to vaccinate as many people as possible, especially given the dangers of the Indian strain. The government has already accelerated the vaccination program: by July 19, London plans to vaccinate two-thirds of the population aged over 30, while those in the 18-24 age bracket began receiving their first shots.Currently, the restrictions include the ban on indoor mass events, the closing of nightclubs, social distancing and mask-wearing. The government has recommended to continue working remotely, if possible. Shops, pubs and restaurants are open and can serve visitors indoors.The number of new cases continues to grow in the UK, exceeding 9,000 daily infections as of Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-parliament-approves-extending-covid-19-restrictions-until-july-19-101623896584536.html
17-06-2021||World||Delta variant fuelled 50% rise in Britain Covid-19 prevalence: Study||The rapid spread of the Delta coronavirus variant has driven a 50% rise in infections in England since May, a large prevalence study led by Imperial College London found on Thursday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson delayed the end of restrictions.The government said the data supported Johnson's decision to push back the end of Covid restrictions in England to July 19, citing the threat of the Delta variant first identified in India, and the need to vaccinate more people.The latest round of the REACT-1 prevalence survey, conducted between May 20 and June 7, found prevalence was 0.15%, compared to 0.10% in the last set of data from late April to early May."Prevalence is increasing exponentially, driven by younger ages... and it appears to be doubling every 11 days. Clearly, that is bad news," Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics, Imperial College London, told reporters.The study is one of the largest prevalence surveys in Britain, with 109,000 volunteers tested in its latest round.Riley added that Britain's high vaccination levels made it hard to predict how long that exponential growth would last, saying the rapid rollout of vaccine doses to younger age groups should slow it down. (Graphic on global vaccinations) https://tmsnrt.rs/3tUM8taOver half the adult population of Britain have received two vaccine doses, and more than three-quarters of adults have received at least one vaccine dose.Although the Delta variant is shown to substantially reduce the effectiveness of one dose of vaccine against mild infection, two doses still provide good protection against severe disease, early evidence has shown."These findings highlight the stark context in which we took the difficult decision to delay Step 4 of the roadmap out of lockdown," health minister Matt Hancock said, referring to the lifting of the last remaining restrictions in England."We all must hold our nerve that little bit longer as our vaccine rollout continues."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-fuelled-50-rise-in-britain-covid-19-prevalence-study-101623896604621.html
17-06-2021||World||2021 Desertification and Drought Day: UN puts focus on recovery of degraded land||The World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought is observed each year on June 17, as mandated by the United Nations, to combat the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas due to climate change and detrimental activities carried out by human beings which leave an adverse impact on the environment. While issues like global warming are being predominantly discussed around the world, it is also important to take note of the increasing degradation of the land cover due to deforestation and subsequent desertification.2021 Desertification and Drought Day: Purpose2021 Desertification and Drought Day is being observed on June 17 this year to focus on turning degraded land into healthy land. The United Nations, on its website marking the occasion, stated that restoring degraded land brings economic resilience, creates jobs, raises incomes, and increases food security. It also helps biodiversity to recover.The aim is to prevent the elimination of sustainable living conditions on Earth for all animals, including human beings. Conditions like desertification and drought not only make human life on this planet difficult but also push the environment toward a situation from which it might be impossible to return.What is desertification?2021 World Desertification and Drought Day is also being observed to increase public awareness of the detrimental effects of desertification. According to the United Nations, desertification does not just mean an expansion of existing deserts. It also refers to the overall declining productivity of land due to overexploitation and inappropriate land use by human activity. Poverty, political instability, deforestation, overgrazing, and bad irrigation practices can all lead to desertification and drought, the UN says.2021 World Desertification and Drought Day: This year's themeThis year's theme for the United Nations' world day for fighting desertification and drought is "Restoration. Land. Recovery." Experts believe that we have to stop the process of desertification on an immediate basis, as well as maintain soil fertility and prevent soil from flowing into the water to stick to the current commitment by over 100 countries to restore almost 100 hectares of land over the next decade. The best way is to plant trees, which can eventually lead to land resettlement. At the same time, we have to change the sustainable and alternative methods of land use so that drought conditions are not triggered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2021-desertification-and-drought-day-un-puts-focus-on-recovery-of-degraded-land-101623893119310.html

The high-stakes mission, named Shenzhou 12, was launched on the back of the Long March 2F rocket, which blasted off as scheduled at 9:22am Beijing time (which translates to 6:52am in Indian Standard Time) at Jiuquan in the northwestern Gansu province. The mission is being led by 56-year-old Nie Haisheng, accompanied by fellow spacefarers Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo who are aboard the spacecraft Shenzhou-12, according to the latest updates.Also Read: China to launch spaceship with 3 astronauts on June 17The Chinese astronauts are set to reach Tianhe ("Harmony of the Heavens"), the core module of the new Tiangon space station, on the Shenzhou-12 spacecraft, which was launched atop a Long March 2F rocket. Chinese state television is broadcasting the live coverage of the launch of the Shenzhou 12 mission to the new space station.Among the astronauts in China's space mission, Nie Haisheng has flown to space twice before -- on the Shenzou-6 mission in 2005 and then again on the Shenzhou-10 mission in 2013. The former air force pilot is now the oldest Chinese astronaut to go to space, reported news agency Reuters. Liu Boming flew on the Shenzhou-7 space mission in 2008, while this is the first spaceflight for the other astronaut, Tang Hongbo. The three astronauts are scheduled for a three-month stay aboard the core module of the new space station, which was launched to low Earth orbit on April 28.The three-month stay for Nie, Liu, and Tang will be the longest for any Chinese astronauts, and one focus will be seeing how the men handle their relatively long time in orbit. "The (mission) is longer this time, and not only do we have to set up the core module – this ‘home’ in space – we’ve to carry out a series of pivotal technical tests," Nie told reporters in Jiuquan. Although the Tianhe module has already received a robotic visitor last month -- the Tianzhou-2 cargo craft -- this will be the first time that humans set foot aboard it.Shenzhou-12, meaning “Divine Vessel”, is the third of 11 missions needed to build China’s space station. The most recent of China's space missions was Shenzhou-11, in October 2016, which carried three astronauts for a one-month stay at a prototype precursor for the new Chinese space station.Chinese astronauts have had a comparatively low international profile. US legislation bars NASA from any cooperation with China, and Chinese astronauts have not been to the more than two-decade-old International Space Station (ISS), which has been visited by more than 240 men and women of various nationalities. The ISS may be decommissioned in 2024 if the project does not receive new funding, and China could end up being the operator of the only space station in Earth’s orbit.(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-send-first-crew-to-new-space-station-today-astronauts-prepare-for-liftoff-101623889631810.html

CureVac declined to say how many who got the shot got sick or how many received a placebo. But the results suggest the vaccine works less well for older people than in a younger population, Chief Technology Officer Mariola Fotin-Mleczek said in an interview Wednesday.Though preliminary, the results throw the future of the vaccine into question as wealthy nations around the world move swiftly to inoculate their populations with shots already available. Still, CureVac will finish its trial and plans to gain approval, Chief Executive Officer Franz-Werner Haas said.“There is a huge need for vaccine, and I think we can still make a contribution,” Haas said.The shot could be a boost in the developing world, since it doesn’t require the deep freezing needed for other Covid shots. Partly owned by the German government, CureVac has forged partnerships with Bayer AG, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and the U.K. government aimed at speeding production of its shot and future versions that will target mutated strains.The data comes as the world is at something of a crossroads in the Covid fight, with global infections falling even as outbreaks in places with less access to vaccines serve as a reminder that the pandemic is far from over. The wealthiest countries have taken an outsize share of the more than 2.4 billion shots administered so far.The proliferation of variants in the CureVac trial is testimony to how the pandemic has changed since the first large vaccine clinical trials were run last year.Genetic SequencingCureVac’s researchers genetically sequenced 124 of the 134 cases they included in their analysis. Just one of the sequenced cases was due to the original SARS-CoV-2 virus first identified in Wuhan, China. The rest came from a range of variants, including 21% of cases attributable to a new variant called lambda that was first identified in Peru.The World Health Organization added lambda to its watchlist as a variant of interest on Monday.Some 57% of the Covid cases in the study were due to so-called variants of concern, the four variants that the World Health Organization has deemed the most worrying. Most of these -- about 41% of all the cases -- were due to the alpha variant first observed in the U.K., CureVac said.That variant is now the most common in the U.S., and other vaccines, including shots from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE as well as Novavax Inc., have shown themselves effective against it. CureVac didn’t release detailed data about how its shot performed against each of the variants.Final ReadoutMore details will emerge in the final readout of the study, which will include more than 200 Covid cases and could come within two or three weeks, CureVac said.Like the shots from Moderna Inc. and the Pfizer-BioNtech alliance, CureVac’s vaccine relies on mRNA, enlisting the body’s own cells as vaccine factories. Unproven until last year, the technology has now catapulted to the forefront of the global fight against Covid.CureVac’s shot, though, is subtly different than its competitors, because it uses an unmodified form of mRNA.CureVac has said it plans to supply 300 million vaccine doses this year, enough to immunize 150 million people. Together with partners, it has said it will supply more than 1 billion doses in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/curevac-covid-shot-falls-short-with-47-efficacy-in-early-result-101623888739529.html
17-06-2021||World||Biden tells Putin certain cyberattacks should be 'off-limits'||US President Joe Biden told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday that certain critical infrastructure should be "off-limits" to cyberattacks, but analysts said his efforts were unlikely to be more successful than previous attempts to carve out safe zones online.Biden wasn't explicit about which areas he wanted out of bounds, but spoke of 16 kinds of infrastructure - an apparent reference to the 16 sectors designated as critical by the U.S. Homeland Security Department, including telecommunications, healthcare, food and energy."We agreed to task experts in both our countries to work on specific understandings about what is off-limits," Biden said following a lakeside summit with Putin in Geneva. "We'll find out whether we have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order."A senior administration official said that the proposal was focused on "destructive" hacks, as opposed to the conventional digital espionage operations carried out by intelligence agencies worldwide.Putin's response to the idea wasn't immediately clear. In a separate press conference, he said the two leaders had agreed to "begin consultations" on cybersecurity issues but didn't directly refer to Biden's proposal.The threat of destructive hacks aimed at critical infrastructure, a staple of disaster movies where renegade hackers trigger blackouts and mayhem, have long worried experts.The United States had its first serious taste of what that might mean last month, when ransom-seeking cybercriminals briefly triggered the closure of a major U.S. pipeline network, interrupting gasoline deliveries and sparking panic-buying up and down the East Coast.Earlier cyberattacks aimed at the Ukrainian power grid and a Saudi petrochemical plant have also drawn concern.In all those cases, the hackers involved are accused by the United States of either working directly for the Russian government or from Russian territory.Russian officials have repeatedly denied carrying out or tolerating cyberattacks, and Putin on Wednesday made no concessions on the issue."We need to throw out all kinds of insinuations, sit down at the expert level and start working in the interests of the United States and Russia," Putin told reporters.He then made an insinuation of his own, saying that Russian officials had tracked malicious digital activity coming from the United States."We certainly see where the attacks are coming from. We see that this work is coordinated from U.S. cyberspace," Putin said.Experts were skeptical that Biden's proposal would be taken seriously by Putin."There's no indication at all that he actually went along with it," said Keir Giles, a Russia expert with the London-based Chatham House think tank.Giles said that grappling with the cyber threat emerging from Russia would require "an outbreak of honesty" on the Kremlin's side."There's no indication – at least from Putin's public comments so far – that that outbreak has begun," Giles said.The fate of a similar agreement between former U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese leader Xi Jinping is not encouraging, said Stefan Soesanto, a researcher at the Center for Security Studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.The 2015 agreement theoretically banned the theft of intellectual property for commercial gain, but many cyber experts that track Chinese hacking say Beijing eventually reneged on the deal."Will Biden fare better than Obama/Xi? I don't think it will," Soesanto said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-tells-putin-certain-cyberattacks-should-be-offlimits-101623886241246.html

He notably kept wearing his aviators while meeting Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle on Sunday.The custom aviators are a brand manufactured in Massachusetts and designed for fighter pilots, the White House said, announcing the gifts after Biden and Putin concluded their summit in Geneva on Wednesday.The US leader also gave Putin a crystal sculpture of an American bison made by a New York-based glass company.The Kremlin has not said whether and how Putin may have reciprocated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-gifts-vladimir-putin-custom-aviator-sunglasses-101623873020291.html
17-06-2021||World||Israeli airstrikes hit militant sites in Gaza, first since ceasefire||Israeli airstrikes hit militant sites in the Gaza Strip early Wednesday, and Palestinians responded by sending a series of fire-carrying balloons back across the border for a second straight day — further testing the fragile ceasefire that ended last month’s war between Israel and Hamas.The latest round of violence was prompted by a parade of Israeli ultranationalists through contested east Jerusalem on Tuesday. Palestinians saw the march as a provocation and sent balloons into southern Israel, causing several blazes in parched farmland. Israel then carried out the airstrikes — the first such raids since the May 21 ceasefire ended 11 days of fighting — and more balloons followed.The airstrikes targeted facilities used by Hamas militants for meetings to plan attacks, the army said. There were no reports of injuries.“The Hamas terror organization is responsible for all events transpiring in the Gaza Strip, and will bear the consequences for its actions,” the army said. It added that it was prepared for any scenario, “including a resumption of hostilities.”By Wednesday afternoon, masked Palestinians sent a number of balloons, laden with fuses and flaming rags, into Israel. Several fires were reported.The unrest provided the first test of the ceasefire at a time when Egyptian mediators have been working to reach a longer-term agreement. It comes as tensions have risen again in Jerusalem, as they did before the recent war, leading Gaza's Hamas rulers to fire a barrage of rockets at the holy city on May 10. The fighting claimed more than 250 Palestinian lives and killed 13 people in Israel.An Egyptian security official said his government has been in “direct and around-the-clock” contacts with Israeli officials and the Gaza rulers to keep the ceasefire and to urge them to refrain from provocative acts.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing behind-the-scenes diplomacy, said the US administration has also been in touch with Israel as part of the efforts.The two sides seem to agree "not to escalate to the tipping point,” he said. “And we do every effort to prevent this.”The flare-up also has created a test for Israel’s new government, which took office early this week. The diverse coalition includes several hard-line parties as well as dovish and centrist parties, along with the first Arab faction ever to be part of an Israeli government.Keeping the delicate coalition intact will be a difficult task for the new prime minister, Naftali Bennett.In Tuesday’s parade, hundreds of Israeli ultranationalists, some chanting “Death to Arabs,” marched in east Jerusalem in a show of force. Hamas called on Palestinians to “resist” the parade, which was meant to celebrate Israel’s capture of east Jerusalem in 1967. Palestinians consider it a provocation.In a scathing condemnation on Twitter, Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, who heads the centrist Yesh Atid Party, said those shouting racist slogans were “a disgrace to the Israeli people.”Bennett, who will hand over the prime minister’s job to Lapid after two years, is a hard-line Israeli nationalist who has promised a pragmatic approach as he presides over a delicate, diverse coalition government.Though there were concerns the march would raise tensions, canceling it would have opened Bennett and other right-wing members of the coalition to intense criticism from those who would view it as a capitulation to Hamas.Mansour Abbas, whose Raam party is the first Arab faction to join an Israeli coalition, said the march was “an attempt to set the region on fire for political aims,” with the intention of undermining the new government.Abbas said the police and public security minister should have canceled the event.While the parade provided the immediate impetus for the balloons, Hamas is also angry because Israel has tightened its blockade of the territory since the ceasefire. The restrictions include a ban on imports of fuel for Gaza’s power plant and raw materials.Israel imposed the blockade after Hamas, a militant group that seeks Israel’s destruction, seized control of Gaza from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority in 2007. Israel and Hamas have fought four wars and numerous skirmishes since then. Israel says the blockade, enforced with Egypt, is needed to prevent Hamas from importing and developing weapons.One of the masked activists firing the balloons said they launched hundreds of them Tuesday and will continue sending them in response to what he described as Israeli provocations in east Jerusalem.After capturing east Jerusalem in 1967, Israel annexed the area in a move not recognized by most of the international community. It considers the entire city its capital, while the Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state. The competing claims over east Jerusalem, home to Jewish, Christian and Muslim holy sites, lie at the heart of the conflict and have sparked many rounds of violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-airstrikes-target-gaza-sites-first-since-ceasefire-101623872928329.html

17-06-2021||India||Madras HC allows Rajiv case convicts to make video calls to kin||The Madras high court on Thursday allowed a plea to allow life convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, Nalini Sriharan and her husband Murugan to make video calls to their relatives in Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom.A two-judge division bench of justices N Kirubakaran and V M Velumani passed the order. The plea was filed by Sriharan’s mother, S Padma, to allow the couple to make video calls to speak to their kin after Murugan had lost his father in April 2020. They had sought permission to make video calls to his mother and sister in Sri Lanka and London for at least 10 mins daily.During previous hearings in the case last year, the state and the union government had taken a stance that they should not be permitted to make video calls to a foreign country. The state had opposed it, submitting that it was under the domain of the ministry of external affairs, and there were no provisions in the Tamil Nadu prisons rules for them to make decisions involving foreign countries. Hence the court had asked the Union external ministry to respond to the issue. The then assistant solicitor general of India G Karthikeyan had argued that the life convicts should not be permitted to make live calls to Sri Lanka as it would hamper the investigations, led by multi-disciplinary monitoring agency (MDMA), into the larger conspiracy of the assassination. The court had refused to accept the submission setting that they were going to make a condolence call.Former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi got assassinated in Sriperumbudur in May 1991, and seven convicts have been serving imprisonment for more than three decades. Chief minister M K Stalin has written to President Ramnath Kovind to remit their sentence and release them, which is a call supported by all regional political parties in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-allows-rajiv-case-convicts-to-make-video-calls-to-kin-101623954079156.html
17-06-2021||India||2 TDP men hacked to death in Ahdra||Two brothers, both members of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), were on Thursday killed in a long-running feud with another family from their village, Pesaravai, in Gadivemula block, around 300km from Vijayawada. It wasn’t immediately known whether there was an additional political angle to the killing. The two were hacked to death after being knocked down by a vehicle. The deceased, former sarpanch Vaddu Nageshwar Reddy (45) and his brother Vaddu Pratap Reddy (43), former president of the local primary agriculture cooperative society, are followers and close aides of former MLA and TDP leader Gouru Charita Reddy. “Three of their relatives were also injured in the attack. They were immediately shifted to the Nandyal hospital, where they were declared out of danger,” Gadivemula sub-inspector of police Sridhar said. According to the preliminary information gathered by the police, Nageshwar Reddy and Pratap Reddy, along with three other relatives, were on their way to the local crematorium to collect the ashes of their cousin, who died three days ago, when a group of five to six people in an SUV waylaid them. The assailants first knocked the brothers down and then attacked them with sharp weapons, including sickles. “Both the brothers died on the spot, while the three relatives sustained injuries,” Sridhar added.He attributed the killings to a feud dating back decades, although it has not resulted in any deaths in the past 25 years. “We have booked a case of murder and attempt to murder. After committing the offence, the assailants fled the village. We have launched a manhunt for them,” Sridhar said. Former MLA Charitha Reddy visited the village and called on the bereaved families of the victims. She demanded that stringent punishment be given to the accused. TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu expressed shock over the killings and blamed the ruling YSR Congress party. “The law-and-order situation in the state has completely deteriorated. There is no protection to the lives of the TDP leaders and activists (who are) killed in broad daylight. So far, at least 30 TDP leaders have been killed in the last two years. I wonder what the police are doing in the state,” he lamented, and added that the TDP will stand by the bereaved families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-tdp-men-hacked-to-death-in-ahdra-101623954021851.html
17-06-2021||India||HC grants interim bail to UT filmmaker||The Kerala high court on Thursday granted interim anticipatory bail to Lakshadweep-based filmmaker and model Aisha Sultana in connection with a sedition case filed over her remark on the Union territory’s administrator. The court has reserved the final order on her anticipatory bail application for next weekA single judge bench of Justice Ashok Menon directed her to appear before the police for questioning on June 20 in the case. OnJune 11, the Kavaratti police registered a case against Sultana under sections 124 (A) (sedition) and 153 (B) (acts against national interests) of the Indian penal code. The FIR was based on the complaint of Lakshadweep BJP president C Abdul Khadar Haji. In the complaint, Haji cited a debate on a Malayalam news channels, in which Sultana called the Union territory’s administrator, Praful Khoda Patel a bio-weapon. Haji said her words were in bad taste and intended to create hatred and aversion in the minds of people. Later, Sultana expressed regrets over her words.Patel has become a controversial figure in the UT for his whimsical orders, some of which threaten the way of life of the residents or threaten the islands’ fragile environment. But her comment did not go down well with the Lakshadweep administration and the union government, both of which opposed her bail plea saying her words are being quoted by many, including foreign media, to portray the country in bad light. Opposing Sultana’s plea, standing counsel for the UT, S Manu said, “She made a powerful and noxious assertion against the government of India. She has practically sowed seeds of separatism in the minds of people.”The counsel for the central government, Krishna Raj added “her [Sultana’s]remarks have international ramifications.” However, filmmaker’s counsel P Vijaybhanu argued that bio-weapon remark was used to criticise new regulations brought in the island. He also cited the June 3Supreme Court judgement in journalist Vinod Dua’s case that mere strong words do not count as an act of sedition. The court had quashed the FIR lodged against Dua in Himachal Pradesh in May last year, in connection with uploading a video in Youtube for allegedly spreading rumours and ‘instigating’ people during the communal violence the broke out in Delhi in February 2020.“A citizen has a right to criticise or comment upon the measures undertaken by the government and its functionaries, so long as he does not incite people to violence against the government established by law or with the intention of creating public disorder,” said the top court in its order. For over a month now, residents of the archipelago have been protesting against the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (2021) that proposes to develop the islands as a major tourist destination, a proposed Goonda Act and plan to ban cow slaughter, saying that the changes “will affect the unique culture and tradition” of the island. They allege it will destroy the islands’ character and identity since 97% of the islands are covered by pristine forests and 95% of its Muslim population belong to the protected scheduled tribe category. Many parliamentarians, former bureaucrats, and artists have described the draft regulations as “arbitrary” and aimed against the majority community of the islands. On May 31, the Kerala assembly passed a unanimous resolution seeking the recall of the administrator and later, 93 retired bureaucrats sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticising the “partisan attitude” of the new administrator and called for the protection of the unique culture and tradition of the islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-grants-interim-bail-to-ut-filmmaker-101623954020648.html
17-06-2021||India||Mehul Choksi still in Dominica hospital; status changes from police custody to jail||New Delhi: The magistrate’s court in Dominica’s Roseau on Thursday changed Mehul Choksi’s custody from police custody to prison even as the businessman continues to be under treatment at the Dominica-China Friendship Hospital where his health has deteriorated, people familiar with the developments said. As soon as he gets better, he will be sent to the state prison in the illegal entry case filed by the Dominica police, they said. Choksi is produced in the magistrate court, either virtually or physically, every two-three days on orders of the judge. The court has already rejected his plea for bail, underlining that he is a flight risk and has no ties to the country. The next hearing in the magistrate’s court in the illegal entry case is scheduled on June 25. The Eastern Caribbean High Court has adjourned his habeas corpus plea and may take it up on July 1. Choksi, 62, who went missing from Antigua on May 23, has alleged that he was abducted by police officials from India and Antigua and brought to Dominica in a vessel, a charge rejected by both Antiguan and Indian officials. New Delhi has sought his deportation on the ground that he was the key accused in the Punjab National Bank fraud worth ₹950 million. India has countered assertions that he had given up his Indian citizenship, pointing out that his declaration to renounce his citizenship was never accepted by the ministry of home affairs and this decision was conveyed to him as well. Choksi fled India on January 4, 2018. Dominica too, while referring to him as an “Indian” citizen, has said he entered the country illegally.In its complaint filed in the illegal entry case, Dominica police has claimed “Mehul Choksi entered the state of Commonwealth of Dominica at a place - Toucari Bay - not approved as a port of entry, contrary to the provisions of Immigration and Passport Act”.On June 10, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) also filed a fresh chargesheet against Choksi providing additional evidence to an Indian court to allege that he knew about investigations against him much before fleeing and started destroying evidence with the help of his associates. His lawyer Vijay Aggarwal rejected India’s argument that Choksi continued to be a citizen of India, calling India’s reliance on various rules “fractured understanding of law.”Antigua’s Prime Minister Gaston Browne has already said the island nation will not take the fugitive back.The ministry of external affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi on Thursday said “the criminal charges that Mehul Choksi faces in India and the facts relating to his continued Indian citizenship have been suitably brought to the attention of the authorities in the Commonwealth of Dominica,” he said.“Choksi continues to be in the custody of authorities in the Commonwealth of Dominica and legal proceedings are underway. The Government of India is actively engaged with the Dominican government to seek the early deportation or handing over to India of Mehul Choksi to face justice in our country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mehul-choksi-still-in-dominica-hospital-status-changes-from-police-custody-to-jail-101623953664774.html

Dismissing the election of his uncle to the post of president, Chirag said only 9 members were present at the national executive meeting, which is illegal. "I have written to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla Ji to reconsider his decision to accept him (Pashupati Kumar Paras) as leader of the parliamentary party. Our party constitution says leader of the party in Parliament or Assembly will be elected by Central parliamentary board," Chirag said, adding that the Speaker might not be aware of the party's constitution. He said he has also written to the Election Commission, urging it to stop the Paras-headed faction from using its symbol and flag in its meeting.LJP's general secretary Abdul Khaliq said a physical meeting of its national executive will be held in the national capital on Sunday to reiterate Paswan's earlier election as its national president amid the split in the organisation after Paras and four other party MPs staged a coup against him, PTI reported."The faction headed by my uncle can be an independent group but cannot represent LJP," Chirag said.The LJP has six MPs, including Paswan, in Lok Sabha and none in Rajya Sabha. Five of its MPs recently elected Paras as their president in place of Paswan. Lok Sabha secretariat then notified his election after all five of them met the Speaker with their representation.Paras, on the other hand, said the rift between the two camps will be addressed and sorted out. "I have just been appointed as the national president of the party. I can not change things in a minute. Give us time, we will sort out every fissure in the party by sitting together and further strengthen the party," Paras said.On Sunday, Pashupati Kumar Paras, the younger brother of LJP founder Ram Vilas E along with five other MPs met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and handed over a letter to him seeking removal of Chirag Paswan as party chief and as the Lok Sabha Parliamentary party leader.Om Birla accepted Paras as the floor leader of the LJP in the lower house. In a revised list of floor leaders of parties on Monday Paras was listed as the Lok Sabha LJP leader. LJP was formed by former Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan in 2000. Paswan, a heavyweight leader in Bihar politics, passed away in October 2020.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-ljp-president-have-approached-election-commission-says-chirag-paswan-101623950267651.html

Rajnath's response came after the Union defence minister was asked regarding the chief ministerial candidate ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. Uttar Pradesh goes into elections next year.The defence minister also quashed the criticism levelled at the BJP government over its handling of the Covid-19 crisis and said that they have always questioned the government’s work. Rajnath Singh on Thursday also in a veiled message to China said that India is peace-loving but it can reply to aggression when required. “We seek world peace (but) if someone shows us an aggressive attitude, we will respond. Last year in Galwan Valley, our soldiers displayed exemplary courage and valour in line of duty. I salute all brave soldiers who laid down their lives fighting for the nation,” Rajnath Singh said while dedicating 12 strategic roads constructed by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) to the nation in Arunachal’s Kimin.Rajnath Singh also said that the government is committed to the growth of the northeastern region. “The development of the region remained stagnant after independence. However, after the NDA came to power in 2014, the region witnessed accelerated development. There are many challenges due to its close proximity with foreign countries,” he further added.Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh chief minister earlier this month met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and president Ram Nath Kovind after reports of friction in the party but the discussions were mostly concentrated on the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-minister-rajnath-says-yogi-adityanath-s-commitment-can-t-be-questioned-101623951343136.html

The World Health Organization (WHO) has listed the Delta variant as the fourth variant of concern (VoC).Also Read: How Delta variant of Covid-19 is now wreaking havoc across the worldB1.617.1 strain or the Kappa variant, too, was first detected in India.Sputnik V, which is world’s first registered vaccine against Covid-19, received emergency use authorisation (EUA) in India in April. In January, Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, and Oxford University-AstraZeneca’s shot, which is being manufactured in the country as Covishield by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), were granted EUA by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). Covaxin and Covishield have been used since the beginning of the nationwide vaccination drive on January 16.A total of 67 countries, including India, have authorised the shot.Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, which, like Bharat Biotech, is based in Hyderabad, is Sputnik V’s distributor in India. Earlier on Thursday, it was announced that the vaccine will be available in nine more cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Chennai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-v-to-offer-booster-shot-against-delta-covid-19-variant-rdif-101623945788012.html

At present, Indian airlines are allowed to operate a maximum of 50 per cent of their pre-pandemic domestic flights.The civil aviation ministry last month also said it will cut down seating capacity from 80% to 50% of pre-Covid-19 domestic flights from June 1. “This decision has been taken in view of the sudden surge in the number of active Covid-19 cases across the country, decrease in passenger traffic and passenger load factor (occupancy rate),” the ministry’s order stated.According to the DGCA data, among private carriers IndiGo catered to 1.6 million passengers in May, a 55.3% share of the domestic market, SpiceJet flew 0.199 million passengers, accounting for a 9.4% share of the market.The occupancy rate or load factor of the six major Indian airlines was between 39.3 % and 64% in May, it stated. The occupancy rate at SpiceJet was 64% in May, the DGCA indicated. The occupancy rates for IndiGo, Vistara, GO FIRST (previously known as Go Air), Air India and AirAsia India were 51.2%, 40.9%, 63.3%, 39.3% and 44.4% respectively, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/domestic-passenger-traffic-dipped-by-60-in-may-compared-to-april-dgca-101623944899059.html

It could spread at double the rate," said an official during the presentation.In the first wave, the number of Covid-19 patients was highest at 3,01,752 on September 13, 2020, and in the second wave, the highest was on April 22, when the number reached 6,99,858.If a third wave caused by Delta Plus hits, the number will be the highest, according to the projection. The projection is worrisome as many people will be completely vaccinated by that time.1st Delta Plus reported in Madhya PradeshMadhya Pradesh has reported the first case of Delta plus in Bhopal, state medical education minister Vishwas Sarang has confirmed. The patient is a 65-year-old woman and her condition is stable. Reports said she has received vaccines.What is Delta Plus?A variant of interest, Delta Plus is a mutation of the Delta virus, which was first reported in India. As on June 7, this variant was present in six genomes in India. This variant is believed to be more virulent. It has been claimed that this variant nullified the use of the monoclonal antibody.

Google’s fresh grants totalling ₹113 crore is on top of the ₹135 Crore announced in April aimed at expanding the reach of public health information campaigns and supporting emergency relief work. The second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic overwhelmed India’s health infrastructure that witnessed massive oxygen shortage.“Our hearts go out to those in India impacted by the ongoing C[ovid]-19 crisis, and we continue to look for ways to help,” tweeted Pichai.Google will support procurement and installation of approximately 80 oxygen generation plants in healthcare facilities in high-need and rural locations with new grants to two non-profits - GiveIndia and PATH. In a blog post, Sanjay Gupta, country head and vice president for Google India, said that the tech giant is turning its focus to help strengthen India’s healthcare infrastructure and workforce, especially in rural areas.“The two organizations will work together to oversee the oxygen program, providing project management support,” Gupta wrote.Also Read | Sundar Pichai surprises winner of Doodle for Google contest with a video callIndia has been witnessing a decline in daily Covid-19 cases after various state governments imposed lockdown-like restrictions to contain the spread.

They were arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).Also read| Delhi riots: Court grants release to three students, two days after bail orderAfter release from jail on bail, Kalita lashed out at the government and said it's trying to suppress dissent, the voice of people, reported news agency PTI."We have received tremendous support inside jail; will continue our struggle," PTI quoted Narwal as saying.Tanha also echoed Narwal's words as he said the fight against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will continue. "Kept hope that I will be released one day; fight against CAA, NRC, NPR will continue," PTI quoted him as saying.The release of the three activists was delayed over the verification of their addresses and sureties. The Delhi court in its order to immediately release the activists said that the verification process by the police could not be a plausible reason for the accused to be kept imprisoned, reported PTI.After bail from the high court, the student activists have moved to the trial court seeking immediate release from the prison. However, it deferred the order on their plea for Thursday, leading them to move to the Delhi High Court. The high court then ordered the lower court to proceed with the issue with "promptitude and expedition".The Delhi HC while granting the activists bail on June 15 said, "in an anxiety to suppress dissent, the state has blurred the line between the right to protest and terrorist activity" and if such a mindset gains traction, it would be a "sad day for democracy".The student activists were accused of being the "masterminds" of the February Delhi riots in 2020.

17-06-2021||India||India capable of giving befitting reply to aggression: Rajnath Singh||In an indirect swipe at China, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Thursday that while India was a ‘priest of peace’, the country was also capable of giving a befitting response to aggression by other nations. The defence minister made the remark while inaugurating 12 roads built by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) --10 in Arunachal Pradesh and one each in Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir. Singh mentioned the “bravery, valour and sacrifice” by Indian soldiers during last year’s Galwan Valley clash to protect the country’s boundaries and paid tribute to the soldiers who had lost their lives. “India is a priest of world peace. We have never indulged in aggression with any country in the world including our neighbours, but we are capable of giving a befitting reply to those who show aggression towards us,” said Singh at an event held at Lakhimpur in Assam close to the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border. “The new roads will not only help civilian population of the region in allowing them easier communication and availability of goods but also help secure our international borders and aid movement of defence forces,” Singh said. He mentioned that the northeast region was of strategic importance as it is surrounded by five countries, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and China. “Due to its proximity to international boundaries, the region has several challenges. Smuggling used to be a big menace earlier, especially of fake Indian currency notes (FICN). But it has come down in recent years,” said Singh. The minister mentioned that the road projects are part of the Centre’s Act East policy of opening up the northeast for economic, strategic and cultural relations between states of the region to countries in South East Asia. The event was attended by Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu, Union sports minister Kiren Rijiju and Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-capable-of-giving-befitting-reply-to-aggression-rajnath-singh-101623942078829.html
17-06-2021||India||India seeks solution for problems faced by US-bound students||India on Thursday called for a “constructive solution” to problems faced by students whose plans to travel to the US to join classes in the autumn have been hit by the absence of uniform vaccination requirements. The US embassy began scheduling visa interviews for Indian students this week and American officials have said applicants won’t require proof of Covid-19 vaccination to enter the US. Students will only require a negative Covid-19 test conducted three days prior to their departure. While thousands of students have secured visa appointments for July and August, some American educational institutions are calling for applicants who got the Covaxin or Sputnik V shots to be re-vaccinated as these jabs are not recognised by US authorities. Asked about these issues at a weekly news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said: “There is no uniformity in the requirements. The US government has clarified that vaccination is not a mandatory requirement for our students to travel.” He said “multiple conversations” were on between India students and the US universities. “We would obviously support out students. I think everyone concerned is interested in ensuring that the students are able to reach the universities and undertake regular classes and we hope that a constructive solution is found,” he added. Covaxin and Covishield are the two main jabs being used in India’s vaccination programme. Covishield, which is the AstraZeneca vaccine made in India, has been granted an emergency use listing by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is accepted under the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) guidelines for entry of foreign travellers. While ruling out the possibility of India issuing any “vaccine passport” at the present time, Bagchi said global discussions on this issue should be conducted in the context of vaccines being more widely available around the world. “There is an ongoing global debate on this issue of so-called vaccine passports. We feel this has to be linked to the larger issue of vaccine equity, given that many developing countries have not yet been able to vaccinate a large percentage of their population,” he said. “We would favour discussions on the subject of vaccine passports with greater focus on vaccine equity. I don’t have any information about India issuing any vaccine passport,” he said. In response to another question on the sharing of the US administration’s plans to share 80 million surplus doses of vaccines with countries around the world, Bagchi said India is still awaiting details regarding the timeline and quantity of shots that will be shared with various countries. Bagchi also said India is hopeful the process of the WHO granting emergency use authorisation for the Covaxin shot developed by Bharat Biotech will be expeditiously completed. “We are keeping a close watch on this issue. Our expectation would be that this process would be completed speedily,” he said. Bharat Biotech submitted an expression of interest for emergency use authorisation to WHO on April 19. The UN’s health agency sought more information from Bharat Biotech following the submission. WHO’s latest update on emergency use listing of Covid-19 vaccines, issued on June 16, shows that a pre-submission meeting is planned for June 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-seeks-solution-for-problems-faced-by-us-bound-students-101623940999204.html

More results are likely to come in the next two or three months.During the survey, it was found that resettlement colonies in South Delhi's urban areas that have a very congested population had the highest seroprevalence of 74.7 per cent, ANI quoted Dr Puneet Misra, Professor of Community Medicine at AIIMS, New Delhi as saying. Dr Misra led the survey."In congested Urban areas of Delhi, since children already have high seroprevalence, opening schools may not be a very risky proposition. During the second wave, the NCR region of Faridabad (rural area) has a seroprevalence of 59.3 per cent (almost equal in both age groups), could be considered high compared to previous national surveys," ANI cited the survey.Dr Misra said these areas in Delhi and NCR (Faridabad) may have higher seroprevalence after the severe second wave of coronavirus. Probably, these levels of seroprevalence may be protective against the third wave, reported the news agency.Also read: AIIMS resumes routine inpatient admissions and elective surgeriesThe survey said Gorakhpur is the most affected in rural areas, which means the chances of herd immunity are higher. Gorakhpur Rural has a very high seroprevalence of 87.9 per cent (2-18 years) with 80.6 per cent and above 18 years with 90.3 per cent, ANI reported.The least seroprevalence (51.9 per cent) was found in Agartala rural, which is claimed to be likely because it also included some tribal populations that usually have lower mobility leading to lower vulnerability to infection.More than half the rural population (62.3 per cent) surveyed showed evidence of past infection, ANI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/possible-3rd-wave-of-covid-unlikely-to-affect-children-reveals-who-aiims-survey-101623935359820.html

Bharat Biotech has two vaccines which are being tried on children while the trial for Zydus Cadilla's vaccine against Covid-19 included children from the very beginning. So if everything goes according to the plans of the vaccine makers, India will have four vaccines for children.CovaxinBharat Biotech's Covaxin in an Indian vaccine developed by the Hyderabad-based vaccine maker and the Indian Council of Medical Research. While the vaccine is being administered to adults and has around 78 per cent efficay. Now the vaccine is in the trial phase on children between 2 to 18 years old.Bharat Biotech's nasal vaccine (BBV154)Bharat Biotech's one-shot nasal vaccine, which is believed to emerge as a game-changer, is already under trial. And since it's a nasal vaccine, making it very convenient for children's vaccination, the trial included children.Zydus Cadila's ZyCov-DZydus Cadila's ZyCov-D is another vaccine which is being tested on children belonging to the age group of 12 to 18, apart from adults. This vaccine will soon apply for licensure and when it gets cleared, the vaccine can be administered to children.Novavax/CovavaxNovavax or Covavax will be the fourth vaccine to begin clinical trials for children in India. The vaccine has been developed by Novavax which has a tie-up with Pune's Serum Institute of India. The vaccine has overall efficacy of 90.4 per cent.Are children at greater risk?No, despite assumptions and projections that the possible third wave of the pandemic in India will affect children, there is no scientific evidence regarding it, experts have reiterated.

Bharat Biotech’s vaccine, Covaxin, is among three shots currently being used in India. Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) is manufacturing Oxford University-AstraZeneca’s shot locally as Covishield, while Russia’s Sputnik V received emergency use authorisation (EUA) in April.Both Covaxin and Covishield were granted EUA by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) in January for the nationwide vaccination drive which began on the 16th of that month.Earlier, there were reports that Bharat Biotech submitted Covaxin’s phase 3 trial data to WHO on Wednesday, with the global health body set to review its application for approval on June 23. The firm, however, has been facing questions over its phase 3 trial data; it first said it will make the results of the trial public in June, only to announce later that it will, in fact, do so in July.Also Read: Covaxin phase 3 trial results to be out in July, says Bharat BiotechAn interim analysis of the trials found Covaxin found it to be 78% effective against symptomatic disease, and 100% against serious illness, according to Bharat Biotech.Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) turned down Bharat Biotech’s application seeking EUA for Covaxin in the US, citing “the lack of data on clinical trials.” Following the FDA’s decision, Bharat Biotech’s partner in the US, Ocugen Inc, announced they would now seek a full-use approval for the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/incorrect-bharat-biotech-dismisses-reports-it-submitted-phase-3-trial-data-to-who-101623938860722.html
17-06-2021||India||Army top brass reviews situation along borders with China, Pakistan||The army’s top brass on Thursday kicked off a two-day conference to discuss important organisational and operational matters including the situation along the country’s borders with China and Pakistan, officials familiar with the development said. The biennial Army Commanders’ Conference is chaired by the army chief. “The operational situation on the northern and western borders was reviewed on the opening day of the conference, chaired by army chief General MM Naravane,” said one of the officials cited above. The review is significant against the backdrop of the ongoing negotiations for disengagement of Indian and Chinese soldiers from friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, and the ceasefire between Indian and Pakistani armies holding at the Line of Control (LoC), the official added. The conference is taking place at a time when India and China have only had limited success in hammering out an agreement for disengagement of their soldiers deployed at friction points on the LAC. The Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have held 11 rounds of talks between corps commander-ranked officers since June 6, 2020, to reduce tensions along the disputed border. The only significant outcome of the military dialogue has been the disengagement of front-line troops and weaponry in the Pangong Tso sector in mid-February after the ninth round of talks. Talks have not made any headway in resolving the problems at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang. Things have, however, been quiet on the LoC after the Indian and Pakistani militaries announced on February 25 that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the LoC from midnight of February 24. India and Pakistan had agreed to a ceasefire on the LoC in November 2003, but it was frequently violated. Last month, the army chief said that the restoration of ceasefire between the two armies was holding, had led to a significant drop in infiltration by terrorists from Pakistan and contributed to the overall sense of peace and well-being in border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-top-brass-reviews-situation-along-borders-with-china-pakistan-101623937938307.html

17-06-2021||India||Theaterisation plans being refined through wider talks before seeking nod from CCS||The defence ministry and the armed forces are refining the military’s theaterisation plans through internal consultations and detailed discussions with other ministries involved before seeking the approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) to implement the long-awaited military reform to optimally use the resources of the armed forces, senior officials familiar with the developments said on Thursday. Different aspects related to theaterisation were discussed and examined in detail by top government officials who reviewed a draft cabinet note on new joint structures at a meeting held in South Block earlier this month, said one of the officials cited above. The key points discussed included the executing authority for theatre commands, the geographies they will control, command and control structures, budgeting, extending the service of senior three-star officers who will take over as theatre commanders and placing some paramilitary forces under the commands, said a second official. Some of these issues involve the finance and home ministries. Theaterisation refers to placing specific units of the army, the navy and the air force under a theatre commander. Such commands are to be led by an officer from any of the three services, depending on the roles assigned to them. HT reported in February that India was set to begin a formal roll-out of its long-awaited theaterisation plan, with the Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command likely to be launched by May. Deliberations on the proposal are likely to take more time as all stakeholders have to be brought on board and the previous timelines may have to be revised. “Processes have to be followed before the proposal is sent to the CCS for approval. We have to have more discussions to iron out the details of the theaterisation plan. All stakeholders have to be in agreement on what is the best way to address the country’s security requirements. But there will be no inordinate delay,” said the first official. Apart from the Air Defence and Maritime Theatre Commands, India is expected to have three other integrated commands to secure its western, northern and eastern fronts. In addition, a logistics command is in the works to avoid duplication of efforts and resources. “Some paramilitary forces, which come under the home ministry, may be subsumed into the theatre commands. The coast guard will also come under the Maritime Theatre Command. These issues are being discussed,” said the second official. Experts said building consensus among stakeholders was crucial to take the theaterisation plan forward. It is crucial to address the concerns of all stakeholders, including the services and other ministries involved, before the cabinet note is sent for the approval of the CCS, said former director general of military operations Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd). “A final decision will be taken after due deliberations to streamline all aspects related to theatre commands. I hope theaterisation is accorded top priority and the necessary approvals come as early as possible so that the armed forces are future-ready and capable of meeting emerging challenges,” Bhatia added. The government expects General Bipin Rawat, who took charge as India’s first chief of defence staff (CDS) on January 1, 2020, to bring about jointness among the three services in a three-year time frame (by January 2023). One of the means to achieve jointness is the setting up of integrated theatre commands. The operational control of all the theatre commands will eventually come under CDS, with the service chiefs being responsible for raising, training and sustaining their forces, as previously reported by HT. Rawat wears three hats — he is the permanent chairman of the chiefs of staff committee (COSC), heads the department of military affairs (DMA), and is the single-point military adviser to the defence minister. CDS will have operational control over all the integrated commands when they are fully functional --- this will be in his role as CDS, and not as permanent chairman, COSC. This will require some restructuring in DMA. The restructuring could involve the chief of integrated defence staff to COSC, or CISC, being appointed as the secretary of DMA in due course to allow CDS to focus on the theatre commands, senior officials earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/theaterisation-plans-being-refined-through-wider-talks-before-seeking-nod-from-ccs-101623936017906.html

It has sparked the interest of many, including experts, who consider it to be an underwater structure as nothing similar to it has been observed in the sea, according to a report by The News Minute.Officials from the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS) are planning to investigate the matter after an organisation, Chellanam Karshika Tourism Development Society, wrote a letter to authorities, the report said. The representative from the organisation said that they observed the formation for the past four years and had not seen it expanding in size, the report also showed.KX Julappan, president of the organisation, in a Facebook post earlier on June 5, 2021, shared a screenshot of the Google Map imagery and highlighted that the structure is located at 7km west of the port gate and also further claimed that it could be about 8km in length and 3.5km in width, based on the image from Google Maps.“There should be studies to find the reasons for this formation, what role this has to play in water currents and coastal erosion and whether this sand dune can be used for artificial shore conservation in Chellanam. The KUFOS technical committee which is working on finding a solution to the coastal erosion of Chellanam should study about this,” The News Minute cited a part of the letter which the organisation wrote to KUFOS officials.Meanwhile, vice chancellor of KUFOS K Riji John, while speaking to The News Minute, said that more could be learned about the formation only after an investigation. “Looking at Google Maps, this looks like any other underwater island that we see across the globe. There have been similar observations, and there is a specific shape also for this. But we don’t know what it is made of — whether it is sand or clay and whether it's distributed regularly. We can only find that out through an investigation. Only after that, we can say anything concrete about this,” News Minute quoted K Riji John as saying. He also said that KUFOS will consult with experts regarding the possibilities of conducting a study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/google-maps-show-new-underwater-structure-in-arabian-sea-near-kerala-s-kochi-experts-to-probe-formation-101623934600266.html

Earlier this week, scientists said that the highly transmissible Delta variant, first identified in India, has further mutated to form the Delta plus, however, added that there was no immediate cause of concern due to low incidence in the country.The latest research shows that the Delta plus variant characterised by B.1.617.2 variant acquiring another mutation, K417N, also found in the B.1.351 or Beta variant of concern. The mutation is in the spike protein of Sars-CoV-2, which helps the virus enter and infect the human cells. The earliest sequence of this genome was found in Europe in late March this year.Experts stressed the need for more studies on the 'Delta plus’ variant before reaching any conclusion on its transmissibility and ability to evade pre-existing immunity, built up either by vaccination or infection with the original Sars-CoV-2 strain."The B.1.617.2 or Delta variant of concern has acquired another mutation - K417N - within the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. This new variant is called Delta or AY.1. This change is of note since this mutation is also found in the B.1.351 or Beta variant of concern," leading virologist Dr Shahid Jameel told news agency ANI."So, in a sense, this is the coming together of changes earlier found in two different variants of concern, which are so far the best adapted to immune escape. Whether this new variant will evade pre-existing immunity better than either Delta or Beta remains to be seen. Therefore, it is a cause for worry but not panic. More studies are needed," he added.Also Read | Delta Plus: All you need to know about new, deadly variant of coronavirusSo far, 202 sequences corresponding to the Delta plus variant have been found in 11 countries, with the highest numbers of cases being reported from the United States. India has reported eight cases of Delta plus variant, with three cases from Tamil Nadu and one each from Odisha, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Maharashtra.But Dr Jameel cautioned about the low incidence, reminding that the B.1.617 variant, the precursor of the Delta variant, was also seen in very low numbers in India in December 2020 and surged within the next eight to 12 weeks."The Indian vaccines have shown three to eightfold reduced efficacy against the Delta and Beta VOCs. Whether this coming together of key mutations would be neutral, additive or more than the sum of both remains to be seen," said Dr Jameel.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expert-weighs-in-on-immune-escape-potential-of-delta-plus-covid-variant-101623932075798.html
17-06-2021||India||Kerala HC grants protection from arrest to Lakshadweep filmmaker||The Kerala high court on Thursday directed filmmaker Aisha Sultana to appear before the Lakshadweep police on Sunday for questioning but ordered she be granted bail immediately in case of her arrest in the sedition case filed against her for alleged remarks against the Union Territory’s administrator Praful Khoda Patel. The order came even as the Lakshadweep administration and the Centre opposed her bail plea saying many foreign journals and others used her words to portray the country in a bad light.“She made a powerful and noxious assertion against the government of India. She has practically sowed seeds of separatism in the minds of people,” said S Manu, who appeared for Lakshadweep. Krishna Raj, appearing for the Centre, said “her remarks have international ramifications.”Also Read | BJP leaders in Lakshadweep resign to protest sedition case against filmmakerSultana moved the court, which has jurisdiction over Lakshadweep, for anticipatory bail last week after she was called for questioning. She was booked for her alleged remarks calling Patel “a bio-weapon launched by the Centre”.The case was filed against Sultana on Lakshadweep Bharatiya Janata Party chief C Abdul Khadar Haji’s complaint. In the complaint, Haji cited a debate on a Malayalam news channel in which Sultana purportedly made the remarks. He said her words were in “bad taste and intended to create hatred and aversion in the minds of people”.In a Facebook post later, Sultana said she regretted the use of the phrase and that she did not intend to hurt the country or its interests.Sultana’s lawyer, P Vijaybhanu, argued his client’s criticism was related to the new regulations introduced in Lakshadweep, which have triggered protests there. He cited the Supreme Court order in journalist Vinod Dua’s case that mere strong words do not amount to sedition.A single-judge bench reserved the final order on Sultana’s bail application until next week.The Supreme Court on May 31 expressed concern over the misuse of India’s sedition law and said it will define the contours of the colonial era penal provision to indicate what does and does not constitute sedition.The slapping of sedition charges against Sultana provoked outrage. The case was filed amid protests in Lakshadweep against the regulations Patel has introduced. The opponents of the norms say they will affect the region’s unique culture and traditions and threaten the livelihoods of islanders. The regulations propose to develop the islands as a major tourist destination and a ban on cow slaughter. The opponents allege the norms will destroy the region’s character and identity since 97% of the islands are covered by pristine forests and 95% of its Muslim population belongs to the protected Scheduled Tribe category.Lawmakers, former bureaucrats and artists have criticised the regulations as “arbitrary” saying they are aimed against the majority community of the islands. The Kerala assembly has passed a unanimous resolution seeking the recall of Patel. As many as 93 retired bureaucrats sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticising the “partisan attitude” of Patel and urged him to protect the unique culture and traditions of the islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-grants-protection-from-arrest-to-lakshadweep-filmmaker-101623932117679.html

17-06-2021||India||Could Twitter, WhatsApp face ban in India? Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad replies||Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday said the government is not in favour of banning any social media platform. If half of the government is on Twitter, including Prime Minister and President, it shows how fair the government is, but social media intermediaries, a status that Twitter has recently lost, have to follow local rules, the minister said to news agency ANI. On WhatsApp, he said all ordinary users can continue to use it. "It is my word," the minister said. The minister's remarks come amid the ongoing face-off between the government and Twitter which escalated as the government withdrew the legal protection — that all social media intermediaries in the country enjoy — from Twitter.On the issue of WhatsApp, which has taken a legal path against the new I-T rules, the minister said the government does not want all WhatsApp messages to be decrypted. "If any content goes viral, causing mob lynching, riots, killing, showing women in nudity, sexual exploitation of children, only in these limited categories, you will be asked to declare who started the mischief," the minister said.Twitter India head quizzed by Delhi Police on May 31 over 'Congress toolkit': ReportIn case if an inciting message originated outside the country, then the government wants to know who started it in India, the minister added."When Capitol Hill in Washington was raided, you block Twitter accounts of all including then President. During farmers' strike, Red Fort is raided by terrorist supporters showing naked swords, injuring policemen and pushing them in a ditch, then it's freedom of expression. If Capitol Hill is US' pride, Red Fort is India's where PM hoists Tricolour. You show parts of Ladakh as China's part. It takes a fortnight for us to pursue you to remove it. This isn't fair. As a democracy, India is equally entitled to safeguard its digital sovereignty," the minister told the news agency, reiterating the flashpoints between the government and the Twitter in the past.Twitter loses intermediary status: What does it mean for Twitter and its users?Why Twitter and WhatsApp are up in arms against the new IT rulesAccording to the new IT rules which became effective from May 26, the social media platforms have to disclose the origin of any message if the authorities consider the message to be harmful. WhatsApp moved the Delhi high court challenging the new IT rules and said that if the platform reveals the origin of chats, then its end-to-end encryption policy will be violated.After being denied legal cover in India, Twitter said it is working with the government. On Thursday, it came to light that cops from Delhi Police's special cell went to Bengaluru on May 31 to question Twitter's India MD Manish Maheshwari over Twitter's "manipulated media" tag. What the government did to Twitter is nowhere close to banning Twitter. If a social media intermediary loses legal protection, it becomes liable for what someone posts on it. Ministers, government departments continue their activities on Twitter, as Ravi Shankar Prasad claimed. However, many ministers have opened accounts on Koo, an India-based platform like Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/could-twitter-whatsapp-face-ban-in-india-minister-ravi-shankar-prasad-replies-101623929459591.html

The government has set the deadline of July 31 for the same. Speaking at a public function, the chief minister said, “Over the last three days, we have done the third edition of the Tika Utsav and more than 50,000 people have taken the vaccine. We are targeting a 100% completion of the first dose by July 31. All those above 18 years of age should walk in for vaccine.”He said the state cannot be opened for tourism yet as “we still need to take precautions.

SII also hopes to introduce Covavax, which is a version of US firm Novavax's Covid-19 vaccine candidate, in the country by September, ANI also said.Novavax Inc, which has a vaccine manufacturing agreement with SII, said on Monday its Covid-19 vaccine candidate was highly effective with 90.4 per cent efficacy overall and also showed high efficacy against predominantly circulating variants. The vaccine demonstrated 93 per cent efficacy against predominantly circulating variants of concern and variants of interest, Novavax said.Novavax said in a statement that the vaccine candidate, 'NVX-CoV2373', demonstrated 100 per cent protection against moderate and severe disease, 90.4 per cent efficacy overall and met the primary endpoint in its PREVENT-19 pivotal Phase 3 trial.The study enrolled 29,960 participants across 119 sites in the US and Mexico to evaluate efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine, it added.On Tuesday, the government said the efficacy data of Novavax vaccine against Covid-19 is promising and encouraging and its clinical trials are in an advanced stage of completion in India. NITI Aayog member (health) VK Paul said the data available in the public domain also indicates the vaccine is safe and highly effective."What we are learning from the available data is that this vaccine is very safe and it is highly effective but what makes this vaccine relevant for today is the fact that this vaccine will be produced in India by Serum Institute," he said during a press conference.Paul said there is preparatory work already accomplished by the Serum Institute of India and that they are also conducting a bridging trial which is in advanced stages of completion."I am also hoping that they will also start trials on children which is of special interest to all of us.

17-06-2021||India||Ramdev booked in Chhattisgarh for comments against Covid-19 medicines||The Chhattisgarh Police have registered a case against Yoga guru Ramdev for allegedly spreading false information about medicines used to treat Covid-19, Raipur police superintendent Ajay Yadav said.Yadav said a First Information Report (FIR) has been lodged in this regard on the complaint of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Hospital Board (Chhattisgarh) chairman Rakesh Gupta, IMA’s Raipur president Vikas Agrawal, and other doctors. He added it was lodged on Wednesday night under Indian Penal Code’s Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and under the Disaster Management Act. “Further investigation and legal procedure in the case will follow,” said Yadav.In his complaint, Gupta has accused Ramdev of allegedly propagating false information about the medicines, misleading people about established and approved treatment methods when doctors and other paramedical workers are fighting Covid.Also Read | Ramdev now says he will take Covid-19 vaccine; ‘good doctors God’s messengers’“The Chhattisgarh Police has taken the right step by registering a case against Ramdev, who is flouting all norms and international guidelines by misleading people of this country. Strict action should be taken against Ramdev for this act,” said Gupta.Police officers aware of the matter cited their probe into the complaint and said Ramdev’s statements also amounted to a violation of a Chhattisgarh government notification issued in March last year. “The notification states that no person/institution/organisation will use any print or electronic media for information regarding Covid-19 without prior permission of the state’s Health Department. This is to avoid the spread of any rumour or unauthenticated information regarding Covid-19,” an officer said, requesting anonymity.Ramdev has been in the news for his comments against allopathic medicines and doctors. He later said he was “withdrawing” the controversial remarks hours after Union health minister Harsh Vardhan asked him to rescind them. In a letter addressed to Ramdev, Vardhan said the people were extremely hurt by the former’s comments against allopathic medicines and doctors. Ramdev has drawn flak for his statement that about 10,000 doctors died despite vaccination. At least 646 doctors have died of Covid-19 during the second wave of infections and 753 during the first wave, according to IMA. IMA has pointed out no vaccines were available during the first wave and most of those who died during the second wave had not been able to take their shots.Several medical associations joined the black ribbon protest on June 1 against the statements of Ramdev.In his response to a legal notice from the Federation of All India Medical Associations over his comments, Ramdev this month said his comments were taken out of context and blown out of proportion. He maintained he was merely questioning the excessive use of experimental therapy. He added several medical experts have also expressed concerns about the overuse of experimental therapies. Ramdev said many of them were later removed from the treatment protocol. Ramdev said he holds no ill will against any discipline of medicine.HT has contacted Ramdev for his response. The story will be updated when he does.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramdev-booked-in-chhattisgarh-for-comments-against-covid-19-medicines-101623926117208.html
17-06-2021||India||Odisha district makes vaccination compulsory for traders||Sundargarh, an Odisha district, which reported about 40,000 cases of Covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic in April and May this year, has announced that owners of businesses and shops of the town who have not been vaccinated may not be allowed to reopen their establishments now.Sundargarh sub-collector Abhimanyu Behera said as per the order issued by Sundargarh district collector and administrator of Sundargarh municipality Nikhil Pawan Kalyan, owners of businesses and shops of the town who have not been vaccinated may not be allowed to open their establishments now.“The first norm of the Covid-19 management protocols is that it is executed for the welfare of the public, so people need to be aware and cooperate with the authorities, be it for enforcement of guidelines or vaccination. The initiative is aimed at motivating people to align with the norms of the government, especially some sections of people who are hesitant about the inoculation drive,” Behera said.Also Read | Odisha’s partial lockdown relaxation to begin from today: Check new guidelines“Shopkeepers who have not received jabs and also not ensured vaccination to their sales executives will not be allowed to open their businesses,” he added.Odisha government on Wednesday announced relaxations in lockdown restrictions in 17 of the 30 districts, including Sundargarh, by allowing traders to open their shops between 6am and 5pm as the positivity rate (ratio of total number of cases for the day to number of samples tested) and Covid-19 caseload had come down in those places.Sundargarh, which in April and May saw a positivity rate of over 40% with an active caseload of 10,000 in May has now reported a positivity rate of 4.5% and 1,682 active cases.Officials said the decision to enforce vaccination was meant to motivate more people to take part in the vaccination drive to defeat Covid-19. Last week, some shopkeepers in Hinjili area of Ganjam district offered a discount of at least 5% to fully vaccinated people upon purchase of groceries. “The district administration suggested we do something for those taking jabs. So we decided to offer a discount,” said Duryodhan Sahu, a trader.The decision on vaccination comes amid vaccine hesitancy prevalent in several districts, including tribal-dominated Rayagada and Nabarangpur. Last week, around 500-odd Kondh tribals of Champakana village in Rayagada’s Kolnara block fled their homes hours before the vaccination team from the Kolnara community health centre arrived there. When the medical team with 100 doses of Covishield arrived at the village in the morning, the villagers fled to the nearby forest after a video claiming that those vaccinated would die within 2-3 years went viral.“There seems to be some vaccine hesitancy among people in the district. We are trying to remove vaccine hesitancy through awareness meetings,” said Rayagada district collector Saroj Mishra.“It’s proving a difficult task to convince the tribals to get the jab before the onset of another wave. But we hope to persuade them,” said Dr Sovarani Mishra, CDMO, Nabarangpur.Gouranga Mohapatra, state convenor of Jana Swasthya Abhiyan, an NGO working on rural health, said folk art can be used to convince people in rural areas. “Vaccine hesitancy has always been an issue in villages even before Covid-19 started. Mediums like folk song can be used to dispel fear of vaccine,” said Mohapatra. Nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination in Odisha Bijay Panigrahi said so far 7.45 million people in the state have been given at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine while around 1.8 million have got both doses of vaccine. There are 30.9 million people in Odisha above the age of 18 years who are eligible for vaccination. “The state government plans to raise the daily vaccination to 300,000 so that the entire state can be vaccinated before the onset of a possible third wave. Everything however depends upon vaccine availability,” said Dr Panigrahi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-district-makes-vaccination-compulsory-for-traders-101623925757266.html

The administration claims to have loaned ₹340 crores to as many as 19,600 youth from across the UT under the first two phases of the programme till now.“Jammu and Kashmir Bank advanced more than ₹340 crores to as many as 19,600 youth from across the UT, against the target of about 8800 youth. These youth were granted financial assistance, making them not only financially independent but also a source of livelihood to other families,” said an official spokesman of the J&K administration.The L-G announced during a high-level meeting of district development committee (DDC) chairpersons, administrative secretaries, and district development commissioners on Wednesday that the idea was to turn unemployed youth into job providers instead of job seekers.“Last year, our target was to pick up two unemployed boys and girls from each panchayat to make them entrepreneurs. The youth of Jammu & Kashmir have immense talent and till date, we have provided this opportunity to more than 19,000 boys and girls. This year our aim should be to reach out to 50,000 youths so that they can become entrepreneurs,” he told the participants.He added that 18,000 posts have been advertised by the Service Selection Board for recruitment in various departments in line with his administration’s promise to provide 25,000 jobs in the public sector.Chairman DDC Srinagar, Aftab Malik said he “hoped” that the promise of empowering 50,000 youngsters through the scheme will be fulfilled.Block development council (BDC) chairman of Narvaw block in Baramulla, Mir Iqbal said that some government programmes started for the youth in rural areas had run into obstacles. “Recently, the government announced to provide D class cards to jobless youths in every block, unfortunately the scheme requires the card holder to have property in his/her name, the project has therefore hit a roadblock.” He claimed that several government schemes were included in the Back to Village program and said it would be better if there was a “separate” scheme for the youth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-s-back-to-village-scheme-to-fund-50-000-youths-this-year-lg-101623925157331.html
17-06-2021||India||Kerala High Court grants protection from arrest to Lakshadweep filmmaker Aisha Sultana in sedition case||The Kerala High Court on Thursday granted interim protection from arrest for a week to Lakshadweep filmmaker Aisha Sultana in the sedition case registered against her over her "bioweapon" remark during a television debate earlier this month.A single-judge bench of Justice Ashok Menon also directed Sultana to cooperate with the investigation and appear before the police in Lakshadweep for interrogation as required under Section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The court also reserved its judgment in the plea by Aisha Sultana seeking anticipatory bail.The Lakshadweep administration has opposed Aisha Sultana's anticipatory bail application. Aisha Sultana’s bail application is not maintainable as the Lakshadweep-based filmmaker has not given any precise reason for any genuine and bonafide "reason to believe" that she will be arrested, the administration said in a statement filed in the Kerala High Court.Aisha Sultana has defended herself and said she did not attack the country or the Union government. "I was referring to some of the decisions of Patel which infuriated local people. Despite popular sentiment, he continues to antagonise people. As a local resident, I have every right to criticise him,” she said in a Facebook post.Aisha Sultana was seeking pre-arrest bail in the first information report (FIR) registered by Kavaratti Police under Section 124A(sedition) and 153B (acts against national integration) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on the basis of a petition lodged by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) Lakshadweep unit president C Abdul Khadar Haji.BJP leader C Abdul Khadar Haji’s police complaint came after Aisha Sultana called the Union territory’s administrator Praful Khoda Patel “a bioweapon deployed by the Centre” against the people of Lakshadweep as she criticised his decisions. She made the comments during a debate telecast by a Malayalam news channel on June 7.The set of orders passed by Praful Khoda Patel have triggered a controversy and a political storm. The Kerala assembly has passed a resolution seeking the recall of the administrator and over a dozen leaders from Lakshadweep quit the BJP last week protesting against the sedition charges slapped Aisha Sultana.Local residents have been protesting against some of the decisions of the administrator for more than a month now, saying they will destroy the islands’ character and identity. These are three draft regulations that propose to develop the island as a major tourist destination, goonda act and a plan to restrict the slaughtering of cattle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-grants-protection-from-arrest-to-lakshadweep-s-aisha-sultana-101623924363435.html

Last year, her father filed a police complaint and he was let off with a warning by the police. Vineesh was also questioned once for alleged use of drugs when in school and the victim’s relatives therefore opposed his acquaintance with her, the police officer said. He is believed to have attacked her since she was spurning his romantic advances.After the incident, the accused boarded an auto-rickshaw but the driver got suspicious after noticing his blood stained dress and took him to the nearest police station instead. Das said Vineesh is in police custody and further investigation in the case is on.The younger sister of the victim is now reported to be out of danger, the police officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-woman-stabbed-to-death-by-stalker-sister-injured-101623923896773.html
17-06-2021||India||Now, PETA urges govt to not use calf serum in Covaxin production||A day after the government clarified that Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin does not contain calf serum, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India on Thursday wrote to the Drugs Controller General of India urging him to replace newborn calf serum with an animal-free chemical solution, reports said. The government on Wednesday explained that Covaxin does not contain calf serum, but calf serum is used at the very first step of the production.In its letter, PETA said the calves required for this purpose are taken away from their mother shortly after birth which traumatises both the mother and the calf. It also said that there are animal-free alternatives already available.What is the controversy all about?Congress's Gaurav Pandhi has recently shared an RTI reply document on social media which says that newborn calf serum is used for the growth of Vero cells.The government said that claiming that vaccine contains calf serum is twisting and misrepresenting the fact as the final product does not contain any aminal part. It explained that to ensure the growth of Vero cells, calf serum is used as the serum has some properties which boost the growth of Vero cells. These Vero cells, after growth, are washed with water many times to make them free from the calf serum, which is only used as a growth agent.Why calf serum is used in vaccine productionCalf serum's biological properties make it crucial for rapid cell growth as newborn calf have fewer antibody properties.On the allegation of animal crueltyIn his tweet, Gaurav Pandhi claimed newborn calves are slaughtered for obtaining serum, which many on social media contested and said there are many ways to get the serum. Importing is also one of them. Bharat Biotech has not specified how they procure calf serum for their vaccine production, but it has clarified that the use of newborn calf serum is not a secret. The company has been in the vaccine-making business for decades and this is the standard process of producing vaccines.If calves are not killed, why PETA is opposingPETA said the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Slaughter House) Rules, 2001, prohibits the slaughter of pregnant animals and animals under three months of age. "Therefore, the use of serum obtained by slaughtering a calf younger than 20 days of age for vaccine production should also not be allowed," it said. But even if they are not killed, they are traumatised for being snatched from their mothers just after their birth, PETA said.It also raised the issue of the risk of contamination in the vaccine, which Bharat Biotech has already addressed and said that Covaxin is pure and there is no trace of calf serum in the finished product.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-peta-urges-govt-to-not-use-calf-serum-in-covaxin-production-101623923373000.html
17-06-2021||India||C’garh to hold public hearings on mining in coal block with 98% forest cover||The Chhattisgarh government will hold public hearings in July in villages around the Kente Extension coal block as part of the process to grant environmental clearance to mining in the forested and biodiversity-rich Hasdeo Arand region, people aware of the matter said. The Centre granted terms of reference (TOR) to the project in January 2020 as one of the first steps for the clearance.Public hearings offer an opportunity to the people to raise objections and make suggestions regarding large infrastructure projects in their areas. They are the third of the four stages in the environmental clearance processes. The other three are screening, scoping, and appraisal. Following the public hearings, the project will be appraised based on its environmental impacts. Later the decision of the Union environment ministry’s Expert Appraisal Committee will be communicated to project developers.Opening the block for mining has been contentious because of the large forest land involved. There has also been a state government proposal to convert a part of the area into an elephant reserve. Hasdeo Arand is one of the largest contiguous stretches of dense forest in central India spanning 170,000 hectares. It has 22 coal blocks. In 2009, the ministry categorised Hasdeo Arand as a “No-Go” zone for mining because of its rich forest cover. But it was later opened again to mining as the policy was not finalised.Also Read | Chhattisgarh to process, sell millets procured from tribalsThe coal block abuts the Atem river, which merges into the Hasdeo river. Several seasonal streams also flow through the region that includes several protected forest blocks.RP Tiwari, member secretary, Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board, said they were only following the directions of the Central government which has asked the state to initiate the process of the public hearing of the mining block. “We are following the TOR of the concerned ministry, and we are bound to do it.”On the state mining department’s letter urging the Central government to exclude the Kente mining block for the proposed Lemru Elephant Reserve, Tiwari said he does not have anything in writing and will not comment.Mohammad Akbar, the Chhattisgarh forest minister, echoed Tiwari. “The directions of public hearing of any coal block comes from central government and we have to follow the instructions.” He said the Environment Conservation Board will conduct the public hearings properly and legally.Last year, Akbar urged Union environment and coal ministers Prakash Javadekar and Pralhad Joshi against auctioning coal blocks in the ecologically sensitive region. Following Akbar’s plea, five blocks from the Hasdeo region were not auctioned. The five are located between Hasdeo Arand and Mand rivers. But some coal blocks in the region were allocated earlier and include Kente Extension.An environment ministry official, who did not wish to be named, said, “The public hearing is part of the environmental clearance process. Its impact on forests will be assessed by the Forest Advisory Committee of the ministry and a view will be taken accordingly.”Alok Shukla, convenor, Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan, said Kente Extension is an integral part of the Hasdeo Arand. “It has 98% dense forest cover. The state government should not have opened up this land. Till a few months back there were talks of declaring this area an elephant sanctuary.”Manju Menon, a senior fellow at New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research, said there has been a contest between the Centre and state government over who gets to control the mining in Hasdeo Arand. “Either way, the profits from mining are mostly captured by one or two actors who will be contracted to do the mining on behalf of leaseholders,” Menon said. Menon added new coal mines should not be opened up during this time of serious economic crisis and complete breakdown of governance. “If it is allowed, these mines will have more negative development consequences than we have seen before. And it will only result in the wastage of precious public resources at great environmental and health costs to the people in Hasdeo. Kente is in the core area of Hasdeo forests. This project will be an environmental hate crime.”The mine is owned by Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited while coal mine developer-cum-operator operations have been awarded to Adani Enterprises through competitive bidding.Adani Enterprises did not respond to HT’s queries sent on June 14.The environmental impact is required to be assessed for a project and is based on the scope and details disclosed by the applicant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cgarh-to-hold-public-hearings-on-mining-in-coal-block-with-98-forest-cover-101623919036096.html

Besides, two TRIFOOD Projects at Jagdalpur and Raigarh (Maharashtra) are being shortly commissioned for undertaking value-addition of various forest products being procured by beneficiaries of Van Dhan Kendras. As a result of the above, an estimated amount of Rs. 3800 Cr. has so far been injected in the tribal economy and has impacted the lives of 50 lakh tribal population, the release stated. TRIFED now plans to expand its operations through the convergence of various schemes of different ministries and launch various tribal development programs in Mission Mode under “Sankalp Se Siddhi – Mission Van Dhan”.

17-06-2021||India||Delhi court passes release order for Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal, Asif Iqbal Tanha||A Delhi court on Thursday finally passed the release orders for Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, and Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha after the three students moved the court seeking forthwith release from jail, two days after the trio was granted bail by the Delhi high court in connection with the northeast Delhi riots case. The students urged in their pleas for immediate release from prison, pointing out that more than 36 hours have passed since they were granted bail by the court.A Delhi high court bench comprising Justices Siddharth Mridul and AJ Bhambhani commenced hearing on the pleas on this day and issued directions for the trial court on the release of the three students -- Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal, and Asif Iqbal Tanha. Additional Sessions Judge Ravindra Bedi said that she has passed the release order at 11 am as scheduled even when the counsels of all the parties said that they were not aware of the order. A detailed reasoned order is awaited.In its bail order two days ago, the Delhi high court had noted that the allegations raised against the students do not prima facie disclose the commission of any offense under sections of the UAPA. Thereby, additional restrictions on the grant of bail do not apply, the court ruled. The Delhi high court also noted that the line between terrorist activity and the constitutionally guaranteed right to protest is getting "somewhat blurred" in the mind of the State, "in its anxiety to suppress dissent".All three students were arrested in May last year under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in connection with the case related to a large conspiracy in the northeast Delhi riots which broke out in February last year.Narwal, who is a student pursuing an MPhil-PhD programme in the Centre of Women's Historical Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, and Devangana Kalita, who is pursuing an MPhil-PhD programme in the Department of Women's Studies at JNU, were taken into police custody on May 29, 2020. Iqbal Tanha, a 25-year-old student, pursuing his final year of BA (Hons) Persian programme at the Jamia Milia Islamia University was arrested in the same UAPA case on May 19 last year which was being probed by the Special Cell of the Delhi Police.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-natasha-narwal-devangana-kalita-asif-iqbal-tanha-move-high-court-seeking-immediate-release-from-jail-101623910805785.html

The court had on June 3 given two weeks time to the CBSE to place on record an evaluation formula for Class 12 students.The board told the apex court that results of Class 12 will be decided on the basis of performance in Class 10, Class 11 as well as Class 12, news agency ANI reported. While 30 per cent weightage will be given to students' performance in Class 10 and 11, their class 12 performance will carry a weightage of 40 per cent.For Class 12, marks obtained in unit, term and practical examinations will be taken into account, it further reported.Attorney General KK Venugopal told the court that there may be a moderation committee to look into the difference in marking mechanism adopted by various schools to put all students as far as the awarding of final marks for Class 12 is concerned on a par, ANI reported.He also said that the results will be declared by July 31.The CBSE also said that for Classes 10 and 11, marks in best of 3 from 5 papers in term exams will be considered.The Supreme Court gave prima facie approval to the assessment scheme, but asked the board to incorporate a dispute resolution mechanism for students aggrieved by it. The court will pass final orders on Monday.The Class 12 exams were cancelled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 1 after a high-level meeting. The examinations had to be cancelled due to the rise in Covid-19 cases across the country.The CBSE had on June 4 framed a high-powered committee for setting up well-defined objective criteria for CBSE Class 12 Result 2021. The 13-member panel, set up by the board for the purpose, was supposed to submit its report within 10 days, but asked for an extension of few days.It was also decided in the meeting chaired by the Prime Minister that in case some students desire to take the exams, such an option would be provided to them by the CBSE as and when the situation becomes conducive.The Class 12 exams were scheduled to be conducted in May-June and were postponed in view of the second wave of the pandemic. The CBSE had already cancelled class 10 board exams and announced an alternative marking policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-presents-evaluation-plan-for-class-12-before-sc-says-results-by-july-31-101623910139416.html
17-06-2021||India||Localised Covid-19 curbs dealt ‘body blow to most of country’s workforce’||Localised restrictions due to the second Covid-19 wave and a lack of government response have dealt a body blow to a majority of the country’s workforce, Stranded Workers Action Network (SWAN), a voluntary group, has said in a report. It said the workers have been left in a lurch with almost no savings.SWAN cited distress calls from over 8,000 people from April 21 to May 31 and said 57% of the callers were left with less than two days of rations. “There was a severe decline in earnings for most workers and a resultant increase in poverty… The proportion of those who are employed… has also dipped,” the report titled “No Country for Workers” said.The report noted the Centre underplayed the worker crisis saying that inter-state travel has not been restricted and also the key industries were open. “…But (the) entire country was practically under lockdown by May 8, 2021, and economic activity had come to a standstill. The only relief measure announced so far is the allocation of 5kg of free grains per individual... Migrant workers have once again been overlooked.”The report said the Centre at least issued guidelines for employers to pay their employees during the lockdown last year. “However, the absence of any mechanisms for enforcement, monitoring or oversight meant that there was hardly any compliance with the order.”SWAN said 66% of the workers its representatives spoke to reported that they did not receive their full wages for the previous month. “Only 8% had received any money from their employer since the work had stopped.”The Centre has said it has set up over 20 migrant helpline numbers across India to address wage, ration and rent-related issues of migrant workers.SWAN said many jobless workers have been left indebted and also face “a hunger crisis”. It cited the Centre’s promise that One Nation, One Ration Card “would enable migrant workers and their family members to access PDS (Public Distribution System) benefits from Fair Price Shops across the country”. SWAN added more than a year since this announcement, it found that 93% of these migrant workers had ration cards but they were not functional in the places where they were stranded.“More than half the workers (who called SWAN) did not have access to ration cards in either their home states or in their current locations. Even if these workers and their families possess a ration card, these are linked to their home addresses. Unless the entire family migrates, the ration card is left at home with family members,” the report said.The report said many migrant workers were reluctant to return home because of a lack of employment opportunities. It added fewer workers have been vaccinated amid the scarcity of vaccines.HT reached out to the chief labour commissioner and the labour secretary for their comments but did not get their responses immediately. The copy will be updated when they respond.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/localised-covid-19-curbs-dealt-body-blow-to-most-of-country-s-workforce-101623910455295.html

Although no details of the interrogation were provided, the development comes as the latest in a series of charges that the central government has raised against Twitter India over compliance with information technology laws in the country.Also Read: Twitter loses legal protection, fails to comply with new IT rules: OfficialTwitter had earlier tagged some posts on an alleged Congress "toolkit" against the central government as "manipulated media", to which the Union ministry of electronics and information technology objected. The Delhi Police had earlier sent a notice to Twitter India, seeking an explanation from the microblogging platform to explain the rationale and share all the information on how it described the toolkit as manipulated media. The cops also visited Twitter India offices in Lado Sarai, Delhi, and Gurgaon on May 24 with the notice.The central government has reasoned that since the case is still pending investigation before a law enforcement agency, Twitter has to remove the "manipulated media" tag.Also Read: Twitter loses intermediary status: What does it mean for Twitter and its users?Meanwhile, Twitter has lost its 'intermediary' status in India, meaning the platform can be directly held accountable under Indian law for posts published on the social media network. Since the central government has taken away its 'intermediary' status, Twitter is no more considered just a platform hosting content from various users but will now be held directly responsible as a publisher for the posts on its platform and will be liable for punishment over "unlawful content" under any law, including IT Act, as also the penal laws of the country. It will no longer be protected from penal action under Section 79 of the IT Act, which absolves social media firms of liability for third-party content.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-india-head-quizzed-by-delhi-police-on-may-31-over-congress-toolkit-report-101623906568546.html

Such movement could be checked if containment zones are declared,” said a senior official. Officials said that during the first wave, initially an entire area, which had more than five active cases, was declared a containment zone. Later, even individual houses were declared as containment zones. While in May 2020, the city had more than 300 containment zones, the number shot up to more than 1,000 in June 2020.

17-06-2021||India||'Green fungus' explained. Causes, symptoms, prevention||"Green fungus" infection was reported in a Covid-19 survivor in Madhya Pradesh's Indore, in what doctors have said is possibly the first such reported case in the country. The 34-year-old, who recovered from Covid-19, was shifted to Mumbai's Hinduja Hospital by air ambulance for treatment, reports said on Tuesday.The man was being treated in Indore's Aurobindo Hospital for the last one-and-a-half-month. "He had 90 per cent lung infection. During diagnosis, green fungus was detected in his lungs which is different from Mucormycosis or Black Fungus. This possibly is the first green fungus case in the country," Apoorva Tiwari, district data manager with the health department in Indore, was quoted as saying by ANI."Green fungus" caseDr Ravi Dosi, head of the department of chest diseases at Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences (SAIMS), told PTI that the man underwent a test on suspicion that he had contracted black fungus or mucormycosis. But he was instead found to have "green fungus" or aspergillosis infection in his sinuses, lungs and blood. "The patient recovered. But then he started having nose bleeds and a high fever. He had also become very weak due to weight loss," Dr Dosi said.Dr Dosi also cautioned that more research was needed on whether the nature of "green fungus" infection in people who have recovered from Covid-19 is different from other patients. All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria has said people must not categorise fungal infections based on their colour and that should use the medical names of the diseases instead.What causes "green fungus"?Aspergillosis is an infection caused by a common mold, Aspergillus, which lives indoors as well as outdoors. People can get aspergillosis by breathing in microscopic Aspergillus spores from the environment. Most of us breathe in Apergillus spores every day without getting sick but those with weakened immune systems or lung diseases are at a higher risk of developing health issues.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), allergic reactions, lung infections and infections in other organs are among the types of health problems caused by Apergillus. However, Aspergillosis is not contagious and can’t spread between people or between people and animals from the lungs.Who can get "green fungus" infection?The US health body says different types of aspergillosis affect different groups of people.Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) most often occurs in people who have cystic fibrosis or asthma. Aspergillomas usually affect people who have other lung diseases like tuberculosis. Also called a “fungus ball.” Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis typically occurs in people who have other lung diseases, including tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or sarcoidosis.Invasive aspergillosis affects people who have weakened immune systems, such as people who have had a stem cell transplant or organ transplant, are getting chemotherapy for cancer, or are taking high doses of corticosteroids. Invasive aspergillosis has been described among hospitalised patients with severe influenza.What are the symptoms of "green fungus"?Different types of aspergillosis can cause different symptoms, says CDC. The symptoms of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) are similar to asthma symptoms, including wheezing, shortness of breath, cough and fever (in rare cases).Among the symptoms of allergic Aspergillus sinusitis are stuffiness, runny nose, headache and reduced ability to smell. Symptoms of an aspergilloma or “fungus ball” include cough, coughing up blood and shortness of breath. Weight loss, cough, coughing up blood, fatigue and shortness of breath are reported in those who get chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.Fever is a common symptom of invasive aspergillosis, which usually occurs in people who are already sick from other medical conditions. It can be difficult to know which symptoms are related to an Apergillus infection. However, the symptoms of invasive aspergillosis in the lungs fever, chest pain, cough, coughing up blood and shortness of breath. CDC says other symptoms can develop if the infection spreads from the lungs to other parts of the body.How can we prevent getting "green fungus" infection?Doctors say rare fungal infections can be prevented by maintaining good hygiene and oral and physical cleanliness. People should try to avoid areas with a lot of dust and stored contaminated water. They should wear an N95 respirator for prevention if they cannot help going to there areas. Avoid activities that involve close contact to soil or dust can also help. People should keep washing their face and hands with soap and water, especially if they have been exposed to soil or dust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-fungus-explained-causes-symptoms-prevention-101623904560013.html

The pharmaceutical company has been facing hurdles in getting Covaxin approved in some foreign countries since it lacks Phase-3 trial data, which is essential for a WHO nod to export the vaccine and make it a part of the much-coveted coronavirus "vaccine passport".Also Read: Not sought indemnity from Centre for any Covaxin adverse events: Bharat BiotechBharat Biotech had earlier told ANI that it will make Covaxin's Phase-3 trial data public during July, following which the company will be applying for full licensure of the Covid-19 vaccine in India. It added that Phase-4 trials are also being done to check the "real-world effectiveness" of the vaccines" and to meet scientifically approved standards for safety and efficacy. Currently, the vaccine has been granted authorisation for emergency use by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), India's foremost drug regulator.The United States' top health regulator -- the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - recently rejected Covaxin's application for emergency use authorisation, citing the lack of data on clinical trials, putting more hurdles on Covaxin's path to gaining foreign approvals at a time when vaccine access continues to be scrutinized in strictly regulated markets. t a time when authorisation from top health regulators at the US, the European Union, or the WHO is needed for a vaccine to cross borders, the India-made Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin remains unrecognised, as some foreign countries are even considering Indian students vaccinated with Covaxin as "unvaccinated".Also Read: Why was Bharat Biotech's Covaxin not approved in US?

The fraud led to a loss of ₹6,097 crore ($952 million) to the state-run bank, the CBI said.A special court on Tuesday took cognisance of the charge sheet and issued a fresh non-bailable warrant against Choksi. In the fresh charge sheet, the CBI said the documents were shifted from time to time from rented places on the instructions of Vipul Chitalia, the then vice-president of Choksi’s Gitanjali Group.“Gokulnath Raghu Shetty, Dy. Manager, PNB, had after issuance of above 165 fraudulent LOUs (letters of undertaking issued by Brady House branch of PNB in favour of Gitanjali group companies) in March /Apri| 2017, and fraudulent amendments made in 58 FLCs (foreign letters of credit) of 2017, returned all the original applications along with other accompanying documents submitted by M/s.Gitanjali Gems Ltd, M/s.Gili lndia Ltd and M/s. Nakshatra Brands Ltd back to them, which should have been in the custody of the bank,” said the charge-sheet.It added later the documents were again shifted on February 5, 2018 to a shop in Bhimrao Wadi, which was also rented at the instance of Chitalia “with the intention to cause the disappearance of evidence.” The CBI recovered the documents during the searches it conducted during the investigation into the case.The CBI said Chitalia maintained records of fraudulent LOUs and FLCs in Google Drive at Choksi’s behest. The drive was recovered when Chitalia was in its custody.The charge sheet said Choksi knew about the impending criminal proceedings and hence fled the country on January 4, 2018, with a “dishonest intent, to evade the process of law”. It added that a month before he fled the country in January 2018, Choksi instructed all the directors of the group’s Hong Kong firms to shift to Thailand.The charge sheet said in February 2018, after the fraud came to light, Choksi got all the dummy directors, partners, and authorised signatories shifted to Bangkok.Choksi acquired citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda after fleeing India in January 2018. He has challenged in court the island nation’s move to revoke his citizenship. He went missing from Antigua on May 23 and was later found in Dominica where he faces charges of illegal entry. His family and lawyers have alleged he was abducted and are trying to prevent his deportation to India to stand trial.India has told a Dominican court that Choksi was still an Indian citizen since his request to renounce his Indian citizenship was not accepted.Choksi’s lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, has said this supplementary charge sheet shows it is only an attempt to cover up anomalies that the defence pointed out in the first charge sheet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksi-managers-hid-fraud-related-papers-in-houses-rented-in-names-of-staff-cbi-101623903734436.html

He will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his stay in the national capital.This is Stalin's first visit to New Delhi after taking oath as Tamil Nadu chief minister last month.Though the chief minister's office has not released any official agenda of Stalin's visit, the discussions are likely to take place on the issues raised by Stalin in his communications to the Prime Minister in the last few weeks.In a letter to PM Modi on Monday, the DMK president sought immediate directions to the ministry of petroleum and natural gas to cancel the bid process for extraction of hydrocarbon in Vadatheru Block of the Cauvery Basin in Pudukkottai district.In the letter, the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister urged the Prime Minister to instruct the Ministry to consult the State government "ab initio" before bringing any area in Tamil Nadu for any auctions in the future for hydrocarbon exploration and extraction.Tamil Nadu health minister Ma Subramanian had said on Sunday that the chief minister will request the Centre for more Covid vaccines for the state. "Death numbers are expected to decrease in coming days. Vaccination is the only solution to get rid of corona infection so people should come forward to get Vaccination," the minister had said.Earlier this month, Stalin tweeted to say that he has written to PM Modi urging him to cancel the conduct of NEET and all other national level entrance exams, keeping in mind the safety of the students during Covid-19.

"She clarified, despite being cautioned by the anchor, that she stands by what she asserted and also stated that she is ready to face any actions for making such a statement," it said, according to news agency ANI. Also read | Lakshadweep cannot be Maldives. Respect its uniqueness"It is most humbly submitted that the baseless assertion by the petitioner (Sulthana) in this regard is sufficient to arouse hatred or contempt among the people of Lakshadweep towards the Government of India," it all said. The administration said Sultana’s statement has a tendency to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resorting to violence and noted that it can be prima facie considered as an attempt to excite disaffection among the people towards the Centre. “It also prima facie amounts to an assertion prejudicial to national integration," it said. The set of orders passed by Praful Khoda Patel, which locals and critics have said will destroy the unique culture and tradition of the 36-island archipelago, have triggered a controversy and a political storm. Over a dozen leaders from Lakshadweep quit the BJP last week protesting against the sedition charges slapped Aisha Sultana. The Kerala assembly has passed a resolution seeking the recall of the administrator.Lakshadweep residents have been protesting against some of the decisions of the administrator for more than a month now. They are up in arms against three draft regulations that propose to develop the island as a major tourist destination, goonda act and a plan to restrict the slaughtering of cattle. They also allege these regulations will destroy the islands’ character and identity since 97% of the islands are covered by forests and 95% of its Muslim population belong to the protected scheduled tribe category.As Praful Khoda Patel arrived in the archipelago on Monday, residents of Lakshadweep observed a black day to protest against his week-long visit. On his part, Patel said that the troubles in the island were incited by a section of people from Kerala, who have vested interests and that the island had failed to develop in the last seven decades unlike the rest of the country.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aisha-sultana-case-lakshadweep-administration-against-anticipatory-bail-101623899481279.html

17-06-2021||India||Nagaland hit by drought-like situation, govt worried||Nagaland is witnessing a drought-like situation due to delayed monsoon affecting nearly 70% of population in rural areas that are dependent on agriculture and allied activities, said the government.State agriculture minister G Kaito Aye said the state was facing a “peculiar” year as farmers could be facing a drought if the situation created by climate change and delayed monsoon persisted. Approximately 915 villages are affected by deficient rains and around 68,662 hectares of jhum fields in the identified villages along with 525 hectares of horticultural crops were affected as per official data.“Terraced rice cultivation (upland) and wet terraced rice cultivation have also been affected due to deficient monsoon rains in all the districts causing delay in land preparation and sowing. If the same trend continues till July, then the farmers may fail to undertake cultivation activities,” agriculture production commissioner Y Kikheto Sema said. The commissioner highlighted that rice production in the state, which was 551,000 metric tonnes for the year 2020-21 is now anticipated to reduce by 70% to 166,000 metric tonnes in the current year, if the present dry spell continues. He said shortage of rainfall had also affected commercial crops like large cardamom, fruits and vegetables and livestock such as fisheries, piggery etc. The situation was further aggravated due to infestation by fall army worm (FAW) in March last, affecting 3048.45 hectares of maize crop covering 334 villages.“Despite intervention by the departments, the FAW infestation could not be completely neutralized,” he added.The administration distributed seeds and planting materials for re-sowing in the affected jhum fields, however, it failed to achieve the desired result due to deficient rain. Chief minister Neiphiu Rio convened a meeting of agriculture and horticulture departments to take stock of the situation on June 15. As per officials, the state would require assistance from the Centre to mitigate the effects of deficient rains in the state.Meanwhile, the government is trying to ensure that crop loss is minimised and is pushing for climate resilient agriculture. They will be distributing seeds such as potato, oilseeds, vegetables for early rabi season from September to compensate the farmers for the anticipated loss. A board headed by the Agriculture Production Commissioner (APC) has been formed to monitor and review the ground situation as per the reports received from the field.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagaland-hit-by-drought-like-situation-govt-worried-101623896833872.html

Tiwari is considered close to Paswan and will replace Prince Raj, one of the five LJP MPs who rebelled against Paswan.Prince Raj was appointed as the LJP chief in Bihar in October 2019 in place of senior party leader and Paswan's uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras.Watch: 'Only death or resignation...', says Chirag Paswan on LJP splitThe crisis began late on Sunday, when the five LJP Lok Sabha members rebelled and chose Paras as their new leader. The lawmakers met Speaker Om Birla on Sunday night and again on Monday, when the Lok Sabha secretariat issued a notification recognising Paras as the parliamentary party chief.On Wednesday, Paswan hit back. In his first remarks since the crisis began, Paswan accused Janata Dal (United) of breaking his party while adding that he is the "son of a lion" and will continue to fight.The 38-year-old leader said that he had looked up to his uncle after the passing away of his father Ram Vilas Paswan. "Today I have become an orphan after my uncle left me, not when my father passed away," Chirag Paswan said.Earlier on Wednesday, Paswan wrote to the Lok Sabha Speaker stating that the decision of announcing Paras as leader of LJP in the Lower House was contrary to the provisions of the party's constitution.He also requested Birla to issue a new circular in his favour as leader of LJP in the House.Paswan targeted Paras for non-cooperation and said he was ready for a legal fight to establish control over the party.Meanwhile, Paras took a dig at his nephew, saying he did not agree to contest last year's Bihar assembly polls as part of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and it was a reason for the party's present problems.Paras also accused Paswan of violating the party’s constitution by holding three posts - that of national president, chairman of parliamentary board and parliamentary party chief.LJP was formed by former Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan in 2000. Paswan, a heavyweight leader in Bihar politics, passed away in October 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljp-feud-latest-updates-chirag-paswan-appoints-new-chief-for-bihar-unit-101623894982681.html

The video shows the car fully submerged in the Gandak river; the water level of the rive has risen suddenly due to unprecedented rainfall in the catchment area of neighbouring Nepal.According to local reports, the villagers had asked the driver not to cross the river at a time when water level was high, but he did not listen to them. As the flow of water carries away the vehicle, the driver cries for help, according to the video. The locals then pull him out with the help of a rope.Though the unprecedented rain has not led to any casualty or displacement of people on a big scale, West Champaran district, situated at the state's north-western tip, was the worst hit. The Collectorate building in Bettiah town and a camp of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) elsewhere in the district were inundated."Many parts of north Bihar and, more importantly, catchment areas of Nepal have received up to 250 mm of rainfall in the last 48 hours. This is unprecedented for this part of the year", Bihar water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said, according to news agency PTI."We fear heavy rainfall in catchment areas of Nepal more than downpour in the state. The reason being heavy rainfall there causes discharge of massive quantity of water from the barrage. We take relief in weather reports that rainfall in Nepal is showing a receding trend", the minister added.He, however, asserted that preparedness had been reviewed by chief minister Nitish Kumar himself and "all our embankments are secure".The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts that most parts of Bihar would receive medium to heavy rainfall over the next 24 hours. It also sounded an alert over the "vulnerability to lightning strikes" at ponds, orchards and water-logged areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suv-gets-stuck-in-gushing-stream-as-bihar-faces-flood-like-situation-101623891080798.html

Verma, her husband and their six-year-old son live in a three-bedroom apartment and after contracting Covid-19 in April, the couple made a tough decision and decided that all three would be isolated in separate rooms.This was not easy for the six-year old who longed for his parent’s love while unable to understand what the coronavirus was or what Covid-related norms meant and what was the need for this isolation, Verma said.He kept on wondering what wrong had he done that he had to stay in a room separate from his parents, she said.In a letter to the prime minister, she narrated her ordeal as a mother who had to stay away from her child, through a poem she had penned.The prime minister wrote back to her and while asking about the wellbeing of her family, said, “I am happy that even in difficult circumstances, you and your family have fought this disease by adopting Covid-compliant behaviour with courage.”He said the ‘shastras’ have also taught us not to lose patience and to maintain courage in times of adversity.Lauding the woman’s poem, the prime minister said it expressed the worry and anxiety of a mother when she is away from her child.Prime Minister Modi expressed confidence that with her courage and positive thinking, Verma will continue to move forward and successfully face any challenge that comes in life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-praises-woman-for-isolating-6-yr-old-child-to-protect-him-from-covid19-101623890564621.html
17-06-2021||India||Kerala HC to hear plea of filmmaker Aisha Sultana facing sedition charge||The Kerala high court will on Thursday hear an anticipatory bail plea filed by filmmaker Aisha Sultana, who has been booked for sedition for her comments against the Praful Khoda Patel, the administrator of union territory of Lakshdweep. Appearing in a television debate, Sultana allegedly called Patel a “bio-weapon” launched by the Centre.The case was registered against her on June 10 based on a complaint by BJP's Lakshadweep unit president C Abdul Khader Haji. She was booked under Sections 121 A (sedition) and 153 (B) (assertions against national integration) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and she was asked to appear before the police on June 20. Sultana is currently settled in Kochi."I made the 'bio-weapon' remark in the context of criticizing the administration relaxing the Covid-19 protocol, which led to a sharp increase of pandemic cases in the island, where there had been not even a single Covid case till January 2021. Lakshadweep is seeing an exponential rise in Covid-19 cases due to the relaxations in the quarantine protocol, and it is in this context that the alleged remarks were made," Sultana has said in her petition.The plea further said that the criticism on political issues does not constitute the offence of sedition under Section 124A Indian Penal Code (IPC)."The applicant had only intended to say that it was due to the apathetic approach and reforms of the new administrator that serious threat is being caused to the lives of the people of the island and had absolutely no intention of exciting disaffection towards the government," according to her plea.Haji, meanwhile, said in complaint that Sultana generated hatred and opposition to the Union government by falsely and with ulterior motives.Many local BJP leaders protested against the slapping of sedition charge against Sultana. Over a dozen of them quit the party in protest.However, the BJP downplayed the resignations, claiming that the party is intact in the island.Over the last few days, there has been an uproar against Lakshadweep administrator Praful Khoda Patel over the new reforms introduced by him, which many allege are against the interest of the islanders.People are protesting against the draft legislations like Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (Goonda Act), Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation and Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, 2021 among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-high-court-to-hear-plea-of-filmmaker-aisha-sultana-facing-sedition-charge-101623888799231.html
17-06-2021||India||DRDO's anti-Covid drug 2-DG effective against all Covid-19 strains, reduces cell death: Study||A new study has claimed that 2-DG, the drug against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), is effective against all variants of Covid-19 and even reduces the multiplicity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The preliminary study also showed that DRDO's anti-Covid drug alleviates cells from infection-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and cell death, according to its abstract reviewed by news agency ANI.Also Read: Govt rolls out DRDO-formed Covid drug, experts call for more researchDRDO's Covid-19 drug, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), was released amid much tucket by Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Dr. Harsh Vardhan on May 17. While releasing the first batch of DRDO's anti-Covid drug, the central government claimed that the drug has the potential to reduce a patient's average recovery time by two and a half days and oxygen demand by up to 40%. It was provided authorisation for emergency use by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on June 1 as an adjunct therapy for moderate to severe coronavirus patients.The new study assessing the viability of DRDO's anti-Covid drug was conducted by Abhishek Kumar, Dhiviya Vedagiri, Annat Narayan Bhatt, Yogesh Rai, and others. It has not been peer-reviewed yet, ANI noted.Also Read: DRDO issues directions for use of 2-DG, its drug for Covid-19 patientsDRDO's anti-Covid drug 2-DG was used in the study to aim and inhibit the "metabolic reprogramming" induced by Covid-19 infection in patients suffering from the disease. The results showed that the Covid-19 infection causes a high influx of glucose in the body and glycolysis in the cells, resulting in selective high accumulation of the fluorescent glucose/2-DG analogue and 2-NBDG. The anti-Covid drug from DRDO, 2-DG, subsequently reduces the virus multiplication and alleviates the cells from infection-induced cytopathic effect and cell death, the study found.Government officials have said that DRDO's anti-Covid drug will be priced at ₹900 per sachet in the market, sold by the Hyderabad-based Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (DRL), although it will provide the drug at discounted prices to the central and state governments.Medical practitioners, however, suggest exercising some caution regarding the use of DRDO's anti-Covid drug 2-DG. The effect of the anti-viral drug on patients with comorbidities such as uncontrolled diabetes, severe cardiac problems, and even renal impairment, ARDS, etc. has not been studied yet. Moreover, the DRDO advises that the 2-DG be prescribed as early into the treatment cycle of moderate to severe Covid-19 patients as possible, for a maximum duration of up to 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdos-anti-covid-drug-2-dg-effective-against-all-covid-19-strains-reduces-cell-death-study-101623886946415.html

17-06-2021||India||Pregnant schoolteacher who aspired to be self-dependent||On April 13, two days before she was to appear for duty in the Uttar Pradesh panchayat elections, Kalyani Agrahari had a fierce altercation with her husband Deepak Chand. Agrahari, 26, was in the third trimester of her pregnancy and Chand wanted her to skip election duty. At the time, Covid was ravaging the countryside and deaths were surging across the state.But Agrahari was worried that her government teaching position would be jeopardised if she didn’t show up for duty. She was one of 69,000 assistant teachers who were recruited four months ago. “It was her dream to be a teacher and she was afraid that skipping the election duty may affect her job. I was more concerned about her health considering her pregnancy and wanted her to skip the poll duty,” recalled Chand.When Agrahari got the order to report as election officer at Pratappur polling station, the couple wrote to officials concerned, pleading exemption from duty on grounds of her pregnancy, but in vain. To save her job and fearing backlash from seniors, Agrahari sat behind her husband on his bike as he drove her to the polling station at Karanjakalan block, 35 kilometres away from their house in Patiala village in Kuthan block.During the hour-long journey, they talked about their struggle and hopes of a better future.Agrahari was the first born of four children in a farming family in Azamgarh district. Her father worked in the fields while her mother tended to household chores. Watching her parents struggle to make ends meet, Agrahari decided to get a job and dedicated herself to studies.But after completing her college education, she quickly realised that jobs were hard to come by in the town. In 2018, when she told her parents that she wanted to pursue studies to become a teacher, the family wed her to Chand, an engineering graduate. Agrahari was only 23.“My sister was not happy to get married so early. She wanted to become self depended and continued her efforts even after the marriage,” said Rani, her younger sister.The couple moved to Delhi where Deepak worked in a private firm. After a few months, Agrahari persuaded Chand to send her to Prayagraj to continue her studies to become a teacher (D.El.Ed). “She lived alone studied hard and cleared the teachers exam in the first attempt,” said Chand.When he was sent on extended leave during the lockdown last year, she asked him to return home in Jaunpur and start a business.In September, Agrahari found she was pregnant. “We were so happy to get the news, her face beamed and I have never seen her smile as widely,” Chand said.On their way to the polling station, the couple discussed possible names for their child — Divansh, if it was a boy; Khyati, if a girl. Agrahari was determined to ensure that her child get a better education than her and smiled as she thought of the future. Chand dropped her outside the polling station and left.That was the last time he saw her smiling. By the time she returned home on April 15, she was very ill. “She fell ill just after returning from her poll duty. I took her to see nearby doctors, took some medication but her health continued to deteriorate,” said Chand.In a few days, the colour had drained from her face. Relatives tried to admit her in a hospital in Jaunpur, 50 kilometres away from Varanasi . “We took her to every hospital in Jaunpur district hoping to get a bed for her but none of the hospitals had a vacant bed to admit her,” said Chand.On April 24, they finally managed to secure a bed with oxygen support at L2 Covid Hospital, Jaunpur. But by then, Agrahari and her unborn child were both dead. A day later, on their third marriage anniversary, Chand lit Agrahari’s pyre.The family remembers Agrahari as a determined woman who sacrificed her joys to study and advance in life. They rue that her life ended before she could enjoy the perks of job – she didn’t even get to see her first salary because of payout delays by the education department.The state teachers’ union says Agrahari was one of 700-odd teachers who succumbed to Covid-19 after conducting the panchayat polls, a figure disputed by the state government. Nevertheless, the administration has assured Chand of compensation and a job. On May 24, a local education officer went to Chand’s home and told him that Agrahari’s pending salary of ₹196,527 had been deposited in her account. She was dead for two weeks||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pregnant-schoolteacher-who-aspired-to-be-selfdependent-101623876440225.html
17-06-2021||India||Covaxin does not contain newborn calf serum: Centre||Bharat Biotech’s vaccine against Covid-19, Covaxin, does not contain newborn calf serum, the Union health ministry clarified in a statement on Wednesday, responding to some posts on social media, moving quickly to address an issue that could have potentially led to vaccine hesitancy among some.“There have been some social media posts regarding composition of the Covaxin vaccine where it has been suggested that Covaxin vaccine contains newborn calf serum. Facts have been twisted and misrepresented in these posts… the final vaccine does not contain newborn calf serum at all and the calf serum is not an ingredient of the final vaccine product,” read the health ministry statement.According to the ministry, newborn calf serum is used only for preparation and growth of vero cells (lineage of cells used for pathogen culture). Different kinds of bovine and other animal serum are standard enrichment ingredients used globally for vero cell growth. Vero cells are used to establish cell lines which help in production of vaccines..., the ministry explained. Dr Gagandeep Kang, physician-scientist, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, said “the explanation holds”. Bharat Biotech also put out a separate statement explaining the process:“New born calf serum is used in the manufacturing of viral vaccines. It is used for the growth of cells, but neither used in growth of SARS CoV2 virus nor in the final formulation...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-does-not-contain-newborn-calf-serum-centre-101623881960966.html
17-06-2021||India||BJP leader’s fear of data theft exposed fake testing racket||Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Faridkot unit leader’s fear of personal data theft after receiving a Covid-19 negative report without giving a swab sample took the lid off a racket involving fake Covid reports generated during the Kumbh Mela in Uttarakhand.Vipin Mittal, a former vice president of Faridkot (Punjab) unit of BJP, had contested the Faridkot municipal council election unsuccessfully this year. On April 22, he had received a text message on his mobile phone with a link to his Covid-19 test report, stating that he had tested negative. “I was surprised to see the Covid report because I never gave my swab sample for testing. I was worried that someone might have stolen my personal data and misused it,” Mittal said.He said he informed the district health department regarding this, but no one inquired about it. However, Faridkot civil surgeon Dr Sanjay Kapoor said that he didn’t receive any written complaint in this regard.“I downloaded a copy of that report from the portal and complained to the Indian Council of Medical Research... I got a reply from them that they would investigate it, but I didn’t hear from them further. So, I filed an RTI..,” Mittal said. In the reply to his RTI, Mittal received a copy of the Uttarakhand health department’s probe and an action-taken report that said he had received a “fake” report. “I am shocked to see this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leader-s-fear-of-data-theft-exposed-fake-testing-racket-101623879649331.html
17-06-2021||India||Twitter may have lost protection, but not tag||There appears to be a degree of misperception that the government has, on political whim, removed the tag of “intermediary” for Twitter — or more accurately, taken away the protections enjoyed by Twitter under Section 79 of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 (as amended) for non-compliance with the Intermediary Guidelines of 2021. This has sparked concerns of “executive overreach”.The basis of these concerns is incorrect. First, intermediaries are those covered under S.2(1)(w) of the IT Act. Twitter was and continues to be covered under this definition. While intermediary has a broad definition, some under this category enjoy comprehensive protection from any form of liability under S.79 of the IT Act. This protection ensures that they will not be held liable for third-party information, data, or communication link shared on their platforms, which they have no personal knowledge of or control over. This protection is what Twitter has lost due to non-compliance with the 2021 guidelines. Not its tag as an intermediary.A Parliament-enacted law i.e., the IT Act mandates that the protection from liability given to intermediaries applies, provided they comply with conditions laid down therein. When an intermediary fails to comply, it automatically loses the protection or “safe harbour”.Herein lies the basis for Twitter losing its protective shield: When the 2021 guidelines were notified, Twitter was aware it had to comply with them. It was open to Twitter to raise its contentions before a court of law, if it believed any of the provisions to violate its rights or entitlements. This was not done. Hence as of May 25, Twitter lost its protective shield (not its tag as an intermediary), when it failed to comply with the 2021 guidelines.Not just Twitter, any social media platform which does not comply would stand on the same footing. This occurred with no further action from the government or executive branch. Any statements by the government are at best rhetorical that reiterates the automatic outcomes that law dictates. No more. No less.A standoff between the Union government and Twitter is not new. Nor is it only under the new 2021 guidelines. Every non-compliance of a takedown notice resulted in the loss of protection to Twitter under S.79 of the IT Act. It then had to face investigations or inquiries to prove its non-complicity. The difference is that when Twitter refused takedowns, it lost the immunity with respect to the specific post. Due to its wilful failure to comply with the 2021 guidelines, it has lost the protection under S.79 of the IT Act in its entirety, and opened itself out for probable prosecution for all posts on its platform.Therefore, losing safe harbour status was not due to an act of executive whim, but under parliamentary law and rules drafted within this framework.Externalising the problem and holding a government liable for the company’s inaction, for no less than three months, is untenable. The company ought to have complied with the extant laws or contested the same in court. It cannot take advantage of its own wrongs.That, however, does not mean that it could be culpable for each post. Each case will have to be evaluated on the basis of the facts of the case, including with respect to whether the company and/or persons in charge thereof are liable. Again, given the scale of posts and data on its platform, the real concern for Twitter or any other social media platform in this situation would be the unenviable task of having to meet the due process for litigation that may arise.This was a risk that all were aware of well before the deadline. Given the risks involved, it was incumbent on all social media platforms to either comply or contest within timeframes given. Blatant refusal to comply with rule of law is not tenable.NS Nappinai is an Advocate, Supreme Court of India & Founder – Cyber Saathi.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-may-have-lost-protection-but-not-tag-101623873825053.html
17-06-2021||India||Karnataka must vaccinate at least 2.5 lakh per day to blunt third wave impact||Bengaluru: Between April 1 and May 27 this year, Karnataka recorded 14,167 Covid-19 deaths, becoming one of the worst-hit states during the second wave of the pandemic. In comparison, the state recorded 6,551 deaths during the two months of the first wave last year. According to state health department’s data, nearly nine out of 100 patients died outside a hospital during the deadlier second wave, with experts and analysts saying the healthcare system was not prepared for the spike.With experts predicting a possible third wave of the coronavirus in October and November, the most important question is: how deadly could this wave be? According to experts, it depends on how people are vaccinated in the coming four months.“There is no doubt that if we don’t vaccinate enough population, the third wave will be as bad, or even worse, than the second,” said CN Manjunath, Karnataka Covid-19 Task Force member and director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research. “Only if are able to build enough herd immunity can we blunt the impact of the third wave. But it is going to be a challenge,” he said.On the minimum target for vaccination to avoid a severe third wave, experts said anywhere between 60 and 75% of the population should get at least the first dose of the vaccine before the third wave hits. To break down the numbers, the population of Karnataka, according to the government projections, is approximately 65 million. According to the Karnataka election commission, around 51 million people in the state are eligible voters, which is roughly the estimated number of those eligible for the vaccination.According to Dr Vishal Rao, a member of the expert committee on Karnataka’s Covid task force, the state should vaccinate at least 60% of the population to control the third wave. “Quick vaccination is crucial. So far, we have been vaccinating those above 45 years of age. But in the state, the majority of the population falls in the 18-44 age category. With multiple variants that are being reported, this age group is one of the most vulnerable sections,” said Dr Rao.The second wave has shown an increase in the number of deaths in the 30-45 age group. A comparison of the numbers of the first and second wave shows that in the first wave, around 11 out of 100 deaths were reported in the 30-45 age group, while in the second wave, 16 out of 100 deaths were reported in this category. For the under-30 age category, in the first wave, 2.2% of deaths belonged to those under 30, while in the second wave, it increased to 2.9%, according to state data.Dr Manjunath said the state should vaccinate at least 70% population in the next four months. Dr Ravi V, virologist and a member of the Karnataka Technical Advisory Committee, also said 70-75% population should get at least the first dose of vaccination before the onset of the third wave.If going by an average of the experts’ opinion, at least 45 million people in the state should get the first dose of vaccination before November. So far, approximately 17 million people have got at least the first dose in the state. Thus, to meet the requirement of the experts, the state government will have to vaccinate at least 250,000 people every day.According to a senior health department official, the state is administering around 150,000 jabs per day on an average. He added that the vaccination depends on the availability of the vaccine doses, which currently is in short supply.Dr Manjunath said the state has a good infrastructure in place to quickly vaccinate the population if vaccines are available. “With more vaccines coming to the market, we hope that the availability will increase by August. The government should be prepared to distribute it effectively when they are available in large numbers. Restrictions on vaccine distribution should be removed and it should be made even without the Cowin app. One good that came out of the second wave is that the reluctance against the vaccine has reduced, which will be helpful,” he added.On whether vaccinating around 70% of the population could in reality make the third wave less deadly, Dr Ravi cited example of England, saying the country was not affected badly by the third wave because it was able to vaccinate more than 60% of its population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-scaling-up-vaccination-key-to-curbing-third-wave-impact-101623871331678.html
17-06-2021||India||Dhankhar meets NHRC chairman, Union ministers in Delhi; TMC, CPM cry foul||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar met Arun Kumar Mishra, chairman of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) during his trip to Delhi on Wednesday, triggering a political row in Kolkata where the Trinamool Congress (TMC) demanded his immediate removal and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M), alleged that Dhankhar is acting like a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member. “Governor West Bengal Jagdeep Dhankhar had a courtesy meeting in New Delhi with former Supreme Court Judge, Justice Arun Kumar Mishra, Chairperson National Human Rights Commission @India_NHRC,” Dhankhar tweeted at 6 pm after meeting Mishra. This immediately triggered a controversy in Bengal as Dhankhar, before his departure for Delhi, wrote a letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday, alleging that the state is witnessing post-poll violence and violation of human rights and never witnessed since Independence. He accused the government of inaction. “Never before has a governor met an NHRC chairman. He is partisan, uncivilized and should be removed immediately. Dhankhar is acting beyond his Constitutional limits,” said TMC Rajya Sabha member Sukhendu Sekhar Roy. TMC supporters started a hashtag campaign, #DhankharAbBandhkar (Dhankhar stop it now). The posts turned viral. Veteran CPI(M) leader and Bengal Left Front chairman Biman Bose said, “We saw Dhankhar visiting violence affected areas with BJP leaders. As governor he is free to go anywhere but why is he accompanied by BJP leaders all the time? His actions are akin to that of a BJP member. He is not following the Constitution of India.” This was the first time that the Left has spoken out so sharply against Dhankhar. Going a step forward, the national executive committee of the Communist Party of India (CPI) has accused Dhankhar of attempting to create unrest in Bengal. The CPI said that the President must recall Dhankar immediately. “After taking over as the governor he started behaving like a BJP representative, ignoring all moral and government protocols supposed to be followed by a constitutional authority. His role before the election, during the election and after the election remains the same. He is disrespecting the poll verdict and is aiming at creating instability and unrest in West Bengal. Such behaviour from a constitutional head of a state is unacceptable,” the committee said in a statement. Defending the governor, Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samiik Bhattacharya said, “We have lost 28 supporters in post-poll violence. The governor has repeatedly sought action. If his actions are being described as unprecedented then the violence, too, is unprecedented.” After writing to the chief minister on Tuesday, Dhankhar attached a copy of the letter to his tweet that said, “Constrained to convey @MamataOfficial that continued silence & inaction over post-poll violence, violation of human rights & dignity of women, destruction of property, and perpetuation of miseries on political opponents- worst since independence, ill augurs for democracy.” “Urged @MamataOfficial to break silence on post-poll retributive violence, restore law and order, provide succour to the suffering people. Called upon her to have an interaction on these issues at the earliest,” he wrote in a second tweet. The state government reacted sharply to his tweets. “Government of West Bengal has observed with dismay and distress that the Hon’ble Governor of West Bengal has suddenly made public, a letter of his to the Hon’ble Chief Minister of West Bengal, with contents that are not consistent with real facts. The communication format is violative of all established norms. The letter has been written to Hon’ble Chief Minister and released to public media through tweets simultaneously, which disrupts sanctity of such communications,” tweeted the state home department. “The unusual step of going public in this manner abruptly and unilaterally has shocked the Government of West Bengal all the more because the contents are fabricated. While the post-poll violence in the state was somewhat unabated when the Election Commission of India was in charge of the law and order machinery, after the swearing in, the State Cabinet has reigned in the situation, restored normalcy and established full command over anti-law elements. State police has been firmly directed to bring to book all anti-socials and the government remains committed to maintain the basic fabric of society and to uphold law and order,” the home department said in subsequent tweets. On Wednesday, Dhankhar also met Union minister for culture and tourism Prahlad Singh Patel and minister of coal, mines and parliamentary affairs Prahlad Joshi. Both the ministers campaigned in Bengal during the recent polls in which the BJP lost to the TMC. “Had useful deliberations with Union Minister for Culture, Tourism @prahladspatel Prahlad Singh Patel @MinOfCultureGoI on issues pertaining Victoria Memorial @victoriamemkol, Indian Museum @IndianMuseumKol;@ezcckolkata @asiatic_society aimed at enhancing impact of these bodies,” tweeted Dhankhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dhankhar-meets-nhrc-chairman-union-ministers-in-delhi-tmc-cpm-cry-foul-101623870792266.html

The video purportedly showed the elderly man, later identified as Sufi Abdul Samad, being beaten up and his attackers cutting off his beard.Samad’s family and friends later claimed that he was forced to chant “Vande Mataram” and “Jai Shri Ram” by his attackers. Police, however, ruled out any communal angle to the incident and said the group of six men who attacked Samad included both Hindus and Muslims who were unhappy about some amulets (taveez) he had allegedly sold them, and which they believed didn’t work.“On June 15, Ghaziabad police had clarified that the incident took place due to a personal dispute. Both parties involved were Hindu and Muslim. Despite this, social media influencers didn’t delete their tweets, which led to communal disharmony in the state,” said UP’s additional director general of police (law and order), Prashant Kumar.The UP Police FIR says the men who attacked Samad were known to him and three of them have been arrested for voluntarily causing hurt and wrongful confinement. It added the muted video was allegedly circulated with the objective of disrupting communal harmony and causing a riot. HT has seen a copy of the FIR, which also names journalists Rana Ayyub and Saba Naqvi; co-founder of fact-checking website AltNews, Mohammed Zubair; and Congress leaders Salman Nizami, Maskoor Usmani and Dr Shama Mohammad.But confusion continued about the June 5 attack. Samad mentioned the alleged religious slogans in a Facebook Live session he did on June 7 with a local Samajwadi Party leader, identified as Ummed Pehalwan Idrisi.On Wednesday, Idrisi conducted another Facebook Live session with Samad and the family and alleged that police deliberately left out the alleged communal slogan chanting from the FIR.“The complaint was concealed by the police, and they filed it on their own. I demand that CCTV of the police station should be checked,” Idrisi said. The victim’ s son, Babbu (who only goes by one name) said on Tuesday night that the police was attempting to divert the case.Loni police refused to comment on the allegations, saying that they were unsubstantiated.Police also filed a separate FIR against Idrisi for allegedly promoting religious enmity between different groups, outraging religious feelings and breaching of peace.“The FIR is filed against Pehalwan as he was the one who took up Facebook live session along with the victim and concealed facts that the suspects were known to the victim and also issued statements which amounted to spreading hatred among communities,” said Atul Kumar Sonkar, circle officer of Loni.The Wire released a statement in which it condemned the criminal case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghaziabad-assault-fir-names-twitter-but-police-victim-s-family-differ-over-incident-101623869892922.html
17-06-2021||India||Charged with defection, turncoat Trinamool lawmaker speaks out against BJP||Trinamool Congress (TMC) Lok Sabha MP, Sunil Mondal, against whom Bengal’s ruling party has brought charges of defection for joining the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has accused the saffron camp of ignoring newcomers like him.The Burdwan East MP also accused Suvendu Adhikari, leader of the opposition in the West Bengal legislative assembly, of not keeping a single promise made to him.“Adhikari did not keep a single promise he made. He does not even receive my calls. The BJP does not let newcomers work,” said Mondal. Amid speculations that he might try to return to the TMC like Mukul Roy, TMC supporters put up posters in the Burdwan East constituency, saying he should not be allowed to make a comeback.Mondal spoke out a day after Sudip Bandopadhyay, leader of the TMC in the Lok Sabha, called up Speaker Om Birla and urged him to take action on the petitions he had earlier filed seeking disqualification of Mondal and Sishir Adhikari who joined the BJP prior to the recent Bengal assembly polls. The Speaker told Bandopadhyay that a committee would be set up to review the petitions.Bandopadhyay had called up the Speaker on the same issue on June 3. The second call was made on a day when 50 BJP legislators in Bengal met Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and demanded that any MLA who joins the TMC should face action under the anti-defection law passed by the Parliament. The team was led by Suvendu Adhikari who is Sishir Adhikari’s son.Mondal joined the BJP in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah in December last year.Sishir Adhikari did not formally pick up the BJP flag but shared the dais with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the election campaign. He is the MP from Contai in East Midnapore district. His second son, Dibyendu, is the Lok Sabha member from the district’s Tamluk seat.Reacting to Mondal’s statement, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said, “Many people joined the BJP thinking that the party will come to power. Now they are making excuses. The BJP welcomed all of them and showed them respect.”The TMC has 22 Lok Sabha MPs since the BJP won 18 seats in 2019. Bengal has 42 seats. Till 2019, the TMC had 34 MPs in the Lower House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/charged-with-defection-bengal-s-turncoat-trinamool-lawmaker-speaks-out-against-bjp-101623869532156.html

The encounter took place at Theegalametta forest area of Koyyru block under Mampa police station limits at around 10 am, when the Greyhound police forces, specially trained for the anti-Maoist operations, were conducting combing operations following a tip-off about Maoist movement. Visakhapatnam (Rural) Superintendent of Police B V Krishna Rao said six Maoists, including three women, were killed in the exchange of fire. Five of the slain Maoists were identified as: Ranadev alias Arjun and Sande Gangiah alias Ashok, both divisional committee members (DCM), Santu Nachika, an area committee member (ACM), Lalitha and Paike, both primary members. “The body of the remaining female Maoist is yet to identified,” the SP said, adding the police had seized an AK-47 rifle, a self-loading rifle (SLR), a carbine, three .303 rifles and a country-made weapon along with extremist literature, kit bags and explosive material from the site. He said a few more Maoists were believed to have sustained injuries in the incident and escaped from the area. “We appeal to the escaped Maoists to surrender and assure them of best possible treatment,” Rao said. Unconfirmed reports said some top Maoist leaders, who were present at the spot, managed to escape during the exchange of fire. The police forces are trying to track their movements using helicopters, the reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/six-maoists-shot-dead-in-andhra-encounter-101623869411492.html
17-06-2021||India||BJP team rushes to Tripura to quell rumblings||Trouble is brewing afresh for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Tripura as a section of party leaders, who had jumped ship from the Trinamool Congress (TMC), are learnt to have started negotiations for a possible return, said a party functionary on the condition of anonymity.The functionary added that friction between chief minister Biplab Deb and dissenting MLAs led by Sudip Roy Barman has exacerbated ever since Mukul Roy, former national vice-president of the BJP, snapped ties with the party to return to the TMC.“It was Roy who was instrumental in making Roy Burman and six others switch sides from the TMC to the BJP in 2017. Now to prove his allegiance to the TMC, he may try to destabilise the BJP government in Tripura. There is a buzz that he has initiated talks with the dissenters,” said the party functionary.Barman, who was a Congressman before joining the TMC in 2016, has made his chief ministerial ambitions public. He has been urging the BJP central leadership to change the CM, citing administrative problems.Anticipating defection to the TMC, the BJP central leadership has taken note of developments. A team of senior leaders, including party general secretary organisation BL Santhosh and Northeast zonal secretary Ajay Jamwal, are in Tripura, where the BJP came to power in 2018 after defeating the Manik Sarkar-led Communist Party of India (Marxist) government. Sarkar was the CM of the state for 20 years.An official from the state government said the team from Delhi is on a visit for “organisational purposes”. “There is no threat to the government from either the rebels or the TMC,” the official said.However, this is not the first time that the central leadership has had to intervene. Friction between the chief minister and rebels made headlines in October last year as well, when Burman, who was dropped from the state cabinet, flanked by leaders including Sushant Chaudhary, Atul Dev Burman, Diba Chandra, Parimal Dev Burman and Ashish Saha among others, flew to Delhi to apprise party president JP Nadda and Santhosh of the problems within the state unit.“These leaders have been complaining that the chief minister leaves them out of decision making, acts in an arbitrary manner and has failed to deliver development works that were promised by the BJP,” the functionary quoted above said.In December, the rebels again raised the demand for replacing the chief minister. They pointed out that the CM’s working style could have an adverse impact on the party’s performance in the 2023 assembly elections.In December when Vinod Sonkar reached Tripura on his maiden visit as the party’s state in-charge, he was greeted with slogans against the chief minister. At that time, the CM had blamed the Left cadre for engineering the protest and went on to declare that he would seek people’s mandate on continuing in his position. “He (CM) had declared that he would go to the Vivekananda Maidan and seek people’s support. That statement had not gone down well with the central leadership. However, a decision was taken not to change the leadership mid-term,” the functionary said.While on earlier occasions, the central leadership was confident of getting a hold of the situation, the involvement of Roy has sounded alarm.“Since the party unit is already in disarray, it will not be very difficult for the opposition to weaken the party structure. But we are hopeful of a resolution,” said a party leader in Delhi, who did not wish to be named.The BJP, which had bagged 43% votes in the 2018 state elections, has 36 MLAs while its ally Indigenous Peoples’ Front of Tripura (IPFT) has eight MLAs in the 60-member assembly. Burman’s claims of having the support of 18-20 legislators could put the party in a bind. The CPI(M), which ruled the state for over two decades, has 16 members. The TMC and the Congress drew a blank in the 2018 assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-team-rushes-to-tripura-to-quell-rumblings-101623869412043.html
17-06-2021||India||Cabinet gives approval to Ordnance Factory Board corporatisation||NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday cleared the corporatisation of India’s main producer of weapons and military equipment, the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), to boost its efficiency and competitiveness in a long-awaited reform in the country’s defence manufacturing sector, top officials familiar with the developments said.The OFB, which controls 41 ordnance factories, will be split into seven government-owned entities that will produce ammunition and explosives, vehicles, weapons and equipment, troop comfort items, opto-electronics gear, parachutes and ancillary products, said one of the officials cited above, speaking on the condition of anonymity.Ordnance factories are currently engaged in the production of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, mine-protected vehicles, bombs, rockets, artillery guns, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes, small arms, clothing and leather equipment for soldiers.“The restructuring will transform the ordnance factories into productive and profitable assets, deepen product specialisation, boost performance and improve quality, cost efficiency and accountability,” said a second official. He said it was a big step towards achieving self-reliance in defence manufacturing.The government expects the seven new professionally-managed entities, likely to come up by the year-end, to increase their share in the domestic market through better capacity utilisation and also tap new export opportunities.“The new structure will help overcome various shortcomings in the existing OFB set-up by eliminating inefficient supply chains and provide these companies incentive to become competitive. It will boost their autonomy too,” said the first official.During the last two decades, various high-level committees have underlined the need to improve the functioning of the OFB and turn its factories into vehicles of self-reliance for the country’s defence preparedness.Defence minister Rajnath Singh described the decision to corporatise the OFB as a “historic one.”“It is also a big decision from the point of view of national security,” Singh said.The factories controlled by the board employ at least 70,000 people who have been against the move to corporatise it. Three federations of defence civilian employees of the OFB gave a joint strike notice last August against the government’s plans to corporatise the board.The workers’ federations called off their proposed countrywide strike last year after a reconciliation meeting.Singh said there would be no change in the service conditions of the OFB employees and the government was committed to safeguarding their interests.All OFB employees (Group A, B and C) from different production units will be transferred to the corporate entities on deemed deputation for an initial period of two years without changing their service conditions as government employees, Hindustan Times has learnt.“The pension liabilities of the retirees and existing employees will continue to be borne by the government,” said the second official cited above.An empowered group of ministers (EGoM), constituted last year under the defence minister, will oversee the board’s corporatisation and also take decisions on other related matters, the official added.An internal army assessment last year flagged concerns about faulty ammunition and armament supplied by the OFB causing army casualties and bleeding the exchequer. It said 403 accidents over the previous six years resulted in the deaths of 27 soldiers and a loss of ₹960 crore.“Lack of accountability and poor quality of production result in frequent accidents. This results in injuries and death of soldiers. On an average, one accident takes place per week,” the internal assessment said.The OFB reacted to the army’s assessment as factually incorrect.In 2017, the government took action against 13 defence ministry bureaucrats from the Indian Ordnance Factories Service for the repeated failures of ordnance factories to meet the shortfall in ammunition and poor quality of products.The Comptroller and Auditor General has also raised questions about the quality of products supplied by the OFB and its overall performance in its reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-gives-approval-to-ordnance-factory-board-corporatisation-101623869352100.html
17-06-2021||India||Training medics to improving infra: TN gears up for third wave||Chennai: As the second wave recedes, Tamil Nadu has begun preparing for a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections. The state relies on experts, data and seroprevalence, adding more oxygen supported beds and oxygen storage capacity. Though the state agrees with experts who have said that there is no evidence to back the claim that a third wave may affect children more, the health department wants to improve infrastructure for paediatric care to be cautious.The government is preparing in three avenues- increasing infrastructure, training healthcare professionals and stocking medicines. “We are seeing to it that temporary infrastructure created for the second wave is not dismantled, and we are focussing on improving permanent infrastructure,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “But, more importantly, we have to continue mass messaging to the public that they need to understand that the real prevention against a third wave or any other increase depends on behavioural change and following SOPs on permitted activities as we open up. Irrespective of the variant, for the next few months, common practices of mask compliance, hand hygiene and social distancing have to be followed.”A 14-member task force, headed by former health secretary R Poornalingam, was set up a few days ago to advise the government on Covid-19 management. “We have told the government to prepare for a scenario where there are 50,000 new cases per day,” said a member of the committee not wishing to be named. “In the first wave, we had 7,000 cases per day, and in the second wave, the peak reached 35,000 cases per day. So, if we were to add children, we estimate that the number would be 50,000 cases in the third wave. Both government and private hospitals have to increase their oxygen supported beds.” There isn’t a consensus on the projection for a third wave.The government has begun strengthening the paediatric facilities with oxygen support. “75% of the beds are free now across Tamil Nadu, so in view reports of a possible third, which says more of the paediatric age group will be affected,” said the director of medical education, Dr R Narayana Babu. “We are making efforts to keep our paediatricians ready, including physicians, anaesthetics and nurses. We have inspected all hospitals for a minimum of at least 100 beds in the paediatric ward to be readily supported by oxygen and ventilators. We already have 40,000 oxygenated beds in medical colleges and 60,000 regular beds.” Babu adds that he is a paediatrician. “We are doing this as a precaution. In my opinion, they (children) already have good antibody levels, and they have been less affected in the first two waves, so it may or may not affect children.”On Wednesday, the health department opened a 40-bed paediatric ward with six ICUs in the Mayiladuthurai district. “Though certain specialists have said that there is no basis to claim that it will have more impact on children, we have been working on this area,” said Radhakrishnan.Tamil Nadu’s oxygen needs went up to 600 MT per day while its production capacity is only 500 MT daily. Former director of public health, Dr K Kolandasamy, who is also part of the newly formed task force, said that his personal opinion is that the state should double its production capacity, and not rely on other states for allocated supply. “Capacity to store oxygen of 5KL to 10KL should be created in districts so that they can be sufficient even if there is no supply for a week,” the member quoted above said. Tamil Nadu has already invited tenders for manufacturers to locally produce oxygen, cylinders and vaccines, and has announced a capital subsidy of 30%. “Tamil Nadu has to become a medical manufacturing hub,” said Kolandasamy. “Whatever infrastructure we build now given Covid-19 will continue to be helpful for other health issues in future after we bring the virus under control.”Agreeing with him is Dr Jacob John, former director of ICMR’s Centre of Advanced Research in Virology, whom the state government had consulted earlier this month, along with several other experts. “The government has to make use of the fear factor of a potential third wave to build capacity in each district,” says John. “Each district is unique, so it will have to be strengthened, accordingly, which will also be useful during a non-Covid-19 period.”Vaccination is a potent tool to protect against the virus, but Tamil Nadu has been facing a vaccine shortage, having come close to halting it twice in June. “Now, vaccine hesitancy seems to be a thing of the past. So our focus is also on rapid administration of vaccines, we are utilising whatever we receive as quickly as possible, and we keep seeking additional vaccines,” said Radhakrishnan. Around 15 million vaccines have been utilised out of the 11 million that the state has received until Monday night.Eom||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/training-medics-to-improving-infra-tn-gears-up-for-third-wave-101623869351516.html
17-06-2021||India||Fresh case against Kerala BJP chief for bribing tribal leader||Thiruvananthapuram: In fresh trouble for Kerala Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief K Surendran, a Wayanad court on Wednesday directed Kerala Police to register a case against him for allegedly bribing tribal leader C K Janu to remain in the National Democratic Alliance and contest from Sultan Bathery constituency in the April 6 assembly elections. Last week, police had registered a separate case against Surendran, following the directive of a Kasargod court, for allegedly bribing independent candidate, K Sundara, and convincing him to withdraw his candidature from Mancheswaram (north Kerala) in the polls. The judicial magistrate court in Sultan Bathery on Wednesday issued the order based on a petition filed by Muslim Students Federation (MSF) leader P K Nawas. In his plea, Nawas accused the BJP leader of adopting fraudulent means to win the elections.The court directed the police to register the case against the BJP leader under sections 171 E (bribery) and 171 F (exerting undue influence at an election) of the Indian Penal Code. Two weeks ago, a leader of Janadhipathya Rashtriya Party (JRP), an ally of the BJP, had alleged that Surendran had given ₹10 lakh to Janu to return to the NDA fold before the polls. Janu, a tribal leader from Wayanad, had earlier severed links with the BJP but later contested on the NDA ticket and lost the polls from Sultan Bathery in Wayanad district. JRP leader Praseetha Azeekode said though Janu had sought a bigger amount, Surendran gave her only ₹10 lakh. After her disclosure, an audio tape surfaced in which Surendran was purportedly heard talking to Janu, promising her ₹10 lakh. HT could not verify the authenticity of the tape. Janu, however, claimed that the money was part of the poll campaign expenses and no payment was involved for her return. Surendran also denied his involvement and blamed the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) “for raking up unnecessary controversies to put the party in bad light”. Last week, he was summoned to Delhi by the central leadership in the wake of the controversies. The CPI (M) and Congress hailed the court decision’s to register a fresh case against the state BJP chief. CPI(M) state secretary A Vijayaraghavan said the party (BJP) had spent enough money in the recent elections and will face more such cases in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-case-against-kerala-bjp-chief-for-bribing-tribal-leader-101623869292161.html
17-06-2021||India||Union or central? How DMK refers to Modi govt fans debate||Chennai: The new DMK government in Tamil Nadu has been punctilious in its reference to the Union Government as Ondriya Arasu (which literally means Union government) instead of the usual Madhiya Arasu meaning Central Government leading to both a semantic and a Constitutional debate. The Constitution of India is clear. In ‘The Union and Its Territory’, Part I, Article 1, it states, “India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.” Recently a parliamentary committee also suggested using the term Union Government of India instead of Central Government and union government officials instead of central government officials.Since May 2, when the DMK returned to power in Tamil Nadu after 10 years, chief minister M K Stalin has used the term which has now become the norm with his cabinet ministers and even regional media. This has made the BJP uncomfortable. Its ally and the principal opposition party, the AIADMK, has insisted that Central and regional governments is the correct term.“It is the central government only,’’ said former chief minister and leader of opposition Edappadi Palaniswami when reporters asked him about DMK’s new terminology.“The nomenclature is just shadow boxing. It’s a symbolic fight,” says retired justice of Madras high court, R Chandru. “The larger issue is the state’s argument that it should have more powers and more say in the running of the state.If you look at the Constitution, it doesn’t give you any different opinion other than saying we are a unitary and not a federal state though we may use the word quasi federal.”The constitution contains a Union List of 97 items, State List of 66 items and Concurrent List of 47 items. Chandru cites the example of how the 97th item in the union list gives it power over items that aren’t mentioned in the other 96. “In this exercise of constitutional power of lawmaking, slowly, the parliament started accessing more power that what it was originally intended to have,” says Chandru. Then, there are laws related to items in the concurrent list that the Union government passes. “ For example, now the centre is going to codife labour law, which was in concurrent list, into four labour codes. Once that is made into a law, it will eclipse all the state’s own amendments,” adds Chandru. Madras high court lawyer and DMK spokesperson, S Manuraj says that though it is alright to use either of the terms colloquially, the party’s use is as laid down by the Constitution and statutory bodies. “Terminologies and nomenclature have often changed and improved with time,” says Manuraj. “In the past we used to say physically challenged, today we say differently-abled. With the passage of time, we change to reflect our modern sensitivities but also to bring in proper terms. There is no question that we have used ‘Centre’ before,” he said. But now, the party prefers Union. Manuraj points to the Rajamannar Committee set up by the DMK In 1969 which looked into the relationship between the Union government and the states. “It laid out a platform for federalism and discussed these issues in depth”. The state’s BJP unit suspects secessionist motives. “We want a clear explanation from the chief minister as to why he was saying Centre before May 2 and after that he is saying Union,” says K T Raghavan, advocate and general secretary of BJP in Tamil Nadu. “I agree with the translation in Tamil. But why is this narrative being set now? I see something fishy here. There are a lot of fringe elements working in Tamil Nadu who feel they are compelled to live in India and have begun raising their heads since DMK came to power.”Manuraj responds that while DMK was in the opposition and the party critiqued New Delhi’s policies, it used the term ‘Modi arasu’ meaning Modi’s government but that now its language has to reflect the fact that it is in power in the state.“I think there is more expectation from the DMK to uphold federalist interests. It’s fair,” adds Manuraj. “ DMK has long shouldered the responsibilities to advance the cause of a more federalist country. This usage is also in continuation of those principles which have been upheld by the Constitution and by the Supreme Court in the SR Bommai versus Union of India case in 1994.”Chandru says that the questions and discussion that went into the constituency assembly were-- what is the power of the union of India? Is it a federating structure or a union structure? “It t isn’t intended to be a federal structure like the United States of America. Then they brought in a via media calling it a quasi federal structure,” he says. But states “cannot do whatever hey want to.” Political analysts see the DMK’s language as something aimed at keeping its cadre happy as well as reinforcing the state’s autonomy, if only in form. “The DMK is clearly implying that the state is not subordinate,” says political commentator Maalan Narayanan. Even former CM and DMK chief , the late M Karunanidhi, a Tamil scholar didn’t use terms such as Ondriya, he adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-or-central-how-dmk-refers-to-modi-govt-fans-debate-101623869232088.html
17-06-2021||India||Another Asiatic lion dies of Covid in TN zoo||Chennai: A 12-year-old Asiatic lion, Pathmanathan, died from Covid-19 in Arignar Anna Zoological Park, popularly known as Vandalur Zoo, outside Chennai on Wednesday morning, a statement from the zoo authority said. This is the second coronavirus-related death reported from the zoo after nine-year-old lioness Neela, who succumbed to the infection on June 3. “Samples of the said lion tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on June 3, as per the report of National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NISHAD) in Bhopal. The lion has been under intensive treatment since then,” the statement said, adding that the animal was housed in the lion safari area of the zoo. On June 3, lioness Neela died in the same zoo after a Covid-19 outbreak among Asiatic lions was reported. Nine lions tested positive for the virus in the zoo at that time. As a precautionary measure, samples of 28 elephants from the Theppakadu camp in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve were also collected and sent for Covid-19 tests last week. All samples have tested negative for Covid-19 in IVRI lab in UP, said KK Kaushal, field director, Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. According to the state forest department, senior vets from the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (TANUVAS) are supervising the treatment of the animals. For preventive measures and appropriate treatment, the Vandalur zoo is taking the help of Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, which is an approved animal SARS-CoV-2 virus sequencing centre for better understanding of zoonotic transmission. All zoos in the state have been closed since April 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-asiatic-lion-dies-of-covid-in-tn-zoo-101623869171443.html
17-06-2021||India||Facebook expands fact-checking arm in India on Covid, health misinformation||With an aim to combat Covid-19 and all other health-related misinformation, social media giant Facebook is expanding its third-party fact-checking programme in India.According to Facebook, the company has partnered with The Healthy Indian Project (THIP) to enhance its capabilities to understand and curb health-related misinformation on the platform. THIP is Facebook's first health-specialist partner in India.THIP works with verified medical professionals to fact check misleading news and claims about health, medicines, diet and treatment in English, Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, and Gujarati.During the pandemic, Facebook has removed more than 18 million pieces of harmful misinformation across Facebook and Instagram and labelled over 167 million fake news posts on Covid-19 with the help of third-party fact-checkers.Globally, Facebook works with 80 fact-checking partners that help in content monitoring in more than 60 languages.According to Facebook, its fact-checking partners have been certified through the independent, non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network.In India, Facebook has 10 fact-checking partners, making it one of the largest after the US. The partners fact-check in 11 Indian languages and English. Indian languages include Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil, Marathi, Punjabi, Urdu, Gujarati, Assamese, Kannada.Third-party fact-checkers evaluate stories, check if the stories are factual, and rate their accuracy. When a fact-checker rates a story as false, Facebook shows it lower in News Feed, significantly reducing its dissemination and reducing the number of people who view it.Pages and domains that repeatedly share false news will also see their distribution reduced and their ability to monetize and advertise temporarily removed. Community members are presented with a pop-up notice if someone tries to share a fact-checked post so people can decide for themselves what to read, trust, and share.People who shared a story that's later debunked are notified so they know there is additional reporting on that piece of content.Facebook said it has also launched a fellowship with 10 fact-checking organizations and will provide virtual training sessions by third-party experts to help the participating fact-checkers to enhance their capabilities to combat Covid-19 misinformation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-expands-fact-checking-arm-in-india-on-covid-health-misinformation-101623860321492.html
17-06-2021||India||House panel members differ on vaccine drive||The Public Accounts Committee of Indian Parliament could not arrive at a decision on whether to examine the production, purchase and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines after members failed to reach unanimity on the subject.According to two members present of PAC, chairman Adhir Chowdhury (of the Congress) started reading out a note on why the subject needs to be added to the agenda of the panel for FY 21-22, when some members from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) objected to its inclusion on the grounds that it was not listed in the draft agenda that was placed before the panel for deliberation.India’s vaccine policy has become a polarising political issue. Against the larger backdrop of a supply constraint, a debate has raged over the approval, purchase, prioritisation, pricing, and administration of vaccines.Chowdhury, according to the two members, who asked not to be named was not the first to demand inclusion of the subject. DMK leader TR Balu suggested the same, they said. After Chowdhury’s speech met with objections, a few other members such as Congress leader Shakti Sinh Gohil came out in his support and said he should be allowed to complete his speech. The objections, however, continued, with BJP members saying the speech was political in nature, one of the two cited in the first instance said.“At one point, a senior leader even proposed voting to decide if the subject should be in the agenda,” said the second leader.The non-inclusion of the subject is in keeping with protocol, a lawmaker explained.PAC member and BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab said: “All agenda that has to be listed for deliberation requires unanimity. If a single member opposes it, the proposed subject can’t be taken up for deliberation.

17-06-2021||India||CBI charges Mehul Choksi with ‘destruction of evidence’||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a fresh charge sheet against diamantaire Mehul Choksi and 21 others in the multi-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case on June 10, adding “destruction of evidence” to the list of offences that he has been accused of. The supplementary charge sheet, like the first one filed on May 17, 2018, also accuses Choksi of cheating, forgery, falsifying accounts, criminal conspiracy and bribery under the Prevention of Corruption Act.Choksi, 62, faces charges of getting 165 Letters of Undertaking (LOUs) and 58 FLCs (Foreign Letters of Credit) fraudulently issued in 2017 in connivance with officials of the state-run bank. The fraud led to a loss of ₹6,097 crore ($952 million) to the state-run bank, the CBI said.HT has accessed a copy of the charge sheet. The charge sheet also alleged that the businessman figured that he would be a target of criminal investigations well before the first case was registered against him on January 29, 2018, and travelled to Hong Kong in December 2017 to get his associates to shift operations to Thailand.“In December 2017, Mehul Choksi visited Hong Kong and met dummy directors of Hong Kong based supplier entities (controlled by him) and told them that problems are going on in India related to his company – Gitanjali Group and that they might have to face Enforcement Directorate (ED) enquiries,” the CBI charge sheet said.“This shows that Mehul Choksi had prior knowledge about the impending criminal proceedings. Hence, he fled the country on January 4, 2018, with dishonest intent, to evade the process of law.”Officials familiar with matter said the supplementary charge sheet will be shared with authorities and the high court of justice in Dominica to back up its plea to get Choksi deported to India.Choksi acquired citizenship of Antigua and Barbuda and was living there after fleeing India in January 2018. He is fighting in court, an effort by the island nation to revoke his citizenship. He went missing from Antigua on May 23 and turned up in Dominica where he faces charges of illegal entry. His family and lawyers have alleged he was abducted and are battling efforts to have him deported to India to stand trial.As reported by HT, India has told the court that Choksi was still an Indian citizen since his request to renounce his Indian citizenship wasn’t accepted.Choksi’s lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, said CBI’s new accusation that he destroyed evidence was an effort to cover up gaps.“This supplementary charge sheet... shows that it is only an attempt to cover up anomalies that defence has pointed out in the first charge sheet. Moreover, addition of section 201 of IPC (destruction of evidence) is not legally tenable as a document becomes evidence only after filing of the court, and the allegations are of a period much prior to even FIR,” Aggarwal said.In its new charge sheet, CBI said the agency was also investigating the “bogus LOUs and FLCs” issued in favour of Choksi’s companies in 2014, 2015 and 2016. CBI suspects a total 347 bogus FLCs were issued between 2014 and 2016.During raids in 2018, CBI said it recovered records of fraudulent LOUs and FLCs transactions maintained in the Google drive by former Vice President of Choksi’s Gitanjali Group , Vipul Chitalia at Choksi’s behest.CBI said it is also probing alleged diversion of another ₹942 crore by Choksi’s companies including Asmi Jewellery India Ltd as well as role of Chief Internal Auditor of PNB, Brady House branch , Bishnubrata Mishra.Apart from Choksi, 21 individuals and companies are named in the charge sheet including retired deputy manager of PNB , Gokulnath Shetty, single window operator Hanumant Karat, former Managing Director of Allahabad Bank , Usha Ananthasubramaniam, former executive directors of PNB, K V Brahmaji Rao and Sanjiv Sharan, former general manager of the bank , Nehal Ahad, and former Vice President of Choksi’s Gitanjali Group, Vipul Chitalia .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-charges-choksi-with-destruction-of-evidence-101623868932740.html
17-06-2021||India||Second wave of Covid-19 took heavier toll on pregnant women: Study||The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India killed more pregnant women and new mothers as compared to the first, a new study by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has found, underlining the need to vaccinate women in these categories.The study is due for publication in a medical journal, officials said. It analysed the case fatality rate (CFR) in pregnant and postpartum women and found that it was 5.7% in the second wave as opposed to 0.75 in the first wave. CFR is the proportion of people who die of a disease among the total number of patients diagnosed with the disease.Symptomatic cases were also significantly higher at 28.7% in the second wave as compared to the first when the proportion was 14.2%, says the study based on data from the Covid-19 registry on pregnant and postpartum women.“The data shows that the severity of disease among this category of patients was higher in the second wave. Data was collated from Nair Hospital in Mumbai for this particular study otherwise there are in all 11 publications based on the registry on pregnant and postpartum women with Covid-19 around 19 study sites,” said Dr Geetanjali Sachdeva, director, ICMR’s National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health.The analysis of data on nearly 4,000 Covid-positive women for the study was done in the Mumbai-based institute, and it is in the process of being published in the Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics.The reason for the drastic increase in deaths and cases is not clear. “Increased severity could be different variants in circulation, but nothing can be said for sure because the whole genome sequencing of positive samples was not done,” Dr Sachdeva added.The data from the first wave was collated between April 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021; and for the second wave, data was taken from February 1, 2021, till May 14, 2021.Doctors treating women with Covid-19 also agree that the second wave had a severe impact on pregnant women than what was seen earlier.Dr Anuradha Kapur, senior director and head of unit, department of gynaecology and obstetrics at Max Hospital in Saket, said a large number of such women caught the infection and became seriously ill.“When Covid-19 started last year, the (American) CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) issued guidelines that it won’t impact pregnant women much. But this year, it was totally the opposite, and the guidelines had to be changed. In most of the cases, lungs of the patients got compromised, making it difficult to treat them,” Kapur said.ICMR released a snapshot of the findings on Wednesday and said 2% of the total number of deaths ever since the pandemic began last year was of pregnant women or new mothers. Most of the deaths were due to Covid-19 related pneumonia and respiratory failure.“The study underlines the importance of vaccination of pregnant and lactating women against Covid-19,” said ICMR in a brief statement.The Centre’s expert panel — the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 —recently shared a fresh recommendation that allowed vaccination in lactating women.As far as vaccinating pregnant women is concerned, the health ministry last month said that the matter was “under discussion and further deliberation by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-wave-of-covid-19-took-heavier-toll-on-pregnant-women-study-101623868871601.html
17-06-2021||India||Mayawati attacks SP after Akhilesh meets rebel MLAs||LUCKNOW A day after six rebel Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLAs met Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav, party chief Mayawati on Wednesday lashed out at the SP, alleging that it was trying to project the meeting as a split.Mayawati accused the SP of “specialising in the narrow politics of hate, manipulation, malice and casteism”.“The Samajwadi Party, which is an expert in narrow politics of despicable manipulations, malice and casteism, is publicising through the media that some BSP MLAs are breaking away to join the SP. This is a serious illusion,” the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister tweeted in Hindi. On Tuesday, six rebel BSP MLAs — Chaudhary Aslam Ali, Hakim Lal Bind, Mohammad Mujtaba Siddiqui, Aslam Raini, Sushma Patel and Hargovind Bhargava — met SP chief Akhilesh Yadav in the party office. After the meeting, the group’s leader Aslam Raini announced that 11 rebel BSP MLAs would launch a new political party.The BSP chief said the MLAs who met Akhilesh were suspended from the party long back for colluding with the SP and an industrialist during the Rajya Sabha elections for defeating a Dalit candidate. “Had the SP been even a little bit honest towards these suspended MLAs, it would not have kept them in the lurch. The SP knows that if these MLAs join their party, then there will be a rebellion and disunity in SP, whose leaders are eager to cross over to the BSP,” she tweeted. Mayawati said people were aware of the fact that the working style, character and face of the SP were anti-Dalit. The SP leaders were not ready to change their attitude, she alleged.After coming to power in 2012, the SP government stopped all schemes launched by the previous BSP government for the welfare of the weaker sections, she said.“The SP has always been anti-Dalit and they do not want to improve. This is why the SP government stopped the welfare work undertaken by the BSP. Bhadohi was not made a new district as Sant Ravidas Nagar,” she said.The “new drama” enacted by the SP in meeting the suspended BSP MLAs and getting it publicised was more of a manoeuvre being done for the coming zila panchayat chairpersons’ and block pramukhs’ elections, she said.Responding to Mayawati’s remarks, SP spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi said: “Mayawati ji’s allegations are baseless. MLAs are deserting her. She must ponder over why they are not ready to contest elections on a BSP ticket. They know BSP is a spent force and it never raises the issues of Dalits and oppressed people. Dalits and other weaker sections are now reposing faith in the leadership of Akhilesh Yadav ji and therefore Behan ji’s recent statement shows her desperation to keep intact her vote share.”“She rarely speaks against BJP governments at the Centre and the state and attacks opposition parties only. We hope the people of Uttar Pradesh will reject her politics,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mayawati-attacks-sp-after-akhilesh-meets-rebel-mlas-101623868812187.html
17-06-2021||India||Twitter chose not to comply, says Centre||New Delhi: Union minister for electronics and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday said Twitter has deliberately chosen to not comply with the country’s new social media and intermediary guidelines, even as officials in his ministry said that this could make the social media company lose the protection it enjoys as an intermediary, although experts said whether or not the company is an intermediary will be decided by the courts, not the ministry. The guidelines came into effect on May 26. The rules are in place, and whether they have been violated or not, the experts added, is also something the courts have to decide.A Twitter spokesperson on Tuesday said that the company is “making every effort” to comply with the guidelines, and has appointed a compliance officer as required, but the IT ministry did not shed light on this.The company did not make any further statements on Wednesday. A Twitter spokesperson declined to respond to requests for comment. Prasad himself did not directly comment on the intermediary protection issue, but lashed out at the social media company for not following rules. “There are numerous queries arising as to whether Twitter is entitled to safe harbour provision,” Prasad wrote on Twitter and on Koo, a microblogging service like Twitter that has the government’s blessings. “However, the simple fact of the matter is that Twitter has failed to comply with the Intermediary Guidelines that came into effect from the 26th of May. Further, it was given multiple opportunities to comply with the same, however, it has deliberately chosen the path of non-compliance,” he said. Prasad added the guidelines were brought in to counter the menace of fake news. “The culture of India varies like its large geography. In certain scenarios, with the amplification of social media, even a small spark can cause a fire, especially with the menace of fake news. This was one of the objectives of bringing the Intermediary Guidelines,” he said. “It is astounding that Twitter which portrays itself as the flag bearer of free speech, chooses the path of deliberate defiance when it comes to the intermediary guidelines.”The Union minister also hit out at the social media firm for arbitrarily deciding which posts to mark as “manipulated media”, seemingly referring to controversy wherein Twitter had decided to flag posts by several senior BJP leaders that alleged Congress prepared a toolkit to defame India’s Covid efforts and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “What happened in UP was illustrative of Twitter’s arbitrariness in fighting fake news. While Twitter has been over enthusiastic about its fact checking mechanism, it’s failure to act in multiple cases like UP is perplexing as well as points towards its inconsistency in fighting misinformation,” Prasad said, adding: “If any foreign entity believes that they can portray itself as the flag bearer of free speech in India to excuse itself from complying with the law of the land, such attempts are misplaced.”His reference is to a video that went viral on Twitter that seemed to show a hate crime targeting a Muslim man in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, and was amplified as such, but which the state’s police has subsequently claimed was not a communal incident. HT on Wednesday reported that if Twitter does not follow the new Information Technology (IT) rules , it may no longer be entitled to seek protection from penal action under Section 79 of the IT Act, which absolves social media firms of liability for third-party content.Twitter late on Tuesday said it was in touch with the ministry of electronics and information technology, and has appointed an interim compliance officer. “We are keeping the MeitY apprised of the progress at every step of the process,” a Twitter spokesperson said, adding: “An interim Chief Compliance Officer has been retained and details will be shared with the Ministry directly soon. Twitter continues to make every effort to comply with the new Guidelines.” The chief compliance officer will be liable for penal action under the new guidelines in case of violation or failure to follow the rules.Digital advocacy rights group Internet Freedom Foundation asserted that the “intermediary status” is a technical qualification as per “criteria under the Section 2(1)(ua)(w) of the IT Act”. “As per Section 79, intermediaries are immune from liability/penalty if they comply with legal takedown requests of user posts from courts & public authorities. As we explain, this is threatened by the IT Rules, 2021,” IFF tweeted. “Even if we presume that the IT Rules are legal and constitutional, where alleged non-compliance is for appointment of officers, etc., when companies like Twitter are prosecuted, courts will decide if it is an intermediary and not the government,” it said.The reference to constitutionality comes from a school of thought that says that because the new guidelines are a subordinate legislation (to the IT Act itself), a case can be made that they are arbitrary and go beyond the scope of the law. IFF added that the there is no power or process for the grant or revocation of an intermediary status. “There is no immediate penalty which flows from non-compliance beyond loss of immunity determined by Courts on evidence and legal submissions,” said IFF. “It’s not that their intermediary status is revoked but they lose protection under Section 79 of the IT Act. The courts can find them guilty of non-compliance,” a senior ministry official said on the condition of anonymity. HT on June 7 reported that the microblogging services conveyed to the government that it was “committed to complying with the new rules”, even as it raised concerns regarding the safety of its employees in the country and intimidation by the police. The social media company sought a week from the ministry to comply with the key clauses of the new guidelines after the ministry issued it an ultimatum earlier this month. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, were notified in February, with all clauses coming into force on May 25. These guidelines require digital companies such as Twitter, WhatsApp, and Facebook to change how they regulate content, appoint nodal officers for compliance and grievance redressal, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification. WhatsApp has challenged only the traceability aspect of the law in the Delhi high court. There are at least 7 other petitions against the guidelines, including by digital news websites. One of these is also by popular Carnatic vocalist and social justice activist TM Krishna, who said the rules are unconstitutional for how they impact the freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Krishna has challenged the entirety of the rules on five grounds, including violations of fundamental rights to free speech, to freedom to practice any profession and to that of privacy.Twitter becomes the latest social media firm to fall in line with requirements, with Google, Whatsapp and Facebook already sharing the details of the officers with the government. Raman Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now said that the Union Government does not have the sole authority to device how internet intermediaries are able to make use of the legal protection granted to them by Parliament. “Whether the government’s rules are constitutional, and whether partial or incomplete compliance impacts this legal immunity provided in law, will ultimately be decided by judges, and not just by the executive branch,” he said. Kazim Rizvi, founding director at the think tank The Dialogue, said the government has always had the option to initiate legal proceedings against any intermediary. “Twitter will obviously invoke its safe harbour immunity to shield itself from actions of third parties on its platform. However, it is the court which will decide the extent of liability (if any) on the basis of the established jurisprudence in the Shreya Singhal and the Nakul Bajaj cases among many others,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-chose-not-to-comply-says-centre-101623868574054.html
17-06-2021||India||Denial of bail hearing is a breach of rights, says Supreme Court||Asserting that denial of a bail hearing is a breach of an accused person’s rights, the Supreme Court has said at least half the number of judges should sit in high courts on alternate days during the pandemic and attend to matters of urgency and individual liberty.A bench of justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian lamented that cases relating to life and liberty of the accused were not being listed for hearing in some of the high courts due to non-availability of judges.“Under the prevailing pandemic, at least half of the judges should sit on alternative days so that hearing is accorded to the person in distress. Non-listing of application for regular bail, irrespective of seriousness or lack thereof, of the offences attributed to the accused, impinges upon the liberty of the person in custody,” said the bench in its order on Tuesday.The court was hearing a petition by Goraya-based industrialist Chuni Lal Gaba, who has been named in a money laundering case linked with the ₹6,000 crore synthetic drug racket masterminded by former deputy superintendent of police Jagdish Bhola in Punjab.Senior advocate Vikram Chaudhri, representing Gaba, submitted before the bench that his client’s bail application has been pending before the Punjab and Haryana high court since February 28, 2020. The petition in the apex court was against an order of the high court on April 29 turning down a request for expeditious hearing of Gaba’s bail plea .Chaudhry added that although his client was 73 and suffered from several ailments, the high court showed no urgency in considering the bail plea and after almost 20 adjournments since February 2020, the matter has now been listed for August 21.At this, the bench said it was “shocked” to come across the facts of the case. “Normally, we do not interfere with an interim order passed by the high court but we are constrained to pass the present order as we are shocked to see that the bail application under Section 439 CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code) is not being listed for hearing for more than one year. The accused has a right to hearing of his application for bail. In fact, the denial of hearing is an infringement of right and liberty assured to an accused,” the order stated.It underlined that “even during the pandemic, when all courts are making attempts to hear and decide all matters, non-listing of such an application for bail defeats the administration of justice” and impinged upon the liberty of the person in custody.The bench then added that at least half the number of judges should sit on alternate days during the week to make certain that people had access to the justice delivery system in urgent matters.It said that the registrar general of the Punjab and Haryana high court will bring the Supreme Court’s order to the notice of the competent authority to take remedial steps at the earliest.On Gaba’s plea, the court said: “We hope that the high court will be able to take up the application for bail at an early date so that the right of the accused of hearing of application for bail is not taken away by not entertaining such application on the mentioning memo.”As Chaudhry thanked the bench for addressing the situation, justice Gupta retorted: “Since I belong to the same high court (Punjab and Haryana), I know the problems there.”The vacation benches in the Supreme Court sit two days a week during the court holidays. Additionally, special bench matters are taken up occasionally||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/denial-of-bail-hearing-is-a-breach-of-rights-says-supreme-court-101623868573505.html
17-06-2021||India||Despite bail, students in prison as cops ‘verifying address’||Three student activists arrested in connection with the 2020 Delhi riots spent Wednesday night in jail despite securing bail from the Delhi high court 30 hours earlier, because Delhi Police asked for more time to verify the permanent addresses of the three people.In a Delhi trial court, police sought six days to complete the verification of the “outstation permanent address” of all three accused people -- Jawaharlal Nehru University students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal and Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha -- and said the process could not be completed earlier due to paucity of time.Narwal’s permanent address is in Haryana, Kalita’s is in Assam, and Tanha’s is in Jharkhand. The three have been in jail for more than a year.The trial court will pronounce its order on Thursday morning.On Tuesday, the high court granted bail to the three people, terming the charges against them “stretched”, “verbiage” and “hyperbole”.“In so far as verification of “outstation permanent addresses” of accused persons is concerned, since Asif lqbal Tanha and Devangana Kalita are permanent residents of Jharkhand and Assam respectively, the investigating agency requires time till June 21 to verify the said address,” said an application filed by Alok Kumar, additional deputy commission of police (special cell)“Similarly, accused Natasha Narwal is a permanent resident of Rohtak, therefore, the investigating agency requires time till June 18 and would file report on June 19,” the application added.Police also said that for each of the accused, one out of two sureties was pending verification.Advocate Adit Pujari, representing Narwal and Kalita, opposed this petition and said there was no justification for delay in verification of surety. He said that the sureties were already visited by police.Tanha’s counsel Sowjhanya Shankaran argued that the high court said that he should be released within 24 hours but her client is yet to be released.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa said, “The police seeking six days to verify the addresses, which are already known to them and mentioned in the charge sheet, is completely unwarranted. The continued detention of the accused persons post the order of the high court is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-bail-delhi-riots-accused-stay-in-jail-police-say-they-re-verifying-addresses-101623868572926.html
17-06-2021||India||Early rain showers risk washing away bodies into Ganga||Earlier-than-expected rain in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj district and rising river levels are fast eroding chunks of the Ganga bank and threatening to sweep into the river hundreds of bodies buried in the sand, local officials said on Wednesday.The Prayagraj administration decided to cremate the bodies to prevent them from floating downstream. Till now, officials cremated at least 24 bodies, including three on Wednesday, in just one ghat, Phaphamau, in Prayagraj. Bodies were buried near four other ghats in the city, including Jhunsi and Daraganj.Another 60 to 70 bodies are on the verge of getting washed away, said residents. Zonal officer Neeraj Singh said he was cremating bodies getting exposed everyday by the erosion. “I don’t know any of the deceased. But it is my responsibility to follow the rituals of last rites. I light the pyre... considering ‘them’ as my own family members,” said Singh.During the 24 hours between Sunday and Monday evening, the city received 69.6mm of rainfall. On Monday, the city received 37mm of rainfall. “For the past around two decades, the monsoon was arriving by late June or first week of July. But here we are witnessing an early arrival of the monsoon”, said former head of the department of Geography at Allahabad University, Savindra Singh.The Ganga water level also started rising around two weeks ago due to weather pattern changes caused by cyclones Tauktae and Yaas. “The erosion of the riverbanks is mainly due to the Ganga water’s changing course and current,” said executive engineer of the flood control unit, Brijesh Kumar Verma.Hundreds of bodies were found buried in shallow graves on the banks of Ganga in Prayagraj last month, sparking concern. Many bodies were too decomposed to test for Covid but residents said the number of people burying bodies was many times higher than previous years.The discovery of the bodies coincided with the devastating second wave of Covid-19. Roughly 100 bodies were discovered floating in the river downstream in Ballia and Ghazipur in UP and Buxar in Bihar.Fearing infection, the government discouraged such burials and started disbursing money for funerals. “We have been keeping a close watch on the ghats because of which no one is burying the dead,” said PK Mishra, public relations officer of PMC.Senior Allahabad high court lawyer Arun Kumar Gupta said the administration needed to expand its vigil. “With the monsoon season on, the coming days would require 24x7 vigil on the riverbanks,” warned Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/early-rain-showers-risk-washing-away-bodies-into-ganga-101623868571473.html
17-06-2021||India||Centre defends vaccine gap amid political row||The Union government on Wednesday defended its decision to keep a long gap between two doses of Covishield despite new evidence from other regions that shows second shots need to be given sooner for adequate protection from the prevalent Delta variant, although it admitted that since mid-May it has been discussing, based on the evidence, whether it needs to revert to the originally recommended 4-8 weeks gap.India’s health authorities have been under increasing pressure from experts since last month, when they expanded the gap to 12-16 weeks while the UK, whose data it cited, itself reversed the delay. The government has been studying the suggestions and new reports suggested a group of experts did not recommend an extension beyond 12 weeks, a fact picked up by opposition leaders such as the Congress’s Rahul Gandhi.“Decision to increase the gap between administering 2 doses of Covishield has been taken in a transparent manner based on scientific data. India has a robust mechanism to evaluate data. It’s unfortunate that such an important issue is being politicised!” said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan in a tweet, before subsequent posts in which he accused Gandhi of “mythical claims without checking any facts”.Gandhi, while sharing a portion of a Reuters story, earlier said: “India needs quick & complete vaccination -- not BJP’s usual brand of lies & rhyming slogans to cover-up vaccine shortage caused by Modi Govt’s inaction. GOI’s constant attempts to save PM’s fake image are facilitating the virus & costing people’s lives”.The Reuters report quoted three members of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) as saying that the recommendation was to extend the gap between Covishield doses to 8-12 weeks, not beyond. The Union government on May 13 set a minimum of 12 weeks and a maximum of 16 to delay the second doses, altering its earlier schedule of 6-8 weeks.At the time, it seemed like a good idea given constraints in the supply of vaccines.That was before the emergence of new data on the Delta variant, and the high likelihood of it being the dominant strain in the country (and responsible for the second wave) .On May 15, the UK announced the Delta variant (B.1.617.2, seen first in India) may be more resistant to vaccines and went on to cut the delay from 12 weeks to 8 weeks for everyone above 50 the same day, and on June 15, extended this shorter dose interval to anyone over 40.A week later, Public Health England released data of its tests on two vaccines, Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford, that showed that one dose of the vaccine offered just a 33% protection against infection, and that two doses of the vaccine offered 88% protection in the case of the Pfizer jab and 60%, in the case of the AstraZeneca one.Subsequent research, released earlier this week, showed that the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine was 71% effective in preventing hospitalisation after one dose, and 92% after both.The AstraZeneca/Oxford shot, made in India as Covishield, accounts for nearly 90% of the 260 million vaccine doses administered in the country, where some states have curtailed vaccination programmes over supply constraints.The head of NTAGI claimed that the decision to increase the gap was unanimous.The move to the gap was to give flexibility to the community, since everyone cannot come at precisely 12 weeks or so, the chairman of NTAGI in a statement on Wednesday, clarifying it was a scientific decision with no dissenting voices in the expert group.“In the last week of April, 2021, the data released by Public Health England, United Kingdom’s executive agency of the Department of Health, showed that vaccine efficacy varied between 65% - 88% when interval is 12 weeks. This was the basis on which they overcame their epidemic outbreak due to the Alpha variant. The UK was able to come out of it because the interval they kept was 12 weeks. We also thought that this is a good idea, since there are fundamental scientific reasons to show that when interval is increased, adenovector vaccines give better response,” said Dr NK Arora.Indeed, research on both the Wuhan strain and the Alpha variant seemed to suggest enhanced efficiency when the gap was extended to 12 weeks.“Hence the decision was taken on May 13, to increase the interval to 12 - 16 weeks. This also gives flexibility to the community, since everyone cannot come at precisely 12 weeks or so… We have a very open and transparent system where decisions are taken on scientific basis. The COVID Working Group took that decision, with no dissenting voice. This issue was then discussed threadbare at an NTAGI meeting, again with no dissenting notes,” he added.It isn’t clear why NTAGI decided to extend the gap to 16 weeks; Spain extended the gap to 16 weeks in April, but prompted by a decision to conduct tests on mixing vaccines. Canada, too, has a 16-week gap, although several states have started reducing this based on supplies (which prompted the decision in the first place).According to the statement, the earlier (first) decision of (a) four weeks (gap) was based upon the bridging trial data available at the time, Arora added, referring to the trials carried out by Serum Institute of India, which makes Covishield.“Later we came across additional scientific and laboratory data, based on which after six weeks or so, we felt we should increase the interval from four weeks to eight weeks, since studies showed that vaccine efficacy is about 57% when it is four weeks and about 60% when it is eight weeks,” Arora said. That change was made on March 22.The government statement said “Canada, Sri Lanka and few other countries are also using 12-16 weeks interval for the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine”.“2-3 days after we took the decision to increase the dosage interval, there were reports from UK that single dose of AstraZeneca vaccine gives only 33% protection and two doses give about 60% protection; discussion has been going on since mid-May whether India should revert to four or eight weeks,” Arora added, according to the statement.“Tomorrow, if the vaccine platform tells us that a narrower interval is better for our people, even if the benefit is 5% - 10%, the committee will take the decision on the basis of merit and its wisdom. On the other hand, if it turns out that the current decision is fine, we will continue with it,”Explaining why NTAGI did not increase the gap to 12 weeks sooner, he said, “We decided we should wait for ground-level data from the UK (the other biggest user of AstraZeneca vaccine).”There was no mention of vaccine supply difficulties during the month of May, when many vaccination centres across the country were shut down, in the statement.“Part of the problem earlier was shortage of vaccine supply, but now as the supplies are improving and there is a pandemic to deal with, I would say, for Covishield, 4 weeks gap is good enough. If you are not in a hurry then you could wait for 12 weeks,” said Dr Jacob John, former head, virology department, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-defends-vaccine-gap-amid-political-row-101623868572126.html
17-06-2021||India||Bangladesh is now among India’s top 5 export destinations||Bangladesh has surpassed Hong Kong to become India’s fourth biggest export destination in the first three months of the current calendar year, and climbed four notches to fare in the country’s top five export destinations in 2020-21 because of New Delhi’s diplomatic efforts, logistical ease and a robust demand for Indian farm produce.India’s exports to Bangladesh rose 46% on an annualised basis at $3.16 billion in January-March, securing it the fourth position after the US ($15.41 billion), China ($5.92 billion) and UAE ($5.34 billion), according to the latest data from the commerce ministry. Indian merchandise exports to Bangladesh, which saw a 35.14% year-on-year growth to $0.95 billion in January and 17%to $0.94 billion in February , witnessed a 93.45% annualised jump in March to $1.26 billion.India, which follows the April-March financial year, saw Bangladesh at the fifth position in its list of top export destinations for FY-21, a jump from the ninth rank in 2019-20, with an annualised growth of 10.83% to $9.09 billion. The top four export destinations in 2020-21 are the US ($51.63 billion), China ($21.2 billion), UAE ($16.68 billion) and Hong Kong ($10.15 billion).Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) director general & CEO Ajay Sahai said one of the reasons for increased export to Bangladesh is relatively fewer disruptions in movement of goods to the country compared to other export destinations in the US and Europe due to Covid restrictions. “A combination of three factors helped in rising exports to Bangladesh – diplomatic efforts, logistics in terms of rail and waterways, and demand for agricultural items,” he said.Bangladesh is one of the largest markets for India’s agriculture products. India’s agri exports to Bangladesh recorded the second highest growth of 95.93% in 2020-21 after Indonesia (102.42%), a government official said on condition of anonymity.Major contributors to the increase in exports in 2020-21 are petroleum products and agricultural commodities such as rice (other than basmati), said India Exim Bank’s chief general manager - research & analysis, David Sinate. Exports also jumped due to a sharp reduction in import duty on rice (from 62.5% to 25%) by Bangladesh. The movement of goods by rail instead of road has also facilitated trade with reduced transportation costs, he added.People familiar with developments said trade with Bangladesh was helped by India’s focus on keeping key rail and river routes open amid disruptions in the neighbourhood caused by the pandemic. Land customs stations and other border facilities too have been upgraded and there is greater coordination between the two sides. “There has been a conscious effort to ensure the bilateral relationship has a solid underpinning from trade and economic ties. There has been greater focus on connectivity and easing of trade procedures at the border because of the confidence in the relationship over the past decade,” said one of the people cited above.“At the same time, there has been a realisation on the Bangladeshi side that certain goods can be acquired more cheaply from India and with the same quality,” the person said, adding Dhaka had also benefited from concessions under the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA).According to Sahai, consumption of food items has gone up globally in recent years. “Bangladesh is importing agricultural produce from India in large quantities because of better quality, reasonable rates and logistical advantages,” he added.“The prime reason for the surge in the exports to Bangladesh is huge surge in cereal exports,” Mohit Singla, founder chairman, the Trade Promotion Council of India (TPCI) said, adding that freight cost is often a deciding factor for global imports. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), food import costs across the world will surge to record levels this year, he said. The world’s food import bill, including shipping costs, is projected to reach $1.715-trillion this year, he added.“Bangladesh is India’s most important trade partner in the South Asian region, and the governments of the two countries are taking diplomatic efforts to enhance trade and commerce for mutual benefits. This reflects in PM Modi’s first foreign visit to the country after the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic on March 26-27, 2021,” said another government official said who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladesh-is-now-among-india-s-top-5-export-destinations-101623868511464.html
17-06-2021||India||Excess early rains boost sowing trend||A bountiful monsoon has bolstered sowing of a range of kharif or summer-sown crops, which is progressing at a quicker pace compared to previous two years and is likely to keep farm growth on track and help tame rising inflation, a major concern across economies, including India, experts have said. The government expects a third straight year of record harvests, an official said, requesting anonymity. Early monsoon rains have boosted sowing of crops such as rice, cotton, soybean, maize and pulses in southern, central and western states. In northern states, too, sowing has accelerated.Global inflation, especially of crude and edible oil, can still stoke prices in the country. However, bountiful farm output and a normal monsoon will keep a lid on prices of foods that don’t need to be imported, forecasters said. Poorer households tend to spend more on food as a proportion of their monthly budgets than on other items.The June-September monsoon covered two-thirds of the country a fortnight earlier than usual on June 13, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which said the rain-bearing system was well on course to advance into the northwestern states, albeit with a bit of a lull. The rains have been 33% excess so far. Good rainfall also tends to increase yields.Overall, planting of summer crops this year has been higher by nearly 38% than the previous year, according to weekly sowing data filed by states. Compared to 2019 levels during the corresponding period, sowing is higher by nearly 24%.Robust farm output is key to Indian economy because nearly half of all Indians depend on a farm-derived income. Over 50% of India’s net-sown area lacks access to irrigation. “One of the reasons for brisk sowing activity is that farmers in many states took to early sowing because of good pre-monsoon showers,” said Abhishek Agrawal, an analyst with Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.Good harvests boost demand for manufactured goods and services. “The rise in inflation has been very broad based and that’s a worry. There are new drivers of inflation. Inflation in imported items, like crude oil and edible oil, is not in our control,” said DK Joshi, the chief economist of Crisil Ltd, a ratings firm. However, the “important part” is that overall food output is likely to be good and “so we are unlikely to see inflation in most food items rising in a substantial way”, Joshi added.GDP growth and prices continue to be two key concerns of the economy as it tries to claw out of the pandemic, said KS Mani, an economist. Retail inflation rose to 6.3% in May 2021 from a year ago, higher than the Reserve Bank’s acceptable upper limit of 6%. Inflation in food and beverages rose 5.24%, led by edible oils and pulses.Farm growth stood at 3.1% in fourth quarter compared to 4.5% in third quarter in FY 21. It grew a healthy 3.6% for the full year, cushioning the impact of Covid on the economy somewhat.The country’s foodgrain output is projected to rise 2.6% to stand at a record 305.43 million tonnes in 2020-21, according to estimates of the agriculture ministry released on May 26.In the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, rice plantings are up by nearly 100% so far, data from the states show.“A key sowing trend this year is a sharp increase in the sowing of pulses,” the official cited in the first instance said. In the first week of May, a month ahead of the monsoon’s onset, the higher sowing trends had already become apparent.In the last week of April, for instance, the area sown under pulses had increased to 1.2 million hectare, which is a nearly 100% jump for that period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/excess-early-rains-boost-sowing-trend-101623868512146.html
17-06-2021||India||PM Modi invites investment into India at world meet||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday invited investment into India, based on what he dubbed were the “five pillars of talent, market, capital, ecosystem and a culture of openness”.Delivering the keynote address at the fifth edition of ‘VivaTech Summit’, the PM said, “India’s strides in the world of tech and start-up are well-known. Our nation is home to one of the world’s largest start-up ecosystems. Several unicorns have come up in recent years. Indian tech-talent pool is famous across the world. Indian youth have given tech solutions to some of the world’s most pressing problems.”“I invite the world to invest in India based on the five pillars of talent, market, capital, ecosystem, and culture of openness,” the PM added.VivaTech is a digital and startup event that is held in Paris every year.Modi said the emphasis should be on sustainable lifestyles that stop ecological degradation and that the focus should be on “repair and prepare” as the nation emerges from the devastating second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. He added that there is a need to insulating the planet against the next pandemic. “We have to continue repairing health infrastructure and our economies,” he said.In India, which is under the grip of second wave of Covid-19, the infection has been spreading at a fast pace, making new records almost daily in terms of the number of people infected.The Prime Minister called upon the start-up community to take the lead in working with collective spirit and a human centric approach to overcome the health challenges. “The start-up space is dominated by youngsters. These are people free from the baggage of the past. They are best placed to power global transformation. Our start-ups must explore areas such as health care, eco-friendly technology, including waste recycling, agriculture, new age tools of learning,” he said.On the issue of digital partnership from start-ups to quantum computing that have emerged as a key priority, Modi said, “History has shown that leadership in new technology drives economic strength, jobs and prosperity. But, our partnerships must also serve a larger purpose, in service of humanity. This pandemic is not only a test of our resilience, but also of our imagination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-invites-investment-into-india-at-world-meet-101623868032031.html

They had then levelled scharges of rampant sexual abuse at the shelter. “The four of the five named accused have been absconding since June 7 and the team led by ASP Kumar Gaurav tracked them down through their cellphone locations with the help of Singrauli police. They were brought here this morning on transit remand and sent to jail after Covid-19 test,” said Jamshedpur city superintendent of police Subhash Chandra Jat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jkhand-home-director-wife-held-for-sexual-abuse-of-minors-101623867972116.html

China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Taiwan have competing claims to parts of the South China Sea - a crucial international trade route.The ADMM-Plus is an annual meeting of defence ministers of 10 ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries and eight dialogue partner countries, mainly Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Korea, Russia and the United States.During his address, Singh stressed on the need for peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue and adherence to international rules. Singh’s Chinese counterpart also attended the virtual meeting. “India has strengthened its cooperative engagements in the Indo-Pacific based on converging visions and values for promotion of peace, stability and prosperity in the region. Premised upon the centrality of ASEAN, India supports utilisation of ASEAN-led mechanisms as important platforms for implementation of our shared vision for the Indo-Pacific,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-stresses-on-open-inclusive-indo-pacific-region-at-asean-meet-101623867852750.html
17-06-2021||India||Another probe ordered into fake Covid testing during Mahakumbh||A top Kumbh Mela official on Wednesday ordered a probe into the Covid-19 tests carried out during the Mahakumbh in April after reports that private labs contracted by the Haridwar district administration generated fake reports to meet targets during the Mahakumbh.This is the second inquiry into the Covid-19 tests conducted in Haridwar during the Mahakumbh. Haridwar district magistrate C Ravi Shankar had earlier ordered an inquiry by a three-member panel led by the district’s chief development officer Saurabh Geharwar to probe the tests after a health department inquiry revealed that people who hadn’t given samples were sent the ‘test results’. Geharwar has to submit his report by July 26.Officials said the Kumbh Mela authorities, in addition to the tests conducted by firms contracted by the district administration, had also empanelled 11 labs from Haridwar, Dehradun, Roorkee and Haryana for conducting Covid-19 tests.Mahakumbh Mela (health) officer Dr Arjun Singh Sengar, who constituted the second probe team on Wednesday, said this committee would look into allegations of irregularities by private labs empanelled by them. “It has come to light that wrong data has been tabulated by some labs. We are probing this matter and due action will be taken accordingly as per the recommendations of the committee,” said Dr Sengar.Saurabh Geharwar, the official leading the first inquiry committee, declined to comment on the progress made by his team. “We are inquiring into the matter and will submit the report in due time... can’t divulge further on this matter until the probe gets completed and is submitted,” said Geharwar.A health official, on the condition of anonymity, said two private labs from Haryana that conducted over one lakh antigen tests in April and reported a disproportionately large number of negative results were under the scanner. The fake Covid-19 tests and other irregularities are believed to have contributed to Haridwar’s 4% 10-week average test positivity rate in April when the figure for the rest of Uttarakhand was 13.7%.The low positivity rate was often cited by officials and the Uttarakhand government to counter experts who advocated a more conservative approach in allowing people to congregate for the Mahakumbh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-probe-instituted-into-fake-covid-testing-during-mahakumbh-101623863471917.html
17-06-2021||Today's||Measuring indoor air pollution: Why low-cost technology is critical||The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic seems to be weakening. However, an old challenge remains: The heavy load of particulate matter (PM) pollution in cities. This is not good news in the Covid-19 era. Several peer-reviewed scientific studies have established that the coronavirus may stay suspended in the atmosphere as PM provides a convenient surface for the pathogen to latch on.Therefore, managing India’s PM 2.5 crisis (indoors and outdoors) is an essential step. Unfortunately, indoor pollution and its impact of people’s health is often overlooked. But research shows that indoor air pollution, which is generated from kitchen fumes and household dust, can be two to three times deadlier than outdoor pollution.The challenge is establishing a dense and country-wide network of indoor air pollution monitors, which meets the requirements of low cost, accuracy, and consistency of data. The continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) monitors used by the pollution control boards are not suitable for mass deployment as the Beta Attenuation Monitoring protocol they operate on is very expensive. Each unit costs more than ₹15 lakh, and with annual maintenance cost, it touches almost ₹20 lakh.There are low-cost sensors (LCSs), which can be installed in households; however, their accuracy varies with the sensor’s sensitivity and the location of installation. For instance, if a PM 2.5 monitor does not have access to unrestricted airflow in the kitchen, it will not give accurate reading.Also Read | With rampant and illegal sand mining, the Yamuna can’t be rejuvenatedHowever, Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur has collaborated with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to develop a new technology that provides acceptable levels of accuracy at a much lower cost.The project, operationalised in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, has installed 40 LCSs at 15 locations (alongside regulatory-grade monitors). Four indigenous start-ups have developed the sensors: Respirer Living Sciences, Airveda Technologies, Personal Air Quality Systems (PAQS), and Oizom Instruments, and they cost around ₹60,000 per unit. The project recorded PM 2.5 data from November 2020 to May 31, 2021.The research team will deploy machine learning to measure and minimise the mismatch in the sensors’ readings with the co-located CAAQMS monitors. An already encouraging early finding is that their monthly uptime was 90%-plus. This is good or even better than CAAQMS units, and these monitors need minimal manual operation. Once the calibration model is complete, LCSs will be re-installed at the exact locations to improve their precision, aided by machine learning.These low-cost sensors can be quickly expand due to a unique feature called “transfer learning”, under which a calibration model perfected in one region can be encoded into a new set of sensors across the country without repeating the process.The project thus brings together all the desirable attributes needed to inform the suitable policy measures. In the next phase, the research team will upgrade the sensors in other ways that will help the medical community.SN Tripathi is steering committee member, National Clean Air Programme, MoEFCC, and Vipul Arora is an assistant professor, IIT KanpurThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/measuring-indoor-air-pollution-why-low-cost-technology-is-critical-101623911895014.html
17-06-2021||Today's||With rampant and illegal sand mining, the Yamuna can’t be rejuvenated||The draft Master Plan of Delhi (MPD)-2041, released last week for public review, underlines the need to save, restore, and rejuvenate the Capital’s green and blue assets.Terming the Yamuna and the city’s water bodies “heritage assets”, the draft plan aims to improve the river’s water quality, preserve and improve its fragile ecosystem, and ensure strict manual and technological surveillance to check illegal construction and dumping of sewage in the river and its flood-plains.The Yamuna crosses several states — Uttarakhand, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Delhi, before re-entering UP again. While MPD’s plans are bold, the health of the Yamuna, the second largest tributary of the river Ganga, will not improve unless all states take measures to stop industrial pollution, regulate mechanised sand and gravel mining, and agree to revise the interstate water-sharing agreement in 2024. Currently, riparian states extract much more from the river than they do for its restoration and rejuvenation.Illegal sand mining is the elephant in the room. While little of it happens in the 52km National Capital Territory stretch, it is widespread in other riparian states. Yet, there is very little public discussion about the issue since many, mistakenly, view sand as a dispensable resource, and officialdom sees it as a “minor mineral” that generates revenue.Also Read | Delhi bans certain soaps, detergents to curb pollution in YamunaBut the impact of such unbridled sand mining on the riverine ecology and lives and livelihoods is immense. It destroys the ecosystem of rivers, changes river courses and affects natural flows and riverbeds, destroys natural habitats of organisms, affects fish breeding and migration, impacts the water table, and increases saline water in the rivers.Most large rivers worldwide have lost anywhere between half to 95% of their natural sand and gravel delivery to the ocean, says UNEP’S Sand and Sustainability report (2019). In Sand Stories: Surprising Truths about the Global Sand Crisis and the Quest for Sustainable Solutions, Kiran Pereira writes that the world will not achieve global Sustainable Development Goals if it fails to take into account how sand underpins lives and livelihoods, and impacts each of the goals.Sand is a critical ingredient in our lives. It is the primary raw material to build our cities. It is used in fibre optic cables, glue, cosmetics, glass, silicon chips, and computers – along with virtually every other piece of electronic equipment in one’s home. With such high demand, the world is facing a shortage of sand, which is created by slow geological processes. Desert sand, available in plenty, is not suited for construction use because it is wind-smoothed, and, therefore, non-adherent.At present, no one even knows exactly how much sand is being pulled out of the earth, where, and under what conditions.Other than destroying rivers, sand mining has a substantial human cost too. A 2020 report by the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), a network working on rivers, says that between January 2019 and November 2020, 193 people have died due to illegal river sand mining incidents/accidents in India. In 2018, only 28 deaths were reported. Most deaths related to illegal sand mining are of children who fall into illicit mining sand pits, or due to rash driving by trucks transporting the mined sand. Officials who crack down on the illegal enterprise, and activists and journalists who highlight it, often face the wrath of the sand mining mafia, which usually enjoys support from a section of politicians, police officials, and bureaucrats.If the Yamuna in Delhi has to have any future, upstream riverine states must regulate sand mining and stop industrial pollution. Experts such as Manoj Misra, a former Indian Forest Service official who is now with Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, demand that there must be a total ban on mechanised sand mining. This is because machines scoop out more from a riverbed than allowed in mining leases. The building industry has to put its house in order by reusing construction material so that the pressure on resources such as sand is reduced, and must promise to use only legally extracted sand. In fact, India today needs an overarching river law that looks at riverine ecosystems, sand mining and overall basin management.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/with-rampant-and-illegal-sand-mining-the-yamuna-can-t-be-rejuvenated-101623911355788.html
17-06-2021||Today's||UNSG Antonio Guterres is set for a second term. This time, it will be different||As per convention in the 21st century, Antonio Guterres is cruising unchallenged to a second five-year term as Secretary General (SG) of the United Nations (UN). He is being reappointed by acclamation, well ahead of the end of his current term on December 31, 2021.The contrast with his first campaign is stark. In 2016, Guterres overturned conventional thinking. Some argued for an East European as no SG had come from the region. Others talked about a woman SG to overcome a historic lacuna. Seven of the 13 candidates were women. Formidable leaders such as Helen Clark, Irina Bukova and Kristalina Georgieva were in the fray.Yet, the former Portuguese Prime Minister leveraged the procedures adopted in 2015 to open new forms of engagement to his advantage. A combination of a politician’s innate people skills; an insider’s grasp of UN issues on account of a decade’s experience as High Commissioner for Refugees; and proficiency in several UN languages — English, French and Spanish — helped the charismatic Guterres impress the overwhelming majority of UN delegates. This made it easier for him to navigate the byzantine dynamics of the Security Council (SC).Also Read | Lot of work remains to be done to tackle land degradation: Modi at UN meetHowever, fate had a surprise in store. A month after Guterres’s victory, Donald Trump was voted in as the 45th President of the United States (US). It meant that much of Guterres’s first term was focused on shielding the UN from the recession of multilateralism that followed. Guterres’s re-appointment follows President Joe Biden’s return to the US’s traditional approach to multilateralism.There is a perception that Guterres’s first term lacked the fizz his election generated in 2016. Perhaps it was on account of the SG being in firefighting mode to keep US financial cuts at bay and ensuring damage limitation. He did try to put into practice his vision of a “surge in diplomacy for peace”. The environment of great power competition ensured that such efforts could not take off. Then the Covid-19 pandemic led to UN institutions being pushed to the margins and operating in a business processes continuity mode.This is not to say that there were no diplomatic successes. These include facilitation of the reconciliation process in Colombia; managing the transition in Bolivia; the setting up of a Government of National Unity in Libya; and considerable humanitarian efforts in Yemen and Syria. However, these are not the first rank geo-political issues that a UNSG is judged by. Even what was described as “low hanging fruit” of the Cyprus dispute remains on the unfinished agenda.Guterres has had a stab at managerial reforms. He shuffled the jurisdictions of UN departments; revamped the role of UN country offices; enhanced oversight of UN Representatives by the deputy SG; and significantly redressed the gender imbalance among senior UN staff. However, such navel-gazing evokes limited interest outside the UN system. These measures primarily appeal to major financial contributors as efforts at enhancing efficiency and lowering expenditure. The UN Charter terms the SG as “Chief Administrative Officer”. That role has grown. More is expected of any incumbent now.The present global environment that the 72-year-old Guterres finds himself in may be akin to what he had hoped for when he threw his hat into the ring in 2016. What then is in store in Guterres 2.0?Unencumbered by the need to go through any more electoral processes, Guterres’s enthusiasm for making a difference is bound to resurface. The realisation about the limitations of UN’s role in major geopolitical issues has meant that Guterres veered in another direction. He turned to the climate crisis as a signature issue, as had his predecessor Ban ki-Moon later in his tenure. An advocacy role is what Guterres thrives on. He is passionate, articulate and genuinely desirous of promoting change for the better. Climate advocacy brings into play his considerable diplomatic skills.Guterres is to report on the challenges the UN faces. This will unveil his thinking about the next phase. Peace and security matters in Africa will remain staples and new roles in hot spots such as Afghanistan and Yemen may emerge.However, it is the big challenges of environment, health, digital technologies, expanding space of civil society and other stakeholders and a host of trans-boundary issues “focusing on people” that will come to the forefront, amidst the perennials. In short, the agenda of Guterres’s second term is likely to be different from that of the first and his profile will grow.Many have faulted Guterres for supporting China’s Belt and Road Initiative and turning a blind eye to Chinese human rights violations. Notwithstanding the US-led western push, a radical change in approach is not likely. In pursuit of his coveted path towards a climate agreement and a forward-looking agenda, Guterres will tread carefully, ensuring that equities with China and other important actors, including Russia and India, are maintained. Without all on board, the climate accord that Guterres desires will not be possible. Further, collaboration on key trans-boundary challenges will be a casualty. This also means that the practice of permanent members retaining key portfolios in the UN bureaucracy will not be fundamentally altered.What does this continuity and change mean for India? The new agenda will open opportunities in tune with India’s mounting concerns on several of these subjects. Without the reticence that binds us to limit engagement on specific political issues, the broader agenda dovetails into our desire to engage and gain from such involvement.The growth of global issues on UN platforms provides more opportunities to play a larger active role. Antonio Guterres often mentions that he considers Indian cuisine as among his favourites. Let’s hope that what he serves as food for thought is also palatable to us in India.Syed Akbaruddin is a retired diplomat who served as India’s permanent representative at the UN.

17-06-2021||Today's||Rahul Gandhi must choose his political path||Critiquing Rahul Gandhi is fashionable. While his opponents in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have caricatured him as an incompetent leader, many of his Congress colleagues, in private, hold him chiefly responsible for the deepening crisis in the grand old party. So let’s cut to the chase and ask the central question. Would a Congress-minus-Rahul Gandhi be in a better position to challenge a Narendra Modi-led BJP?As the two massive Congress debacles in the 2014 and 2019 general elections have shown, the Gandhi scion is a tailormade foil for the Prime Minister (PM) in any presidential-style leadership contest. His identity as a fifth generation dynast allows Modi to play the naamdar-kaamdar narrative to the hilt, with a populist war cry — would you choose a privileged, untested inheritor of a family legacy or opt for the pulled-up-by-his-bootstraps chaiwallah who has become PM after years of toil? For a new young India, built on a meritocratic ideal, the well-marketed Modi journey is far too compelling compared to the pampered existence of a Lutyens’ elite offspring.Moreover, the sustained toxic campaign of the BJP in damning Rahul Gandhi as “Pappu” — through a mix of lies, half-truths, self-goals and yes, a complicit media — has influenced voters. Even when Gandhi raises valid questions, as he has done through the pandemic, his image as an unsuitable leader has stuck.Also Read | Rahul Gandhi hits out at Centre over ‘prolonged’ gap between Covishield dosesAnd yet, it isn’t as if the Congress was doing spectacularly well before Rahul Gandhi entered politics 17 years ago. The party’s decline across the Hindi heartland is a late 1980s phenomenon, with its hollow commitment to secularism and social justice ruthlessly exposed by the rising tide of the Mandir and Mandal forces. Besides, an imperious high-command culture that evolved in the Indira Gandhi years meant that more than a generation of regional leaders within the party was systematically marginalised. The unswerving belief that only the Nehru-Gandhi family could hold the party together weakened its leadership structure and atrophied the party organisation to a point of no return.Rahul Gandhi cannot be blamed for the organisational decay and his grandmother’s mistakes. What he can be held responsible for is his failure to recognise that the present-day Congress is neither equipped to be an ideological adversary to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) nor is it a well-oiled election machine that can compete with a Modi-led BJP, an election juggernaut with energised cadres, catchy slogans and thirst for new voters.The Congress, instead, is a loose big tent party of power-hungry leaders, harbouring perennial ambitions for VIP privilege. It cannot be transformed overnight into a revolutionary party of hardened secular activists or a party of like-minded Left-leaning fellow-travellers. Power may be poison for Gandhi, it is tonic for his party. Those who have left the Congress in recent times, including Gandhi’s close aides, mirror the inescapable reality of a political culture that is uneasy with the prospect of being out of power for an extended period. If Gandhi is not seen as a vote-catcher or an astute election strategist, then a large section of the Congress will never fully embrace him.Which is why if Rahul Gandhi wants to genuinely democratise or reform the Congress, then he must realise that he can’t do it while remaining in the Congress. Sharply competitive and resource-intensive contemporary power politics has little space for a moral revolution, intellectual engagement or soul-stirring wannabe Mahatmas. For example, you cannot claim to be a secular fundamentalist and then compromise for power by allying with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra or with an Islamic cleric in Bengal. The Congress is weighed down by too much baggage to be seen as a resolute defender of progressive values.If Rahul Gandhi truly wants to wage an ideological war against the BJP-RSS, then he is leading the wrong army. If he is committed to value-based politics, he must show the courage of his convictions, risk breaking the present Indira-Rajiv-Sonia Congress, and forge his own path with comrades who share his ideals. If he has a vision for a better politics, then he needs to agitate for it, not just by attacking the government on Twitter or interviewing foreign-based academics online but by hitting the streets and connecting with people, replacing the culture of entitlement with that of egalitarianism. Rahul Gandhi must form his own party and lead it according to his principles. That is the only way he can hope to emerge from the dynastic trap and be seen as a formidable challenger to the existing ruling dispensation.Maybe he can draw a leaf from his dadi’s playbook. Indira Gandhi too was lampooned as a “gungi gudiya”. Yet, by 1969, she determinedly broke with the old guard in the Congress and forged her identity with stunning success. She, though, clearly saw herself as an artful 24x7 practitioner of realpolitik. Rahul Gandhi too needs to finally decide — is he willing to play a lead role in the ruthless pursuit of power or else opt out and operate in a more academic universe of ideas? Staying in a status quoist comfort zone is no longer an option for him or the Congress.Post-script: Recently, when Mukul Roy rejoined the Trinamool Congress, Mamata Banerjee was asked about taking back someone who betrayed her. She was emphatic that in politics, there are no “closed doors”. It’s a lesson in no-holds-barred powerplay that the Congress once excelled in and perhaps needs to re-learn. Else, it will be reduced to a feeble rump.Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/rahul-gandhi-must-choose-his-political-path-101623910395401.html
17-06-2021||Today's||Scientifically Speaking | Considering a mix and match approach to Covid vaccines||For most vaccine-preventable diseases, two or more shots are needed for both long-lasting and strong immune protection. For example, children require up to five doses spaced over months for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP). Even in adults, a tetanus booster is recommended every ten years.All currently available vaccines for Covid-19, with the exception of the single-dose adenovirus vector vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, were approved clinically with two doses — a prime to build and train the immune response, and a boost to jolt it into producing even more antibodies and immune cells.In clinical trials for approval of two-dose vaccines, adults were administered a prime and boost regimen with exactly the same vaccine type and dose. The only approved vaccine with a slightly different prime and boost is Sputnik V, which uses different cold-causing adenoviruses in two doses to deliver instructions for the body to make and mount an immune response.Also Read | Shortage of raw material holding up Covovax manufacturingA record-number of different types of vaccines have been approved for Covid-19 already; more are on the way. Some such as Covaxin are inactivated virus vaccines created with traditional approaches. Others such as adenoviruses vector vaccines, RNA vaccines, and protein subunit vaccines use molecular approaches.Right now, those who have received one vaccine should adhere to health guidelines for their second doses. In the United States (US), for example, the only approved two-dose vaccines are mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Those who have received one dose of Pfizer are not typically given a second Moderna dose and vice versa. But the US has not faced widespread shortages of either vaccine. Additionally, the US Food and Drug Administration has unfailingly stuck with the approved clinical trial data for vaccine doses and intervals. Still since the two mRNA vaccines are quite similar, considering administering one instead of the other for a second dose if there is a dwindling supply, is not a stretch.In other parts of the world, mixing different vaccine types for the first and second dose (known as heterologous prime-boost) has been initiated. In particular, the AstraZeneca (Covishield) vaccine, which is a viral vector vaccine, is has been associated with a rare blood clot risk in younger populations according to some studies. In addition, there is a higher risk of a rare bleeding disorder. In many European countries, high-risk individuals who received the prime of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been advised to get a boost of Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine weeks later.Currently, most of the data that is available is with respect to mixing the AstraZeneca vaccine and Pfizer/ vaccine. A study in the Lancet published on May 29 found that those who received either vaccine first and a second dose of the other, had higher rates of common side effects such as fever and pain compared to those who received the same vaccine. Reassuringly, there were no major safety concerns.Research from Spain presented on May 18 that has yet to be published found that those who received the Pfizer boost after a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine had higher levels of antibodies than those who received only the AstraZeneca prime.More recently, Barros-Martins and researchers showed in a preprint posted on June 3 that receiving a boost of the Pfizer vaccine after a prime of the AstraZeneca vaccine raises higher levels of neutralising antibodies against tested variants of concern than receiving two doses of AstraZeneca. In addition, those who had two doses of different vaccines had boosted immune cells responses.None of these three studies demonstrates real-world effectiveness or how long protective immunity lasts, but taken together, they show that getting a boost of Pfizer after being primed by a dose of AstraZeneca is safe and results in a robustimmune response. In this case, heterologous prime-boost is the right approach.Countries should test different heterologous prime-boost vaccine combinations to maximise the protection of their populations.First, if one vaccine becomes scarce, those who are partially vaccinated may need to be offered a different boost vaccine for full protection. Second, the safety and adverse effects of mix-and-match vaccines needs to be determined before rolling out broadly. Third, the immune responses and effectiveness of mixing vaccines together needs to be gauged.For other diseases, an unexpected finding is that heterologous prime-boost often results in stronger immune responses and more effective vaccines. This strategy has been beneficial for rabies and for Ebola. And so far, it seems to be the case for some Covid-19 vaccine combinations.To my knowledge, there are currently no published studies on heterologous prime-boost with Covishield and Covaxin, but this research is vitally necessary since these are the two most widely available vaccines in India. Safety or supply issues with either could slow down India’s vaccination drive. We urgently need systematic studies that look at safety, immune responses, and real-world effectiveness of a mix-and-match approach with vaccines.Anirban Mahapatra, a microbiologist by training, is the author of COVID-19: Separating Fact From FictionThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/considering-a-mix-and-match-approach-to-covid-19-vaccines-101623902594284.html
