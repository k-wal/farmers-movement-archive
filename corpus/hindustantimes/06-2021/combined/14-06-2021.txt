The work that was started in January this year was supposed to be completed by June, but it got affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic, said officials.The authority is spending ₹4.86 crore on the development of wetland and park on an area spanning around 22 acres of land. Once developed, it will be a beautiful attraction for nature lovers right in the heart of the city, said the officials.“We have expedited the work on this wetland and park project after easing of Covid-19 restrictions. The park will be opened for public in August,” said Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty and in-charge of horticulture department of the Noida authority.In June, 2019, the authority had shifted the rotting mass of garbage from Sector 54 to another site in Sector 145 following protests from residents, who had approached the National Green Tribunal. The NGT had in 2019 directed the authority to stop dumping waste at the Sector 54 green belt. The authority then decided to convert the ‘wasteland’ into a wetland’, said the officials. “There is a low lying area in the Sector 54 green belt, which is being used to develop a wetland. Besides, a park will be developed around the wetland. The park will have several elevated pathways, a sit out area, an open air theatre with a capacity of 150 people, among other facilities,” said Singh.“The wetland will not only use rainwater to recharge water table, but will also be filled with treated water from a nearby sewage treatment plant,” Singh added.Residents are eagerly waiting for this project to be completed. “Noida hardly has any pond or a wetland, where families can hang out with children. Once this wetland and park is opened for public, it will be very beneficial for citizens,” said NP Singh, president of Gautam Budh Nagar district development residents’ welfare associations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-wetland-park-on-landfill-in-sec-54-to-be-ready-by-august-101623695385726.html

The first two-wheeler was registered at the dealer’s showroom on Monday, at B U Bhandari, Sadhu Vaswani chowk. The first vehicle registration number was given to Ramesh Vaswani customer, with the number MH 12 TJ 7818. “Henceforth, the dealer point registration system has started in the state and it began from Pune city.

14-06-2021||Noida||Gautam Budh Nagar has only three trees over 100 years old, says forest dept||Noida: It seems that the rapid urbanisation has taken its toll on the old tree cover in Gautam Budh Nagar, as the district is left with only three trees which are over 100 years old and qualify for ‘heritage’ tag, finds out the forest department in a year-long quest. The Uttar Pradesh government in May 2020 had ordered the forest department to recognise all trees which are 100 years or older to protect them as ‘heritage’ trees. Under this tag, the trees are to be notified, protected and not allowed to fell in any circumstances, forest department officials said.However, after searching the region since May last year, the officials said that only three trees could be found in the entire district — one in Noida’s Okhla Bird Sanctuary and two at Maripat railway station in Greater Noida.“Based on the old records and information from the local villagers, we found the three trees which are over 100 years old. Though we are still searching, it seems that a lot of developmental work through all these years has taken a toll on some of the rare trees in the region,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, GB Nagar.The three trees include a banyan tree (Ficus benghalensis) at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary that has a girth of 883.9 cm, the second is also a banyan tree at Maripat railway station near Achheja village in Greater Noida with a girth of 800 cm, and the third a peepal tree (Ficus religiosa) that has a circumference of 600 cm.The officials said that the three trees have been proposed to be titled as heritage trees. “We have initiated the process of declaring them as heritage trees for future protection. For that, there would be a sign board installed by the tree declaring it so, a sample bark to be kept as record and the tree shall be protected and never allowed to be felled,” Srivastava added.Of its total geographical area of 1,282 sq km, GB Nagar has 19.99 sq km (1.56%) under green cover. The district has a total of five moderate dense forests (70%-40% density), while 15 are open forests (39%-10% density), as per data from the district forest department. Environmentalists say that the forest department needs to look deeper, believing that there could be more. “Years back, I was told that there are only seven wetlands in the district. Later, I myself found 750 wetlands in the district. The forest department officials for some reason are not looking deeper, but they need to do more fieldwork as there are many old trees. The department should involve better research,” said Anand Arya, a city-based environmentalist.Vikrant Tongad, another environmentalist, said that there had been a lot of felling of trees in the district that had our greenery compromised. “However, I believe that there would be more heritage trees and perhaps forest department is not doing enough work to cover more area,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/gautam-budh-nagar-has-only-three-trees-over-100-years-old-says-forest-dept-101623695325189.html

Districts at level 5 have a positivity rate of less than 5%, like Pune for example. However, in Kolhapur district Covid-19 is far from under control. Between June 6 and June 12, Kolhapur district recorded the highest positivity rate in the state, at 15.2%. This has prompted the state government to issue a warning that even stricter curbs to contain the spread of the infection in the district are likely to be imposed. Kolhapur, currently, falls under level 4 of restrictions set by the state administration. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and state health minister Rajesh Tope held a Covid review meeting with people’s representatives and district authorities from Kolhapur on Monday. At a press address that followed the meeting, Ajit Pawar explained the reasons behind the high number of Covid cases, and then, the decisions that will be taken to break the chain of the infection in Kolhapur. He also warned that action will be taken against those in charge of the situation, if the scenario does not improve. Pawar cited low testing numbers in Kolhapur as the main reason behind the rapid spread of the virus and instructed the district administration to double the number of Covid tests being conducted, from the existing 9,500-10,000 per day. “Some positive cases are not getting identified because they are not tested, and they go roaming around with other people. Those people are getting infected. So the testing should be increased. If testing is increased then in the initial stage the number of positive cases will go up, but it is fine if for the first week cases go up. Afterwards, it will help to reduce the caseload,” said Pawar. He also emphasised putting a maximum number of Covid patients in institutional quarantines, rather than home quarantine. Pawar also noted the non-compliance of basic Covid norms, such as wearing of masks and social distancing, is also behind the high number of Covid cases in Kolhapur. He asked the administration to enforce strict measures to ensure norms are followed and warned of action if the Covid situation does not improve. “In the morning I noticed that many were not wearing masks. Some had used a handkerchief instead of the mask and if the police came into sight, then they would pull the handkerchief over the nose. From now onwards, if the situation doesn’t change then, unwillingly, we will have to take bitter decisions about those who are in charge; if they fail to deliver,” said Pawar. After the meeting, it was also made clear that no relaxations to curbs will be allowed in Kolhapur. “Kolhapur currently is at level 4. It currently, has the highest positivity rate in Maharashtra. No relaxations will be given here. If non-compliance to rules is observed then curbs will be made even stricter,” said Pawar. To contain the spread of the virus in the Kolhapur district, Pawar said that everyone resident will be tested in villages where Covid numbers are high. Pawar also hinted at changing the vaccine quota for districts. “It is right that vaccination is the only way to control the Covid wave. We have decided to distribute vaccines in proportion to the population of a district. In the upcoming cabinet meeting we will discuss giving 5%-10% more vaccines to the districts where positivity rate is higher,” said Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/number-of-covid-tests-in-kolhapur-district-to-double-efforts-on-to-break-chain-of-infection-101623695267281.html

As of June 14, Pune reported a total rainfall of 56.9 mm against its normal quota of 63.7 mm. On Monday, the city reported no rainfall. IMD reported a maximum temperature of 32.4 degree Celsius and a minimum temperature of 23.3 degrees Celsius. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting, IMD Pune, said that multiple weather systems over the city and Maharashtra have been less active than earlier.“The off-shore trough line which brought good rainfall to the city is now less marked. Today, it runs from Southern Maharashtra to North Kerala. The formation of a system over the Bay of Bengal, which was expected to intensify, has not. Its trough was expected to cover Chhattisgarh, Vidarbha and adjoining areas. However, this trough has moved north-Northwestwards, thus not reaching our state. The system is now over south Jharkhand,” said Kashyapi.“The westerlies are partially strengthened. Its strength also depends on the depth of westerlies. Even though there was a gradient over Arabian Sea, the strengthening of the westerlies did not materialise. All of these reasons contributed to less rainfall so far in June, despite the arrival of the monsoon earlier than its predicted date,” said Kashyapi.He added that in the next few days, Pune is on the leeward side of the Sahyadris. “This has affected the rainfall in Pune city and Pune district. On June 15 and June 16, rainfall is likely to get better due to strengthening westerlies. There is moisture in the air and so there are chances of thunder activity on these two days,” said Kashyapi.IMD has forecast that moderate rainfall in Pune city is likely. “Rainfall is likely to be heavy in isolated parts of the ghat areas around Pune. The day temperature will be around 31 degrees Celsius and the night temperature will be around 22 degrees Celsius in the coming few days,” said IMD officials.Along with Pune, Marathwada, Vidarbha and Madhya (central) Maharashtra will experience rainfall at isolated places with thunderstorms and lightning till June 16. “Konkan and Goa may receive heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places in the next few days,” said IMD Officials.Not a monsoon breakSpeaking about the monsoon, Kashyapi added that this dry spell cannot be termed as a “monsoon break”.“As the southwest monsoon is still settling in, this cannot be called a dry spell. Moreover, it is likely that rainfall activity may revive by the end of June and starting of July,” said Kashyapi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/less-active-weather-systems-responsible-for-little-rainfall-so-far-imd-101623695208342.html

Police found 46 men and 15 women there not wearing masks and using the swimming pool, which is banned. Most were university students from Delhi and the National Capital Region, they said.“Those without masks were challaned at the spot and ₹6,100 was collected in fines,” said a police spokesperson.The people were booked under sections 188 (disobeying public order) and 269 (negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Expressway police station. The people were let off on bail.“They had booked the farmhouse for four hours for ₹20,000. We also recovered 12 beer and two liquor bottles from them that had been bought from Haryana,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Rannvijay.Seven from the group were also booked under relevant sections of the excise act for illegally bringing liquor from another state.Police officials said that the caretaker, Dharamveer, had already been booked the previous day for a similar offence when another farmhouse was raided, while the owner has been traced.On the night of June 8, 16 people were apprehended for organising a birthday party in a high-rise. On Saturday night, 14 people from Delhi had been booked after they had rented a farmhouse for a night for ₹12,000.Farmhouses in the Noida floodplains are infamous for illegal gatherings and parties specially for people from Delhi.“Party goers feel that the area is secluded enough that they can get away with organizing such gatherings. They rent these places for nominal prices through online portals. We are planning on having a meeting with farmhouse owners in the area to discuss the problem with them and to aware them about the regulations specially regarding Covid-19. We will take serious action against them all in case of repeat offences,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/61-booked-for-illegal-pool-party-covid-violations-101623695207701.html

On June 7, it said those travelling outside the country - Tokyo Olympic athletes, students and job seekers or those employed overseas - will be allowed to get the vaccination after 28 days. The other vaccine, Covaxin, requires only a month’s gap but is yet to get approval from international bodies such as the World Health Organization.“But the Co-WIN portal is yet to be updated with this exception, leaving us no option to administer the second dose of Covishield to a person who has not completed 84 days,” said Dr Ajit Kumar, director of public relations at Sharda Hospital who confirmed that they had written to the district’s chief medical officer on Saturday for permission to administer second dose for international travellers based on the new rules.CMO Dr Deepak Ohri on Monday said that those looking to get vaccinated with Covishield after 28 days can submit a request for it.“Once we check the documents proving that they are travelling overseas and qualify for the ‘exceptional circumstances’, we will grant them permission that can be taken to any hospital in Gautam Budh Nagar and get their shot on a walk-in basis,” said Dr Ohri.The central government had advised that people wishing to avail of this exceptional facility present their passport as their ID proof, although this is not mandatory. The competent authority, it said, could issue another certificate that links the vaccination certificate with the passport. The facility is available only to those seeking to travel by August 31, 2021.Delhi began this service on Monday at Navyug School in Mandir Marg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/overseas-travellers-can-apply-to-noida-health-dept-to-fast-track-covishield-2nd-dose-101623695207049.html

The data also mentions that 345 patients were discharged, and the number of active cases stood at 112 in Meerut division, as of June 13. Ghaziabad, as per official records, recorded eight deaths and 43 active cases of black fungus, with a total of 94 cases till June 13. The 43 active cases are getting treatment at five hospitals. Permission to obtain the drug still rests with the divisional commissioner’s office in Meerut, which can be obtained online. The drug is then to be sourced from the office of the district chief medical officer.“My brother-in-law comes daily for treatment for black fungus at the black fungus at the Harsh ENT Hospital at the Raj Nagar District Centre. He requires four injections of Amphotericin B per day, but we are getting only two from the office of the Ghaziabad CMO. However, the drug being locally available has eased our woes as earlier, at least one member of the family had to spend the entire day at Meerut to get the injections while one used to accompany the patient,” said Vinod Kumar, from Pilkhuwa, said at the CMO’s office on Monday.“With drug’s availability at the district level, we are told beforehand when the injections will arrive each day. So, a lot of hassle is reduced. But short availability is still a cause of concern,” he added. Experts also echoed similar views. “Generally, patients need four injections each day, but we are getting only two from the district-level officer daily. In such a case, we have now resorted to use of another drug, Posaconazole, which is easily available in the market. At present, we are using both Amphotericin B and Posaconazole in combination and patients have responded positively. Of the 48 patients who have come for black fungus treatment to our hospital, four died due to severity of the infection while only three are presently admitted,” said Dr BP Tyagi, senior ENT specialist at Harsh ENT Hospital.The district health department said that during the past four days, since the Amphotericin B injections were made available locally, they received 60 doses (distributed among 26 patients) on June 11, 75 each on June 12 (to 32 patients) and 13 (to 34 patients) besides 125 on June 14.“We are getting regular stock but in limited numbers and are providing an average of two injections per patient, as per availability. We expect that we will be able to get more doses and will be able to provide them sufficient quantities as per requirement,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad. Dr Deepak Ohri, the chief medical officer of GB Nagar, said that they were able to provide more Amphotericin B injections to patients as compared to Ghaziabad. “We are giving sufficient injections to our patients as per requirement. We are giving three-six injections per day to patients per day. We have 150 injections available with us,” Dr Ohri added. According to official records, GB Nagar till June 13 had 21 active cases of black fungus besides 11 deaths out of a total of 94 cases reported so far in the district. The 21 patients are getting treatment at five hospitals in Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/black-fungus-drug-available-in-noida-ghaziabad-but-supply-not-enough-101623695145189.html
14-06-2021||Noida||Low turnout at 24x7 vaccination centres in GB Nagar||Noida: The turnout at two 24x7 vaccination centres run by private hospitals in Gautam Budh Nagar has dropped significantly over the past one week. Authorities at one of the two hospitals said that they are mulling to close down the night vaccination facility.Started with an aim to provide the service to those who may not be able to book a slot between 10am and 5pm, the 24x7 vaccination centres are also offering drive-through and walk-in facilities.Felix Hospital in Noida Sector 137 had started the 24x7 vaccination centre on May 29. At that time, according to the hospital administration, the 24x7 facility was a hit among people as the hospital opened around 5,000 slots a day on Co-WIN portal. “By June 5, 10,000 beneficiaries were administered jabs at the centre,” said Dr DK Gupta, chairman of the hospital.However, the hospital vaccinated only around 5,000 people (on average about 600 daily) at the centre from June 6 to June 13 even though it still opens around 5,000 slots on the portal. “The turnout for the vaccinations has trickled down. People prefer to come in the morning or in the evening. There are no takers for vaccinations during the night. However, we will continue with the service as of now,” Gupta said.Greater Noida’s Sharda Hospital that started the 24x7 vaccination centre on June 6 on the Sharda University campus is mulling to stop the round-the-clock service. “The 24x7 vaccination centre was started with the aim of providing vaccination service for people who may not be able to come during the day. However, the response has not been good,” said Dr Ajeet Kumar, director (public relations) at Sharda Hospital. According to authorities, the hospital opens around 1,000 slots per day for vaccination, but on average, only about 370 vaccinations are being carried out daily. “It is a big loss to deploy staff and other equipment throughout the night for nothing. Hence, the hospital is thinking of stopping the 24x7 service, and will continue vaccinations at the general time of 10am to 5pm,” said Dr Kumar.Medical experts say the low turnout can be attributed to an increase in number of vaccination centres and special camps across the district.“Compared to last month, the situation regarding vaccination in GB Nagar has improved. Now, camps are being held in residential areas and workplaces. Besides, slots are comparatively easily available on Co-WIN. So, there may not be many people who would require to go to a 24x7 vaccination centres at odd hours,” said Dr NK Sharma, president, Indian Medical Association (Noida chapter).According to data from the Co-WIN portal, a total of 130 sites are currently conducting Covid-19 vaccinations in GB Nagar, of which 79 are government sites and 51 are private.The district health department is also running 10 drive-through vaccination centres in the district that are operational between 10am and 5pm. “While all slots at drive-through centres get booked within hours of opening up, only 80% people show up,” said Dr Neeraj Tyagi, district Immunisation officer, GB Nagar.“It has often been found that some people book more than one slot using different identity cards on Co-WIN. That is why even though all slots are booked, lesser people turn up,” Tyagi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/low-turnout-at-24x7-vaccination-centres-in-gb-nagar-101623695085725.html

Speaking to reporters via video conferencing, PCMC commissioner Rajesh Patil said that the civic body is planning to conduct its largest sero survey since the pandemic struck, which will include 10,000 samples. The Pune municipal corporation (PMC) has conducted one Sero survey with a nominal sample size of 1,664 across five sub-wards in Pune.The PMC survey found that 51.5% of the samples tested positive for antibodies. PCMC conducted its first Sero survey in October 2020 and had a sample size of 5,000. “In view of the much anticipated third wave, we will conduct a Sero survey and profile the antibodies. This will include all areas under the civic body. It will mainly include children and younger adults,” Patil said. No sero survey in PMC, but parents urged to not miss regular immunisations for childrenWhen asked if the PMC is also planning a survey, additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal said, “We are not planning any such survey, but we had done a Sero survey along with NIV earlier, the results of which will be made public very soon.”While the 13-member paediatric task force in Pune has not suggested any survey, such sero surveys help understand the spread of infection and also future containment measures, said experts. Dr Aarti Kinikar, who heads the task force and is the head of the paediatric department at Sassoon General hospital, said, “From our observation, until now, we have found that very few children would need hospitalisation, medication or even ICU management. Most would probably need only home isolation. However, to ensure that we are well prepared, along with the beds and oxygen management, we are also working to make sure that the required medicines are stocked as children cannot be given the same medicine as adults.”“However, in case of multi-inflammatory syndrome (MISC) in children we do require expensive drugs like Intravenous immunoglobulin or Dexamethasone, in small quantities, as per the child’s weight. The central government has also made MISC a notifiable disease.” Experts on the panel also appealed to parents to ensure that children do not remain miss routine immunisations. Dr Sanjay Natu, president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP), Pune chapter, said, “All under the age of five must be vaccinated as per the state and central routine immunisation programme. Especially high risk children, which includes those suffering from malnutrition, congenital diseases, anaemia, obesity, heart disease, chronic ailments of kidney and liver, developmental problems, diabetes, blood pressure, blood related ailments, sickle cell anaemia, HIV and tuberculosis.”“While influenza is a seasonal vaccination programme which is mandatory for children under five, high-risk children aged above five can also get the seasonal flu vaccine. However, to be clear, influenza vaccine works only against the seasonal flu and cannot be correlated to the Covid19 infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pcmcs-second-sero-survey-to-include-children-101623695086288.html

The results will be out by Tuesday, a senior health official said.The new mutation is an addition to the already existing Delta variant (B.1.617.2), which was first discovered in India. However, officials also said that whether the new variant is different from the existing one in terms of symptoms is yet to be investigated. On Monday, during an online meeting, state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate, said, “We have got reports of possible Delta-plus variants in samples from Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri. However, it is yet to be investigated and studied further.” Earlier reports had confirmed six cases that tested positive for the Delta=plus variant. Awate also said Delta-plus (B.1.617.2.1) is an addition to the Delta variant (B.1.617.2).While it is still under investigation as to whether the mutation is more infectious or different from the existing variant, the official also said that CSIR and BJ Medical College are working on the cases. Over the phone to Hindustan Times, Dr Awate further added that an MoU has been signed between the state and CSIR to investigate the same. He said, “It is part of the same variant and it is an addition to the Delta variant. The final report will come on Tuesday. The samples have been sent to the CSIR lab. As of now we have sent samples from three districts, of which two are Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. It is too premature to talk about it as it is under investigation.” As of now Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri are reporting a higher positivity rate and an increasing weekly growth rate of 13.06 and 9.03%, respectively, from June 7-13. These districts also account for the top two districts with the highest percentage of active Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-samples-from-ratnagiri-sindhudurg-under-investigation-for-delta-plus-mutation-101623695085167.html

The daily death toll due to the disease was 16, according to the state health bulletin.Currently there are 130 active cases in the force of nearly 80,000 personnel. Almost 90% of police personnel have received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, while about 70% have received the second dose, officers said. Currently, four police personnel are admitted to hospitals, and 126 are in quarantine. Senior officers, who daily monitor the infection spike within the force, said in mid-April, the number of infections among the force was high because as front-line workers, policepersons were on the roads, outside hospitals and crematoriums, helping arrange oxygen supply for hospitals and ferrying the sick and the dead. A Covid-19 dashboard report of infections within the force shows that between April 1 and June 11, 40 police personnel died of the infection. Compared to that, only 37 police personnel had died in the first three waves of the infection in Delhi. The police’s Covid report shows that in March (before the fourth wave), only one or two personnel were contracting the infection daily. In fact, on March 13,14,15,17,18, and 29, there was not a single case in the force. The report shows that cases started to spike from April 2. By April 15, around 150 personnel were testing positive daily and it touched the 200-mark on April 19, and reached a peak of 275 on April 22. This was the week when the capital city was reporting a daily high of over 25,000 cases. The highest daily increase of 28,395 infections was reported on April 20, according to the state government’s health bulletin. Until April 28, the new cases reported from within the force remained above 200 a day after which it started declining gradually. But even until May third week, nearly 50 fresh cases were being reported daily, senior officers said. Between April 4 and May 31, a total of 6,058 police personnel contracted Covid-19. In comparison, only 7,725 personnel tested positive between March 2020 and March 31, 2021. “We did not have any fresh cases on Saturday and Sunday. Even in the last week of May, we were getting 20 to 30 new cases. This drop in cases is happening despite personnel being out on the roads, carrying out policing duties just like during the pre-Covid times. All of them have been directed to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. Because of the high rate of infection, the police brass had also started three Covid Care Centres for the policepersons. Separately, a team of senior officers were also formed to track each case and ensure that every Covid-19 patient within the force received proper medical care,” a senior police officer, privy to the data of the police’s Covid-19 report, said, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/zero-new-covid-cases-among-delhi-police-for-two-days-101623694307832.html

It said the high court will have to look into the order passed by the trial court and cannot take a superficial view.The court issued notice to Rohit Jha who had filed a suit contending that Jayalal was using the IMA’s platform to propagate Christianity and that he must be restrained from writing, speaking in media, or publishing any content which is defamatory to Hindu religion or ayurveda. The suit had alleged that Jayalal had started a defamatory campaign against the Hindu religion “by way of promoting Christianity, in the garb of proving superiority of allopathic medicines over ayurveda in treatment of Covid-19 patients”.On June 4, the trial court judge recorded in his order: “He shall not use the platform of IMA for propagating any religion and rather shall concentrate on welfare of the medical fraternity and progress in the medical field.” The court had held that there was no need to issue a judicial restraining order since Jayalal has undertaken not to indulge in activity offending any other religion. The order added that the IMA chief will not indulge in any activity contrary to the principles enshrined in the Constitution of India and shall maintain the dignity of the position chaired by him. Challenging the trial court’s order, advocate Tanmaya Mehta, representing Jayalal, claimed that the IMA chief never gave such an assurance to the trial court since he has not done anything wrong.He sought to stay the observations made against Jayalal in the trial court’s court order, saying they were affecting his reputation as he was heading a body which has 3.5 lakh doctors as its members.He contended that there was no television debate between Jayalal and yoga guru Ramdev and that he was not propagating any religion, including Christianity. He further said that the suit before the trial court was based on fake news.If anyone promotes allopathy, this does not mean that the person was asking for conversion into Christianity, the counsel said, adding that Jayalal was not against Ayurveda but against mixopathy. He said that Jayalal never uttered any remarks against Hinduism nor ever tried to forcefully convert any Indian of any religion into Christianity.“The act of appellant (Jayalal), if any, does not defame respondent/plaintiff (Jha) therein per se or cause any per se offence, causing per se injury. Accordingly, the suit claiming defamation against a class is not maintainable,” the appeal read.Warning Jayalal, the trial court had emphasised that any kind of unguarded or loose comment could not be expected from someone chairing a responsible post like his. “IMA is a prestigious institution...such a platform cannot be used to propagate an individual’s views on any religion,” it noted. The court cited a couplet by poet Mohd Iqbal - ‘Mazhab Nahi Sikhata Apas Mein Bair Rakhna; Hindi Hai Hum Watan Hai Hindustan Humara; Saare Jahan se Acha Hindustan Humara (Religion does not teach us to fight against each other. We are all Indians. Our India is the best.)’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-refuses-to-stay-order-restraining-ima-chief-from-using-his-post-to-propagate-any-religion-101623694305664.html

The state government on Sunday allowed one weekly market to open per day in each municipal zone. The national capital is divided into 12 municipal zones. “Weekly markets are prone to large crowds. They offer a wide range of products and the footfall comprises people across the demographic. These have to be put under strict surveillance,” said a senior official in the revenue department.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced that all shops will be allowed to operate through the week, restaurants may reopen for dine-in after nearly two months of closure, apart from allowing weekly markets to reopen.The revenue department has deployed 250 enforcement teams across all 11 districts in the city, said the official.Senior police officers also said the force has increased the number of personnel deployed on the ground, and will work closely with other agencies concerned, such as the local administrations and civic agencies to ensure the updated unlock norms and conditions are enforced properly.“Following the fresh guidelines, our primary focus will be on weekly markets, crowded markets, malls and restaurants. Personnel will visit these places to ensure shopkeepers and restaurant staff ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed and carry out instructions such as making provision for sanitisers, maintaining distancing and wearing masks. Shops and restaurants can stay open only for the designated timings. Action as per law will be taken against violators. We will continue with our awareness campaigns as well,” said deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena.Officers said they have held meetings with trader associations and the managements of religious places, which have been allowed to open, but without visitors. “The onus of implementing the guidelines will be on these associations, and the police will assist them however possible,” said DCP (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-revenue-dept-to-scale-up-enforcement-of-delhi-s-new-lockdown-norms-101623694245137.html

Their vaccination began on May 1, after which the vaccination drive remained suspended for several days. But even after the vaccination drive remaining open for such a limited time, 20% of the youth of Delhi have been vaccinated. This shows that the youth want to get vaccinated,” said AAP legislator Atishi in a press statement on Monday.She further said several government-run vaccine centres for the 18-45 age group are likely to remain suspended from Tuesday because of a shortage of Covishield vaccine.The health bulletin said government-run centres in the city have 11 days’ Covaxin stock and 24 days’ Covishield stock for the 45+ group, but only two days’ Covaxin stock and less than a day’s Covishield stock for the 18-45 age group.In the 18-45 group, around 1.37 million have got at least one dose of the vaccine and around 99,000 have got both doses of the vaccine (Covaxin). In the 45+ group, around 2.6 million have got at least one dose of the vaccine and 900,000 have got both doses, government records showed.VACCINATION DRIVEDelhi’s environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday inspected a vaccine centre in his assembly constituency Babarpur, endorsing the government’s “Jahan vote, wahan vaccination” drive which aims to boost vaccine coverage in the 45+ group by engaging booth level officers in door-to-door drives and setting up temporary vaccine centres in polling booths across the city.“The drive has so far been successful. Vaccine is the only way to protect the masses against Covid-19. We want to vaccinate a large number of people in the four-week drive,” said Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/around-1-37-million-in-18-45-age-group-received-at-least-one-vaccine-dose-in-delhi-says-govt-101623694185086.html

The board had said it has sensitised all paper setters to ensure that the question paper does not have any question with casteist and religious undertones.The board had issued a notice after media reported about the alleged question in which it said that it was an “inadvertent error”.It had clarified that the procedure of paper setting was highly confidential and secretive in nature and the contents of the paper are not shared with the board officials and are revealed for the very first time before the candidates only.However, Gautam filed another complaint on August 19, 2019, against DSSSB chairman and other erring police officials alleging the incident was repeated again.In the second complaint, he claimed that a caste-based question was again asked in the exam conducted by the DSSSB for the primary teachers’ recruitment examination on August 18, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-upholds-order-to-lodge-fir-over-caste-based-question-in-dsssb-exam-101623694126888.html

The plea sought appropriate directions to the jail superintendent to look into the matter.On Monday, the prison authorities opposed the plea and said the injuries were self-inflicted, said Qausar Khan, appearing for Zafar. She said the court, in order to verify the stand, sought the CCTV footage from the jail.Zafar was arrested along with nine others in December 2018 after NIA carried out searches, in coordination with the special cell of Delhi Police and the anti-terrorism squad of Uttar Pradesh Police, at six places in Jafrabad and Seelampur in Delhi, and 11 places in Uttar Pradesh.The searches and the arrests came a month before the Republic Day celebrations on January 26.According to NIA, a locally made rocket launcher, materials for suicide vests and 112 alarm clocks to be used as timers were recovered from the searches.

The death reference as well as appeal of Singh against the capital punishment awarded to him is also pending in the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/court-seeks-police-report-on-plea-by-1984-riots-case-convict-seeking-90-day-parole-101623694126264.html

However, till date, only four private hospitals in Odisha have been able to procure vaccines directly from the manufacturers,” said Mohapatra.“In Odisha, the presence of private hospitals is very low and limited to only about five per cent of the total health care sector in the state. Hence, it is apprehended that as per the existing guidelines, Odisha will lose out on its proportionate share of 25 per cent allocation of vaccines to the private sector.”Last week, PM Modi announced that from June 21, the Centre will provide Covid-19 vaccines to all states. Modi said the government will procure 75 per cent of all vaccines produced in India and supply them to adults free of cost while private hospitals can procure the rest 25 per cent and administer those at a price fixed by the Centre. The central government fixed the price of the Covishield vaccine at ₹780, Covaxin at ₹1,410, and Sputnik V at ₹1,145. It also capped the service charge of vaccines administered by private hospitals at ₹150.Till Monday evening, Odisha had administered 8.94 million doses of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines to beneficiaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-urges-centre-to-change-vaccine-ratio-for-govt-pvt-hospitals-101623693705708.html

Athletes, sportsmen, and staff accompanying the Indian contingent for the Olympics in Tokyo can also get themselves vaccinated at this centre.As per the government guidelines, the time gap between two vaccine doses for international travellers will be 28 days, instead of 84 days.“Students and citizens undertaking international travels for education, job, or the 2020 Summer Olympics till August 31, 2021, can visit the Sector 31 polyclinic for their second dose (after 28 days from the first dose only) of Covishield from Tuesday (June 14). There are 100 slots for the second dose of Covishield, on a first-come-first-serve basis,” said Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer (DIO).The recommended time interval between the two doses of Covishield is 84 days.People who want to get themselves vaccinated at this centre will have to carry their passports, relevant travel documents, and provisional certificate of the first dose of vaccination. In cases, where the first dose was administered with an alternative ID proof, people will be given a separate annexure authorising the linkage of their passports and vaccination certificates.According to Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), the special vaccination camp has been set up to ease the vaccination process for international travellers, following the government guidelines.Dinesh Munjal, a resident of Essel Towers in Sector 28, said that his son needs the second dose before leaving for the USA on a work visa. “There hasn’t been any clarity on the time interval between the two doses. Since lockdown restrictions are being gradually lifted, my son has to go back to his office in the USA. It is not possible for him to wait for the next 84 days to get vaccinated.”Meanwhile, at least 14,959 doses — 5,472 doses in government health centres, and 9,487 in private facilities — were administered to people on Monday. Out of the overall coverage, over 12,269 were in the 18-45 age group, while 2,381 were above 45 years.

14-06-2021||Gurugram||Khori residents continue protests||Over a 100 women residents of Khori village in Faridabad’s Aravallis continued their protest on Monday, demanding rehabilitation before eviction from the area, as the administration prepares for a demolition drive. Residents said that demolishing their houses without rehabilitating them during the pandemic is “similar to a death sentence” for them. A protester, who did not wish to be named, said, “My husband works as a labourer, and he has not had steady income for the past one and half years. Because we all live together here, my family has been able to survive by taking help from each other, now if our houses are demolished, we don’t know how we will survive.” Nirmal Gorana, general secretary, Bandhu Mukti Morcha, an organisation that is taking up the cause of the residents, said, “The Supreme Court has ordered eviction, but the government should follow the order in a planned manner and not put the villagers on the clock, who are already standing on the last rung of the society. It will be an injustice if they are not provided proper rehabilitation.” On June 7, the Supreme Court ordered the eviction of thousands of slum dwellers encroaching on the Aravalli forest area in Faridabad district, holding that there cannot be a compromise or concession on forest land. The Faridabad police, in a statement released on Monday, said that they are fully prepared to conduct the demolition drive while maintaining law and order. According to the statement, Anshu Singla, the deputy commissioner of police (NIT), said, “The police administration is fully alert so that the law and order situation is not disturbed in any manner during removal of encroachment in Khori village.” Giving instructions to police personnel on Monday, Singla said that during the demolition drive, all police personnel will be deployed with anti-riot equipment to overcome any kind of situation and action will be taken against those creating chaos. Officials from the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad said that the demolition drive will be conducted within six weeks, as stipulated by the Supreme Court. Garima Mittal, commissioner, Municipal Corporation of Faridabad, said, “The district administration, police and MCF are working in coordination. The Supreme Court’s orders will be strictly followed, and encroachments will be removed within the six weeks given by the court. The final details of removing encroachments are being discussed internally and we will take action soon.” The MCF was scheduled to conduct the demolition drive from June 15-18. However, the commissioner did not confirm this on Monday. Last Wednesday, the MCF had requested the district administration to provide 2,000 constables, including 500 women constables, for the demolition drive from June 15-18. Meanwhile, environmentalists are demanding that all encroachment must be demolished, and not just houses in Khori village. Environmentalists said that the human cost per acre of reclaiming Aravalli land from commercial enterprises will be negligible (as the properties are not inhabited) compared to a village like Khori, where over 100,000 people will be displaced. Chetan Aggarwal, a city-based environmentalist said, “Khori has about 10,000 houses on 100-odd acres. If each house has six people, that means 600 people per acre. The human cost of reclaiming Aravalli land from real estate here is the displacement of about 600 people per acre. Whereas, other nearby villages, like Mewla, Ankhir and Anangpur, have more than a hundred farmhouses running commercial enterprises or religiopolitical enterprises. There are hardly any people living there and the human cost per acre of reclaiming Aravalli forests in these hill areas will be negligible.”“If encroachments are to be removed, then it should be done for the whole of Aravallis and not just one village where the poor people are trying to survive in small plots of land,” said Agarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/khori-residents-continue-protests-101623693346098.html
14-06-2021||Gurugram||7 Faridabad cops booked for allegedly assaulting 24-yr-old, who later died||The Nuh police booked seven Faridabad policemen on Sunday for allegedly assaulting a 24-year-old man, suspected to be involved in a fraud case, who later died.The family of the victim, identified as Junaid, alleged that no case was registered against him, but a cybercrime cell team of the Faridabad police kept him in custody overnight on May 31 and assaulted him, before he was released on June 1. Junaid, who was a resident of Nuh’s Bichhor, died on June 11.Following the incident, villagers and family members of Junaid protested on the road near Bichhor village on Saturday. Some protesters allegedly pelted stones at police personnel and torched a police vehicle, following which eight persons were arrested and 200 others were booked, said the Nuh police.Faridabad police commissioner OP Singh said on Monday that allegations that “a cyber police team killed Junaid in a fraud case were baseless”. Singh, however, said that the allegations were being investigated, and action will be taken against those found guilty.Junaid’s father, Hassan, alleged, “He had multiple injuries all over his body when he returned home after being released from police custody, and he had been complaining of acute pain since then. We took him to a local doctor, who had asked us to admit him to a private hospital. Junaid died while we were on the way to a Hodal hospital on June 11.”The victim’s family had approached the sub-divisional magistrate, and got a medical test done to ascertain the nature of his injuries. Hassan says they have “enough evidence and recordings of the policemen who had demanded money from them to release Junaid.“We had paid the police the amount demanded (which wasn’t disclosed) within a few hours, but they still assaulted and tortured him. They had called me, and I have a recording of the call where they could be heard threatening us,” Hassan added.A case under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 302 (murder), and 34 (common intention) has been registered against two sub-inspectors, two assistant sub-inspectors, two head constables, and Faridabad station house officer (SHO) at the Bichhor police station on Sunday.Narender Bijarnia, superintendent of police, Nuh, said that the post-mortem report is not clear, and they have sent the victim’s viscera to a laboratory to check the cause of death. “Junaid’s two brothers and other relatives were involved in multiple fraud cases. We have recorded their statements and an investigation is underway. The Faridabad police is yet to take any action against the police personnel who were booked,” Bijarnia said.Meanwhile, Basant Kumar, SHO of cybercrime police station in Faridabad, said that they had received a tip-off on May 31 about Junaid, his brothers Azad and Irshad, and others identified as Shahid, Parvej, Wasim, Asif, and Nadeem being involved in multiple fraud cases. Following this, the police picked up Junaid, Shahid, Parvej, Wasim, Asif, and Nadeem from Bichhor in Punahana, while they were returning from a wedding ceremony in Rajasthan.“Junaid, his two brothers, and other relatives were involved in multiple fraud cases. However, only Shahid was arrested. Junaid and others’ names were not mentioned in any of the FIRs, and we released five of them on June 1,” Kumar said, adding that the police could not be held responsible for a death that took place 10 days after the interrogation.Police found out during investigation that a man named Issar, also referred to as “chairman”, had allegedly taken money from Junaid’s father for police assistance. However, when it didn’t materialise, he started levelling allegations against the police. “He claimed that he has evidence, and will produce those before the police on Monday, but we didn’t receive any evidence yet. They planned all these to ensure that no raids are being conducted in their area,” said the Faridabad police commissioner.OP Singh added that they are investigating the matter, but the allegations seem to be baseless. “There are 412 cases registered against suspects from the Bichhor area, for duping people of ₹2.5 crore. We arrested two more persons, who were related to Junaid, in similar cases on June 3. They were involved in OLX and Paytm frauds,” he said, adding that they are taking legal opinion in the case registered against the policemen.“Junaid had kidney issues and was handed over to his relatives in presence of an assistant sub-inspector. On further investigation, Junaid’s brothers and Asgar were arrested two days later,” OP Singh said.There are CCTV cameras installed at the cyber police station, and police have scanned the footage. The police team had no physical contact with Junaid, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/7-faridabad-cops-booked-for-allegedly-assaulting-24-yr-old-who-later-died-101623693287492.html
14-06-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram crime: Six snatching incidents reported on Sunday||At least six incidents of snatching were reported from across the city on Sunday, with victims in all instances suffering injuries due to a sudden and forceful attack, the police said. Multiple gangs were responsible for the incidents as they took place between 6.45am and 11pm.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police, said that four teams have been formed to arrest the suspects who snatched gold chains and cash from six victims, five of whom were women. “We have arrested three suspects in the last two days involved in snatching cases and are questioning them to get more details. They had targeted more than 30 women this month,” he said. According to police data, at least 102 cases of chain snatching were reported across the city till June 13 this year. Despite the lockdown in May and June, the city has witnessed a rise in street crimes, the police said. In the first incident, around 6.50am on Sunday, a 40-year-old woman was walking with her husband on the footpath of Sispal Vihar’s Gate 2 in Sector 49. “A man came and attacked me and snatched my gold chain and ran towards the other side of the road where his friend was waiting for him on a motorbike. I didn’t notice the details of the motorbike as I was in shock,” the woman said. In the second incident, the chain snatchers fled with a gold chain belonging to a 33-year-old man, who registered a complaint at the Sector 56 police station. “I was walking near the W Pratiksha Hospital around 7.40am when one of the bike-borne robbers walked towards me and asked me for an address. He suddenly hit me, snatched my gold chain and fled with his partner towards the main road,” said Kapil Kumar a resident of Sector 56. In the third case, a woman was attacked by a man who snatched her purse and gold chain while she was waiting for her husband outside a bank around 11am on Sunday. “I had gone to withdraw money from an ATM in the main market.

14-06-2021||Gurugram||Lockdown eased: Gurugram markets receive moderate footfall||Markets across the city witnessed moderate footfall on Monday, a day after the Haryana government eased the lockdown restrictions, allowing all shops to open instead of operating on an odd-even basis. Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, on Sunday, issued an order on extending the Mahamari Alert Surakshit Haryana till June 21, with relaxations issued for various categories. While shops were allowed to open from 9am to 8pm, the state government has allowed gymnasiums to reopen as part of the unlocking process, albeit with a 50% capacity, from 6am to 8pm. Parks were also opened from 5am till 8pm. The Sadar market in old Gurugram witnessed moderate footfall on Monday, with the association members saying it will take a couple of months after lifting of restrictions for the situation to normalise. Bablu Gupta, the president of Sadar market association, said, “Footfall remained low as a large percentage of industrial workers and other staff have left for their home towns due to Covid-19 infection and lockdown. It will take at least two months for the entire market to resume its normal functioning, even as the administration has eased the lockdown restriction, allowing shops to open from 9am to 8pm. Other factors like a limitation on weddings and social gatherings will also affect the overall turnout in marketplaces.” Even shops at the Vyapar Kendra market witnessed a low turnout, according to the market association. “People were already coming to the market when shops were running on an odd-even basis. There has been no major change since then. There is still a fear among people due to Covid-19, therefore, the footfall has been low,” said Tej Singh, the president of Vyapar Kendra market association. Harinder Rana, the president of Palam Vihar market association, held a similar view. “It is during the evening hours when footfall is high, but due to Covid-19, people are visiting the market to get items of basic needs.” The footfall at shopping malls, however, increased in the last one week, according to mall associations. “Malls were permitted to open from May 31 onwards for a limited time duration of 10am to 3pm. Last week, the timeline was extended till 8pm. Since then, the turnout at the mall increased by almost 40% compared to the first week of June,” said Aman Bajaj, member, MGF Metropolitan Mall Association. Likewise, gymnasiums that opened on Monday noticed a heavy footfall. Aakash Bhati, the owner of Foxx Gym in Sector 10, said, “More than 60 people reached the centre during morning hours. In the evening hours, however, there were not many people. It is likely more people will come to the gym in the next few days.” Anand Maina, the owner of Zink fitness studio in Sector 28, said that they will reopen the facility only after complete sanitisation. “The gym will be operational from June 16 onwards, only after complete planning. Our customers will use the facility based on the appointments made by them a day before. It will help us in managing the crowd and maintaining social distancing norms.” To ensure the enforcement of the lockdown curbs, police barricades were placed at the entry and exit gates of popular markets, to manage traffic movement and law and order.Nitish Tripathi, 33, who stepped out of his Sector 56 residence almost after a month, said, “Covid-19 cases have declined but there is a fear of contracting the disease. Since it was important to take out my car for servicing along with buying other items of daily needs, I had to move out following all precautionary norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/lockdown-eased-gurugram-markets-receive-moderate-footfall-101623693286345.html

It has to pass through both the houses of the Parliament and then to the Assembly. If the opposition leader from the BJP wants to bring a new rule, he can ask the central government since they are in power,” Banerjee was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier in the day, 50 MLAs of the BJP met West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and submitted a memorandum over the incidents of violence following the West Bengal elections. “Being the constitutional head of the state, let me make it clear that anti-defection law is applicable in full force in Bengal. It is as much applicable here as in other parts of the country,” Dhankar said. He also said that there is an atmosphere of fear in the state.Speculations arose after the Trinamool Congress (TMC) asked the BJP about the rest of the 24 MLAs who were not present at Adhikari’s meeting with the Bengal governor. Reports of other leaders who had left the TMC to join the BJP ahead of polls returning to TMC surfaced following Mukul Roy’s return to the TMC.“Where are the 25 missing MLAs? Let him first talk about issuing anti-defection laws against them. Suvendu Adhikari needs to take care of his own MLAs now after which he can talk about others,” Sudip Banerjee further added.“Todna-jodna is part of Trinamool Congress’ politics. They have been doing this for the past 10 years and it went unopposed, but it is being opposed now and action will be taken under the anti-defection law,” Suvendu said after his meeting with Dhankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/where-are-your-25-mlas-tmc-mp-banerjee-asks-bjp-s-suvendu-adhikari-101623692641542.html

In an order, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said civic and government agencies having control over markets, storage and marketing facilities of soaps and detergents will be tasked with ensuring that the order is thoroughly followed. The enforcement teams have also been asked to submit monthly action taken reports. “...Agencies shall ensure compliance of directions through strict vigil and surprise checks on such establishments...Non compliance will attract penal action under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act,” the DPCC order read. In January, the National Green Tribunal accepted recommendations of a two-member expert panel that suggested that the Delhi government issue orders “prohibiting sale, storage and transportation and marketing of detergents that do not conform to the revised BIS standards”. The NGT had also directed to launch awareness campaigns about the harmful effect of using substandard soaps and detergents. “All the authorities concerned, including local bodies, civil supplies department and district administrations having control over shops and other establishments dealing with sale, storage, transportation and marketing facilities for soaps and detergents in Delhi should ensure the compliance of directions through strict vigil and surprise checks,” the DPCC said in the order. “Indiscriminate use of soaps and detergents not conforming to BIS standards has been identified as one of the contributors to the deteriorating water quality of River Yamuna. There is probability of use of non-permissible chemical substances in the manufacture of soaps and detergents not conforming to BIS standards, which may cause harm to aquatic life, river water quality, animals as well as human beings dependent on river water,” the order read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-bans-soaps-and-detergents-that-pollute-the-yamuna-101623692084997.html

14-06-2021||Mumbai||#MeToo case against Mumbai principal: Panel orders action against college, cops||The Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission (MSHRC) has held KJ Somaiya College of Science and Commerce and the Mumbai Police responsible for the “grave injustice” done to two professors allegedly sexually harassed by a former principal of the college.The MSHRC has granted compensation of ₹5 lakh each to both the survivors, ordering that the amount be recovered from the erring police officers of Tilak Nagar and Juhu police stations for blatant dereliction of duties. The commission has also ordered departmental inquiries against the police officers. MA Sayeed, judicial member and acting chairperson of MSHRC, passed the order on April 26, a day before his retirement. But a copy of the order was made available to the survivors only on Monday, June 14. The accused, Dr Rajpal Hande, died on September 3, 2020.The commission in its order recommended that the vice-chancellor of Mumbai University (MU) to consider initiating necessary action against the erring management of KJ Somaiya College for having committed serious lapses in turning a blind eye towards the grievances of the professors. One of the complainants, a Nagpur-based professor, who fought for justice for more than 14 long years, is a wildlife scientist with several national and international awards for wildlife and environment conservation. She had alleged in January 2004, the then principal of K J Somaiya College of Science and Commerce, Hande, showed her a cassette tape with a suggestive cover picture of Khajuraho temple. At one instance, Hande allegedly held the professor’s shoulder from behind and when she resisted, he told her “I am treating you like my girlfriend.” As per her complaint, Hande allegedly sexually harassed her on multiple occasions between 2004 and 2007, when he was principal of the college. She first complained about the harassment in 2007, but the Tilak Nagar police registered a first information report (FIR) only in 2018 after she wrote to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on September 23, 2017. She said that the police, however, took action in her case in January 2020, only after she approached the state human rights commission in March 2019.After the first FIR was registered on Hande, another professor, a psychologist, alleged that Hande misbehaved with her at a conference held by the Bombay Psychological Association in 2016 at Mithibai College. After no action was taken by the college, she filed a complaint against him at Juhu police station on February 10, 2019, alleging sexual harassment.The Nagpur-based professor said that she lost her job after she complained against Hande to various authorities, including the MU and the women’s rights commission. The college dismissed her on the charges of “defaming” the principal and the college.The commission in its order observed that neither the [college] management, nor the police rose to the occasion, to extend and protect dignity and honour of the ladies, holding important positions in the society and they had to virtually wage a war for vindication of their rights. No plausible justification or explanation came to be submitted on record by either the police, as to why no prompt and immediate action was taken by them on receipt of victim’s report of sexual exploitation by the alleged culprit. These are the grey areas, which has not been explained or attempted to be justified by cogent and plausibile material. The commission also observed that it was pertinent to note that despite the reports making out a cognisable case, the concerned police took their own sweet time in registering an offence against the culprit.The investigation wing of the commission found that the complainant professor had filed 103 oral and written complaints against Hande with the management of KJ Somaiya College, but no action was taken by the college. Instead, the college management supported Hande by issuing a warning to the professor. College in-charge Samir Somaiya, secretary V Ranganathan and female member Patricia Gokhale, had knowledge of the entire matter, but they did not take cognisance of it, it said.“If they would have acted on time, then the victim professor’s sexual, financial and mental harassment could have been averted; the investigation wing of the commission found facts in this claim of the victim and feels it is important that police inspector Savita Chavan, the investigation officer of the case, must thoroughly probe the case to ascertain the involvement of the college management in the matter,” the order read. The commission’s investigators also found that the MU tribunal in its 2014 verdict pointed out that Hande, Somaiya college and MP Sadekar, the inquiry officer appointed by the college, in connivance with each other, sacked the professor. But, the police failed to take note of this.It was also found that the KJ Somaiya college administration on being asked, responded to the police that in the college’s records they found no complaints of any irregularities against the professor.“The incident and later, the struggle to get justice, have shattered my life. For many years, I had gone through tremendous mental and financial stress. After the commission’s validation of my complaint, the police should now book the police on charges of abetment, conspiracy, common intention for helping Hande. I have now written to the charity commissioner requesting strict action on Somaiya Trust by cancelling the registration of Somaiya Trust under section of 12 D of Society Act 1860 where the Trustee supported the accused person and encouraged him for serious and heinous crime of sexual harassment,” the survivor told HT.The spokesperson for the Somaiya Group, said, “As we haven’t received any order or communication from the state human rights commission it would not be appropriate to comment on the matter. “When asked what action will be taken against the erring police officers, DCP (zone 6) Krishnakant Upadhyay and DCP (zone 9) Abhishekh Trimukhe, said they haven’t received the commission’s order yet and won’t be able to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/metoo-case-against-mumbai-principal-panel-orders-action-against-college-cops-101623690644914.html

State chief wildlife warden Rajiv Ranjan said, “Pug mark of a tigress was found at Kisko block of Lohardaga district on May 25. Forest extension of this district touches the PTR forest. So, we are suspecting the tigress may have travelled to Lohardaga from PTR.”When asked if the pug mark will be sent to Dehradun’s Wildlife Institute of India (WII) for confirmation, Ranjan said, “There is no need to send it to WII, as we have the expertise to identify if it of a tiger’s or not. On the basis of our examination, we can certainly say it is a tigress.”In a bid to collect more concrete evidence, the forest department has provided 10 trap cameras to Lohardaga forest division and asked PTR officials to install cameras on possible routes. “We have also installed cameras at spots where cattle were killed in Lohardaga. However, no image has not been captured till now. We have also deputed teams to track pug marks of the tigress.”Residents of Salaiya Panchayat under Kisko block in Lohardaga found intermittent killing of their cattle in the last week of May. They claimed that around five cattle were killed in past one month by big cats. Following the complaints, the forest department sent a team to the village for inspection, which found the tigress’ pug mark, Lohardaga divisional forest officer (DFO) Arvind Kumar said.DFO (buffer area) of PTR, Mukesh Kumar, who led the team, said, “We interrogated the person, who claimed to have seen the tiger. According to his statement, it was understood that he knew the difference between a leopard and a tiger.”The pug mark was four inches long and rectangular in shape, indicating that it was of a tigress, the official said. “Size of a leopard’s pug mark is three inches,” Kumar said.The development has raised hopes among officials and wildlife lovers about presence of tigers in the “tiger-less” reserve.The All India Tiger Estimation (AITE) in its 2018 report did not record a single tiger in the reserve, spread over 1129.93 square kilometres. However, an elderly tigress was found dead in the reserve on February 15 last year reportedly following clash with a bison. “The reserve has presence of tigers for sure. It is our fault that we are not able to reach them because of many reasons including dense forest, vast spread and some limitations due to presence of left-wing extremists. The next tiger census is scheduled in 2022. We will try to cover the census properly this time,” said the chief wildlife warden.Meanwhile, the reserve authorities recently concluded an animal assessment drive in PTR. Officials said the details of the assessment are expected in a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/evidence-of-tiger-s-presence-found-near-ptr-after-15-months-101623687526455.html

It has also started Head On Generation (HOG) technology in 38 trains, achieving saving of 4,256 litres of diesel per hour that translates into saving ₹3,40,480 per hour. “About 500 acres of vacant land along railway track as well as settlements under SER jurisdiction has been identified for installation of 201MW capacity solar plant. By consuming solar energy as alternative source of energy, SER has saved ₹33.6 lakh in 2019-20 and ₹39 lakh in 2020-21 from regular energy bill,” Manish Kumar Pathak, Chakradharpur senior divisional commercial manager (Sr DCM), said.Under HOG system in train operation, electrical power is fed to coaches directly from Over Head Equipment (OHE) through electric locomotive for functioning of Coach AC, fans, lights etc. “This is resulting in savings of 112 litres of diesel or ₹8,960 per train per hour. Under SER, a total of 38 trains are moving on HOG system, that has helped to reduce fuel cost amounting to ₹3, 40, 480 per hour and also reduction of huge amount of carbon emission,” said Pathak. Till now, SER has installed altogether 2.306 MW solar plants at its buildings and four railway divisions- Kharagpur, Adra, Chakradharpur and Ranchi.Work is also under process for installation of another 18.94 MW capacity roof top solar plant under SER jurisdiction, Pathak said, adding that SER has also replaced conventional light fittings by energy efficient LED lights in all its 363 stations and other railway establishments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ser-to-set-up-201mw-solar-plant-101623687527109.html

The move came owing to sharp fall in Covid-19 cases in the district, officials said on Monday. Around 30 private doctors were deployed at different Covid-19 care centres in the district when cases peaked this April. Dhanbad registered only four new cases in last 24 hours till Sunday night, while no death was registered in last three days, according to the health department’s Covid-19 bulletin.Deputy commissioner (DC) cum DDM chairman Umashankar Singh said, “It has been decided to release private doctors deployed at ICU and non-ICU of Sadar hospital, Shahid Nirmal Mahto Medical College (SNMMCH) PG Block Covid care centre and Dhanbad Railway station from Tuesday.”However, these private doctors can be called for their services again in the future if required, the DC said.Besides private doctors, it was also directed to release all private ambulances deployed at all 10 blocks, railway stations, and bus stations for taking positive patients to Covid care centres, the DC said. However, he has directed to deploy 108 ambulance at all blocks.Meanwhile, the DDM also disallowed home isolation facility and sent infected patients to Sadar Hospital for early recovery as all beds were vacant. “Eight private doctors were deployed here; their relieving will not impact services as the hospital has enough medical staff,” Sadar Hospital nodal officer Dr Rajkumar said.SNMMCH Covid care centre in-charge Dr ( Prof) DP Bhushan also said that since number of cases have reduced, there was no need of additional doctors at the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/private-docs-released-from-covid-duty-in-dhanbad-101623687525719.html

Most states in the country have relatively high weekly positivity rate and hence influx of passengers from other states may pose a risk of increase in Covid-19 infection in our state,” the acting health secretary said in his letter dated June 12.He, therefore, directed to shift all Covid-19 patients to Covid-19 care centres. “No home isolation shall be granted to them,” he said.However, the DCs can create exception for people depending upon the situation. “The DCs may take a decision for authorization of home isolation only on case to case basis after due application of mind, fully satisfying themselves about the justification for such permission and taking into account concerns for public health and infection control in the districts.”According to Singh, shifting patients from home isolation to facility isolation will most likely discourage many super spreaders from travel. It will also lead to better treatment of such patients and keep Covid-19 facilities ready as well as prepare for any eventuality in the near future, he saidPermanent RAT booths at airports, railway stations, bus terminalsIn yet another direction, the health department asked the DCs to set up permanent rapid antigen test (RAT) booths at all airports, railway stations and bus terminals. The booths should function round-the-clock to screen people arriving from other states, the department directed.It also asked the DCs to depute police force, along with a magistrate, at every booth for providing adequate assistance to testing teams, besides stressing on providing adequate RAT kits to these booths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/state-bans-home-isolation-for-covid-19-patients-101623687524760.html

City Improvement Committee president Anand Rithe said, “The PMC got various flats in different schemes which it has allocated to the project affected people. Mainly those who lost their homes in road widening and other PMC owned projects would be allocated these flats. PMC charges ₹450 nominal rent to them. This scheme started from 1991-92.” These flats have been used by these people for the last many years, but the PMC is not getting enough rent from them. Considering this, the civic body has decided to sell the flats to the renters of these 1,512 flats. Rithe said, “It is a win-win situation as these people would get ownership for their homes and PMC will receive onetime revenue. As per the PMC survey, the price of these flats is between Rs12 lakh to Rs15 lakh as per ready reckoner rates.” The city improvement committee approved this proposal and now it would get forward to the standing committee for approval. Once the standing would approve it, the final permission will be granted from the general body. PMC standing committee chief Hemant Rasne proposed this scheme to sell PMC owned flats to generate more revenue. There are different views on this proposal. Some people are of the view that PMC cannot sell out these flats. Now as the city improvement committee approved this proposal, again there would be discussion on this proposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/city-improvement-committee-approves-selling-of-pmc-owned-flats-101623687464751.html

CBI sources said they had not closed the case even as kin rued no real progress had been made. “Neither have other agencies investigating his death, such as the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), arrived at any conclusion,” said Rajput’s sister Nilu Singh. Rajput’s father KK Singh had filed a case against the actor’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty the Rajiv Nagar police station in Patna, accusing her of taking his money and driving him to suicide. The investigations soon became mired in a series of controversies, including a stand-off between Bihar and Mumbai Police. Later, the Bihar government transferred the case to the CBI. On August 6, 2020, the CBI registered an FIR against Chakraborty and others and started a probe. “We are investigating all possible angles,” said a senior CBI officer, requesting anonymity.

14-06-2021||Patna||Bihar: Death certificates mum on cause, ex gratia a far cry for kin of Covid dead||Death certificates of Covid-19 victims do not mention on it the cause of death, causing difficulty to family members in claiming government compensation. Bihar offers ₹4 lakh ex-gratia to the next of kin of a Covid-19 deceased through the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. To get this compensation, there is a lot of paper work involved, and irrefutable evidence of Covid-19 death being just the first prerequisite. With no mention about the cause of death on form 6 of the death certificate, issued by the department of planning and development, government of Bihar, relatives have to append Covid-19 positive test report along with the patient’s death summary in case of institutional death. “A mere mention in the remarks column of the death certificate that the deceased was Covid-19 positive would have sufficed and dispensed with the requirement of a Covid-19 report as well as patient’s death summary in case of hospital deaths,” said Rajeev Ranjan, a resident of Danapur. Rajeev had played a proactive role in helping his neighbour Shukla Sengupta get the government compensation of ₹4 lakh for her husband Sujit Krishna Sengupta, who died of Covid-19 last year. Sengupta has two daughters, one in Pune, and the other in Patna, who is suffering from a genetic disorder. Rajeev had to make several rounds of government offices before the septuagenarian widow could get the government cheque. “Sujit tested positive at Patna Medial College Hospital (PMCH) where he was initially admitted. He suffered a fall at the hospital and fractured his hip bone, after which the hospital referred him to a higher centre. His family then moved him to another hospital, which misplaced his Covid-19 test report. I had a tough time to convince the clerks in government offices that Sujit uncle died of Covid-19,” he recollects. This is not an isolated case. Ishani Lal (27), Stuti Lal (25), Aastha Lal (20), residents of Hanuman Nagar locality in Patna’s Kankerbagh, have lost their parents. While their father Anupam Kumar died a few years back, mother, Vibha Baxi, 49, succumbed to Covid-19 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on April 27. The daughters are now struggling with paper work, as the death certificate issued by AIIMS does not mention Covid-19 as the cause of death. Worse, the institution has misspelt their mother’s name in the death summary. Correcting it is taking them some effort and time. “Neither has any of the three daughters nor I received any call from the government either to enquire about the delay in submission of claim or to guide us and facilitate the payment of compensation,” said Vishal Baxi, who got his elder sister admitted to AIIMS. Most government medical colleges, which are authorised to issue death certificates on form 6 to relatives, said there was no provision to mention the cause of death on it. “We do not write the cause of death on the death certificate issued to the relative, as the format is fixed by the government and there is no column to mention the cause of death on it,” said Dr Binod Kumar Singh, medical superintendent of the Nalanda Medical College Hospital. Additional professor, forensic medicine and toxicology department of AIIMS-Patna, Dr Amit Patil, said doctors were supposed to mention Covid-19 as a cause of death in form 4, which is the medical certificate for cause of death. “Doctors have to mention cause of death in the death certificate according to the international classification of disease. The WHO has given code U07.1 for Covid-19 disease. Relatives of patients have the right to access form 4 along with form 6, generally given to them as the death certificate,” said Dr Patil. Mahesh Prasad, additional district registrar of births and death in Patna, said death certificates given to relatives were not supposed to mention cause of death on it. “The format of death certificate is fixed and there is no provision to mention the cause of death in it. The data uploaded on the national portal of births and deaths, on the basis of information furnished by doctors in form 4, does mention the cause of death in it, but the certificate given to relatives does not capture it for confidentiality reasons. Any change in it has to be done as per the guidelines of the Registrar General of India,” Prasad said. Meanwhile, considering the issues in compensation, the state government has decided to take up the issue with the Centre. “We will take up the issue with the Centre and request it to mention the cause of death on the death certificate given to relatives,” said Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar’s additional chief secretary, health. Of the 9,429 Covid-19 deaths in Bihar, as on June 9, the state government had released ex gratia funds for 3,737 Covid-19 victims so far of which around 2,000 had been paid till then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-death-certificates-mum-on-cause-ex-gratia-a-far-cry-for-kin-of-covid-dead-101623687226827.html

Chaudhary said educational institutions would be reopened in a phased manner, with resumption of secondary classes followed by higher and primary classes.“If Covid-19 situation improves in the state, educational institutions are likely to be reopened next month following Covid-19 safety protocols. Students, especially the younger lot, are facing academic loss due to closure of schools,” he said. Chaudhary also conceded there was a huge digital divide among students in the state. “Amid closure of schools, we resorted to online classes through various platforms including Doordarshan, e-lots application etc. However, online classes cannot replace traditional classroom teaching. A large number of students are deprived of online classes as they don’t have access to mobile and internet. We have urged the Centre to provide digital devices to students under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan to minimise the gap,” he said. The education department is also set to introduce catch-up course for compensating the academic losses. Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary of education department, said the final decision regarding reopening of educational institutions would be taken after meeting with all stakeholders. “We have designed catch-up course for classes 2 to 10 to compensate the learning loss due after the pandemic triggered closure of schools last year. Earlier, we intended to launch the bridge course in April but we had to put off the plan owing to lockdown and shutdown of schools once again. The course will be introduced at all government schools before beginning of new academic session so that existing and newly enrolled students overcome learning gap,” he said. All government and private educational institutions have been shut in the state since April 5 this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/educational-institutions-likely-to-reopen-in-july-minister-101623687225475.html

Nitish Kumar just cannot wish away the troubles he faces after release of Lalu Prasad from the jail. The game is on,” said RJD MLA and chief spokesman Bhai Birendra. Congress MLC extended an offer to Chirag Paswan to join hands with Opposition’s grand alliance. “He (Kumar) was pursuing his political goals when people were grappling with the challenge to survive in the pandemic and the opposition parties were out to help those in distress,” Mishra said. State Congress spokesman Rajesh Rathore said JD(U)’s bid to disintegrate LJP and obliterate the legacy of its founder Ram Vilas Paswan would not succeed for long. “Paswan community would not spare Nitish Kumar for isolating Chirag Paswan in Bihar politics. Chirag will rise again. Paswans will not back Pashupati Paras,” he said. Former Patna University professor and political analyst Nawal Kishore Chaudhary said, “It’s an attempt by JD(U) to settle scores with LJP and regain its lost ground. Kumar is a power hungry politician.” Over the past few months, JD(U) has been able to poach lone MLAs of BSP and the LJP, besides an Independent. Now, it is said to be eyeing five MLAs of AIMIM. Besides, the party has poached four MLCs of RJD and an equal number of Congress MLCs over the past few years. Former Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Ashok Choudhary, who was a Congress MLC, had switched his loyalty with three others and joined JD(U) in 2017. Meanwhille, JD(U) national president RCP Singh said Chirag Paswan has just reaped what he sowed. “Chirag was heading a party which was with the NDA. Yet, he adopted a stance that damaged it in the Assembly polls. This led to a sense of unease within his own party,” said Singh. Ashok Choudhary, who is now a minister, said JD(U) had nothing to do with the rift in the LJP, but added Chirag was destined for this fate owing to negative politics he played during the Bihar assembly elections. The BJP was cautious. State BJP spokesman Prem Ranjan Patel said Chirag was bearing the brunt of his habit of taking unilateral decision for his party without consulting other leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oppn-targets-cm-for-ljp-troubles-jd-u-says-chirag-reaped-what-he-sowed-101623687165482.html

Yuvraj Sambhajiraje has taken an aggressive stance on the Maratha reservation issue and is leading the Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM) this time. The Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM) has planned to carry out morchas from June 16 across Maharashtra. The first protest will be held in Kolhapur. Pawar was on a visit to Kolhapur on Monday to take the Covid-19 review of the district as its positivity rate is high in western Maharashtra. He also met Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj at his residence and discussed various issues.On one side when Sambhajiraje and Udyanraje Bhosale planned their visit in Pune, Pawar met Shahu Maharaj in Kolhapur. Pawar said, “Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and I met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and briefed him about the Maratha reservation problem. We’ve also given information about the Supreme Court’s decision. We appealed to the Central government to amend the law as Maratha caste can be declared as a backward caste.” Pawar said, “If the Central government takes a positive stand and amends the act, the problem of giving reservation to Marathas is possible. Even the state government had appointed the committee for the same which is headed by former chief justice Dilip Bhosale. The committee had submitted the report to CM Uddhav Thackeray. The government will discuss the suggestions given in this report.” Pawar also took a review of the Covid-19 situation in Kolhapur city. As the Covid cases are more in comparison to neighbouring districts, Pawar clearly instructed to bring more restrictions in Kolhapur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ajit-pawar-meets-shahu-chhatrapati-in-kolhapur-shifts-onus-on-centre-101623686984760.html
14-06-2021||Pune||Udayanraje extends support to Sambhajiraje on Maratha reservation||Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s descendants Udayanraje Bhosale and Sambhajiraje Bhosale on Monday came together and expressed strong support for Maratha reservation in Pune. Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje has taken the lead this time and planned to carry out the Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM) protests in each district from June 16, 2021. The first morcha will begin from Kolhapur. On Monday, Sambhajiraje met Udayanraje Bhosale in Pune. After the meeting both Sambhajiraje and Udyanraje addressed the press. Udayanraje Bhosale said, “I am with Sambhajiraje and have extended my full support to his efforts in getting reservation for the Marathas. We have only one demand and that is reservation for Marathas.” Udayanraje Bhosale dared politicians from all parties to hold a special assembly session on the issue of Maratha reservation as soon as possible. He said, “Maharashtra government should call a special session on the Maratha reservation. This session should be broadcasted live, and people should know who is speaking what. I don’t believe in the courts for getting reservation for the Marathas. The citizens must ask questions to all elected members. They need to raise questions with all MLAs irrespective of which political party they belong to.” Udayanraje Bhosale assured that if the state government clears all hurdles that exist currently, he will raise the issues with the Centre. “This issue is above party politics, I appeal to all leaders, including those of the BJP to solve the issue of Maratha reservation. I appeal to the media that you shouldn’t make this about party politics, people and Maratha youth are very angry and restless,” he said. In the previous Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM) protests, Udayanraje had taken charge and was aggressively seen leading silent protests. This time, Sambhajiraje of Kolhapur has taken the charge. Sambhajiraje recently visited Kopardi village in Ahmednagar district and later on Monday held a meeting with Udayanraje in Pune. “We are from the same family, there are no two families. There may be different paths, but our aim is the same, and that is reservation for Marathas,” Udayanraje Bhosale said. Sambhajiraje Bhosale said, “We have a very good meeting and there is no difference between us on any demand. We have the same view.” The Supreme Court on May 5, 2021, struck down the Maharashtra law that held the Maratha community as socially and economically backward, thereby ending the Maratha reservation in public education and employment. In doing so, the Supreme Court also quashed the Maratha reservation in so far it breaches the 50% ceiling of reservation. The top court, while nixing the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, said that it violates equality as under Article 14 of the Constitution. The five-judge Supreme Court bench, comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta, and Ravindra Bhat, pronounced the verdict on May 5, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/udayanraje-extends-support-to-sambhajiraje-on-maratha-reservation-101623686864759.html

He asked me when I will be able to travel to Delhi as I have to appear before the committee as well,” Bandyopadhyay told HT. Bandyopadhyay had called up the speaker on the same issue on June 3. The second call was made on a day when 50 BJP legislators in Bengal met governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and demanded that any MLA who joins the TMC should face action under the anti-defection law passed by the Parliament. The team was led by Shishir Adhikari’s son Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of the opposition in the legislative assembly. “The anti-defection law applies to all states and Bengal is not an exception. As the Constitutional head of the state, I will ensure that it is enforced,” Dhankhar told the media after the meeting. Sunil Mondal, TMC Lok Sabha member from the East Burdwan seat, joined the BJP in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah in December last year. Sisir Adhikari, who did not formally pick up the BJP flag but shared dais with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the campaign, is the MP from Contai in East Midnapore district. His eldest son Suvendu defeated Mamata Banerjee from the district’s Nandigram seat by 1958 votes. She has to face the election again to continue as chief minister.Bandyopadhyay wrote to the speaker on January 4 and May 12, seeking Mondal’s disqualification. The petition regarding Sisir Adhikari was sent on May 17. On June 3, Bandyopadhyay told Om Birla that the two TMC MPs joined another party in public programmes and there are no doubts about their defection. The TMC has 22 Lok Sabha MPs since the BJP won 18 seats in 2019. Bengal has 42 seats. Till 2019, the TMC had 34 MPs in the Lower House. In the assembly polls, the TMC bagged 213 of the state’s 294 seats. The BJP, which had sworn to oust the TMC by winning more than 200 seats, won only 77. However, two BJP MLAs resigned from the assembly to retain their Lok Sabha seats. On Friday, BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy, who won the Krishnanagar North assembly seat, joined the TMC. On Monday, Suvendu Adhikari said Roy would face action under anti-defection law if he did not resign from the assembly within 24 hours. When asked about the TMC’s demand for disqualification of his father, Adhikari said, “I will not comment on this.” Sisir Adhikari’s second son, Dibyendu, is the Lok Sabha member from East Midnapore’s Tamluk seat. Though he spoke in support of Suvendu Adhikari on a few occasions he has not joined the BJP. Sisir Adhikari and Sunil Mondal did not give any reaction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/tmc-urges-lok-sabha-speaker-to-disqualify-turncoat-mps-including-sisir-adhikari-101623685187921.html

The district police had launched a hunt for them in a ₹3 lakh robbery in Patran area on May 9.The arrested accused are from Jind district in Haryana and have been identified as kingpin Vijay Kumar, 43; Sanjeev, 26; Satinder Singh, 35; Sunny Sharma, 34, and Sunny Kanari, 24. Patiala senior superintendent of police (SSP) Sandeep Kumar Garg said the kingpin Vijay had 53 cases of murder, dacoity, cheating and kidnapping registered against him across the four states. He added that the accused lured their targets after offering them fake currency that they could try and circulate as genuine. Once their target became convinced that the fake currency would work, the gang members lured him/her into buying fake currency from them by paying just half the amount. “The gang called their victim to a secluded place for the supposed transaction and robbed them of their money. The accused donned police uniforms during the crime,” the SSP said, adding that the same modus operandi was used in the Patran case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gang-of-robbers-busted-in-patiala-lured-victims-using-fake-currency-101623681765435.html

It said that these drives cannot be made a part of the national vaccination policy at this moment.The government was responding to a previous query posed by a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni on what it thought about the Brihanmumbai Municipal Commission’s request for door-to-door vaccination of the elderly, bedridden and other citizens who fall in the special category.“On the BMC's permission letter to the Union ministry of health and family welfare, the ministry says its current advisory against such drives has been formulated based on recommendations of experts,” the counsel for the government said.The Centre, however, pointed out that it had not asked the states Kerala, Odisha and Jharkhand, who were conducting such drives, to roll them back. The court also asked the civic body if it would conduct a door-to-door drive in case Maharashtra decides to start it for its citizens who fall under special categories.“We will follow the state's guidelines. The state is thinking about the drive but issues like lack of manpower, since three persons will be needed to visit each person getting vaccinated, requirement of ambulance, and ensuring no wastage of vaccine, have to be considered,” BMC’s counsel Anil Sakhare said, according to a PTI report.The Maharashtra government earlier said that it wanted to launch a Covid-19 door-to-door vaccination campaign. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by two advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari. The high court will hear the plea further on June 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-provision-for-door-to-door-vaccination-campaign-centre-to-bombay-hc-101623681041096.html

The payments were made for the construction of the Masters of Business Administration (MBA) building, the University College of Engineering, renovation of hostels and the teaching block. The varsity is yet to start the recovery process.Officials of the civil engineering branch made these payments during the tenure of the then vice-chancellor (V-C) Jaspal Singh. A state vigilance bureau report names top officials of the civil engineering branch in making these payments and causing financial loss to the varsity of ₹2.7 crore.”A senior university official said the vigilance department had acted on an anonymous complaint filed with it in 2017. An audit report, prepared separately, had also expressed concern over siphoning of sand worth ₹36 lakh. The sand had been excavated during the construction of the basement of the engineering department.“The varsity failed to produce any record related to trucks used to ferry sand from the construction site to outside the varsity premises,” another official said.Registrar Varinder Kaushik said he had joined just two months ago and the matter had not been brought to his notice. “I am yet to look into the matter,” the registrar added.

14-06-2021||Lucknow||Pride month: The closet unlocks online||Looks like the pandemic has helped some members of the LGBTQ community in Lucknow come out of the closet and connect with other members in safe online space.“Since the lockdown last year, the members of online groups have grown three-fold as closed meetings are happening online which are safe, more interactive and helps keep anonymity for those who are not ‘open’ to family and friends,” says Yadavendra Singh Darvesh, founder-member of Awadh Queer Pride Committee.Offline meetings saw low turnouts as logistically it was inconvenient and then many members wanted to share about themselves but did not want to be identified, says Yadavendra.The virtual session has enabled them to open up to the needs of the community.“Many of them did not turn out and we barely had 20-odd members attending but it reached to somewhere over 60-70 members attending the online sessions which has never happened before. Online they discuss about problems, sexuality, family acceptance issues, seek guidance and suggestions without disclosing their identity. With closed cameras they feel safe and share about themselves on the forum and get benefitted with each other,” he says. Suyash Srivastava, an apparel designer in Lucknow, became a part of this queer support group last October. “I evolved a lot since then. I came out about my queer identity to my sisters, cousins and friends. I am yet to open to my parents but am now vocal about speaking my mind. Close-door physical meetings are also fine but in larger picture online meets have been more successful,” he says.Active member Megha Nandi, a graphic designer, says, “As every member problems are different, so we understand each other and provide psychological support from experts who are also from the community.”Youngster Aditya was working down South but came to his hometown after work-from-home scenario and joined the community.“You can’t be visible as a queer person in place like Lucknow. In big cities, you are practically anonymous. Besides sharing about self and discussing I was also part of story-telling session. It has become a big support system and best part is you can invite guests from anywhere in the world,” he says.An anonymous transwoman says, “Online support group is fine but personally I prefer meeting people in person. It has benefitted me a lot in finding people of my community with common mindset and I can be myself without I am being judged.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pride-month-the-closet-unlocks-online-101623679605083.html
14-06-2021||Chandigarh||Nirmal Milkha Singh, an unmatched administrator who transformed Chandigarh sports||Mrs Nirmal Milkha Singh, who passed away on Sunday after battling Covid-19, was the most dynamic sports administrator Chandigarh ever had. I can say that with authority as I was the finance secretary and sports secretary in Chandigarh Administration when she was posted as joint director, sports, in 1984. Memories came flooding back on hearing the sad news. Nirmal, as we all knew her, was a sportsperson of national fame herself, but not many know that her knowledge, initiative and enthusiasm as a sports administrator were unmatched. The two years that saw a transformation of the Chandigarh sports department was much due to her personality and the new ideas that came to her naturally. After more than 35 years, I may not be able to recall all her contributions, but I do remember how the Sector 42 sports complex, Sector 7 sports stadium and many others, are the result of her initiatives. We worked in a small group headed by K Banerjee, the then chief commissioner and administrator whose decision-making was sharp and quick. That being the easy task, the difficult part of implementation was left mostly to Nirmal and her team. I remember how we could all leave the details of organising events such as the first National Women’s Athletic Championship at the Sector 7 stadium to her and were pleasantly surprised with the Pinjore Flying Club plane dropping flowers at the inauguration, all due to her initiative. Always part of the solution Her contribution to build the sports infrastructure continued much after I left the Chandigarh Administration in 1986. I remember how she was always a part of the solution and came out with brilliant ideas. In 1985, we were given an opportunity to host the first-ever international cricket match in Chandigarh. This was the One-Day match between England and India. We accepted the challenge but ran into problems when the requirement of constructing new stands with seating capacity for 25,000 in the Sector 16 stadium was not allowed as per the bylaws and master plan. Nirmal came out with brilliant idea of wooden stands. That’s how even today one can see the dark green wooden stands in the stadium, blending beautifully with the environment. The first One-Day International was watched by a capacity crowd of 25,000, and I remember David Fowler, the then England team captain telling me that he found the stadium to be one of the most picturesque. Endearing nature, always cheerful Nirmal was not only an able administrator, but also a fine human being. My wife, Rupan Deol Bajaj, herself an administrator, admired her initiative. Now for a woman’s take. Rupan admired her flawless complexion, and the way she carried herself in a sari with her well-earned India blazer. Nirmal’s cream salad, the recipe of which she so generously shared with my wife (with her secret ingredient of coconut) became a signature dish at our home.

14-06-2021||Chandigarh||Renewed beliefs, power of positivity in testing times||A warm embrace, the human touch, and the presence of loved ones around – these were the things I longed for the most during my quarantine. Yes, I’ve also been witness to the invisible notorious guest that has engulfed the world. Setting aside negative vibes, which are endless and omnipresent, I’d like to share lessons learnt from this new experience. It was for the first time in years that my husband (who was in isolation as he had also contracted the virus) and I celebrated our wedding anniversary on a video call, being in the same house but distant. The cake was there but we couldn’t even see it, let alone the thought of cutting it. When we got the piece of cake to eat, our taste buds deceived us. The days of my quarantine took along a few more missed anniversaries and birthdays, leaving me with the thought that surviving is more important than celebrating. We should celebrate each moment we live. Also read: AIIMS Delhi to begin screening children between 6 and 12 yrs for Covaxin trialsBlessed that I was in home isolation, which makes it a little comfortable, yet something was amiss. I was there yet not there as I couldn’t step out of the room, interact face to face with anybody, couldn’t be privy to whatever happened outside of that room, and could only see the days go by. The most challenging thing was to maintain a healthy state of mind in an enclosed space and just soak in the silence. It’s as much a mental battle as it is physical. Donning a combatting role and staying resilient help. This one-of-a-kind experience further strengthened my belief that family and friends are our saviours no matter what. We should thank God for having sent these angels in our life. My first saviour turned out to be one of my old friends, a doctor, who had undergone Covid-19 treatment herself. She immediately came to my rescue and asked me to get the medicines and equipment required. I acted as instructed. It helped in putting things under control quite early. At home, my father-in-law took good care of us despite his own health limitations. He managed it all like a lone soldier in the battlefield. All the loved ones played a major role in making things comfortable by contributing their bit and doing more than asked for. Another lesson learnt was that kids have a better coping mechanism, and it makes me proud to think how my daughter handled the chaos. Isolation doesn’t come easy. It can have a dismaying effect on the mind, body, and soul. What kept me going was will power and a calm mind. I made sure to read books, write my thoughts, no TV or social media exposure, and meditate. Messages from friends which suggested, “Stay positive to be negative”, made me realise the power of positivity. My recommendation: Carry a positive attitude to remain healthy and fit, even in testing times. Take it as an experience and move on with an enriched perspective. vepreeti@gmail.com The author is a Chandigarh-based freelance writer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/renewed-beliefs-power-of-positivity-in-testing-times-101623672224485.html
14-06-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: Pune’s latest fire incident exposes unpreparedness||Last week, when 17 workers were charred to death in a blaze at a mid-sized firm in Pirangut near Pune, it hit the headlines before becoming part of history as yet another tragic incident. Scores of people have lost their lives in similar incidents in the past; another recent incident being a fire engulfing the entire floor of a newly developed facility at the Serum Institute of India in January this year, when five workers lost their lives. Saving lives – and property too – has always been at the heart of fire fighter’s job. The significance of emergency response in fire incidents is the most crucial element if lives are to be saved. This was underlined when the fire broke out inside SVS Aqua Technologies, a chemical unit in Pirangut, and spread rapidly. The tragedy exposed negligence on the part of those running the unit, as several norms were found to be violated, including storage of inflammable material like sanitisers without permission, a lack of space and poor entry-exit points. At the same time, a severe lack of fire safety measures in the industrial zone of Pirangut, where more than 200 industries including 10 chemical units are located, was also brought to fore. Despite being a key industrial estate, the area does not have its own fire station. According to locals, fire tenders had to be called in from other stations in the absence of a locally situated one. This, according to relatives of victims and others, delayed the dousing exercise. As reported in HT Pune in its June 9 edition, six fire brigade vehicles helped in the rescue operation, including units sourced from Hinjewadi Phase 3, Wagholi, Marunji, and MIDC. Around 50 officials were involved in the four-hour operation to douse the fire. Yet, the blaze could have been controlled after only two hours. The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), a state government agency responsible for planning and development of the region, has its own fire station, but in other locations. The PMRDA depends on three fire stations, with the latest one being Wagholi, and two others at Marunji and Nanded City. The PMRDA fire station nearest to the Pirangut-located SVS Aqua Technologies is the Life Republic fire station in Marunji. However, geographically, the nearest fire station is the one at Hinjewadi Phase 3, under the Pimpri-Chinchwad fire department. Since every moment counts in a fire-fighting exercise, the time of over 45 minutes for fire tenders to reach the spot was not short of an immense delay. As recounted by one of the survivors, on that fateful day of June 7, the fire broke out at around 3:30pm, while fire fighters reached by 4:15pm. The National Disaster Management Authority under the Ministry of Home Affairs, in its 2012 report, has stated that as per norms set by Standing Fire Advisory Committee, the standard response time for fire fighting in urban parts should be three-five minutes, while for the rural parts it is 20 minutes. India is vast country with resources often in short supply, while roads in big cities are crowded and structures catching fire are cramped in bylanes, where access is a major problem. This often delays the response time, leading to a loss of lives. The Pirangut incident has once again underlined this. This isn’t the only issue Pune’s fire-fighting mechanism is grappling with. The fire department has seen over 750 small and big fires and natural hazard incidents in 2020, as against 650 during the previous year. Despite growing incidents, its capacity hasn’t been increased. The department is facing a shortage of over 510 men and requires 12 more fire stations to provide better services to citizens, as highlighted by Vivek Velankar through an RTI query. During a recent fire incident at Lohiyanagar in the Bhavani peth slums on November 23, the response time was delayed by more than 25 minutes as trained drivers were unavailable. The shortage of firemen delayed the control of fire by men on the ground. If the loss of lives is to be prevented, there is a strong need to increase fire stations and manpower.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-pune-s-latest-fire-incident-exposes-unpreparedness-101623671024847.html

14-06-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand BJP leader arrested for capturing house after owners died to Covid||Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Mahila Morcha (women’s wing) general secretary in Uttarakhand was arrested on Sunday along with her two sons and an aide for attempting to capture a prime property owned by an elderly couple, who succumbed to Covid-19 in Clement Town area of Dehradun, leaving no heir behind. The BJP later expelled the leader for an indefinite period.Reena Goyal, her two sons- Lavya and Rishabh Goyal, and aide Anuj Saini were arrested after they were found to have broken into the property, sealed by the police. The police were alerted by an email from the US-based brother of the deceased woman on Sunday. In his complaint, he alleged that the BJP leader had captured his sister’s property in Dehradun.Dehradun’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) Yogendra Singh Rawat said the deceased couple identified as DK Mittal and his wife Sushila Mittal, both aged above 80, lived in a house worth crores in Clement Town area of the city. After Sushila Mittal passed away on May 2 due to coronavirus, her husband too got infected and succumbed on June 6. Police said their only son had died about two years ago, leaving them with no heir.“As both had no one to look after the property, Sushila’s brother and complainant Suresh Mahajan who is settled in the United States (US), informed the local Clement Town police, who sealed the property to prevent any illegal occupation,” said Rawat.The matter didn’t end there, on June 13; Mahajan lodged a complaint in an e-mail to Clement Town police alleging Reena Goyal had formed a trust in the name of the Mittals and captured the property along with her sons and an associate a day earlier. Based on this, police went to the spot and stopped the four, but they tried to indulge in violence... following which all the four were arrested,” said Rawat.State Congress said BJP leaders were indulging in “inhumane” activities when people were suffering during the pandemic.“...In these dire times, when people are helping each other to cope with the loss, BJP leaders like Goyal are capturing properties of people who died of Covid-19, which is just despicable. She has no right to live in a civilised society,” said Congress state spokesperson Garima Dasauni.BJP state media in-charge Manveer Singh Chauhan said BJP has zero tolerance for such behaviour. “Hence, Goyal has been expelled from the party and removed from all the positions she was holding, for an indefinite period,” Chauhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-bjp-leader-arrested-for-capturing-house-after-owners-died-to-covid-101623666524262.html

14-06-2021||Mumbai||‘For everyone it is matter of faith’: Sena's Sanjay Raut demands clarification on Ram temple land purchase in Ayodhya||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday demanded clarification from the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust and other leaders amid charges of corruption being raised regarding the purchase of the land for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya.Raut said that the Ram Mandir is a matter of faith for the Shiv Sena and the common people of the country. “Lord Ram and the fight for the Ram Mandir is a matter of faith for us. For some, it is a political matter. The Trust formed for the construction of the temple should clarify if the allegations are true or false,” Raut was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.“The temple's 'bhoomipujan' ceremony was also attended by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. They should also speak out. Ram temple is a matter of faith. People have made donations out of faith. Even Shiv Sena had contributed ₹1 crore to the Trust,” he further added.He said that there is no use of having faith if the money taken for building the temple has been misused and demanded that it should be investigated if the allegations are right or wrong. It was Aam Aadmi party MP Sanjay Singh who had claimed that the Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust general secretary Champat Rai had purchased a piece of land worth ₹2 crore at an inflated price of ₹18.5 crore for the Ram Temple and was aided by Trust’s member Anil Mishra.AAP’s Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh and a former minister in the Samajwadi government, Pawan Pandey who also demanded that the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate initiate a probe into the land purchase. Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust general secretary Champat Rai dismissed the claims and said that the allegations were being motivated by political hatred.Raut said that spoke to Sanjay Singh and was ‘shocked by the evidence’ provided by Singh. Raut also pointed out that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) appointed the members of the Trust. He said that the Shiv Sena should be included in the members’ body as they were also an important part of the Ram Mandir agitation. “Representatives of organizations like the Shiv Sena should have been included in the body as the Sena had participated in the agitation for the construction of the Lord Ram's temple… That was our earlier demand,” Raut said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/raut-demands-clarification-on-ram-temple-land-purchase-in-ayodhya-101623664513580.html

14-06-2021||Delhi||Metro riders flout rules, young denizens despise unruly attitude||The Delhi Metro resumed operations on June 7, after being shut as per strict guidelines during the recent lockdown. And on day one itself, an approximate 4.5 lakh passengers journeyed till 8pm, out of which 84 passengers were advised to get down from coach for travelling in standing position, 73 were penalised for not wearing mask and 106 were counselled to follow social distancing and wearing mask properly! As late as June 8, 136 passengers were fined for not wearing mask during random checks inside trains by flaying squads, and 70 passengers were advised to get down from coach for travelling in standing position. In addition to this, 126 passengers were counselled to adhere to Covid appropriate behaviour inside metro premises. Is the lacks towards Metro travel going to change? Well, many Delhiites are miffed at this carelessness that seems to be sending an open invitation to the third wave of Covid-19. Kunal Vats, a second year student pursuing Bachelor of Management Studies at Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies in Delhi University, says: “Delhi Metro has been the go-to mode of transport for me during my days in Delhi, and it pains me to see people not adhering to its rules. Considering that a vaccine shortage is always round the corner and that the second wave was so dangerous, we should be more careful than ever. A third wave is imminent if people continue to not observe Covid appropriate behaviour in public places such as the Delhi Metro. I hope the authorities enforce the rules more strictly. Metro operating hours could be limited and/or the number of people at any given time at stations should be restricted.”“Looking at the pictures of the crowd, I feel: Yeh nahi sudhrenge! According to me, we as responsible citizens should be patient and respect the facility provided for our benefit rather than putting precious lives in danger,” says Aayush Jain, another DU student, and Ronak Singh, a Gurugram resident opines, “As a country we’ve been trying very hard recover from this crisis, and we usually lose months of progress the moment we become negligent. This has the potential to cause an endless loop and therefore it is critical to take things slowly, apply wisdom, and comply with government issued guidelines. In the end it comes down to individual accountability and being responsible citizens who show concern for ourselves and those that are around us.” Jayani Shah, a second year BA (Hons) Economics student at DU’s Shri Ram College of Commerce, echoes a similar sentiment: “It’s important that people follow the guidelines issues by the government to ensure social distancing is maintained. The main lesson we took from the second wave is that we have to be extremely careful about opening up the cities. Our battle with Covid-19 has not ended and we need to be vigilant. However, to ease the process for Delhiites, strict steps need to be taken by the authorities. May be an increase in the frequency of the trains can ensure that the commuters are not left stranded to crowd at the platforms.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/metro-riders-flout-rules-young-denizens-despise-unruly-attitude-101623656770568.html

14-06-2021||Delhi||World Blood Donor Day: How Delhi cops are leading the way amid pandemic||A lifesaving act – blood donation has found new meaning during the pandemic. And World Blood Donor Day, which is celebrated every year on June 14, reiterates the significance of the need to donate blood. During Covid-19, many donors were needed to save lives, especially at a time when citizens were afraid to step out of their houses. That’s when some police officers stepped up, and till date they have been donating blood, only to celebrate almost every day as blood donation day!“I had never donated blood before, but amid the pandemic I received SOS messages from people and was inspired to go in for donation during the first lockdown last year. Since then, I’ve made it a point to donate blood every 90 days,” says Pooja Junjadiya, a constable with Delhi Police. She feels more people need to make this essential contribution in saving lives, keeping in line with this year’s theme for the day: Give blood and keep the world beating. “I always wanted to donate blood, just did not know where to start. But we need to make more people aware of how safe and necessary it is to do so,” she adds.Trying his best to raise awareness about blood donation is constable Arjun, who has donated blood over two dozen times since 2010. “There is a demand for blood, platelets from patients who have thalassemia, cancer, or are in emergency situations. We try to take all the requests and have an active Facebook group of police officers in the city, where we list all messages and respond to requests depending on who’s the closest to the given location. I try to tell people to not just donate when there is need, but also donate regularly to the blood banks that receive a barrage of requests on a daily basis,” says the officer, who is posted in outer district’s Sultanpuri Station. And having donated blood, these donors feel elated to help those in grave need and see their families heave a sigh of relief. All this for the sake of humanity! “More often than not, we don’t know the patients. We simply respond to any urgent message that we get,” says Sub Inspector Satwant Singh, posted in Delhi’s Northwest District, and recalls: “I remember last year I had just finished my night duty and was about to head home when a colleague asked me to respond to a request for blood at a hospital nearby. I immediately went and donated blood, and the family of the patient could not stop thanking me. These are the small moments that remind us why we do this.” Having donated blood 14 times, Singh says it’s imperative to educate everyone about the need for blood donation. He adds, “I started donating blood as part of my college’s NSS program, and have been doing it since then. More so because I have a rare blood group. We should teach youngsters about blood donation because every drop of blood can save a life!” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/world-blood-donor-day-how-delhi-cops-are-leading-the-way-amid-pandemic-101623653204313.html

14-06-2021||Other||Vatican rejected 3rd plea challenging expulsion, says Kerala nun||The Vatican has turned down the third plea of expelled nun, Sister Lucy Kalapura, to revoke her expulsion, said the nun on Monday. Kalapura was expelled from the Franciscan Clarist Congregation (FCC) two years ago for “serious indiscipline and flouting orders of superiors” . She said she got a fresh communiqué from Vatican on Saturday in this regard and later, the Mother Superior of the FCC sent a fresh notice to her to vacate her room in the convent. Kalapura is still staying at the convent and was granted police protection by the high court two years ago. Later, a local court in Wayanad (north Kerala) stayed her eviction from the convent. Kalapura, 55, has claimed she was victimised for supporting the agitation seeking the arrest of Franco Mulakkal, a bishop from Jalandhar who was slapped with rape charges by a nun in 2018. She had also participated in a protest against the alleged delay in Mulakkal’s arrest.Also Read | 3 men arrested in UP’s Jhansi for demanding action against Kerala nuns“The letter is in Latin but the covering letter spells out the decision. The details will be available only after the letter is translated but it is dated 2020,” she said over the phone from Manathawady in Wayanad. “The recent revision of church laws regarding abuse of minors, vulnerable adults, and fraud gave us hope. But it seems the papal head is not getting a clear picture,” she said, adding that she will continue her fight against the “corrupt practices” of the Church. An FCC spokesperson refused to comment on the issue. Kalapura has written an autobiography, ‘Karthavinte Namathil’ (In the name of Christ), in which she alleged that sexual abuse and assaults happen in convents and seminaries frequently. She also alleged that she faced sexual assault attempts at least four times during her convent life and many nuns succumb to such intimidation. Save our Sisters, a reformist body formed in the wake of protests against Mulakkal, pledged support to Kalapura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vatican-rejected-3rd-plea-challenging-expulsion-says-kerala-nun-101623652063393.html

14-06-2021||Lucknow||Ganga being cleared of algal bloom near famous Varanasi ghats||River Ganga’s stretch between famous Dashashwamedh and Assi ghats in Varanasi was sprayed with chemicals on Sunday to clear it of algal bloom, which was discharged from a sewage treatment plant in Mirzapur and spread rapidly due to presence of nitrogen and phosphorus in river waters, traced to untapped drains in the Varanasi district, officials said.The algal bloom was removed using 3000 liters of bioremediation solution made with 7.5 kg chemical powder. Another 3000 liters will be sprayed in the affected stretches on Monday and the efficacy of the exercise will be assessed on Tuesday by carrying out spot inspection, the team involved in the cleaning exercise said. The team was headed by Neeraj Gahlawat, project officer-technical, National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), NMCG Varanasi convener Rajesh Shukla and city health officer Dr NP Singh.Shukla said the spray solution helped clear algal deposits from the stretch within hours by Sunday afternoon.Varanasi district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said the algal bloom was first detected in Ganga over 20 days ago but it disappeared briefly around a week ago. A team of experts, constituted on June 7 after its reappearance, collected water samples, which were tested by UP pollution control board’s laboratory. It was found that the algae strains came from a STP in Mirzapur. “The algae strains drained into the river Ganga from Mirzapur district’s Chunar oxidation pond and STP. This algae flourished in Varanasi stretch of River Ganga due to presence of nitrogen and phosphorous (though mild) which mainly come in the river water from untapped drains,” UPPCB scientific officer Dr TN Singh said, referring to two untapped drains supplying nitrogen and phosphorous for the algae to bloom. One of these drains with 50 MLD capacity discharges into the river in Asi area, while the second one with 10 MLD capacity drains into the river in Ramnagar area of the district, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ganga-being-cleared-of-algal-bloom-near-famous-varanasi-ghats-101623648943260.html

On Sunday, West Bengal reported 3,984 new cases. This is less than the highest number of cases reported on October 22, the peak of the pandemic in 2020. West Bengal registered its highest number of fresh Covid-19 cases on May 14 this year, when the daily count shot up to 20,846. “The number of cases has declined, and situation is now under control. We expect to touch the base level of 100 – 150 cases per days across the state by the end of June or early July. But we need to be on guard and follow all Covid protocols,” said a senior official of the state health department.

On June 13, the state reported 84 deaths compared to 136 deaths on May 14, when the highest number of Covid-19 cases were reported. Experts had said that the West Bengal assembly election was one of the main reasons of the sharp rise of Covid-19 cases in the state in April and May this year. While elections were declared in February-end, the eight phase polls took off on March 27 and continued for over a month. Results were declared on May 2. “The number of active cases had shot up from 3,343 on February 26, when elections were announced, to118,495 on May 2, when the results were declared. The positivity rate had also shot up from 1% to 31% during the same period,” said the official. After the new government came to power, the Mamata Banerjee administration imposed several restrictions from May 16 to check the spread of the virus and the state entered a near lockdown phase. “Public transport was shut down, government and private offices were closed, timings of markets and shops were restricted and people’s movement at night was stopped. This helped and cases reduce,” said a senior official. The state government has now relaxed some of the restrictions, allowing more shops to remain open longer. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has announced that eateries will reopen from June 16for some hours in the evening and shopping malls will also open with limited number of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/daily-count-of-covid-19-cases-drops-below-last-year-s-peak-in-west-bengal-101623643782772.html

Believe me sir, in this fascinating city of nawabs, nothing is more exciting than experiencing a horse ride, amidst beautiful skyline dotted with so many nawabi-era heritage structures,” Khan says, trying to convince a family to take a horse ride through the Old City, but even his best pitch fails to convince the family, which prefers to proceed on foot, leaving Khan and his dear friend Abdullah dejected.Juggan, a traditional horseman is one of about 50 horsemen, struggling to make a living even after switching to horse riding business in Lucknow’s Old City after their previous business of running horse carts completely collapsed, making it impossible to buy even horse feed.“Sahab khud bhooke so lenge par bezubaan janwar to kaise bhooka maar de. Iska pet to palna hi hain, chahe lockdown ho ya fir Covid (We can stay hungry, but how can I leave a speechless animal empty stomach? I have to manage his meals somehow, be it in the lockdown or Covid scare),” Juggan says.Khan said the situation was still manageable until March 2020- the time when the first Covid wave hit the country, resulting in imposition of a nationwide lockdown. “Until March 2020, we were able to earn at least ₹200 to ₹350 a day, but the lockdown and other government-imposed restrictions squeezed the income, leaving us hand to mouth.”Mohammed Azeez, who owns a horse named Kajal, says the loss of business due to the pandemic has affected them the most. “Unlike other trade, once the shop is closed, the expense also reduces. But in our case, we have to feed our horses, even if there is no business. On an average, a horse needs fodder worth ₹250 to 300 a day. Hence to meet up the expenses we thought of starting horse rides in the Old City,” said Azeez.Horsemen like Azeez and Juggan recall the good old days when horse-driven carts like Bagghi, Ikka or tonga used to be the only means of transport in the city of nawabs. Now, Bagghis are only restricted to museums, while a handful of ikka, tonga and other horse driven carts left are mostly used for marriages and religious processions, which have been banned due to the pandemic.The city has around 50 ikka, tonga owners at present, and they are asking the state government to help them tide over the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid-trots-out-hard-times-for-lucknow-s-horsemen-101623639042727.html

The minimum temperature on Sunday was 23.8 degree Celsius – four degrees below normal – and the maximum temperature was 35.2 degree Celsius – four degrees below normal.IMD officials said the monsoon is on course to cover most areas of northwest India by Tuesday. “Conditions are favourable for further advancement of southwest monsoon into most parts of Madhya Pradesh, remaining parts of east Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, more parts of west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab during the next 48 hours,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre said on Sunday.Also Read | Heavy rainfall predicted in Punjab, Haryana from Tuesday. All details hereOn Saturday, HT had reported that the monsoon was around two weeks ahead of schedule due to a low-pressure system building up over the Bay of Bengal and was set to advance over Delhi and most parts of northwest India by June 15. The southwest monsoon generally arrives in Delhi by June 27-28.Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality was in the satisfactory category on Monday morning. Data from Central Pollution Control Board showed that the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 7am stood at 100. On Sunday, the average 24-hour AQI had been 83, which is also in the satisfactory category. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".Due to the rain, air quality in the national capital is also expected to stay in the "satisfactory" category this week. On Sunday, the Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar) said, “Rainfall observed yesterday [Saturday] has led to air quality improvement. The wind speed is forecasted to stay high for the next three days and isolated rainfall is likely in Delhi. AQI is likely to improve and stay in the satisfactory category for the next three days.”The bulletin also added, “...The contribution of bigger particles is still significantly high in Delhi’s air with a coarser versus finer particle ratio as 3:1, which normally remains around 1:1 in the Delhi-NCR region. This tends to suggest that fossil fuel emission-generated particles are lesser and quickly dispersing but dust-laden bigger particles are prevailing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-likely-to-witness-thunderstorm-today-imd-101623638502728.html

"If Suvendu Adhikari has thorough knowledge about anti-defection law.... he should first teach his father Sisir Da (Sisir Adhikari) because he was a TMC MP who joined BJP before the election...", said Kunal Ghosh, while responding to Suvendu Adhikari's comment regarding former BJP national general secretary Mukul Roy's defection to the Trinamool.Suvendu's comment on anti-defection law came after Mukul Roy, former BJP national vice president, and his son Subhranshu Roy rejoined the TMC in Kolkata on Friday in the presence of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, a month after the party's landslide victory in the state Assembly elections. Responding to this Roy's exit from BJP to rejoin TMC, Suvendu had said: "We are not moved or worried about Mukul Roy leaving the party. Since BJP is the only opposition party in the state, TMC will target us now. Anti-defection law has never been implemented in West Bengal before, but as the Leader of Opposition, I will take the charge to implement the laws in the state. It will take two to three months."Trinamool Congress (TMC) senior leader Kunal Ghosh on Sunday hit back at BJP's Suvendu Adhikari for his 'anti-defection law' comment and asked him to teach the law to his father Sisir Adhikari as he was a TMC MP, who joined the BJP before the elections while he was still holding the post."If (LoP) Suvendu Adhikari has thorough knowledge about anti-defection law, he should not try to teach TMC. He should first teach his father Sisir Da because he is a TMC MP and has joined BJP before the election while he was still holding the post," Ghosh told ANI.He claimed that proper protocol to quit the party and the post was not followed by Mukul Roy.Roy had contested the Assembly election from Krishnanagar Uttar constituency and defeated TMC candidate actor Koushani Mukherjee.Mukul Roy, a founding member of the TMC, had changed camps and joined BJP in November 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/teach-your-father-first-tmc-s-kunal-ghosh-hits-back-at-suvendu-adhikari-over-anti-defection-remark-101623633990519.html

14-06-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Notes from a post-lockdown walk||Two masked men are sitting on the dusty footpath, by the traffic light, with sketch pads on their laps. They are drawing Safdarjung’s Tomb, standing just across the road.It is a hot evening in the early post-lockdown, and traffic is still scarce. One has grown so used to seeing Delhi roads mostly empty, only peopled with those who really need to be out, that it is surreal to come across these sketchers.These days, a walk through Lodhi Road seamlessly marries the extraordinary beauty of the long tree-lined avenue with the eerie ambiance of Delhi’s currently absent outdoor life, and produces something truly haunting. Further ahead, three fat buffaloes (where did they come from?!) are chomping off leaves from the untrimmed foliage planted on the road divider.As the address of high-status institutions, Lodhi Road used to be traffic-heavy. Despite being in the heart of one of the most privileged portions of the city whose inhabitants emerge out of their houses only in chauffeur-driven cars, it used to teem with street hawkers. Dozens of ice cream carts would be parked outside Lodhi Gardens, which is still closed to visitors. How are those sellers coping, one wonders. (And what must have happened to Naresh Chandra, the stern ram laddoo seller who would walk up and down the road all day long with a snack basket on his head?)A right turning leads to the quiet Jor Bagh Market. Nini KD Singh, the elderly owner of the bookstore there hasn’t entered her establishment for more than a year due to the coronavirus scare, though she would occasionally venture out to Lodhi Gardens before the second surge.Some steps ahead, on the right, the gigantic India Habitat Centre overwhelms the senses like a monolithic vision from a mythical past. Here Delhi would go for music concerts, theatre plays, book launches and Tinder dates. Some years ago an unprecedented super-long queue had come up one evening to hear novelist Margaret Atwood talk with author Patrick French. The building is now marooned in desolation.As Lodhi Road ends at Mathura Road, the sidewalk on the right has an anonymous grave screened off within a dense shield of trees. The evening light is streaming in through the leaves and falling decorously over the grave, making it look disconcertingly alive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-notes-from-a-post-lockdown-walk-101623623899163.html
14-06-2021||Chandigarh||Tap alumni achievements to boost enrolment: Punjab education secretary||Punjab education secretary Krishan Kumar shared recommendations for boosting enrolment in government schools with school heads and district education officers on Sunday . In a letter issued in this regard, Kumar has asked school authorities to launch an “each one brings one” programme and issue e-certificates to students who refer a student to the school. He also suggested sharing alumni achievements with students. “Students should be asked to interact in English as well as their mother tongue at school,” reads the letter. “The head girl, head boy, and class monitor should be made part of the enrolment process and must be briefed about the available facilities,” it says. Students can be asked to share class-wise data and videos available on the Educare application with their friends, the letter said. District education officers (elementary and secondary) Jaswinder Kaur and Lakhvir Singh said, “Most primary schools are English medium. Their students confidently participate in competitions that require interacting in English at district and block levels. Booster clubs have helped increase students familiarity with the language.” Over the last two months, 29,597 students have been enrolled in classes from pre-primary to Class 5 in Ludhiana, of which 14,372 students have been admitted to lower and upper kindergarten; 4,366 to Class 1; 3,230 to Class 2; 6,352 to Class 3 and 2,291 to Class 4; and 3,882 to Class 5. Deputy district education officer (elementary) Kuldeep Singh said, “We will continue admissions till September as we hope to achieve our target of 30% enrolment in government schools. Last year, many schools had received funds for construction of new classrooms. This year, too, the government has sanctioned funds for the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/tap-alumni-achievements-to-boost-enrolment-punjab-education-secretary-101623617739340.html
14-06-2021||Chandigarh||Villagers still wary of vaccine in Ludhiana||With the virus making inroads into rural areas, the state government and local administrations have stepped up awareness and vaccination drives in villages under ‘Mission Fateh 2.0’. However, a sizeable chunk of the rural population remains sceptical about the efficacy of the vaccine.With the rumour mill working overtime, several villagers are refusing to get the jab despite the second wave of the pandemic exacting a terrible toll in rural areas as well. Sarpanch of Pakhowal’s Pamal village,Jagdish Singh Grewal, says, “The villagers are resisting vaccination because of rumours about alleged side effects of the vaccine. There are around 4,000 people in our village. However, only 10% of them have got the shot. Though special vaccination drives, and awareness drives have been launched and efforts are being made to reach out to people on social networking sites, the turnout remains low. After all, we cannot force anybody to get the jab!” “Most of the people who have got themselves vaccinated are those who plan to travel abroad and thus are out of options,” says Sudhar village sarpanch Harminder Gill, adding that a large section of villagers was neither following coronavirus protocols nor getting themselves vaccinated.Turn of the tideNonetheless, the situation is not all doom and gloom as the government’s intensive awareness drives and special grants for fully vaccinated villages have borne fruit. On June 12, Bhikhi village of Payal constituency became the first village in the state to have vaccinated all residents above the age of 18.MLA Lakhvir Lakha said the village has a strength of 1,700, of which 947 residents are above 18 years of age. Barring 18 pregnant women and a few others unfit for vaccination due to health issues, all the eligible 905 residents have been administered at least one dose of the vaccine.“May residents who were in double minds about the vaccine are coming forward to get the jab after villagers who got themselves inoculated did not report any side effects,” Mohie village sarpanch Gagandeep Singh said.District immunisation officer, Dr Puneet Juneja said the rural population had started getting themselves vaccinated and the situation was improving with every passing day. A certain number of residents have been vaccinated in almost every village. “Teams of the health department are regularly raising awareness in the villages and are clearing people’s doubts,” said Juneja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/villagers-still-wary-of-vaccine-in-ludhiana-101623617499344.html
14-06-2021||Chandigarh||2,700 minors contracted Covid in 2nd wave in Ludhiana||With some experts saying that children are likely to be more susceptible to contracting the coronavirus disease in the third wave of the pandemic, it has emerged that 2,702 children below the age of 18 were infected in the district between January 1 and June 4 this year.With 1,203 cases, the highest infections were reported in the 15-18 age group, followed by 630 in the 11-14 group, 539 in the 6-10 group and 330 in the 1-5 bracket, as per data compiled by the district health department. Health department officials have said that though it has been predicted that the third wave will affect more children, nothing is certain. However, preparations are being made to deal with every exigency.District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Kumar said, “Children may contract the infection from their parents or some other source.However, there is no scientific proof to indicate that children will be more susceptible to the third wave. The mortality rate among children is low because of their strong immunity.” Meanwhile, experts have said that children have largely been asymptomatic or exhibited mild symptoms. However, post-Covid complications remain a pressing concern. Dayanand Medical College And Hospital associate professor, department of paediatrics Gurdeep Singh Dhooria said, “Though children have strong immune symptoms, it has been seen in some cases that after two to three weeks of catching the infection, their immune system goes into a hyper-inflammatory response. Children may exhibit symptoms such as fever, redness in eyes, rashes, swelling in the face and in serious cases heart problems. If parents witness any of these symptoms, they should immediately consult a paediatrician.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2700-minors-contracted-covid-in-2nd-wave-in-ludhiana-101623616900472.html

The deceased, Shivangi, had arrived in Dhakoli from Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, last week in search of work. Government Railway Police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Rajinder Singh Dhillon said the deceased’s family was staying at a slum near Golden Sand Society in Zirakpur.

14-06-2021||Chandigarh||Amid piling losses, wholesale dealers rue Sunday lockdown in Ludhiana||With markets still closed on Sunday, wholesale dealers in the district say they have yet again got the short end of the stick as 80% of their clientele prefers to make purchases on that day. With most of their summer purchases still in stock, the wholesale dealers say ease in restrictions have not boosted their business. They have requested the Ludhiana deputy commissioner to allow them to open their shops on Sunday, even as they agreed to keep the shops closed on any other day of the week. Wholesale dealers at Chaura Bazaar, Akalgarh Market, and Gandhinagar Market say they witness more footfall on Sunday than any other day of the week. Amid a surge in cases, the administration had, on May 2, closed all shops selling non-essential items and imposed curfew on weekends as well. Sellers of non-essential items got some relief on May 7, as authorities provided them a window from 5am to noon. When the cases began to ebb, the administration increased the timings till 3pm on May 26, and then further increased it to 5pm on May 26 on May 31. As per the latest orders, all the shops are allowed to operate from 5am to 6pm. Proprietors of wholesale stores say it is not just local people who buy from them but a considerable chunk of the sales comes from people of other districts such as Patiala, Hoshiarpur, Mansa, and Moga. Akalgarh Market, one of the wholesale garment markets of the city, has around 795 such shops. Akalgarh Market Readymade Garment Association president Manpreet Singh Bunty says, “Last year, our summer wear stock remained shelved because of the nationwide lockdown. This year, too, we are in the same boat. We will not be able to survive unless the market is opened on Sunday.” A wholesale dealer at Gandhi Nagar market, which has 700 wholesale shops, Sukwinder Singh, says, “I have been in the garment business for 20 years. However, the pandemic has ruined the business. Few customers turn up on weekdays,” he said. In normal circumstances, special markets were setup by shopkeepers on Sunday, which were visited by around 10,000 customers. However, the once vibrant markets now wear a deserted look on weekends. Sanjeev Chaudhary, president of Arora Market Chaura Bazaar Association, said, “The Sunday lockdown has definitely affected my ready-made garment business. Hopefully, the government will make more concessions from next week.” PPBM wants shops to stay open till 8pm, on Sunday The Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal (PPBM) slammed the state government for not providing any relief package to boost business in the time of pandemic. “Industrialists and traders are leaving the state because of the anti-trade policies of the government,” representatives said during a press conference. The lockdown and curfew have caused considerable financial loss to both traders and industrialists, they said, adding that if Sunday lockdown was not withdrawn and timing of shops not increased till 8pm within the next three days,they will be forced to start an agitation across Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-piling-losses-wholesale-dealers-rue-sunday-lockdown-in-ludhiana-101623616540140.html
14-06-2021||Chandigarh||Cash-strapped Mohali MC’s budget cut by ₹31 crore||In a major setback to the fund-starved Mohali municipal corporation, the Punjab local bodies department has imposed a ₹31-crore cut in its budget for 2021-22.Against the proposed budget of ₹148 crore, forwarded in March this year, the department has approved only ₹117 crore.Notably, no funds have been allocated for solid waste management, Swachh Bharat Mission, and water supply and sewerage maintenance, despite Mohali slipping to the 157th rank out of 382 cities in the 2020 Swachh Survekshan ranking.The rank had also pushed Mohali to the seventh position in Punjab from the fifth position in 2019 when its nationwide rank was 153.The city continues to fare poorly in the annual cleanliness survey primarily due to its failure to get garbage-processing projects off the ground, including its solid-waste management project at Samgoli village.In 2020-2021 as well, the local bodies department had trimmed down the proposed budget of ₹268 crore to ₹127 crore, by slashing ₹141 crore. “We are passing through severe financial straits. The state government has not approved budget for water supply and sewerage maintenance, and for solid waste management. We are totally clueless about how to tackle the situation,” said a senior civic body official.MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said they will write to the local bodies department for more funds for 2021-22, so that the development works did not suffer.After taking charge on April 12, city mayor Amarjeet Singh Sidhu had assured that MC will face no dearth of funds. “We will get more grants from the state government as needed. Development works will not stop in the city,” said deputy mayor Kuljeet Singh Bedi.Revenue losses last yearWhile MC had expected to earn ₹28 crore from property tax in 2020-21, only ₹17 crore was paid by residents. Even the excise duty provided by the state government was just ₹12.5 crore against the expected ₹30 crore.The corporation couldn’t even earn its revenue from unipole advertisements after the state government waived the ₹5-crore fee for six months after six companies cited revenue losses amid the Covid pandemic.As a result, though the civic body was to earn ₹11 crore, it got only ₹1.42 crore from advertisers, with most not even paying their dues.On the account of tehbazari fee, MC was to collect ₹60 lakh but earned only ₹32 lakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cashstrapped-mohali-mc-s-budget-cut-by-31-crore-101623616300485.html
14-06-2021||Bangalore||Amid rumblings, BJP state in-charge to meet partymen||Bengaluru Three days after announcing that BS Yediyurappa will remain chief minister and there had been no discussions on replacing him, Arun Singh, the general secretary of the BJP in-charge of the state, is expected to arrive in Bengaluru on Wednesday. “Arun Singh would be in Karnataka for two to three days. It is his duty to hold meetings and take stock of the situation, for which he is coming here,” Yediyurappa told reporters in Bengaluru. According to people aware of the development, Singh is likely to hold meetings with ministers, MLAs and the party’s core committee members during his visit. Singh’s visit comes at a time when simmering dissent in Karnataka’s BJP unit has threatened to boil over as legislators and others have been rushing to Delhi to seek the ouster of the 78-year-old chief minister. Yediyurappa said that he would also be there and cooperate with Singh. Several legislators from within the BJP have met the central leadership, seeking the ouster of Yediyurappa who they believe has mishandled the Covid-19 health crisis, indulged in corruption and whose son, BY Vijayendra, is alleged to be running a parallel administration under the aegis of his father. The statements by Singh on June 10 backing the CM had infused new found confidence in Yediyurappa, who, a day later, claimed that he will be the chief minister for the remainder of the two years. “Yediyurappa is the chief minister, he is doing a good job and will remain the chief minister. He has done a good job during the Covid situation, all the ministers and the party- everyone has done a good job”, he was quoted saying by PTI. Singh had also said that it was wrong to publicly air grievances against anyone and that he would speak to those legislators and ministers making such statements in front of the media. The state unit of the party has issued gag orders, restricting its ministers, legislators and party workers from speaking out against the chief minister. However, the party is yet to take any action against Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand legislator from Bijapur City, who has time and again levelled charges of corruption against Yediyurappa and his family for at least six months now. The central leadership of the BJP are wary of making any decisions in haste with regards to Yediyurappa, who holds significant clout over the party and the Lingayat community, believed to be the single largest caste group in the state and who have stood behind for over a decade now. “There is a section on one side that believes that Yediyurappa is the leader. There is no dissent among any of the legislators. No one should do anything of this sort at a time like this,” Basavaraj Dadesugur, the BJP’s legislator from Kanakagiri said on Sunday. He added that there is no change of leadership and also that the BJP will face the elections in 2023 “under the leadership of Yediyurappa”. A section of the legislators have trained their guns on Arvind Bellad and minister CP Yogeshwara, who are among those seeking the removal of Yediyurappa. Bellad had visited Delhi on more than one occasion and has come under fire for his actions. Bellad on Saturday, however, defended his Delhi visit claiming it to be personal. Dadesugur on Sunday said that Bellad was just a two-time MLA and was not even a minister and should not aspire to be the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/amid-rumblings-bjp-state-in-charge-to-meet-partymen-101623616178490.html

Nirmal breathed her last at Fortis hospital in Mohali on Sunday. The cremation took place in the evening.

In 1955, Nirmal went to Sri Lanka as part of the India volleyball team where she met Milkha for the first time. Their friendship blossomed into a love affair when both were deputed as sports administrators in Chandigarh in 1960-61.

She bagged her master’s degree in political science in 1958 from Punjab University. She is known to have worn ‘salwar kameez’ instead of shorts or skirts while playing national as well as international volleyball tournaments. She retired from service in the early 90s. “Madam has played a big role in building Chandigarh’s sports infrastructure. The Sector 42, Sector 7 and Sector 46 sports complexes were built during her tenure. She made sure Chandigarh had the best sports facilities. She had a heart of gold. Always very kind towards poor athletes,” said Vijaypal Singh, secretary Volleyball Federation of India, who is also secretary of Chandigarh Volleyball Association. Meanwhile, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh condoled the death of Nirmal Milkha Singh. In his condolence message, the CM said, “I am saddened to learn about the death of one of the iconic volleyball players who brought several laurels for the country,” adding, she had rendered remarkable services as director of sports for women.

14-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn owes MC ₹24 crore in property tax||The Chandigarh municipal corporation is yet to recover around ₹24 crore in outstanding property tax from the UT administration. For the 2020-21 fiscal, the civic body had collected more than ₹61 crore against the target of ₹48 crore, which is the highest in its history. For the current fiscal, it has already collected ₹27 crore. “Revenue from property tax could have been higher if government offices had deposited the full outstanding amount of ₹27 crore. But, the tax reconciliation process with the UT administration helped us recover an additional ₹3.6 crore. We expect the administration to deposit more of its outstanding dues in this fiscal,” an MC official said. For the recovery of dues, the MC had had issued notices to the estate office, UT Press Trust, State Transport Authority (STA), Sector 18 hockey stadium, Sector 23 swimming pool, Sector 29 Traffic Police Lines, Sector 35 and 37 civil dispensaries, Sector 38 Government Model High School, Sector 42 sports complex, Lake Club, CLTA Tennis Stadium, roller skating rink, Karuna Sadan, Sector 11 and 19 police stations, Bal Niketan, Old Age Home, Kendriya Pustakalay, football stadium and Sector 17 bus stand among others. The departments managing these buildings have defaulted on property tax payments. MC had also served notices to its own departments, which owed around ₹8 crore. But, after reconciliation, it was reduced to ₹3 crore, which the MC recovered. For the cash-strapped MC, property tax is one of the two major sources of revenue, the other being the collections from charges on water supply. There are 1.40 lakh properties under the jurisdiction of the MC, of which more than 1.2 lakh are taxable. For the 2021-22 fiscal, MC had extended the deadline to avail rebate on the payment of property tax from May 31 to June 30 amid the Covid-induced lockdown. Residential property taxpayers will get rebate of 20% and commercial property taxpayers 10%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-owes-mc-24-crore-in-property-tax-101623615885039.html

A Covid e-pass is still required. There was no weekend curfew in Panchkula, while Chandigarh and Mohali had imposed it on Sunday only.

There was an unexpected rush on Saturday, which led to an hour-long jam.”He said a video of the serpentine queues, which went viral on social media, was from Saturday. “On Saturday, there were over 5,000 vehicles and on Sunday, their number was around 3,000. In pre-Covid times, the number used to be much higher.”“There was traffic because we have to ensure that everyone had an e-pass. It takes time, as many people have not registered themselves and we have to guide them.

There were 23 more deaths in Bengaluru that took the toll to 15,307, data showed. Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa has announced that Bengaluru and 18 other districts in the state will see some relaxations of restrictions while 11 others, who are still witnessing a high positivity rate, will remain under lockdown till at least June 21. Karnataka recorded 7,810 new Covid-19 infections in a 24 hour period, the state government said on Sunday. “Though Karnataka is witnessing a decline of active caseload & new cases of #COVID19, it doesn’t mean that we stop taking precautions. We have to follow #COVID appropriate behaviour at all times to stay safe and defeat this virus,” Dr Giridhara R Babu, epidemiologist and professor at the Public Health Foundation of India and member of Karnataka’s covid-19 task force said on Sunday. There were 18,648 recoveries that brought down the caseload to 180,835, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department on Sunday. The positivity rate was 6.02%. “With 1,29,617 tests and 7,810 new cases in the last 24 hours Karnataka’s positivity rate stands at 6.02%. 18,648 recoveries were reported in the stage today including 4,125 in Bengaluru. With 41,618 tests and 1,348 new cases Bengaluru’s positivity rate stands at 3.23%,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said in a post on Twitter. The Yediyurappa-led government has decided to go in for a phase-wise lifting of curbs to restrict the sudden rush of people coming out of their homes and adding to the risk all over again. The new guidelines will come to force after 6 am on June 14. Karnataka has extended the timings for essential services like grocery, meat, vegetables, liquor and other shops from 6 am to 2 pm, extending it beyond the 10am deadline till June 14.“Do not come out on the streets at once on June 14. Some people are already running around as though they have permission from now itself,” Basavaraj Bommai, Karnataka’s minister for home, law and parliamentary affairs. Yediyurappa has also announced a night curfew on all days from 7pm to 5 am and a weekend curfew to restrict movement in the state at least till June 21. The government has stated that it will review the covid-19 situation closer to closer to June 21 and then take appropriate decisions on further relaxations, if any. Industries and other production facilities have been allowed to operate with 50% strength while garment units have been restricted to 30% due to its labour-intensive process. Meanwhile, the positivity rate in the majority of the 30 districts in the state remain higher than the state’s average of 6.92%, data shows. The coffee growing regions of Chikmagalur and Kodagu have a seven day positivity average of 17.12% and 11.41% (as at 5pm on Saturday), data from the state Covid-19 war room shows.

14-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn again invites interest for noise mapping study||The Chandigarh administration is going to carry out a noise pollution mapping study to understand how the city’s high decibel levels are affecting the environment and residents.“An effort will be made to identify which areas of the city have more noise pollution and what are the reasons for it. Based on the results of the study, appropriate steps will be taken by the administration to prevent noise pollution,” said a UT official on Sunday.The administration has sought expressions of interest from educational institutions and organisations recognised by the central and state governments for carrying out “Study on source identification and mitigation actions for noise pollution using noise mapping and prediction techniques”.“Like air pollution, noise pollution is also an area of concern for the city. The main focus of the study will be to narrow down its causes so that remedial steps can be taken. Depending up on the findings, we can tailor-make solutions for the city,” the official said.The National Green Tribunal had also directed the UT administration to complete this study expeditiously. In response, the UT administration told the green court that equipment have been purchased to monitor noise pollution in Chandigarh.Last year, the administration had sought applications from eligible agencies for conducting the study, but no company had applied. Due to this, the study could not be conducted and now the department concerned has again invited interested educational institutions and other agencies in this regard.Adverse effects of noise pollutionNoise pollution can cause physical and psychological harm to humans as well as animals. Vehicles are considered the main cause of noise pollution. Apart from this, loud music and other types of noise at wedding functions and ceremonies also cause noise pollution. Pollution has an effect on health as well as on human behaviour. Noise pollution can cause problems such as irritation, aggression, high blood pressure, high stress levels, sleep disturbance and hearing problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-again-invites-interest-for-noise-mapping-study-101623615518907.html
14-06-2021||Chandigarh||As lockdown restrictions ease in Ludhiana, so does police action||The tapering coronavirus curve seems to have lulled the district police into a dangerous sense of complacency so much so that no lockdown violations have been registered against defaulters since June 7, which was when the government had eased curbs after a period of strict lockdown. That no lockdown violations took place after shops were allowed to operate till 6pm on weekdays beggars belief, especially as a large number of people can be seen roaming without masks in markets! While police can be seen issuing challans to those venturing out without a mask, there has been a marked decline in the number of challans issued. Police had lodged 208 FIRs against shopkeepers for keeping their shops open after permissible hours between May 10 and June 6 and had issued 9,200 challans to those caught without a face mask in the same period.Shopkeepers, who have suffered extensive losses due to the coronavirus curfew, continue to clandestinely operate after curfew comes into effect to earn a few extra bucks. Partially open shops can be seen during the Sunday lockdown. To evade penalty, they post an aide outside the shop who lets in customers after raising the shutter and keeps a look out for cops. Violations remain rampant, especially in Chaura Bazaar, Ghumar Mandi, Jawahar Nagar Camp, Model Town and Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar.The police’s leniency appears to be directly proportional to the ease in curbs. They had manned the city like fortress till May 26, after which they started giving a little leeway after shops were allowed to open till 3pm. This is evidenced from the 46 FIRs registered between May 26 to June 6 (12 days) against the 161 FIRs registered between May 10 to May 25 (16 days). With the situation normalising, Jagjit Singh, an eatery owner, says, “Though permitting home delivery has brought relief to our business, the government should also allow dine-in option.” Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal says the police are not allowing shops and eateries to operate after permissible hours. “We make sure all shops close at 6pm,” he said.Virus claims three, 112 more test +ve 
14-06-2021||Chandigarh||Even Ambedkar would have been slandered as pro-Pakistan by BJP: Mehbooba||The BJP would have slandered even BR Ambedkar, the father of Indian Constitution, as pro-Pakistan had he been alive, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said Sunday, amidst criticism of Congress leader Digvijaya Singh over his remarks on Article 370.Mehbooba said Article 370 -- which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir before its operative provisions were nullified by the Centre in 2019 -- was granted by the Constitution drafted by Ambedkar, but it has been “subverted” by the Centre. Her remarks came amidst growing criticism of the Congress and Singh over his purported comments in an audio chat on social media that his party will have a “relook” at Article 370 revocation and Jammu and Kashmir’s lost statehood if it returns to power.The BJP has said that Singh’s remarks were part of a larger pattern of the party being “hand in glove” with Pakistan.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, who was a BJP ally for some time in Jammu and Kashmir, criticised the saffron party. “Thank god Ambedkar ji isn’t alive or else he too would be slandered as pro- Pakistan by BJP,” she said on Twitter.Singh had purportedly made the remark during a clubhouse conversation with a person, who the BJP said was a journalist of Pakistani origin.“The decision of revoking Article 370 and reducing the statehood of J&K is extremely, I would say, sad decision, and the Congress party would certainly have a relook on the issue,” Singh had said, according to excerpts of the clubhouse conversation available on social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/even-ambedkar-would-have-been-slandered-as-pro-pakistan-by-bjp-mehbooba-101623615340864.html

However, the Centre later decided to deliver the full batch on a single day.The consignment was received on Saturday. Director, National Health Mission, Dr Nipun Jindal said the vaccine is to be utilised by June 21 and hence the vaccination of 18-45 age group will be carried out throughout the week.Vaccination sessions would be held on June 14-18 and a mop up round will be held on June 19 for the left out doses. “The state plans to use all the vaccine which has been procured by June 19 as the Centre’s new policy of free vaccination for all shall be applicable from June 21 onwards,” he said.In total, around 1,706 sessions are expected for the 18-45 years of age group in the coming week and 1.7 lakh persons would likely be given the shot in this age group. For proper implementation, district authorities have been directed to publish sessions in on-site registration mode/facilitated cohort mobilisation mode in tribal/hard areas. In other areas sessions will be booked online.Slots would be published one day prior to the vaccination to the sessions. For June 14, session day slots have already been booked. Each session would have 100 slots. The vaccination of the other prioritised age groups will be avoided on the same date and site, to avoid confusion. However, districts can plan sessions for 45 years and above age group/prioritised groups with centre allocated vaccine at sites where vaccination of 18-45 age group is not planned.Vaccination of 18-44 age group started in Himachal on May 19. However, the drive was put on hold in June due to the shortage of doses for the particular age group.The hill state has vaccinated more than 25.16 lakh people — 34% of the total population. Of these, 4.38 lakh people have been given second jab as well. Over 3.21 lakh people of age group 18-45 years have received the first shot.

On February 24, a total of 82 people had tested positive across the tricity and since then the number had only risen, shooting up to the peak of 2,612 on May 10. A steady downturn began thereon and since the advent of June, the tricity has logged less than 200 cases on seven days, including five straight days till Sunday.Panchkula was the biggest contributor to the slide on Sunday, as it reported only seven cases, a first since the same number of cases were recorded on February 17, 116 days ago.For the second time in the past four days, Mohali recorded 49 cases and Chandigarh had 54 fresh infections.Also, for the fifth day in a row, tricity’s daily deaths remained below 10, as four people died in Mohali, three in Chandigarh and one in Panchkula, which had recorded no fatality for the past two days.In the first 13 days of June, 2,852 people have tested positive across the tricity – a 90% drop from the 28,649 cases in the same period in May.

14-06-2021||Chandigarh||Monsoon arrives in Chandigarh, road gullies yet to be cleaned||City residents can expect waterlogged roads this year too, with early onset of monsoon catching the UT administration and municipal corporation off-guard. The cleaning of the road gullies and seasonal rivulets flowing through the city has yet to be completed even as monsoon arrived in the city on Sunday.MC officials claimed that nearly 85% of the cleaning work was done and UT officials assured it will be completed in a week’s time, though the tender was floated recently in June. The civic body has around 35,000 road gullies under its purview, while the UT engineering department cleans gullies on other roads under its jurisdiction, like Madhya Marg and Dakshin Marg. It is also responsible for cleaning of seasonal rivulets - Sukhna Choe, N-Choe and Patiala Ki Rao - which is also underway.Last monsoon, several internal sector roads and major roundabouts were flooded, resulting in traffic jams. Due to the laxity in cleaning of rivulets, some areas were also inundated. A flash flood in the Patiala Ki Rao rivulet had flooded New Colony in Khuda Lahora.PC Rana, general secretary of the RWA, Khuda Lahora, New Colony, said, “The floor level of the rivulet has risen, and during the rainy season, it often overflows. Last year was one of the worst as several houses gave away, and internal roads were clogged with garbage and soil brought in by the flash flood.”Fearing a repeat this year, residents had even staged a protest against the administration, demanding immediate cleaning of the rivulet. “The fate of more than 400 houses and around 1,200 families is at stake as the colony is adjacent to the rivulet,” said Rana.In sectors also, residents contended they haven’t seen much work on the ground. Vinod Vashisht, convener, City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations, said, “I doubt the authorities are prepared for the monsoon this year too. There was some work being done by MC around two months back, particularly for Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge. But since then we have only seen road gullies getting clogged with garbage. Heavy rain will leave the roads inundated in no time.”Industrial areas are among the worst-affected locations during the rainy season, with both internal and major roads witnessing water logging. “The road gully cleaning work should be taken up much before monsoon, so the city is prepared for its early onset. We request the MC and administration to complete the work in industrial area as soon as possible,” said Pankaj Khanna, president of the Industries Association, Chandigarh.‘We are prepared’On their part, MC and UT officials claimed that they were prepared for the monsoon. UT chief engineer CB Ojha said, “We have set up a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the cleaning of drains and rivulets. We will complete it in a week’s time, even though we have already done it once. Similarly, we will take another week to clean the Sukhna Choe. It was already cleaned once last month, but as there is time, crucial locations are being covered again. All blocked passages of the Patiala Ki Rao have also been cleaned.”MC executive officer Vijay Premi, who is in-charge of storm water drainage, assured, “We have completed most of the drain cleaning work. Special steps have been taken to clean up points that get choked routinely. Even in the past few weeks, when the city witnessed heavy rain, there was no water logging on the roads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/monsoon-arrives-in-chandigarh-road-gullies-yet-to-be-cleaned-101623614800501.html
14-06-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: Nominating live-in partner for financial products||MUMBAIEven as banks and investment companies have revamped financial products to suit the needs of millennials in our digital age, the restrictions on whether they can nominate a live-in partner, whether same sex or opposite sex, remains a gray area. Bank accounts A nominee has the right to access the account holder’s bank accounts and is entitled to the money deposited in the savings accounts, deposits (both fixed and recurring) and bank lockers (even while the account holder is alive). All banks allow the account holder’s parents, spouse, children or siblings to be nominees, but only a handful permit live-in partners to be nominees. Praveen Bhatt, EVP and head, retail liabilities and direct banking channel, Axis Bank said, “Axis Bank does not restrict any relationship to be eligible for being a nominee in its individual liability accounts, i.e., current accounts, savings accounts, term deposits, etc. Live-in-partner can be a nominee in such accounts.” However, this is more exception than norm. Banks insist on granting joint home loans to married couples or blood relatives. Live-in partners do not hold much ground while applying for loans. Insurance policies Besides parents, spouse, and children, some insurance companies also allow their clients to choose cousins and siblings as nominees. However, live-in partners cannot be nominated in life insurance policies. Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar, an online marketplace for financial products and check the credit score explained why this is so. “In case a live-in partner is made a nominee, there is no way the insurance company can confirm the relationship between the insurer and the nominee, so there is no way of assigning a beneficial nominee to the policy. This leaves the field wide open for legal disputes between the nominee and the legal heirs especially if the policyholder dies intestate. So, to avoid such complications, the insurers prefer not to have live-in partners as nominees.” Health insurance Let us first talk about corporate health insurance that employers extend to their employees. Also called group mediclaim policies, these plans are extended to protect both the employees and their families keeping in mind the rising costs of medical expenses. Many IT and financial services companies allow their employees to include their live-in partners to avail health insurance benefits. Family floater policies cover legally recognised relationships. Though live-in relationships are not deemed illegal, no health policy covers live-in relationships thus necessitating partners to go for individual health plans. Mutual funds Live-in partners can be made nominees to mutual fund schemes subject to the submission of certain documents. “A live-in couple needs to provide proof of cohabitation and submit a declaration of relationship for making the partner a nominee for the financial product. The same may apply to LGBTQ persons as well, but they can’t provide proof of marriage as same-sex marriages are not legal in our country. There always is a risk of biological family members challenging the rights of the nominee after the demise of the person (the will must make it clear that the nominee is the beneficiary). In the absence of clear rules protecting beneficial nominee rights, same sex partners may choose to enter a business relationship and hold joint accounts legally. Specialized professional advice is recommended,” said Raj Khosla, founder and managing director, MyMoneyMantra. Considering there is no formal statute regarding the financial rights of live-in couples, there is a need to have a law in place that can ensure nomination rights to live-in couples like legally married couples. Personal Finance is a weekly feature that aims to provide our readers pertinent and helpful financial information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/personal-finance-nominating-live-in-partner-for-financial-products-101623614558856.html

The petitioner had a dispute with some of his relatives regarding ancestral property.Verma was arrested by the Varanasi police on October 8. On October 12, he filed relevant papers seeking his release, but for verification of papers, the case was adjourned till October 21.According to the petitioner, he was illegally detained from October 12 to 21. He demanded compensation for the period.The court observed: “Public authorities acting in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions oppressively are accountable for their behaviour before authorities created under the statute like the commission or the courts entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining the rule of law.”Referring to the ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of Lucknow Development Authority Vs MK Gupta, the Allahabad high court observed: “Once it is found by the competent authority that a complainant is entitled to compensation for the inaction of those who are entrusted under the Act to discharge their duties in accordance with law, then payment of the amount may be made to the complainant from the public fund immediately but it may be recovered from those who are found responsible for such unpardonable behaviour.”The court also observed that the harassment of a common man by public authorities is socially abhorring and legally impermissible and it may harm him personally but the injury to the society is far more grievous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/allahabad-hc-asks-up-govt-to-implement-policy-to-compensate-illegal-detention-victim-101623614500066.html
14-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Monsoon is here, brace for heavy rain on Monday||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) declared the onset of monsoon in Chandigarh on Sunday after 22.6mm rain through the day.Monsoon has been also declared in northern parts of Haryana and Punjab, though it was expected around June 26.According to IMD, since 2000 it was only in 2008 and now that monsoon arrived in the city as early as June 13. Last year, it was declared on June 24.“The system advanced faster this year due to a low pressure area forming over the Bay of Bengal and an east-west trough forming over Punjab at lower tropospheric levels, along with strong south-westerly winds,” said Shivinder Singh, scientist, IMD.He added that monsoon hadn’t covered all of Haryana and Punjab yet, and had only reached Ambala and Amritsar in the northern areas of both states. But it is likely to spread across the rest of Punjab and Haryana within 48 hours. More than average rainfall likely this yearTalking about the significance of an early monsoon, former IMD Chandigarh director Surender Paul said, “There is a correlation between early onset of monsoon and above average rainfall in the previous years’ data. It is likely that Chandigarh will get more than average rainfall this year. However, weather conditions in the second half of monsoon in August and September must be analysed to determine the excess rain.”According to IMD, monsoon months comprise June, July, August and September and normally 845.7mm rain is received in Chandigarh in this duration.Light rain to continue after MondaySingh said moderate to heavy rain (up to 70mm) was likely in Chandigarh between Monday night and Tuesday morning. Due to high humidity and temperatures, chances of light rain up to 20mm will continue in the following days as well.After the rain subsided on Sunday, the maximum temperature rose to 33.9°C, but was lower than Saturday’s 34.3°C. The night temperature saw a slight rise from 21.2°C to 21.7°C.With more showers expected, the day temperature will remain around 33°C, but night temperature may reach 23°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhmonsoon-is-here-brace-for-heavy-rain-on-monday-101623614440363.html
14-06-2021||Lucknow||UP poised to exceed June’s 10 million Covid vaccine dose target: Yogi Adityanath||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said Uttar Pradesh, at the current pace, was poised to overshoot the target of administering one crore (10 million) Covid vaccine doses in June.“The state has administered a total of 46 lakh (4.6 million) Covid vaccine doses this month (till Saturday). At this pace, the state would be able to overshoot the target of administering one crore doses in June,” he said while reviewing the Covid-19 situation.“All vaccination centres should function regularly, and they must get the supply of vaccines continuously,” he said. Observing that the vaccination drive was going on effectively in the state, he said it should continue like this. “From July, the state aims to administer 10 lakh vaccines per day,” the chief minister said, asking officials to ensure effective preparation for accomplishing the target. “Do all the planning in advance,” he said, asking them to ensure proper arrangements were made for cold chain points and vaccination centres.

14-06-2021||Chandigarh||Congress panel to resolve Punjab crisis meets Rahul||ChandigarhA three-member Congress committee headed by leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge met former president and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi on Sunday to discuss the recommendations given to resolve factionalism in the party’s Punjab unit. The panel, which has All India Congress Committee general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat and former Delhi MP Jai Prakash Agarwal as members, met Rahul at his residence. At the one-hour meeting, the committee’s key recommendations, including revamping of the party’s organisational set-up in Punjab, accommodating Sidhu either in the party or in the state cabinet, reaching out to marginalised castes, were discussed. “The committee discussed the report and he (Rahul) had lots of queries which were answered,” a panel member said. Besides the suggestion regarding fair representation to the Dalits and Hindus, continued statements of party leaders, including Jalandhar Cantonment MLA Pargat Singh, also came up for specific discussion. The meeting, according to a party leader, underlines the urgency being shown by the central leadership. The SAD-BSP electoral alliance and the seat-sharing announced by the two parties on Saturday have set alarm bells ringing in the ruling Congress. The Akalis are said to be in talks with the Left parties as well. Meanwhile, the dissenting leaders, who were indicated that the party high command would take a call on the committee’s suggestions by June 15, have decided to wait for its decision. “We put forth our viewpoint without mincing words, telling the high command the problems and why it needs to intervene urgently. Now, it is for them to act,” one of them said. The committee had submitted its report to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Thursday after holding one-to-one discussions with close to 150 party lawmakers and functionaries from the state. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa were among the prominent state leaders who met the central panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/congress-panel-to-resolve-punjab-crisis-meets-rahul-101623613298397.html

14-06-2021||Lucknow||PM Modi praises Yogi over project for senior citizens||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has praised the Yogi Adityanath government’s implementation of the “Elderline” initiative, a toll-free helpline for senior citizens functional since May 14, in Uttar Pradesh.“Very good initiative! @myogiadityanath,” the PM tweeted after tagging a news report on the success of the “Elderline” project with his tweet. The PM’s praise for the implementation of the central government initiative by the Adityanath government came two days after the UP CM returned after a Delhi visit during which he met President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief JP Nadda. Adityanath was quick to respond to PM’s tweet, acknowledging the praise.“It’s by following your all-inclusive mantra of sabka saath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas that the state government has been able to extend help and emotional support to the elderly,” he responded.“On behalf of the people of the state, I heartily thank you for your wholesome praise,” Adityanath tweeted.UP was among the first few states to operationalise the helpline 14567 initiative for the elderly launched by the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment. Officials said the helpline remains functional from 8am to 8pm, addressing queries of the elders ranging from old age homes, health and mental health related issues, availability of physiotherapy units.Several BJP leaders in Uttar Pradesh, especially those considered close to the chief minister, were seen sharing the PM’s praise for Yogi Adityanath’s implementation of the central government initiative.“After BJP national general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh’s praise of the Yogi Adityanath government’s handling of the Covid situation, now Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself has praised the UP government on yet another project. It shows that the government is working with the right intent,” a BJP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pm-modi-praises-yogi-over-project-for-senior-citizens-101623612940447.html

14-06-2021||Chandigarh||PPCB nails 15 Ludhiana steel units for violations||The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has found glaring anomalies in the working of 15 of the 24 units dealing with electroplating, surface finishing and pickling of raw material in Ludhiana. The role of the common effluent treatment plant (CETP), which is operated by a private company, JBR Technologies, is also questionable as per the PPCB report for lifting effluent from hydrochloric acid (HCL) consuming units without having the requisite methodology to treat the same. The 15 firms, engaged in wire drawing process, are in the dock regarding the use of HCL for the pickling process and further lifting of the spent acid to re-processors, which have no methodology to treat the spent effluent generated from the use of HCL. Principal secretary, science, technology and environment, Punjab, Anurag Verma said these industries have entered agreements for lifting of effluent with M/S JBR Technologies, Kohara Macchiwara Road, Ludhiana, which is a spent sulphuric acid processing unit (common effluent treatment plant). Verma added that after complaints, scientific and technical teams of the PPCB collected samples from the pickling tanks installed by the industries. Of the 24 units inspected, 12 were found using HCL in the pickling process, nine units were found to be H2SO4 consuming and three units were consuming both HCL as well as H2SO4 for the acid pickling process. Firms found using HCL against the norms were identified as Abhay Steel Pvt Limited, Vishnu Wires, United Marathan Engineers, Aggarson Fasteners, Ashish International, Kiscon industries, BD wires and allied industries, Ravindera Alloys Industries, Bansal Industries, Sond Impex, Vallabh Steel and Ganpati Fasteners, Sua Road. “An inquiry was also initiated regarding the supply of HCL in Ludhiana from stockists. The investigation of the industries, which are the bulk consumers, is underway,” said Verma. The inquiry revealed that sulphuric acid is used for better quality, but the process is time consuming and comes at higher costs. As small and marginal industries are always cost conscious, they tend to use HCL instead of sulphuric acid. The common effluent treatment plant that is managed by Ludhiana Effluent Treatment Society (LETS) and operated by a private company, JBR Technologies Pvt Ltd, is also in the dock as the PPCB report states that it is not technically as well as legally appropriate for the pant to lift the effluent from the HCL consuming units as the methodology adopted by it is not effective for the effluent generated from the HCL consuming pickling units. Another spent HCL-based reprocessing unit, Rajchem Global Technologies Pvt Ltd, at Dheri village on Rahon Bajra Road, Ludhiana, has started its operation without obtaining consent to operate (under Water Act, 1974, and Air Act, 1981) and without installing adequate pollution control devices. Further, the report reveals that the unit is lifting HCL-based spent liquor illegally from unknown locations and is not maintaining any record of the operation of the plant. This reprocessing unit (Rajchem Global) has consumed around 28,458 power units from January 2020 to May 2021 generating an electricity bill of ₹11.2 lakh, thus proving it is still in operation illegally, states the report. Verma said strict action will be taken against the defaulters and also the CETP operator for not following the norms. The report also stated that there are 23 big electroplating/surface coating/pickling units, which are getting more than 1 lakh litres per month of effluent lifted to the CETP operator. As such, there is a need to issue directions to these units to install captive effluent treatment plants rather than getting their effluent lifted to CETP operator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ppcb-nails-15-ludhiana-steel-units-for-violations-101623612158258.html

The team, led by project officer (technical), NMCG, Neeraj Gahlawat and comprising NMCG, Varanasi, convener Rajesh Shukla, city health officer Dr NP Singh sprayed the special solution in river Ganga from Dashashwamedh Ghat to Asi Ghat. The team has brought around 15 kg powder from which solution was prepared and sprayed. “Around 3000 litre solution was prepared using 7.5 kg powder and sprayed in a long stretch of river Ganga in Varanasi to disintegrate algae strains and prevent algal bloom,” said Neeraj Gahlawat. He said around 3000 litre solution will be sprayed in river Ganga on Monday too. On Tuesday, spot inspection would be done, and situation will be assessed.“Solution was sprayed at Dashashwamedh Ghat stretch on Sunday morning. In the afternoon, when we reached the same spot, the algal bloom was nowhere in the stretch. It means the solution disintegrated the algae,” said Rajesh Shukla. The algal bloom was seen in the Ganga nearly 20 days back. After few days, it disappeared and was seen again in the same stretch of the Ganga around a week ago. Thereafter, district magistrate, Varanasi, Kaushal Raj Sharma constituted a team of experts on June 7. The team collected samples from the Ganga and testing was done UP pollution control board, laboratory. The samples were tested and it was found that the algae strains coming from STP, Mirzapur caused algal bloom in the Varanasi stretch. UPPCB scientific officer Dr TN Singh said, “We collected samples of the Ganga water from various stretch of the river to find out the cause of algal bloom in river Ganga in Varanasi. The samples were tested, and results revealed that algae strains drained into the river Ganga from Mirzapur district’s Chunar oxidation pond and STP. These algae flourished in Varanasi stretch of river Ganga due to presence of nitrogen and phosphorous (though mild) which mainly come in the river water from untapped drains.” A 50 MLD untapped drain in Asi area falls into the river Ganga. Likewise, another 10 MLD untapped Ramnagar drain also falls into the river. The nitrogen and phosphorus reach the river with the sewage water, said Dr Singh adding that nitrogen and phosphorous act as fertilizer for the algae and it blooms. The UPPCB officials submitted the report to the district magistrate on June 11. Moreover, NMCG sent a team for preventing algal bloom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nmcg-team-sprays-solution-in-the-ganga-to-remove-algal-bloom-101623611137478.html

14-06-2021||Mumbai||Major dip in foreign students enrolling at Mumbai varsity amid pandemic||Amid the pandemic, the international student count of the University of Mumbai dipped to 101 in the 2020-21 academic year from 209 and 227 foreign national or non-resident Indian (NRI) students who had confirmed their admissions in 2018-19 and 2019-20, respectively, data revealed.For years, Nepal contributed to a majority of international students approaching MU-affiliated colleges or departments for higher education opportunities. From 26 and 28 students confirming admissions in the past two academic years, 2020-21 saw only five students from Nepal in MU. Similarly, 42 students from Afghanistan had confirmed admissions in MU in 2019-20, but in 2020-21, not a single student from the country registered for admissions.Usually, NRIs make up for the largest chunk of international students approaching MU. Nut only five NRI students confirmed admissions in 2020-21, compared to 85 and 92 students in 2018-19 and 2019-20, respectively.“Several foreign nationals usually opt for undergraduate (UG) as well as postgraduate (PG) degrees in innovative self-financed courses and in the field of science and research,” said a varsity spokesperson, adding that every year, students who visit MU under exchange programmes end up liking a course and come back to seek admission soon after. “The pandemic, however, has forced students to rethink and re-plan. So may have postponed their plans for foreign education by a year at least,” he said.While applications from several countries dipped in the 2020-21 academic year, surprisingly those from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States of America (USA) increased as compared to the previous years. From 11 UAE students in 2019-20 and 17 in 2018-19, the count rose to 29 in 2020-21, while 15 students from the US confirmed admissions as opposed to 12 in 2019-20.“Many foreign nationals choose to pursue PG degree in languages as well as science and research. I have been in touch with some of my UG students who are foreign nationals and they specifically deferred their higher education plans in MU by a year because of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said the head of a foreign language department at MU, on the condition of anonymity. She added that this dip will only be a temporary trend and colleges are expecting the numbers to rise in the upcoming admission season.Several Mumbai colleges also attract students from across the country every year and the pandemic, however, has not discouraged such students from approaching city institutes for admissions. “At the beginning of the 2020-21 academic year we were worried that the number of outstation and international students will be affected. But were surprised to see more applications that ever of students from Gujarat, Rajasthan as well as Bihar,” said Ashok Wadia, principal of Jai Hind College, Churchgate.“We have previously also received applications of students from USA, Australia and the UK (United Kingdom). But last year, applications from international students had dropped,” he said, adding that several NRI students, especially from Dubai, Kuwait and Qatar still approached the college for admissions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/major-dip-in-foreign-students-enrolling-at-mumbai-varsity-amid-pandemic-101623610177234.html
14-06-2021||Other||Local bodies to transfer central funds to govt for buying covid-19 vaccine||Moga Even as the Centre has promised free vaccine to state governments, local body institutions under the rural development and panchayat department in the state are passing resolutions to handover Central ‘untied funds’ meant for development of rural areas to the state government for procurement of Covid-19 vaccine. The Centre has released ‘untied funds’ of ₹205 crore to Punjab last month to distribute it to local bodies for the development of rural areas. All five block samitis in Moga have passed such resolutions and the zila parishad is scheduled to pass it on Tuesday. Rural development and panchayat department officials say the government had told districts to transfer rural development funds of the 15th Finance Commission of the Centre for vaccine procurement in a video conference, a few days ago. Top officials of the department had also held a meeting with representatives of zila parishads and block samitis in Moga.“The department has sent a pro forma for passing the resolution. Zila parishad and block samitis have to write just their name and amount of funds,” said an official. Inderjit Singh, chairman, zila parishad, Moga, said, “Rural development and panchayat department director had visited Moga on June 5, and verbally directed us to transfer funds for vaccine procurement.” Jagjit Singh Bal, DDPO, Moga, said, “Almost all block samitis have passed such resolutions. The meeting pertaining to the resolution of the zila parishad will be held on Tuesday. The gram panchayats are also doing this gradually.” Subhash Chander, ADC (D), Moga, said, “The department had asked us to get such resolutions passed in a meeting via video conference. The Centre has decided to provide vaccines to states free of cost, but the state government is yet to issue any direction. If the government directs not to pass such resolutions, we will not do it.” Barjinder Singh, alias Makhan Brar, youth leader, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), said, “The money is supposed to be spent on rural infrastructure development. Instead of sending verbal orders, the government should work through written orders.” Seema Jain, additional chief secretary of the department, said, “The matter of utilisation of ‘untied funds’ for procurement of vaccine was under consideration. There is no official order yet. Some blocks may have passed such resolutions, but it does not mean that we are using their money for vaccine procurement, as the Centre has made it free for all states. The passing of a resolution does not mean that the money has been transferred.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/local-bodies-to-transfer-central-funds-to-govt-for-buying-covid-19-vaccine-101623610117952.html
14-06-2021||Mumbai||Will go solo in all polls: Maharashtra Congress||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s statement that the state’s three ruling parties will fight polls together, and his meeting with poll strategist Prashant Kishor this week have left one of its alliance partners, the Congress, fuming. The Maharashtra Congress, while reacting sharply to the developments, has said that it will go solo in all the elections that will be held henceforth in Maharashtra, and that its allies should not take the party for granted.On Thursday, during NCP’s 22nd foundation day celebrations, Pawar had said that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, will fight the next Lok Sabha and Assembly polls together. He also said that MVA will complete its term and hailed Sena for its past records of standing firm on its commitments on political support. A day after the statement, Pawar and other party leaders met Kishor at the NCP chief’s Mumbai residence, leading to speculations of political developments in the state and the country.NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik’s statement on Saturday fuelled the speculations further, prompting Congress to react.“There is a need to form a formidable alliance of Opposition parties against the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) at national level, ahead of the next general elections. Pawarsaheb had himself spoken about the need to have such a national alliance and had said that he would try to bring together all such forces,” Malik said.Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said that his party would fight all the forthcoming elections alone.“We already have announced that we will go solo in all forthcoming local body elections, likely to be held from November, and thereafter the Assembly polls too. We do not want to keep our allies in the dark and ditch them ahead of the polls. We are preparing to go solo and they too are free to do so. The Congress will be the single-largest party in 2024 Assembly polls,” he said.Party’s working president Arif Naseem Khan said that the party will benefit if the local elections are fought on its own.“It will also help in regaining the old glory when the party used to form the government in the state singlehandedly. Patole’s statement is the party’s official stand,” he said.Malik, while reacting to statements by Congress leaders, on Sunday said that there were no talks held between the three ruling parties.“Patole aspires to become the chief minister of Maharashtra, and the statement has come out of it [his ambition]. Every party has the right to spread its wings and such statements are necessary to keep the morale of the workers high. The MVA alliance is ruling unitedly by taking decisions close to the heart of the people. We may fight the local body elections by forming an alliance of three or two ruling parties, or even separately, depending on the political situations at the local level. There are no talks held about the Lok Sabha or Assembly elections for the alliance yet,” he said.The contradictory statements have led to speculations over the differences between the three ruling parties. The Congress, since the government was formed in November 2019, has been complaining about secondary treatment by its allies. Party leaders feel that the Sena and NCP have been on the same page when it comes to keeping the Congress out of the decision-making process.More than 15 municipal corporations (including Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane), 29 of 36 district councils and over 90 municipal councils will go for polls over the next 20 months. The election bandwagon to these local bodies in such a huge number is considered as the mini assembly polls. NCP and Shiv Sena are likely to join hands in most of the local body elections by keeping the Congress out.BJP leader Ram Kadam said that the contradictory statements by Congress and NCP indicate the differences between the ruling parties.“It is a proven fact now that the Congress is not happy with CM Uddhav Thackeray and hence, they have been talking about going solo. It needs to be understood if Congress’ anger is out of the differences between them or because the other two parties are grabbing major share of power,” he said.Malik said it would be wrong to draw conclusions over their statements.Political analyst Pratap Asbe said, “The decision over the alliance in elections is taken by Congress’ central leadership. There is no meaning to what the state leaders of the party say. They keep saying things to keep the leadership happy. As far as the question of putting up an alliance of Opposition parties against BJP at national level is concerned, it all depends on the stand taken by Congress,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/will-go-solo-in-all-polls-maharashtra-congress-101623609937231.html
14-06-2021||Mumbai||No info on mangrove cover in Nhava Sheva, says JNPT||The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), which is legally mandated to transfer 913 hectares (ha) of mangroves on its property in Nhava Sheva to the Maharashtra forest department for safekeeping as per an order of the Bombay high court (HC), has claimed that it does not have any information as to the current extent of mangrove cover on its land. This was revealed on June 7, in response to a Right to Information (RTI) request. In response to a query, filed by BN Kumar of the environment group NatConnect Foundation, seeking details about the total hectares under mangroves at entire JNPT “as on date”, JNPT through its public information officer RA Mhatre has said the “details are not available.” The response has drawn the ire of environmentalists and experts, who have criticised JNPT on multiple occasions for failing to comply with HC’s final order, dated September 17, 2018, to transfer the mangroves on all government land to the forest department within three months. JNPT has been previously accused of wilfully reclaiming the mangrove cover at Nhava Sheva, burying several dozens of ha under mud and debris. A site visit to the area by an HT team earlier this month found that mangroves at the edge of the Belpada wetland were being actively reclaimed in an organised fashion by dump trucks and earth-moving machines. JNPT officials though, said they have received HC’s permission for road-laying work in the area. Previously, JNPT has been penalised by the HC-appointed mangrove protection and conservation committee for destroying at least 4,500 mangroves to make way for its container terminal-4 port expansion project. A JNPT spokesperson, who did not wished to be named, emphasised that the RTI response does not mean a denial of the fact that there are mangroves in Nhava Sheva. “There certainly are. Initially, there were about 900ha in 2016, but we do not have a current assessment on how much of the mangrove area remains. As the RTI applicant has asked for the area “as on date”, we have responded saying that these details are not available,” the spokesperson said. Until at least February, JNPT’s website, under a section titled ‘Environment Push’, also contained a declaration that it has 913.6ha of mangroves on its land in Uran. This section has now been removed. When asked for reasons behind the same, the JNPT spokesperson said, “The part about mangrove cover has been removed from the website because there is no current data on mangrove cover. The port planning and development department is carrying out an assessment and the true area, as of date, will be uploaded.” The spokesperson did not mention the timeframe in which this is to be done. The website does, however, still mention: “The total land available with JNPT is around 3,402ha. Out of this, 1,147ha area (34%) of the port is under green cover, including mangroves.” On February 12, the state mangrove cell had written to JNPT, asking it to comply with the HC order. In a letter issued to the chairman of JNPT, Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell), had asked the port authority to notify mangrove area under its control under section 4 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, “at the earliest”. Once notified, the mangrove area has to be handed over to the mangroves cell for better conservation. “It had come to our notice that JNPT had not yet started the process of notifying mangrove land despite a court order in 2018. As we don’t have any information regarding the mangrove area owned or controlled by JNPT, we had been waiting for the port trust to start the process on its own. We have not received any response from them as of date,” said Tiwari. In December, environment group Vanashakti had issued a contempt notice to JNPT for failing to hand over mangrove land under their jurisdiction. In January, Vanashakti filed a petition in HC, seeking an immediate transfer of all mangrove lands to the forest department. “The JNPT’s response amounts to concealment of material facts. If there were 900-odd ha at the time of the court order, then those need to be handed over immediately. Their response also seems to imply that there has been a reduction in the area, which is in itself a violation of HC’s directions,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti. JNPT officials emphasize that the area of mangroves within JNPT “as on date” is tentative and the exact area of mangroves needs to be finalised before any further action is taken. HT also learnt that JNPT has approached the Maharashtra Remote Sensing Application Centre (MRSAC) for demarcation of its mangrove area, and that the latter responded with a work proposal in the first week of June. “Following demarcation of mangrove area of JNPT through MRSAC after approval, notification, the port trust may handover mangroves land to forest department,” a senior JNPT official said to HT on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-info-on-mangrove-cover-in-nhava-sheva-says-jnpt-101623609817399.html
14-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra still not out of Covid-19 danger: Experts||There is still potential for a surge in Covid-19 cases despite the steady drop over the past few weeks, health experts warned, amid the unlocking of activities in the state since June 1. They feel that although the devastating second wave has subsided, various factors like the large number of cases in some districts, lack of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, and slow pace of vaccination, still remain a matter of concern.On Sunday, the state recorded 10,422 cases, taking the tally to 5,908,992, and 483 deaths, pushing the toll to 111,104. Mumbai reported 695 cases and 19 deaths, taking the tally to 715,660 and toll to 15,183. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the state on Covid-19 management, points out that the danger of another disastrous Covid-19 wave still persists. “We need to continuously monitor the incidence and recoveries daily, along with tests. It is imperative to speed up the pace of vaccination. If we see the cases graph as constant when on its downward journey, then it’s a warning sign. Then if we see an upward trend, it is definitely a danger sign, where again restrictions need to be imposed,” said Salunkhe. Salunkhe voiced his concerns to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar during a meeting last week.In the past week, the number of new Covid-19 cases has averaged 11,030 per day. There were 77,211 cases in the period between June 7 and June 13. A week before it, between May 30 and June 6, there were 103,489 new Covid-19 cases — a daily average of 14,784.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said steps are being taken to reduce cases in those districts where cases are still high. “We are now focused on reducing the cases in six districts like Kolhapur, Raigad, Satara, Kolhapur, Ratnagiri and Pune, where the positivity rate is more than 10%,” said Awate.He said that the unlocking was being done in a scientific manner on basis of the positivity rates and oxygen-bed occupancy to facilitate the opening up of the lockdown.Mumbai, which has been reporting a declining trend in terms of positivity rate, moved to level two from level three of the unlocking classifications this week. Level two of unlock requires positivity rate to be below 5% and oxygen bed occupancy to be between 25% and 40%, which were fulfilled by Mumbai. However, the Brihamumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to stick to the relaxations applicable to level-three areas to ensure that the virus spread does not see a rise in cases. Mumbai clocked 695 new cases on Sunday with 19 deaths.Dr Awate said BMC is right in its decision. “Although the city may meet the criteria which means curbs needs to be relaxed, the fact remains that BMC, which works on the ground level is the best judge of the situation. Hence, its justified in taking this decision,” said Dr Awate.Awate said the “carrot and stick approach” is being adopted for those not adhering to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. “We are making the people aware on the consequences of not wearing masks or not maintaining social distance and also fining them,” said Awate.Maharashtra’s mortality rate has gone up significantly over the past two weeks as the state authorities have reconciled 15,996 deaths during this period.There were 212,536 tests conducted on Sunday, while the total number of cases from the time of outbreak has now reached 5,908,992. The toll has now reached 111,104 with Pune leading with 15,187 deaths, followed closely by Mumbai with 15,183 deaths. The number of active cases recorded were 155,588 with Pune again leading with 18,571, followed by Mumbai with 18,166.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-still-not-out-of-covid-19-danger-experts-101623609757248.html

This was done as per government direction,” said a GNDU spokesperson. “Some companies who have issued offer letters are finding it difficult to evolve a criteria to hire prospective employees in absence of concrete and comprehensive evidence of their academic performance in form of detailed marks cards of all the semesters,” he said, adding that online exams without university supervision had been rejected. On its part, the university had conducted students’ survey by creating a dedicated page to take feedback from students, as to their choice of the method of examination and also the fallacies in the exams held last year.“The overwhelming majority of the students have favoured offline examinations. The university has conveyed this to the Punjab government. However, GNDU will conduct examinations as per guidelines and directions from the state government,” the spokesperson added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-hits-lives-300-gndu-students-have-job-offers-but-no-marksheets-101623609697914.html
14-06-2021||Mumbai||Thane creek lost 30sqkm in 48 yrs: Study||The Thane Creek – a coastal inlet off Mumbai’s eastern waterfront, which separates the city from the Maharashtra mainland – has shrunk by 12% in 48 years, according to an unpublished study by the state forest department’s mangrove cell. The analysis shows that the creek’s water spread area reduced to 202 square kilometres (sqkm) in 2020 from 232 sq km in 1972. About 30 sq km of the waterway has been lost to new mudflats and mangroves.The study was carried out by Anjaneyulu Adluri, a geographic information systems (GIS) specialist with the mangrove cell, using Landsat satellite images for the years 1972, 1978, 1988, 2000, 2010, 2014 and 2020, and confirms that “there is an overall increase in the spatial extent of mangroves and reduction in the width of the Thane Creek.”Adluri’s analysis is in line with a similar study published by Srushti Conservation Foundation (SCF) and led by Dr Deepak Apte, former director of the Bombay Natural History Society on June 4. Apte’s analysis had shown that the larger Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has lost 107.6 sq km of waterways and agricultural lands along its coast between 1990 and 2019, as a result of siltation that is likely caused by the deposition of untreated sewage and other waste into the city’s creeks.The cumulative area lost is larger than Sanjay Gandhi National Park, which is 103 sq km in size. Of this, about 24 sq km of waterway in Thane Creek were lost between 1990 and 2019, Apte’s analysis suggested. Viewed together, results from both the studies indicate that there has been a sharp increase in the rate of siltation in recent years. About 9 sq km of water spread was lost since 2014 at a rate of 1.5 sq km per year, the mangrove cell has shown in their study (an executive summary of which was shared with HT).The report also notes an increase in the cover of new mangroves, which propagate after taking root in the newly created mudflats. “The mangrove area around Thane Creek has increased from 68.11 sq km in 2014 to 79 sq km in 2020, which is a 10.72 sq km increase in mangrove area in the past six years,” Adluri has noted in his study.The mangrove cell has said that it will seek the Bombay high court’s permission to uproot these new mangroves, which have grown just before and after the Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary was declared in 2015. HT was the first to report on this development on June 5.“Flamingos and migratory waders are presently benefiting from the shrinking waterways as their population increase is being witnessed in the same trajectory as the expansion of mudflats and mangroves. This in combination with high sewage load that MMR is pumping into the creek as well as warm water from refineries and power plants make it a perfect feeding ground, with nutrient rich flora and fauna,” said Apte. However, once the accreted land is taken over by mangroves in combination with reduction in tidal prism during non-monsoon months, soft mudflats turn into hard and barren land. “Thus, flamingos could permanently move away from the area,” Apte added.Shrinking creeks also mean shallower creeks, which spell bad news for Mumbai at a time when previous studies have indicated a rise in sea levels by 0.5 to 3mm per year in the Arabian Sea, along with of extreme rainfall events in the foreseeable future. Simply put, shallow creeks cannot hold as much water; so even with a slight increase in sea-level rise and precipitation levels, the combined impact of high-tide and heavy rainfall will lead to a spill-over of water into the city, disrupting the lives and livelihoods of coastal populations and exacerbating degradation of otherwise productive coastal lands.Published studies, such as the one from January 2020 in the Journal of Coastal Conservation and another by the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (SACON) and the BN Bandodkar College of Science, Thane, have also noted or demonstrated the siltation issue in Thane Creek. “Considering the seriousness of this issue where the width of creeks is reducing owing to excess siltation, scientific removal of mangroves will have to be carried out to protect the original coastline,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), mangrove cell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/thane-creek-lost-30sqkm-in-48-yrs-study-101623609577196.html
14-06-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Drains along tracks helped WR keep trains running through rain||The drains with new pipelines measuring 1,780 meters alongside the railway tracks, helped Western Railway (WR) in averting waterlogging at three crucial spots this monsoon. It helped WR to operate the suburban locals uninterrupted last week amid heavy rainfall.The WR constructed drains, retaining walls and installed 1,780 meters of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes alongside the railway tracks. The installation of pipes and construction of drains was done between Grant Road and Bandra; Virar and Goregaon and Dadar and Mahim railway stations.First-of-its-kind on the Western Railway, the installation of HDPE pipes along with tracks helped in pumping out water from the tracks during heavy rainfall last week. The WR services were operational without any glitch throughout, as the city received heavy rainfall.On the Grant Road and Bandra railway section, the zonal railway has installed 460 meters of HDPE pipe and constructed an 800 meters drain. Between Dadar-Matunga and Mahim 680 meters of HDPE pipe has been inserted and 500 meters of the drain is constructed along the railway tracks. On the Virar and Goregaon section, 580 meters of HDPE pipes along with three retaining walls are constructed.“The small techniques have helped us a lot in avoiding waterlogging on critical locations throughout last week heavy rains. With the installation and construction, the water pumping capacity at each location has been increased. The capacity has increased up to 320% between Grant Road and Bandra, 280% between Virar and Goregaon and 300% between Dadar-Matunga and Mahim railway stations,” said a senior WR official.In 2020, due to waterlogging instances owing to heavy rainfall train services on the WR were suspended during the monsoon. In 2018, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had to rescue 1,000 passengers who got stuck in outstation trains due to waterlogging between Nallasopara and Vasai railway stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-drains-along-tracks-helped-wr-keep-trains-running-through-rain-101623609337170.html

During further search officials found 35gm of marijuana and arrested a 20-year-old woman and another person Elston Fernandes.After interrogation of the duo, the agency intercepted the main supplier Jagat Chaurasia at Bandstand in Bandra and during the search allegedly seized 125gm of marijuana from him late at night on Saturday, said Wankhede. The agency discovered that drug suppliers were selling marijuana where edible weed is used for baking cake. Chaurasia supplied many people and Fernandes is one of them who has converted his house into a bakery shop, said Wankhede. The case has been registered under relevant sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act against three accused. During interrogation, it was learnt that the accused found the idea of selling edible weed with brownie cake through an online streaming service. The accused were produced in the court on Sunday and remanded three days in NCB custody for further investigation, added Wankhede. The NCB issued a statement, “A cannabis edible or edible weed pot brownie is a food product (either homemade or produced commercially) that contains cannabis extract as an active ingredient. Edible weed pots are a way to consume cannabis. Cannabis edibles may affect people for a longer period than smoked cannabis”. “The important base to all food edibles is that it has fat that has been infused with THC (a psychoactive compound in cannabis). In other words, any food that contains butter, oil, milk, or any fatty substance can be turned into an edible. Examples of cannabis-infused foods include baked goods, candy, potato chips, and more. One may not be able to distinguish between regular baked goods and those containing cannabinoids which tend to have a slightly green tinge and often emit a faint cannabis smell” reads the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ncb-arrests-three-for-baking-selling-cakes-mixed-with-drugs-in-mumbai-101623609157160.html

Visuals of the act went viral on social media leading to a reaction against the legislator and his party.Lande made the contractor sit on the waterlogged drain and asked his aide and party workers to pour the silt and garbage on him. The legislator was seen asking why his boss did not come to the spot.“You will have to sit in the drain until your boss comes. The waterlogging exists for the past eight days but you have no time to clean the drains. We were forced to clean it up,” Lande is seen threatening the contractor amid the abuses hurled at him.Lande said that he punished the contractor to make him realise the situation the people of his area are going through. “The people of Sanjay Nagar and Sundarbaug (in Kurla) have been wading through the dirty water and clogged streets for the last few days. I had to resort to the street along with party workers and Shiv Sena corporators and get the drains cleaned. I made him sit in the waterlogged drains so that he realised the plight of the people,” he said.Though the video clips were released by his office, Lande was not available for comments, despite repeated attempts.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya has slammed Sena MLA calling it hooliganism. “Mumbai mayor says 103% garbage removed by BMC & Shivsena MLA Dilip Lande assaulting Contractor from not removing Garbage.

14-06-2021||Mumbai||Covid pandemic: Children putting on weight, doctors warn of health risks||With schools shut, restrictions on playgrounds and hours spent in front of screens, children are gaining weight, which, according to doctors, is a worrying trend and could contribute to Covid-19 complications in paediatric patients. In the second wave, children with obesity or high body mass index needed more clinical attention. Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital, said almost 30-40% of paediatric patients with Covid-19 infection who were treated in intensive care units (ICU) or ventilators at the hospital in April were overweight. “During the peak of the pandemic, we got several paediatric patients who were overweight or obese. Due to their underlying health issues, they take longer time to recover than others,” she said. Similarly, Dr Tushar Parikh, pediatrician from Motherhood Hospital, said, “Such children tend to develop more complications like acute pneumonia which requires treatment in the ICU.” Hospitals like Nanavai Max Super Speciality Hospital, Bombay Hospital have witnessed a rise in the number of children suffering from obesity-related cardiac, respiratory and diabetes complications. “Children can’t go to school, or play outside due to the Covid-19 safety restrictions. It is affecting their mental health also which often makes them irritable and aggressive. This also leads to overeating and consumption of junk foods,” said Dr Harish Shetty, a city-based psychiatrist. Dr Parikh claimed that obese children with mild Covid-19 infection can turn severe. “An obese child is prone to early onset of heart problems and diabetes, which brings down the immunity. So they become more vulnerable to Covid-19. Even after contracting the infection, their underlying health condition can contribute to further worsening of their infection.” Health experts say the lockdown has negatively impacted sleep, eating habits and physical activity among children. In fact, doctors are getting children as young as two years old who are gaining weight due to the sedentary lifestyle. “In children, obesity can lead to a metabolic syndrome (a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes), which can be a serious problem in adolescence,” said Dr Subhash Rao, senior paediatrician, Fortis Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi. According to a study, ‘Obesity as a risk factor for severe illness from Covid-19 in the paediatric population’, obesity leads to persistent immune dysregulation and is associated with increased susceptibility to infections that lead to sepsis and death. It has been postulated that chronic inflammation-hypercytokinemia, endothelial dysfunction, cardiac abnormalities, and pro-thrombotic environment are possible mechanisms through which obesity leads to worse Covid-19 outcomes. The study has been conducted by Ascension Sacred Heart, University of Florida, Pensacola, USA. In the conclusion, the study read: “With increasing pediatric infections due to Covid-19, risk factors for disease severity are becoming evident with obesity prevailing as a major risk for the pediatric population.” “Children with obesity need better observation and the treating doctors should be more careful,” said Dr Bakul Parekh, past president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) and part of the paediatric Covid task force. Dr Rao suggested that the children eat a healthy diet that will ensure they get all micronutrients, vitamins and the right number of calories to build their immunity. “Also, ensure at least one hour of physical activity in the form of exercises at home, dancing, using stairs instead of lift among others. Limit the consumption of “JUNCS” food i.e. (junk foods, ultra-processed foods, nutritionally inappropriate foods, caffeinated/colored/carbonated food/ beverages, sugar-sweetened beverages),” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/kids-don-t-let-pandemic-weigh-you-down-101623607957793.html

Only one healthcare worker and five front-line workers took the second dose of vaccine shot.Dr Yadav said, “On Monday, there will be a vaccination drive at 31 primary health centres for the first dose of Covishield for 18-45 years and six centres will vaccinate people for the second dose of Covaxin. These are all walk-ins. “There are 200 slots at each centre and people need to visit the sites on time. Four sites have been dedicated for health workers and front-line workers at Tigra, Chauma, Badshahpur and Manesar, but only for second jabs,” he said.Yash Garg, Gurugram’s deputy commissioner, said, “People should still maintain social distancing and wear face masks to ensure their health safety. We have been regularly holding awareness camps and have motivated the residential welfare associations to ensure all residents are vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-gurugram-records-lowest-single-day-spike-since-feb-22-101623606279734.html
14-06-2021||Gurugram||Residents of Gurugram’s Khori Gaon to continue protest||Residents of Khori Gaon Basti in Faridabad said they will continue to protest against the plans to demolish their houses without rehabilitating them, even as eight people were arrested and 10 booked for blocking a road in Faridabad’s Surajkund last Friday. The police said that more than 150 men, women and children gathered in violation of Covid-19 safeguards to block the Faridabad-Delhi road and raise slogans against the authorities.The police said that they were protesting against the impending demolition of their houses following a Supreme Court order in Khori Gaon Basti colony which was constructed illegally on the foothills of the Aravallis 20 years ago. There are nearly 10,000 houses with a population of around 100,000 that will be displaced as the demolition drive is set to start on Wednesday. The police said that the dwellers were demanding rehabilitation and are not ready to vacate the area fearing being homeless.Residents of the area are demanding the release of the arrested persons and rehabilitation ahead of the demolition drive. They said they have hired lawyers who will help them get the bail of the victims.Sonu Kumar, a resident who has been living in the colony for the last 15 years, said that the residents have invested a huge amount to buy the houses there. “The government has to come up with a solution as to who will bear the loss of property. How can they demolish and give no alternative for our rehabilitation? We will protest on Monday again in our colony to give a clear message that we will not let the drive take place,” he said.Milesh Kumar (29), a social activist and a member of Basti Suraksha Manch, who works on issues of housing rights, said that people arrested from the spot were holding a silent protest and they were not violating any Covid-19 guidelines. “All of them are demanding reallocation and an alternative plan so that they get a space to live. People have built double and three-storey houses but the administration and government have turned a blind eye for the last 20 years. Why did they let the constructions take place?” he said.The eight persons arrested on Friday were booked under sections 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment), 114 (abettor present when offence is committed), 147 (riot), 149 (unlawful assembly), 186 (whoever voluntarily obstructs any public servant in the discharge of his public functions), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant)., 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 283 (danger or obstruction in public), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 61 of the Disaster Management Act at Surajkund police station.Anshu Singla, the deputy commissioner of police (NIT), said that they received information about the gathering near the Faridabad-Delhi border around 6.30am. “Even small children were brought to the spot and they all were violating Covid-19 protocols. When our teams asked them to maintain social distancing and wear face masks, they refused to follow their directions. All of them shouted slogans against the state government and the Faridabad municipal corporation authorities,” she said.Singla said that despite repeated directions, protesters did not pay heed to them and were not ready to unblock the road, following which they arrested eight people and detained several others. “We have got the videography done of the incident and pictures have been clicked, from which we are identifying more people who are likely to be arrested,” she said.Residents said that constructions were taking place in the colony since 2000, while demolition drives were held in September 2015 and last April, wherein 1,000 and 2,000 houses, respectively, were razed.Following the demolition of 300 houses in April this year, the dwellers of Khori village had approached the Supreme Court for protection, seeking rehabilitation before the demolition of their houses. On April 6, the Khori Gaon residents’ welfare association held a day-long peaceful protest outside the office of the commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad and the deputy commissioner.After the Supreme Court, last Monday, ordered the eviction of thousands of slum dwellers encroaching on the Aravalli forest area, they are demanding temporary rehabilitation and action against those who sold land to them decades ago.The land where 15 colonies were built is notified under special sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA), which extends protection against land-use change to certain specified Aravalli areas, forests and trees. According to directives of the Supreme Court, the PLPA attracts protection under the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, which states that “no state government or other authority shall make, except with the prior approval of the central government, any order directing that any forest land or any portion thereof may be used for any non-forest purpose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/illegal-colonies-khori-gaon-residents-to-continue-protest-eight-in-police-custody-101623606279274.html
14-06-2021||Delhi||Behind crime spree, 4 petty thieves trying to ‘make it big’||Nearly five hours after committing a series of crimes in the early hours of June 8, including allegedly robbing a truck driver and shooting him dead in west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh, four car-borne robbers returned to the crime scene in another car to observe the actions of the police, investigators said after arresting and questioning three suspects. Police said they are on the lookout for the fourth suspect.They said the men, who were arrested by a team from the northwest district’s special staff on Friday, allegedly confessed to committing seven crimes, six of them within an hour, in five districts while driving 70-80 kilometres around the city in the intervening night of June 7 and 8.“Their sole objective was to mark their entry into Delhi’s crime world. Previously, all four committed petty thefts such as stealing batteries of parked vehicles, mostly in Ghaziabad. But they were not satisfied with their crimes and the earnings, so they decided to make it big for themselves. They had purchased two pistols and bullets and that emboldened them. However, our team arrested them and shattered their dreams,” said deputy commissioner of police (northwest) Usha Rangnani, quoting the disclosures of the three arrested suspects, identified as Rizwan, Shamshad and Nasir.While only four crimes were reported to the police, investigators said they are now trying to identify and locate the victims in the other three crimes, which included the alleged theft of four wheels of a parked car that the suspects used to replace the old wheels of their Santro car. Police said they allegedly stole the wheels to ensure the tyres do not burst during the crime spree or in case they faced a police chase.The fourth suspect, Bhola, who is still absconding, drove the stolen silver-coloured Santro car during the crime spree. The car, which was found to be stolen from Jahangirpuri in November 2020, allegedly remained in the possession of Bhola, a resident of Mukundpur in outer Delhi from where the crime spree began on the night of June 7. Police found the vehicle in a charred state in an agricultural field in a village in Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh, on Friday after questioning the arrested men.Around 10 pm on June 7, Bhola left his home for Loni in the stolen car and returned to his room around 11 pm with Rizwan, Shamshad and Nasir. The accused reportedly consumed liquor and around 11.30 pm, embarked on the crime spree .They first allegedly stole four wheels of another Santro car parked in Mukundpur area and replaced their car’s wheels with them near Azadpur vegetable market. They remained in the area till 2.15 am on June 8, eating omelettes at a roadside stall and discussing their next course of action. Police said a CCTV camera from the area captured them replacing the wheels and its footage is now a key evidence in the investigation.Around 2.30am, the four reached a residential neighbourhood in Singalpur village in northwest Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh, where their alleged attempt to steal the battery of a parked e-rickshaw was thwarted by the wife of the vehicle owner who raised an alarm from the balcony of her first floor flat. According to police, Rizwan allegedly fired his pistol but the bullet reportedly hit a window AC of the adjacent house.The four then drove towards Punjabi Bagh, another police officer who did not want to be named, said. “On the way, near Prem Bari Pul, they waylaid an autorickshaw and robbed the mobile phones of the driver and the passenger. A few kilometres away, they also stopped a truck and robbed its driver of ₹5,000 and his mobile phone. While leaving, Rizwan, who had a scuffle with the driver who tried to resist the robbery, fired at the driver who died on the spot,”“While leaving, Rizwan fired a bullet at the truck driver, killing him on the spot. He fired the bullet just because the driver was resisting the robbery and had a scuffle with Nasir,” the officer said, quoting Rizwan’s disclosure during questioning.From Punjabi Bagh, the four drove towards central Delhi and on the way, they allegedly fired a bullet at another e-rickshaw driver when their attempt to steal the vehicle’s battery failed. The incident took place somewhere on the Ring Road between Punjabi Bagh and ITO, where they also allegedly robbed the passenger of an auto of his mobile phone.While the firing incident on Ring Road was not reported to the police, the phone theft at ITO was reported.The suspects allegedly robbed their last victim, the driver of a car who was changing a flat tyre near the Moolchand flyover in south Delhi, of his cellphone at gunpoint at around 4am. However, they returned the phone and fled after seeing a police patrol van, police said.Investigators said that after the crimes, the suspects returned to Loni, where they parked the car at an isolated place and left again in a Wagon R car owned by Rizwan.“Around 7.30 am, they arrived at the Punjabi Bagh crime scene to see what the police were doing. As the police had removed the truck and the dead truck driver from the crime spot, Bhola returned to his room while the others went to Loni. To destroy evidence, Rizwan and Nisar drove the Santro car to Baghpat and set it on fire in a village on the same day,” the officer said.DCP Rangnani said that the suspects were identified with the help of technical surveillance and information collected through the human intelligence network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/four-petty-thieves-behind-late-night-crime-spree-wanted-to-mark-their-entry-into-crime-worldpolice-101623605497393.html

On Saturday evening, Pramod and Sunita went to a relative’s home in northeast Delhi’s Khajoori Khas. “They returned home around 10 pm and found Rajwari lying unconscious with her throat slit. There were some burns on her left leg,” said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse.The family informed the police control room about the incident. A police team reached there and rushed Rajwari to a nearby hospital, where she was declared brought dead. “We have registered a case of murder and looking into it from all possible motives, including personal enmity and robbery. It looks like the killer was known to the woman as there are no signs of forced entry into the house,” said the DCP.Police said they have asked the family members to inform them if any cash or valuables were missing from the house.In another murder case, 25-year-old man, identified as Avinash alias Gola, was stabbed to death by another man over a money dispute in north Delhi’s Sadar Bazar on Friday. The suspect, Shivam, was later arrested. Shivam told the police that Avinash had borrowed some money from him and was not returning it despite repeated demands. On Friday, a scuffle broke out between them and Shivam stabbed Avinash, who died during treatment at a government hospital, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/65yrold-woman-murdered-at-home-in-north-delhi-s-burari-101623605496625.html
14-06-2021||Delhi||Weekly markets are back in Delhi, but with Covid riders||Weekly markets in the city will reopen per day, per municipal zone – and subject to a long list of conditions concerning location, space, capacity and random Covid-19 tests of vendors and customers – after eight weeks this Monday, according to directions issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) to scale down restrictions concerning the ongoing lockdown that was imposed in April in the light of a sharp surge in Covid-19 cases.“I hope our lives will be back on tracks if the Covid cases continue to decline. It is a massive calamity and we have to tackle it together, and hope the cases do not increase now,” Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday, announcing another round of easing of restrictions as Delhi has reported fewer than 500 cases for nine days and city’s test positivity rate has stayed below the 1% mark for 10 days now.The announcement came as a major relief for tens of thousands of people who are associated with these markets spread across the city, which specially cater to lower-income and middle-income group people, offering products that range from soaps and utensils to toys and garments.“Only one authorised weekly market (up to the limit of 50% of the allowed vendors at normal time) per day per zone in all three municipal corporations/ New Delhi Municipal Council/ Delhi Cantonment Board shall be allowed subject to the strict compliance of SOP and all instructions/ guidelines issued by government of India/ government of Delhi from time to time. To contain the spread of Covid-19. Weekly market shall be selected by the zonal deputy commissioner of the municipal body as per prescribed guidelines,” said the DDMA order, a copy of which HT has seen.It further said that no weekly market will be allowed to function on roadsides. “The weekly markets can be allowed to function at suitable nearby grounds, school grounds, where SOP/ guidelines of DDMA can be strictly implemented. No unauthorised weekly market shall be allowed to function… RT-PCR / Rapid antigen tests of vendors / customers of weekly markets shall be conducted on random basis by the district magistrate concerned regularly.”Delhi has total 12 municipal zones.“It has come as a major relief. Thousands of people have been deprived of incomes, of which many have left for their home states. We hope that business recovers soon,” said Sanjay Kumar, a vendor and member of town vending committee in charge of a weekly market in the Yamuna embankment area in east Delhi.Dhanik Chand, vendor and member of town vending committee in charge of a weekly market in Mandawali locality, said, “Last year, vendors had to wait for months for weekly markets to resume business. We are lucky this time. This will ensure some income in such difficult times.”Brijesh Goyal, president of chamber of trade and industry, said, “Delhi has around 2,700 weekly markets – big and small ones. Collectively, they employ around 400,000 people in different capacities – vendors, suppliers, porters, etc. Sunday’s announcement is expected to bring them big relief.”Arbind Singh, national coordinator of the National Association of Street Vendors of India, said, “Allowing weekly markets to finally operate is a welcome move. The government should have allowed them earlier with strict protocols. But better late than never. Weekly market vendors are in extreme distress. Many of them are migrants and they have been struggling for food and ration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/weekly-markets-are-back-in-delhi-but-with-covid-riders-101623605438666.html
14-06-2021||Delhi||Monsoon set to arrive in Delhi by Tuesday: IMD||The south-west monsoon is set to arrive in Delhi and will cover most parts of north-west India by Tuesday, almost a fortnight ahead of schedule, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Sunday.The expected early arrival of the monsoon will cap what has largely been a cooler-than-usual summer this year in Delhi, a city known for its scorching summer heat. Scattered spells of rain brought on by two cyclonic storms, along with a series of western disturbances, through April to June have given Delhi residents a relatively easy summer this year.IMD officials said monsoon is on course to cover most areas of north-west India by Tuesday. “Conditions are favourable for further advancement of south-west monsoon into most parts Madhya Pradesh, remaining parts of east Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, more parts of west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab during next 48 hours,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre said on Sunday.On Saturday, HT had reported that the monsoon was around two weeks ahead of schedule due to a low-pressure system building up over the Bay of Bengal and was set to advance over Delhi and most parts of north-west India by June 15. The south-west monsoon generally arrives in Delhi by June 27-28.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of privately operated Skymet Weather Services, said that while the monsoon is expected to arrive by June 15, there may not be significant rainfall in the city at least in the initial days. “Rain activity may increase by June 15-16. However, it may not be a typical onset of monsoon. We might see patchy rainfall instead of a continuous downpour,” said Palawat.He added that the temperature had already dropped from 41-42 degrees Celsius zone experienced last week to 34-35 degrees Celsius in the past few days, as humidity has started rising signalling the arrival of monsoon.While the south-west monsoon arrived two days late in Kerala coast on June 3 this year, it picked up pace soon after and has, since then, been sweeping across the country several days ahead of schedule. Experts have said that it may cover the entire nation about a fortnight before its normal date of July 8.Early on Sunday, the IMD had issued an alert for a thunderstorm with moderate to heavy intensity rain for Delhi-NCR. The weather alert, however, was later withdrawn, but sparse rainfall may occur in some regions of the city and its neighbouring areas on Monday.“On Sunday, we saw that a patch of cloud was travelling towards Delhi, but it evaporated before reaching the city. On Monday, we might see light to moderate showers in patches. Rain activity might increase from June 16,” said Palawat.On Sunday, the maximum recorded temperature was 35.2 degrees Celsius, four degrees below what is considered normal for this time of the year, while the minimum temperature stood at 23.8 degrees Celsius, as per the Safdarjung weather station, considered to be the official marker of the city.As per IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum temperature is expected to hover around 34 degrees on Monday while the minimum might touch 24 degrees. As per the weekly forecast, a thunderstorm with rain is expected in the next few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monsoon-set-to-arrive-in-delhi-by-tuesday-imd-101623605439222.html
14-06-2021||Delhi||As Delhi unlocks, bruised restaurant industry hopes for reprieve||Restaurants in the city will throw open their dine-in spaces – up to 50% of their total seating capacity and their bars closed – after eight weeks from Monday, with the Delhi government further scaling down restrictions in the ongoing lockdown in the light of Covid-19 cases declining for several weeks now.“All activities, except certain prohibited ones, will be allowed from 5am on Monday. There are also certain restricted or partly allowed activities announced last week that will continue,” Kejriwal said in an online briefing on Sunday.The chief minister, however, cautioned that if Covid-19 cases will increase, the government will scale up restrictions again. He appealed to all market associations to ensure that all Covid protocols are followed.“We will watch the relaxation allowed to reopen markets and restaurants during the next week. If Covid cases do not increase, we will continue the relaxation, but if cases increase, we will have to bring back the restrictions.“I, therefore, appeal all market associations and others to prevent crowding and ensure social distancing and other precautions,” the chief minister said.A lockdown was imposed in Delhi on April 19. So far, restaurants were only allowed to offer take-away and home delivery either independently or through food delivery aggregators.Restaurant owners welcomed the decision, citing how the industry has been adversely affected by the pandemic, and assured that they would strictly follow all necessary regulations for protection against any potential spread of Covid-19, but urged the government to allow them to serve liquor to guests.An order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Sunday said, “Restaurants are allowed up to 50% of their seating capacity. The owners of the restaurants shall be responsible for strict adherence to prescribed SOP (standard operating procedure) and all instructions/guidelines issued by the government of India/ government of Delhi from time to time as well as compliance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour (viz. wearing of masks, maintaining social distancing, regular hand washing and use of sanitiser, etc) to contain the spread of Covid-19 virus. In case any violation is found, strict penal/criminal action shall be taken against the owner of the restaurant.”Another part of the order essentially restricts liquor service in restaurants. It said, “It is directed that all district magistrates, districts DCPs, deputy commissioners of municipal corporations... and all other authorities concerned shall be responsible for ensuring Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, which is wearing of masks, maintain social distancing ... (and) no consumption of liquor, pan, gutkha, tobacco, etc in all shops, malls, market complexes, weekly markets, restaurants, mandis, ISBTs and railway station.”Two senior officials in DDMA confirmed that bars will not be allowed to open this week. However, liquor stores in the city are allowed to function all days a week under the current regulations.“The industry is in distress. We hope that the current relaxation marks the beginning of its road to recovery. But we urge the government to allow bars to function too. They help in increasing revenue. There is already a 50% cap on seating capacity,” said Gaurav Chhatwal, owner of Chungwa in Greater Kailash – II.Kabir Suri, owner of Mamagoto in Khan Market said, “It is a welcome decision. The industry could not recover from the shock of the first lockdown by the time the second lockdown happened. We hope the coming days will witness economic recovery and restrictions will be further scaled down very soon. We will ensure that all regulations and Covid-19 protocols are followed.”Manpreet Singh, a Delhi-based restaurateur and treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI), said the restriction on serving liquor does not make any sense. “Clients who are seated can order any food item or beverage. Then what is the harm in serving them liquor too? I fail to understand this condition especially at a time when liquor shops are allowed to operate. The government should reconsider this decision,” he said.The Capital began to emerge out of a punishing fourth wave of infections in mid-May. The city has, for 16 days now, added fewer than 1,000 Covid-19 cases each day, and fewer than 500 cases for nine days. The seven-day average of cases, also known as the case trajectory, on Sunday fell to its lowest in 97 days. In the week ending Sunday, Delhi added an average of 271 fresh infections a day, the lowest since the seven days ending March 8, when the city added 268 cases.Further, the city’s test positivity rate has stayed below the 1% mark for 10 days now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-delhi-unlocks-bruised-restaurant-industry-hopes-for-reprieve-101623605437405.html
14-06-2021||Delhi||As home becomes campus, DU freshers go a year without friends, class||Last year, 18-year-old Vanshika Aggarwal was admitted into an undergraduate course at Lady Shri Ram College, a dream she harboured since Class 10. As her first year winds to a close, she has been to the college just once, and has not met any of her classmates in person.“I am one of the luckier ones,” she says. “At least I got to see the campus.”Aggarwal is just one of over 73,000 undergraduate students who have barely visited their campus since they got into Delhi University colleges and courses in the Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB) last year — soon after the pandemic took hold in the country.The Covid-19 outbreak has forced educational institutes in Delhi to stay shut since March last year. While final-year students were able to visit their colleges earlier this year for practical classes, most first-year undergraduate students haven’t been able to visit campus since their courses began in November 2020. Their academic year is set to end in August, leaving them with only a few months before they move to the second year. For several of these undergraduate students, this has meant a year’s worth of interactions with classmates, peers and teachers lost.“My biggest fear is that whenever college reopens, everybody else is going to have their own circle of friends and I may not have anyone to talk to. College is scary because in school we have our own identities after being involved in various activities. Here, we are nobody and the year-long isolation may only make it more difficult for some students,” said Aggarwal.Several students also lamented missing out on several extra-curricular activities (ECA) and fests, which DU colleges are known for. While many college societies organised these activities online, students said they could not be compared with participating in these activities in person.Madurai resident Aakash BT, 19, a first-year BCom (Honours) student, cancelled his admission in a private university and moved to Shri Ram College of Commerce because of the exposure and ECA options it offered to its students.“SRCC has one of the best fests, which is organised by second-year students. If the pandemic situation is better by next year, we have to organise the fest without any experience. These festivals involve a lot of teamwork, organisational skills, time management, interpersonal skills, getting corporate exposure while arranging for sponsors – all of which is important for our overall personality development. DU offers something beyond just academics, and we missed out on that this year,” he said.The pandemic also forced the university administration to make changes to the admission process which also allowed for reservation of 5% supernumerary seats each under ECA and sports quotas. Last year, DU scrapped the ECA trials due to the pandemic and awarded points on the basis of past certificates.Anamika Prasad, DU’s deputy dean (cultural activities), said the two-fold transition from school to college and from offline to online learning has made things difficult for first-year students.“While they have had some experience with online activities, we agree it is of no match to the real-life experience of engaging in cultural events. Conducting academic activities like classes or seminars through online mode is easier than arranging online cultural events which require an audience. Moving forward, whenever these students return to campus, colleges can organise cultural and communication workshops to make up for the things that these students missed out on,” she said.While a majority of students haven’t been able to visit their campuses, the situation at St Stephen’s College is a little different, because the college kept its hostel open for first- and second-year students.Falit Sijariya, 18, a first-year undergraduate BA programme student at the college, was looking forward to engaging in co-curricular activities as he did not get much exposure during his schooling in Meerut. “Even though I have been able to visit the college and interact with my peers, I haven’t been able to take part in co-curricular activities. Due to a delayed academic cycle, our seniors are busy with their exams and so even the online activities are not taking place for now.”The lack of interaction with teachers also means that colleges are finding it hard to establish a connection with students and offering them the help they need during the pandemic. Bijayalaxmi Nanda, principal of Miranda House, said they have engaged several college societies to interact with the first-year students. “We have been trying to reach out to students who have faced personal losses during the pandemic or are finding it difficult to manage things. However, it has been a challenge since most of the outstation students haven’t even visited their college once or met their teachers,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/as-home-becomes-campus-freshers-in-delhi-university-go-a-year-without-friends-class-101623605377479.html
14-06-2021||Delhi||6 million Covid vaccine doses given in Capital: Delhi govt||Delhi on Sunday completed administering six million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, of which around 4.6 million were first doses and 1.4 million were second doses, showed the government’s vaccination bulletin.The 4.6 million first doses were given to around 250,000 healthcare workers, 428,000 frontline workers, around 2.6 million people in the 45+ group and 1.36 million in the 18-45 group, said government records.Around 181,000 healthcare workers, 261,000 frontline workers, 900,000 beneficiaries aged 45+ and around 97,000 people in the 18-45 group were administered the 1.4 million second doses, show records.Delhi has a population of around 20.6 million, of whom around 15 million are adults.“With vaccine supplies slightly stabilising in the last one week, the administration of doses everyday is picking up slowly,” said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislator Atishi, while reading the government’s vaccination bulletin in a live-streamed video press briefing.Currently, there are 635 vaccine sites operational for the 45+ age group and 248 sites inoculating beneficiaries in the 18-45 group. More than 300 sites for the 45+ group and 368 sites for the 18-45 group were temporarily closed for several days in the light of a vaccine shortage.Vaccine centres operated by the Delhi government currently have 11 days of Covaxin stock and 24 days of Covishield stock for the 45+ age group. For the 18-45 age group, two days of Covaxin stock and less than a day’s stock of Covishield are available.Atishi urged the central government to scale up vaccine supplies to Delhi, even as she highlighted how an ongoing government initiative involving door-to-door visits by booth level officers and setting up temporary vaccine sites at polling booths is helping boost turnout of the 45+ age group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/6-million-covid-vaccine-doses-given-in-capital-delhi-govt-101623605376770.html
14-06-2021||Delhi||56 shanties gutted in fire at Rohingya camp in southeast Delhi||Around 56 shanties housing Rohingya refugees in Madanpur Khadar were gutted in a fire late on Saturday night. No casualties were reported in the incident.“It has been revealed that around 56 jhuggis of Rohingyas having a total population of around 270 people were burnt to ashes in the fire. The cause of the fire is not known yet and appropriate legal action is being taken,” said DCP (southeast) RP Meena.Delhi Fire Services (DFS) chief Atul Garg said that the fire department had received a call about the fire at around 11.54 pm on Saturday. “Five fire tenders were rushed there to control the blaze. The fire was brought under control around 3 am on Saturday,” he added.Rohingya refugees have been living on a plot of land in Madanpur Khadar near Kalindi Kunj since 2012 when the land for setting up the camp was given by a non-governmental organisation.Around midnight on Saturday, Minara Begum (24), a Rohingya refugee from Myanmar’s Rakhine region, said she woke up to frenzied screams of people. “We were sleeping when I heard some commotion around 12 am. People were shouting ‘fire, fire’. We ran out without our slippers. There was no time to think or salvage anything. Everything that we had has been destroyed,” said Minara, who has been living in the refugee camp along with her seven-member family since 2012.Refugees living in this camp are no strangers to tragedy. Over the past several years, the camp has witnessed a number of conflagrations, including three so far this year. While residents claimed they diffused the previous two blazes before it went out of control, they recall a massive blaze had gutted the entire camp on April 15, 2018.Abdullah (37) is among those who saw his home turned into a smouldering ruin for the second time​in three years. “Incidents like these are not uncommon. Three years ago, we lost our house and everything that we had earned over the years in a similar fire. We had to start all over again then. Once again, we are back to nothing,” he said, adding that the fire had started from an empty hutment and spread rapidly to other houses in the camp.“In the past three years, I had saved around ₹30,000-40,000 rupees. We lost it all last night. Rice, pulses and grains also got destroyed in the fire along with all our clothes and the cooler that we had,” said Abdullah, who drives an e-rickshaw but has been without work since the lockdown was imposed.Noor Begum (35), another resident, said that while she was thankful to God for saving her family, their lives had been upended once again. “Our clothes, food, utensils, whatever we had accumulated over the past few years were destroyed. Around ₹2,000 that I had saved for my husband’s medicines was also lost. We don’t know how we will rebuild our lives again,” said Begum, whose husband recently got operated on for kidney stones and is unemployed.Ali Johar (26), a Rohingya youth leader, said the community had faced multiple fire tragedies but there was no solution in sight. “This year alone, we have seen three fire incidents. Every time a tragedy unfolds, people talk about this issue for some time but no permanent solution is proposed. This time too, we will be left to fend for ourselves. In the absence of a solution, we will end up waiting for another tragedy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/56-shanties-gutted-in-fire-at-rohingya-camp-in-southeast-delhi-101623605316740.html

People were asked to stay indoors and not to venture out unnecessarily during this time. On Sunday, all public activities came to a standstill across the state. Every road and street wore a deserted look, more so due to the monsoon rain.Milk supply, vegetable and fruit vendors and small grocery shops remained closed.Local police along with additional forces, including rapid action force (RAF), were deployed to check implementation of the lockdown. State capital Ranchi, that is the hardest hit by the pandemic, witnessed total shut down on Sunday, except healthcare establishments.Police also conducted intensive checking. People arriving in the city by train or air were also intercepted during the checking.“Such lockdown is not going to bring significant improvement. Crowd in markets swelled up on Saturday as people were scurrying for making arrangements of essentials for the next day. Since it is implemented for the first time as an experiment, I believe that government will make an assessment of its true benefits,” said Pramod Pathak, a resident of Ranchi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jkhand-observes-38-hr-complete-lockdown-101623603936696.html

The ASPCA alleges that the Agriculture Department has adopted “education and cooperation” efforts as a substitute for enforcement. The USDA refers to dealers as those who breed dogs or act as brokers in their sale or transport.The department has “imposed no statutory penalties against a dog dealer since 2017” despite evidence that more than 1,000 violations take place each year, the ASPCA says in the suit. In one case, a licensed dealer avoided punishment despite keeping dogs in housing with wire flooring that hurt some of them so badly they were unable to stand, the group says.It sued the Agriculture Department under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that its embrace of education initiatives in lieu of concrete penalties violates federal law. The agency’s inaction “has enabled licensed dog dealers to commit horrible abuses without any repercussions,” the ASPCA claims.The USDA referred a request for comment on the suit to its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which is also named as a defendant. A spokesman for the service said he wouldn’t comment on pending litigation.The case is American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 21-cv-01600, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abusive-dog-dealers-escape-usda-penalties-says-animal-group-101623687271376.html

14-06-2021||World||At NATO, Biden says ready to talk China, Russia and soothe allies||President Joe Biden made his entrance at the NATO summit aiming to consult European allies on efforts to counter provocative actions by China and Russia while highlighting the US commitment to the 30-country alliance that was frequently maligned by predecessor Donald Trump.The summit Monday comes as Biden tries to rally allies for greater coordination in checking China and Russia, two adversaries whose actions on economic and national security fronts have become the chief foreign policy concerns in the early going of the Biden presidency.Biden shortly after arriving at the alliance's headquarters sat down with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and underscored the US commitment to Article 5 of the alliance charter, which spells out that an attack on one member is an attack on all and is to be met with a collective response.“Article 5 we take as a sacred obligation,” Biden said. “I want NATO to know America is there.”The White House said the communique to be signed by alliance members at the end of the NATO summit is expected to include language about updating Article 5 to include major cyber attacks — a matter of growing concern amid a series of hacks targeting the US government and businesses around the globe by Russia-based hackers.The update will spell out that if an alliance member needs technical or intelligence support in response to a cyber attack, it would be able to invoke the mutual defense provision to receive assistance, according to White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan.The president will begin his day meeting with leaders of the Baltic states on NATO's eastern flank regarding the "threat posed by Russia,” China and the recent air piracy in Belarus, according to Sullivan. He'll also meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Biden's itinerary in Europe has been shaped so that he would first gather with Group of Seven leaders for a three-day summit on the craggy shores of Cornwall and then with NATO allies in Brussels before his much-anticipated meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva on Wednesday.At the G-7, leaders sought to convey that the club of wealthy democracies — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States — is a better friend to poorer nations than authoritarian rivals such as China and Russia.The G-7 meeting ended with a communique that called out forced labor practices and other human rights violations impacting Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in the western Xinjiang province. The president declined to discuss private summit negotiations over the provision, but said he was “satisfied” with the communique, although differences remain among the allies about how forcefully to call out Beijing.Biden is focused on building a more cohesive bond between America and allies who had become wary of US leadership after enduring four years of Trump's name-calling and frequent invectives about the relevance of multilateral alliances like NATO.Trump complained that the NATO alliance allows “global freeloading” countries to spend less on military defense at the expense of the US and dismissed the alliance as “obsolete.”Biden offered a pointed rejoinder on Sunday, saying: “We do not view NATO as a sort of a protection racket. We believe that NATO is vital to our ability to maintain American security for ... the remainder of the century. And there’s a real enthusiasm.”When alliance members last met for a summit in England in December 2019, Trump grabbed headlines by calling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “two-faced” and French President Emmanuel Macron “nasty."Trump lashed out after Trudeau was caught on a hot mic gossiping with other leaders about Trump turning photo opportunities into long news conferences. Ahead of the summit, Macron had declared NATO “brain dead" because of a void in US leadership under Trump.Biden has already acknowledged during his Europe tour that the alliance needs to ensure better burden sharing and needs more American leadership. He’s also highlighted NATO members' contributions in the war in Afghanistan, noting that “NATO stepped up” after America was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001.The US and the alliance are winding down their involvement in the nearly 20-year war that killed tens of thousands of Afghans and more than 3,500 US and allied troops. The war also raised profound questions about whether NATO’s most ambitious effort was worth it.For now, NATO plans to leave civilian advisers to help build up government institutions. It’s unclear who will protect them. The alliance is also weighing whether to train Afghan special forces outside the country.NATO members are also expected to endorse the creation of a new cyber defense policy to improve coordination with countries impacted by the increasing frequency of ransomware attacks, a climate security action plan to reduce greenhouse gases from military activities in line with national commitments under the Paris agreement and a commitment to strengthen NATO’s deterrence to meet threats from Russia and elsewhere, according to the White House.Biden will meet with Turkey's president, Erdogan, on the summit sidelines.Biden has known Erdogan for years but their relationship has frequently been contentious. Biden, during his campaign, drew ire from Turkish officials after he described Erdogan as an “autocrat." In April, Biden infuriated Ankara by declaring that the Ottoman-era mass killing and deportations of Armenians was “genocide" — a term that US presidents have avoided using.The two leaders were expected to discuss Syria and Iran as well as what role Turkey can play on Afghanistan following the US troop withdrawal, according to the White House. Also on the agenda: how Washington and Ankara “deal with some of our significant differences on values and human rights and other issues,” Sullivan said.The unsettled security situation in Libya, as well as overlapping concerns on China and Russia are also expected to be discussed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-nato-biden-says-ready-to-talk-china-russia-and-soothe-allies-101623671962981.html
14-06-2021||World||Afghanistan hospitals close doors to new patients as Covid-19 surges||The two main hospitals treating people with Covid-19 in Afghanistan have had to close their doors to new patients because of a lack of beds, a senior health official and doctors said on Monday.Afghanistan is grappling with a third wave of the pandemic, with a record number of infections and deaths being reported amid a surge in violence as US-led international forces withdraw and Taliban insurgents go on the offensive."Both Afghan Japan and Ali Jinnah hospitals had to close their doors because they had no more beds or resources," the health official said on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly about the matter.The official said the two hospitals, both in the capital Kabul, were facing persistent shortages of oxygen and other medical supplies.Mirwais Alizay, deputy health ministry spokesperson, said hospitals had close sometimes due to higher patient numbers but he denied that hospitals were facing serious shortages of supplies, saying issues with oxygen had been solved.Masi Noori, a doctor at Afghan Japan hospital, said it had been closed to new patients for several days because it had run out of beds.Eid Wali, head of Ali Jinnah hospital, said it had to stop taking new patients when its Covid-19 beds were full. It let in new patients as beds become free."We only have 50 beds for Covid-19 cases, that's the main problem," Wali told Reuters.Afghanistan reported on Monday 1,804 new Covid-19 cases and 71 deaths from the disease.In all, it has had 93,272 cases and 3,683 deaths but doctors say many cases are likely being missed because of low rates of testing.Human rights group Amnesty International said last week the government needed to immediately procure more oxygen and vaccines."Afghanistan's Covid-19 case numbers have been steadily increasing," said Zaman Sultani, the group's South Asia researcher. "Without urgent international support to contain this surge, the situation could quickly spiral out of control."The country, with a population believed to be about 36 million, has administered about 1 million doses of vaccine, largely to front-line health workers and members of the security forces.Last week, Afghanistan received 700,000 doses of a Covid-19 vaccine made by China's Sinopharm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghanistan-hospitals-close-doors-to-new-patients-as-covid-19-surges-101623670762390.html

14-06-2021||World||Israel's new government gets to work after Benjamin Netanyahu ouster||For the first time in 12 years, Israelis on Monday woke up to a new government and a new prime minister, after Naftali Bennett secured the backing of parliament and ousted longtime leader Benjamin Netanyahu.The two were slated to hold a handover meeting later in the day, but without the formal ceremony that traditionally accompanies a change in government.Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, narrowly approved the new Bennett-led coalition government on Sunday, ending Netanyahu’s historic 12-year rule. The divisive former prime minister, the longest to hold office, will now serve as the opposition leader.David Bitan, a Likud lawmaker, told Kan public radio that Netanyahu was not holding the handover ceremony with Bennett because he feels “cheated” by the formation of the Bennett-Lapid government and “doesn’t want to give even the slightest legitimacy to this matter.”Under a coalition agreement, Bennett will hold office of the premier for the first two years of the term, and then Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, the architect of the coalition, will become prime minister.The new government was sworn in late on Sunday and set to work Monday morning, with ministers announcing appointments of new ministry directors. Outgoing President Reuven Rivlin, who finishes his term in office next month, hosted Bennett, Lapid and the rest of the Cabinet at his official residence in Jerusalem for the official photo of the new government. Bennett and Lapid declined to comments to the press.Topaz Luk, a Netanyahu aide, told Army Radio that the former prime minister will “fight this dangerous and horrible government" as opposition leader. “He’s full of motivation to topple this dangerous government as soon as possible,” Luk said.World leaders have congratulated Bennett on becoming the 13th person to hold the office of Israeli prime minister.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson congratulated Bennett and Lapid on forming a government, tweeting that “this is an exciting time for the UK and Israel to continue working together to advance peace and prosperity for all.”Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who shared close ties with Netanyahu, congratulated Bennett in a tweet in Hebrew, saying he “looks forward to meeting you and deepening the strategic relations between our countries.” Modi also voiced his “deep recognition” of Netanyahu’s leadership.Lapid, Israel’s new foreign minister and alternate prime minister, spoke with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and “discussed the special relationship between the US and Israel," he wrote on Twitter.The United Arab Emirates, which established diplomatic relations with Israel last year as part of the so-called Abraham Accords orchestrated by the Trump administration, said in a statement that it was looking “forward to working together to advance regional peace, strengthen tolerance and coexistence, and embark upon a new era of cooperation in technology, trade, and investment.”Bennett, 49, a former ally of Netanyahu turned rival, became prime minister after the 60-59 vote in Knesset on Sunday. The motion passed after a member of the coalition was taken by ambulance from hospital to the parliament building to cast her vote, and despite an abstention by a member of the Islamist Raam party.He heads a diverse and fragile coalition comprised of eight parties with deep ideological differences, ranging from a small Islamist party to Jewish ultranationalists. Bennett said he is prioritizing mending the many rifts dividing Israeli society.Bennett's ultranationalist Yamina party won just seven seats in the 120-member Knesset in March elections. But by refusing to commit to Netanyahu or his opponents, Bennett positioned himself as kingmaker. Even after one member of his religious nationalist party abandoned him to protest the new coalition deal, he ended up with the post of premier.The Knesset vote capped a chaotic parliamentary session and ended a two-year period of political paralysis in which the country held four deadlocked elections. Those votes focused largely on Netanyahu’s divisive rule and his fitness to remain in office while on trial for corruption charges.Netanyahu has made clear he has no intention of exiting the political stage. “If it is destined for us to be in the opposition, we will do it with our backs straight until we topple this dangerous government and return to lead the country,” he said Sunday.To his supporters, Netanyahu is a global statesman uniquely capable of leading the country through its many security challenges.But to his critics, he has become a polarizing and autocratic leader who used divide-and-rule tactics to aggravate the many rifts in Israeli society. Those include tensions between Jews and Arabs, and within the Jewish majority between his religious and nationalist base and his more secular and dovish opponents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-new-government-gets-to-work-after-benjamin-netanyahu-ouster-101623666061041.html

India will mark the 75th anniversary of Independence Day on August 15 next year.The statement was delivered on the floor of the provincial legislative assembly by minister of infrastructure Prasad Panda, an Indo-Canadian on behalf of minister of culture, multiculturalism and status of women Leela Aheer.Panda said he had shared the statement with Canada’s foreign minister Marc Garneau.“Most foreigners who have never visited India cannot really gauge how vast and how diverse the country is. The cuisine changes every 200 miles (321km) you travel in any direction; the language and the dialect are different every 300 miles (482km); and cultural nuances shift subtly as you travel across the length and breadth of the country. This makes each state in India unique,” Panda told Hindustan Times.He said that the ties that are developing between the province and India as tech majors like Infosys and Mphasis have recently established presence in Alberta. “There are tremendous synergies that exist between Canada and India. I believe that with a little common sense, some hard-nosed business acumen, and political will, we can forge an incredibly strong, mutually beneficial relationship,” Panda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-alberta-recognises-india-s-75th-independence-anniversary-celebrations-101623653623679.html

The Department of Defense announces,and improve interoperability with NATO, which included armed Mark VI patrol boats.Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and backed a pro-Russian separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine which triggered a conflict that has killed more than 14,000 people.Tensions have flared again in recent months after the two countries traded blame for a surge in fighting in Ukraine's Donbass, and Russia, in what it called a defensive exercise, massed troops on its border with Ukraine and in Crimea.U.S. President Joe Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Monday he will stand up for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity ahead of a meeting between Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Geneva on June 16.The Pentagon said the U.S. security assistance included capabilities "to enhance the lethality, command and control and situational awareness of Ukraine's forces".It would provide counter-artillery radars, counter-drone systems, secure communications gear, electronic warfare and military medical evacuation equipment.Ukraine's defense minister, Andrii Taran, said in a statement on Saturday the decision to provide the second part of the security package was "timely and reasonable".The country has received almost $2.5 billion in defense assistance from Washington between 2014 and 2021, Taran added, expressing gratitude "to our American friends for their enormous diplomatic, political and financial support".The U.S. assistance followed certification by the Pentagon that Ukraine "made sufficient progress on defense reforms this year," as required by U.S. law.During his term as U.S. president, Donald Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives after it accused him of using U.S. aid as leverage to try to force Kyiv into smearing Biden ahead of the 2020 presidential election. The Republican-led Senate later acquitted Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eying-russia-pentagon-to-send-ukraine-counter-drone-electronic-warfare-equipment-101623634950858.html
14-06-2021||World||Naftali Bennett, Israel's new prime minister, unlikely to change stance on Iran nuclear deal||Naftali Bennett became the new prime minister of Israel on Sunday, topping his predecessor and former ally Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year regime and ending a political crisis in the country that sparked four elections in two years. High up on Bennett's priority list as the new prime minister is coordinating with the United States on military and intelligence matters, the New York Times reported, adding that using Mossad, the country's spy agency, to sabotage the nuclear deal with Iran could still be on the table.Also Read: Who is Naftali Bennett, the ultra-nationalist leader poised to replace Netanyahu as Israel PM?The Iranian nuclear deal had long been a bone of contention within Israel's political and military establishment. Benjamin Netanyahu, former prime minister, had expressed his gripe with the original 2015 agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, pointing out that it neither gave Israel sufficient security from the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon nor did it cover significant issues like Iranian support to militias in neighbouring nations. Before being voted to the post of prime minister, Naftali Bennett had echoed similar sentiments, vowing to stop Israel from acquiring nuclear weapons. "The renewal of the nuclear agreement is a mistake," the New York Times quoted Bennett as saying at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, shortly before Sunday's vote.A religious Jew by birth, Bennett had long positioned himself to the right of Netanyahu but played the kingmaker recently by partnering up with centrist and left-wing parties, an unlikely combination that defines the contradictions in the 73-year-old nation. Even so, Bennett's stance regarding the Iran nuclear deal is unlikely to be much different from his predecessor, the Amerian daily said, adding that the new Israeli prime minister, however, might try to influence some terms of the new deal, something that Netanyahu had refused to do.Also Read: Biden welcomes new Israeli government led by Naftali Bennett, reaffirms supportNotably, the espionage operations of Mossad, Israel's spy agency, against the Iranian military establishment over its nuclear ambitions had continued even after Joe Biden was elected as the president of the United States of America and negotiations to rejoin the nuclear deal began. David Barnea, who was recently appointed as the director of Mossad, has said that Israel's Mossad will respond in "full force" if Iran continues with its nuclear program, hinting at the fact that the spy agency was well-aware of those officials within the Iranian military establishment associated with the nuclear program.Israel, under its new prime minister Naftali Bennett, is looking to minimise disagreements with the United States on the Iranian nuclear deal, the report added, noting it as a marked shift from the adversarial stand it pursued with the US under the Obama administration. To this end, Bennett is even likely to replace Gilad Ardan, a longstanding Netanyahu ally and current Israeli ambassador to Washington, with a man of his own, the daily added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/naftali-bennett-israel-s-new-prime-minister-unlikely-to-change-stance-on-iran-nuclear-deal-101623630214064.html
14-06-2021||World||Myanmar Junta to start Suu Kyi’s first trial since February coup||Myanmar’s ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi will be in court Monday as her first trial begins on charges brought by the military junta after it seized power earlier this year.Suu Kyi and former President Win Myint, who have been in detention since the Feb. 1 coup and face multiple charges, are expected to testify in person at a special court in the capital, Naypyidaw, according to the head of their legal defense team, Khin Maung Zaw. She is being tried for allegedly violating Covid-19 restrictions during last year’s election, as well as incitement and possessing unlicensed walkie-talkies.On Tuesday, she’ll return to court to face two additional charges related to breaching the Natural Disaster Management Law and the Telecommunications Law, Khin Maung Zaw said by phone, adding that he expects verdicts on those charges by mid-August. He has described all the allegations against her as groundless.The trials are the latest push by the military to discredit Suu Kyi after her party won more than 80% of available seats in November’s national election, prompting the military to declare it tainted by widespread fraud even though international observers said it was mostly free and fair. The result was in line with another landslide victory in 2015, when Suu Kyi formed the country’s first civilian-led government in more than five decades.Since the coup, the military regime has struggled to contend with a shadow government set up by her allies, renewed civil conflict with armed ethnic rebels and international sanctions from the U.S. and its Western partners over a deadly crackdown on protesters that has killed more than 850 people. The military, also known as the Tatmadaw, moved the two civilian leaders in recent weeks from their residences in the capital to an unknown location.Suu Kyi, 75 also faces other criminal charges. On June 10, the junta charged her and other officials with corruption in the most serious of the seven cases against her so far, accusing her of bribery and illegally leasing property. As a senior government official she faces a maximum of 15 years in prison if convicted in that case.Suu Kyi has long been the face of Myanmar’s pro-democracy movement, winning the Nobel peace prize while under house arrest for the better part of two decades prior to her release in 2010. Her international reputation had suffered in recent years due to her defense of Myanmar’s army from allegations of genocide against Rohingya Muslims at the International Court of Justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-to-start-suu-kyi-s-first-trial-since-february-coup-101623631240230.html

After the first escape, he was arrested in Italy in 2019 and extradited in 2020.At least 3,200 people were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's dictatorship from 1973 to 1990. An estimated 38,000 were tortured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/argentina-detains-chile-dictatorship-fugitive-wanted-for-dozens-of-murders-101623629244845.html

14-06-2021||World||They did it: Pakistan's foreign minister blames previous govt of 'complicating' Kulbhushan Jadhav case||The Kulbhushan Jadhav case was "complicated" by the previous Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government, Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said. Qureshi also claimed that India was trying to take Pakistan again to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for not implementing its verdict."Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (government) complicated the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav," Qureshi said on Sunday, according to news agency ANI, without explaining his comment.Kulbhushan Jadhav, the 51-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was arrested in March 2016 in Balochistan. Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. India has rejected the charges levelled against Jadhav and said he was kidnapped by Pakistani operatives from the Iranian port of Chabahar, where he was running a business. The ICJ stayed Jadhav’s execution in 2018.Also read | Pak rejects India’s assertion of pressurising Kulbhushan Jadhav’s lawyerIndia approached the Hague-based ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging his death sentence. The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an "effective review and reconsideration" of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.On Thursday, Pakistan’s Parliament rushed through a bill that will help Kulbhushan Jadhav appeal against the death sentence given to him by a military court amid protests by the opposition, which accused the government of violating parliamentary principles. The bill is also aimed at allowing Jadhav to have consular access in line with the ICJ verdict.Qureshi said that opposition MPs who were against the bill to provide relief to Jadhav were “speaking the language of India”. “India wants Pakistan not to abide by the decision of the ICJ and the opposition also wants this,” he said.Law minister Farogh Naseem added the ICJ had asked Pakistan to enact legislation to provide the right of appeal to Jadhav. If the bill wasn’t passed, India could initiate contempt proceedings against Pakistan in the ICJ, Naseem said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kulbhushan-jadhav-case-complicated-by-previous-govt-qureshi-101623628937729.html

14-06-2021||World||'Very gracious' queen 'reminded me of my mother': Joe Biden||President Joe Biden and his aviator sunglasses met Queen Elizabeth II on a bright Sunday afternoon.The queen hosted the president and first lady Jill Biden at Windsor Castle, her royal residence near London. Biden flew to London after wrapping up his participation in a three-day summit of leaders of the world's wealthy democracies in Cornwall, in southwestern England. He arrived at the castle aboard the presidential helicopter and was ferried to the queen in a black Range Rover.The 95-year-old monarch greeted the Bidens in the castle’s quadrangle, where she waited beneath a covered dais that shielded her from the sun on one of the hottest days of the year so far in the United Kingdom. Assembled soldiers from the Queen’s Company First Battalion Grenadier Guards gave a royal salute and the Bidens placed their hands over their hearts as the U.S. national anthem was played.The president was then led across the grass for an inspection of the Guard of Honor. He wore a stern expression on his face after he had removed his trademark sunglasses, but when the 78-year-old Biden got to the end of the row, he smiled for the soldier in front of him who held up a sword. The queen and Jill Biden remained on the dais.Biden returned to the dais and he, the first lady and the white-gloved woman who has held the British throne for nearly 70 years watched the military march past before they went inside for tea. As they left the dais, Biden offered the queen an elbow. She declined and stepped down on her own power, using the handrail.The Bidens emerged from the castle just shy of having spent a full hour with the queen and boarded the helicopter for the return trip to London.At Heathrow Airport, Biden talked about the queen with his traveling press corps, saying she was “very gracious,” that she asked him about Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping and that he had invited her to visit the White House.“I don’t think she’ll be insulted, but she reminded me of my mother,” Biden said before he boarded Air Force One for his next stop, Brussels.It generally is frowned upon for anyone to reveal the contents of their private talks with the queen.Biden is the 13th American president to meet the monarch. President Lyndon B. Johnson is the only one who did not make her acquaintance while he was in office.She has welcomed four other US presidents to Windsor Castle, where she has been isolating during the coronavirus pandemic. They are Donald Trump in 2018, Barack Obama in 2016, George W. Bush in 2008 and Ronald Reagan in 1982.Biden's first time meeting the queen came in November 1982, when as a U.S. senator he traveled to the United Kingdom for a meeting of the British-American Parliamentary Group, the White House said Sunday. Biden was part of a group that met with the monarch during that visit.The queen has been riding out the pandemic at Windsor Castle, but also has begun getting out now and again after the April death of her husband, Prince Philip, at age 99.On Friday, she joined other royal family members, including Prince Charles and Prince William and their spouses, at a reception in Cornwall for the Group of Seven leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/very-gracious-queen-reminded-me-of-my-mother-joe-biden-101623626338636.html

The leaders agreed that they and their teams would consult closely on all matters related to regional security, including Iran," the White House said."United States remains unwavering in its support for Israel’s security," Biden said in an earlier statement. "My administration is fully committed to working with the new Israeli government to advance security, stability, and peace for Israelis, Palestinians, and people throughout the broader region."By contrast, Biden did not speak to Netanyahu for nearly a month after the US president took office on Jan. 20.US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken also issued statements welcoming their counterparts in the new Israeli government.Bennett, a former defense minister and a high-tech millionaire, won by a thin 60-59 majority vote, and the coalition of left-wing, centrist, right-wing and Arab parties is likely to be fragile.Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving leader, vowed to return to power soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-welcomes-new-israeli-government-led-by-naftali-bennett-reaffirms-support-101623622514487.html

14-06-2021||World||Netanyahu’s tenure ends; Bennett is Israel’s new PM||After a record 12 years under Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel entered a new era on Sunday, voting in a motley coalition united by animosity towards “Bibi” and installing his one-time protege Naftali Bennett as the prime minister.Sixty members of the Knesset voted in favour of the ideologically divided alliance and 59 against, with one abstention.Bennett will serve as prime minister for two years, after which coalition architect, centrist Yair Lapid, will take over.Earlier in the day, Bennett said that renewing the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran would be a major mistake. In a speech to parliament prior to the vote, Bennett said that Israel remains ready to act against Iran.“Israel will not allow Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons,” Bennett said. “Israel will not be a party to the agreement and will continue to preserve full freedom of action.” The strong comments maintain the confrontational policy by Netanyahu.Nonetheless, Bennett thanked President Joe Biden and the US administration for supporting Israel over the decades. Bennett’s new government was sworn into office late on Sunday.The Knesset voted in favour of the coalition put together by Lapid with the aim of terminating Netanyahu’s 12 years at the helm.Bennett, a former tech entrepreneur and a former defence minister, leads the right-wing Yamina Party, which has called for Israel to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. Bennett becomes Israel’s first premier to lead an openly religious lifestyle, with his small skullcap known as a kippa fastened to his head.He shares this ideology with Netanyahu, having served in several of the Likud leader’s governments. But in recent years tensions between the two arose and intensified, with Netanyahu making little effort to hide his disdain for Bennett.In late May, two months after Israel’s fourth inconclusive election in two years, Bennett allied himself with Lapid, paving the way for the improbable eight-party coalition.Bennett entered politics in 2005, and the next year became chief of staff to Netanyahu, who was then in the opposition. After leaving Netanyahu’s office, Bennett in 2010 became head of the Yesha Council.He took politics by storm in 2012, taking charge of the hard-right Jewish Home party, which was facing annihilation. He rebranded Jewish Home as the “New Right” Party, before forging the Yamina bloc in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahus-tenure-ends-bennett-is-israel-s-new-pm-101623618219136.html
14-06-2021||World||China takes a dig at G7, says it’s a ‘small group’||China on Sunday pointedly cautioned the G7 leaders that the days when “small” groups of countries decided the fate of the world was long gone, hitting back at the world’s richest democracies that have sought a unified position over tackling Beijing.“The days when global decisions were dictated by a small group of countries are long gone,” a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in London reportedly said.“We always believe that countries, big or small, strong or weak, poor or rich, are equals, and that world affairs should be handled through consultation by all countries.”In another development, the G7 advanced a plan to impose a global minimum corporation tax and a collective crackdown on avoidance, arguing that it would help tackle inequality.The G7 leaders endorsed an agreement struck by their finance ministers last week to adopt a minimum floor for corporation tax of 15%.Time to crack down on tax avoidance, says G7“With this, we have taken a significant step towards creating a fairer tax system fit for the 21st century, and reversing a 40-year race to the bottom,” the G7 said in its concluding statement.“Our collaboration will create a stronger level playing field, and it will help raise more tax revenue to support investment and it will crack down on tax avoidance.”The proposal, which now goes to G20 nations meeting in Italy next month, is aimed at snaring more taxes from revenue-hopping multinational companies, especially tech giants. US President Joe Biden welcomed the development, saying, “Too many corporations have been engaged in what are essentially tax savings, deciding that they would pay considerably less.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-takes-a-dig-at-g7-says-it-s-a-small-group-101623617959802.html
14-06-2021||World||G7 vows action on Covid, climate change||G7 leaders on Sunday vowed to start delivering one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines and to step up action on the climate crisis, in a US-led summit call that also took a hard line on China and Russia.In a final communique issued at their first physical summit in nearly two years, the leaders of the elite club stood by US President Joe Biden’s push to regain the West’s cohesion after Donald Trump’s tumultuous tenure.“We will harness the power of democracy, freedom, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights to answer the biggest questions and overcome the greatest challenges,” Biden and his colleagues from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan said.G7 seeks investigation into origin of Covid-19The seven leaders scolded China over human rights in Xinjiang, called for Hong Kong to keep a high degree of autonomy and demanded a full and thorough investigation of the origin of the coronavirus in China.“We will promote our values, including by calling on China to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms,” the G7 said. “We also call for a timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-based WHO-convened Phase 2 Covid-19 origin study including, as recommended by the experts’ report, in China.”Separately, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain wants further investigation into the origin of the pandemic. Speaking at the end of the summit, Johnson said , the world needs to “keep an open mind”.Biden, at a press meet on Sunday, said his fellow leaders agreed that “America is back at the table and fully engaged”. NATO’s mutual defence was a “sacred obligation” for the United States, he added, arguing that democracies were in a “contest with autocracies”.Johnson, host of the summit in St Ives, Cornwall, earlier described Biden as a “big breath of fresh air” and said on Sunday that the G7 stood united anew in its “democratic values”.But the pledge on coronavirus vaccines for poorer nations fell far short of the 11 billion doses that campaigners say are needed to end the pandemic.Likewise, the G7’s pledges to deliver more aid for countries at the sharp end of the climate crisis, and to phase out fossil fuel investments, were decried as too little, too late ahead of a key UN summit in November. “This G7 summit will live on in infamy,” said Max Lawson, head of inequality policy at aid group Oxfam.Campaigners also complained the G7 failed to flesh out how it will pay for a newly agreed “Nature Compact” - aimed to protect 30% of land and oceans from despoliation by 2030.In another important pledge, the world leaders said they want to rapidly scale up technologies and policies that will accelerate the transition away from unabated coal capacity, including ending new government support for coal power by the end of this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g7-vows-action-on-covid-climate-change-101623617248613.html
14-06-2021||World||Netanyahu ousted as Israel PM, Parliament approves new coalition govt||Israel's parliament approved a new coalition government on Sunday that sent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into the opposition after a record 12 years in office and a political crisis that sparked four elections in two years.Naftali Bennett, the head of a small ultranationalist party, was sworn in as prime minister after a narrow 60-59 vote in parliament. But if he wants to keep the job, he will have to maintain an unwieldy coalition of parties from the political right, left and center.The eight parties, including a small Arab faction that is making history by sitting in the ruling coalition, are united in their opposition to Netanyahu and new elections but agree on little else. They are likely to pursue a modest agenda that seeks to reduce tensions with the Palestinians and maintain good relations with the US without launching any major initiatives.Netanyahu sat silently during the vote. After it was approved, he stood up to leave the chamber, before turning around and shaking Bennett’s hand. A dejected Netanyahu, wearing a black medical mask, briefly sat in the opposition leader’s chair before walking out.Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, remains the head of the largest party in parliament and is expected to vigorously oppose the new government. If just one faction bolts, it could lose its majority and would be at risk of collapse, giving him an opening to return to power.The country's deep divisions were on vivid display as Bennett addressed parliament ahead of the vote. He was repeatedly interrupted and loudly heckled by supporters of Netanyahu, several of whom were escorted out of the chamber.Bennett's speech mostly dwelled on domestic issues, but he expressed opposition to US efforts to revive Iran's nuclear deal with world powers.“Israel will not allow Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons,” Bennett said, vowing to maintain Netanyahu's confrontational policy. “Israel will not be a party to the agreement and will continue to preserve full freedom of action.”Bennett nevertheless thanked President Joe Biden and the U.S. for its decades of support for Israel.Netanyahu, speaking after him, vowed to return to power. He predicted the incoming government would be weak on Iran and give in to U.S. demands to make concessions to the Palestinians.“If it is destined for us to be in the opposition, we will do it with our backs straight until we topple this dangerous government and return to lead the country in our way,” he said.Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said the new government will likely be more stable than it appears.“Even though it has a very narrow majority, it will be very difficult to topple and replace because the opposition is not cohesive," he said. Each party in the coalition will want to prove that it can deliver, and for that they need “time and achievements."Still, Netanyahu "will continue to cast a shadow,” Plesner said. He expects the incoming opposition leader to exploit events and propose legislation that right-wing coalition members would like to support but can't — all in order to embarrass and undermine them.The new government is meanwhile promising a return to normalcy after a tumultuous two years that saw four elections, an 11-day Gaza war last month and a coronavirus outbreak that devastated the economy before it was largely brought under control by a successful vaccination campaign.The driving force behind the coalition is Yair Lapid, a political centrist who will become prime minister in two years, if the government lasts that long.He called off a planned speech to parliament, instead saying he was ashamed that his 86-year-old mother had to witness the raucous behavior of his opponents. In a brief speech, he asked for "forgiveness from my mother.”“I wanted her to be proud of the democratic process in Israel. Instead she, along with every citizen of Israel, is ashamed of you and remembers clearly why it’s time to replace you,” he said.The new government is expected to win a narrow majority in the 120-member assembly, after which it will be sworn in. The government plans to hold its first official meeting later this evening.It's unclear when Netanyahu will move out of the official residence. He has lashed out at the new government in apocalyptic terms and accused Bennett of defrauding voters by running as a right-wing stalwart and then partnering with the left.Netanyahu's supporters have held angry protests outside the homes of rival lawmakers, who say they have received death threats naming their family members. Israel's Shin Bet internal security service issued a rare public warning about the incitement earlier this month, saying it could lead to violence.Netanyahu has condemned the incitement while noting that he has also been a target.His place in Israeli history is secure, having served as prime minister for a total of 15 years — more than any other, including the country's founder, David Ben-Gurion.Netanyahu began his long rule by defying the Obama administration, refusing to freeze settlement construction as it tried unsuccessfully to revive the peace process. Relations with Israel's closest ally grew even rockier when Netanyahu vigorously campaigned against President Barack Obama's emerging nuclear deal with Iran, even denouncing it in an address to the U.S. Congress.But he suffered few if any consequences from those clashes and was richly rewarded by the Trump administration, which recognized contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital, helped broker normalization agreements with four Arab states and withdrew the U.S. from the Iran deal.Netanyahu has portrayed himself as a world-class statesman, boasting of his close ties with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He has also cultivated ties with Arab and African countries that long shunned Israel over its policies toward the Palestinians.But he has gotten a far chillier reception from the Biden administration and is widely seen as having undermined the long tradition of bipartisan support for Israel in the United States.His reputation as a political magician has also faded at home, where he has become a deeply polarizing figure. Critics say he has long pursued a divide-and-conquer strategy that aggravated rifts in Israeli society between Jews and Arabs and between his close ultra-Orthodox allies and secular Jews.In November 2019, he was indicted for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes. He refused calls to step down, instead lashing out at the media, judiciary and law enforcement, going so far as to accuse his political opponents of orchestrating an attempted coup. Last year, protesters began holding weekly rallies across the country calling on him to resign.Netanyahu remains popular among the hard-line nationalists who dominate Israeli politics, but he could soon face a leadership challenge from within his own party. A less polarizing Likud leader would stand a good chance of assembling a coalition that is both farther to the right and more stable than the government that is set to be sworn in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-parliament-approves-new-govt-ending-netanyahu-s-historic-12-year-rule-101623607400258.html

Patel also blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the circulation of such “fake reports,” which he discarded as “baseless.”“I am surprised at the reports coming in from various media quarters that I am going to join the AAP and become their face for the next year's Assembly election in Gujarat. Such claims are baseless. Such fake reports are being planted in the media with a malicious intent at the behest of the BJP,” PTI quoted Patel as saying.विभिन्न मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म्स में मेरे आम आदमी पार्टी में शामिल होने और आने वाले विधानसभा चुनाव में उनका चेहरा बनने की खबरें आने से अचंभित हूँ। ये खबरें निराधार और फर्जी है एवं भाजपा द्वारा कांग्रेस कार्यकर्ताओं और विभिन्न समाज में भ्रम फैलाने के उद्देश्य से प्लांट कराई गई हैं।In a series of tweets, Patel also alleged that the BJP is planting fake news in the media to hide its failures during the Covid-19 pandemic times. “Shocked to hear the news of me joining the Aam Aadmi Party and becoming their face in the coming assembly elections in various media platforms. These reports are baseless and fake and have been planted by BJP with the aim of spreading confusion among Congress workers and various societies,” he said in a subsequent tweet in Hindi.While saying that the Indian National Congress party came close to forming the government in Gujarat in the previous assembly elections, he tweeted “Anyone who wants to strengthen the fight against the BJP's misrule is welcome in Gujarat.” He further expressed confidence that the people of the state would elect the Congress with full majority in the upcoming election. He also said that the people have observed the party’s rule in neighbouring Maharashtra and Rajasthan during the Covid-19 pandemic.Also read | AAP to contest all seats in 2022 Gujarat assembly elections: Arvind KejriwalPatel said that he is the youngest working president of the Gujarat Congress and he joined the party “with the sole aim of removing the anti-farmer, anti-worker and anti-Patidar BJP government,” PTI reported.Earlier in the day AAP’s national convenor and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal during his visit to Ahmedabad, said that the party would contest all 182 seats in the 2022 assembly election.

14-06-2021||India||Panneerselvam, new AIADMK deputy leader, teams with Palaniswami against Sasikala||CHENNAI: Former chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and his deputy, O Panneerselvam, the two top feuding leaders of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), on Monday came together to block expelled interim general secretary VK Sasikala from trying to regain control of the party and expelled 16 party members including three leaders for their proximity to her.O Panneerselvam was also appointed as deputy leader of the AIADMK legislature party at the three-hour-long meeting at the party headquarters in Chennai to elect leaders to positions in the legislature party, a statement by the party said. Panneerselvam’s supporter, P H Manoj Panidan, was elected as deputy secretary while Palaniswami’s supporters and former ministers, SP Velumani, Kadambur C Raju and K P Anbalagan, were appointed as a whip, treasurer and secretary respectively.Monday’s appointments were a sharp contrast to the tussle between Palaniswami and Panneerselvam, the AIADMK’s dual leadership, which resurfaced after the previous two meetings of the legislature party. Last week, the chill in their relationship also reflected on the streets of Tamil Nadu when their supporters fought a poster war.On Monday, they spoke in one voice in a four-page resolution that threatened to expel anyone who associates with VK Sasikala. A party spokesperson V Pughazhendhi, former MP VK Chinnasamy and former MLA M Anandan were among the 16 who were expelled.The AIADMK’s effort to shield the party from Sasikala comes against the backdrop of her attempts to reach out to party workers sympathetic to her and release audio tapes of her conversation that has workers pleading with her to assume a leadership role.The resolution called the audio clips ‘drama’ and reiterated that the “party will never destroy itself for the desires of one family”. They recalled that Sasikala who had decided to ‘step away’ from politics before the assembly elections wanted to return because the AIADMK alliance won 75 of the 234 assembly seats, with the AIADMK alone securing 66 seats despite being in power for 10 years.Palaniswami had earlier tried to puncture her campaign, telling reporters that she hadn’t been speaking with AIADMK workers but members of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, the party floated by her nephew TTV Dhinakaran. But subsequent audio clips released by Sasikala’s team started mentioning the AIADMK membership details of the party worker as well. “They don’t understand that it is the cadre who decides the leader of this party,” she said.“The dual leadership (of Palaniswami and Panneerselvam) will continue, if not, the party will break,” says political analyst Raveendran Duraisamy. “They both have fallen on Jayalalithaa and Sasikala’s feet. They will set aside their ego and move forward together which will benefit both of them. If Sasikala wants and if she has public support she can be her own leader but the AIADMK and party symbol is in the hands of EPS and OPS. They will not let go of it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panneerselvam-new-aiadmk-deputy-leader-teams-with-palaniswami-against-sasikala-101623689205425.html

Stating that the government needs to be given a larger share by the vaccine manufacturers, the state government pointed out that the private hospitals provide health service to only 5 per cent of the state population. In a letter to the Secretary of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Additional Chief Secretary of Health and Family Welfare Department, PK Mohapatra sought an increase in the Odisha governments share of Covid vaccine to 95% and allocation of 5% vaccine to private hospitals in the state. Mohapatra said there is poor presence of private hospitals in the health care sector in Odisha. "For the state of Odisha, the government and private vaccine allocation ratio of 75:25 may be revised to 95:5 ratio, keeping in mind the ground reality," Mohapatra wrote in the letter. In the guideline, it has been mentioned that 25 per cent of monthly production of vaccines by the domestic manufactures can be directly procured by the private hopsitals. However, till date, only four private hospitals in Odisha have been able to procure vaccine directly from the manufacturers, he said. The ministry of Health and Family in its revised guidelines for implementation of Covid vaccination programme on June 8, 2021 said it will come into effect from June 21, 2021 across the country. Mohapatras letter also mentioned that distribution of the vaccine to private health care sector may be handed over to the state government for subsequent mobilisation and allocation to private hospitals. Odisha has so far inoculated 76,673 people of different categories like health care workers, front line workers, senior citizens, people above 45 years and those in 18-44 age group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-wants-centre-to-revise-covid-19-vaccine-allocation-between-state-govt-private-hospitals-101623688205862.html

The top court will consider the affidavits filed by the parties when it takes up the matter on Tuesday.The Supreme Court is hearing two petitions including one filed by social activist Arun Mukherjee and four others to seek compensation and rehabilitation of persons displaced due to violence. This petition also accused inaction by police to register complaints of victims and demanded a probe into the incidents.The second petition was filed by family members of two BJP workers, Abhijit Sarkar and Haran Adhikari, killed during the violence.Two applications for intervention have also been filed in support of the petitions by a 60-year-old woman and a minor who alleged rape by Trinamool Congress supporters. The woman alleged that five people barged into her house on May 4-5 night, raped her in front of her six-year-old grandson, and left with all her valuables and property title documents. In the other application, the minor belonging to Scheduled Caste was gang-raped by four men on May 9. Later, her family was threatened not to pursue the case by persons linked to a local TMC leader. Both applicants have demanded transfer of probe to SIT since they don’t trust the police investigation.The West Bengal government has called the petitions “politically motivated” and “misleading”, underlining that it conceals the fact that issues raised by them significantly overlapped with proceedings pending before a five-judge bench of the Calcutta high court. The high court had formed a three-member committee to examine the issues of persons displaced due to violence and ordered all complaints by victims to be forwarded to the Director General of Police in the state. As an interim measure, the state government announced compensation of ₹2 lakh for families of the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misleading-narrative-bengal-tells-sc-on-plea-for-cbi-probe-into-violence-101623682606568.html

Older persons also need to be educated about support systems, legal provisions and non-formal support networks, accessible and available to them,” Himanshu Rath, chairman of the Agewell Foundation, was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.The report also highlighted that most elderly have to depend on family care which makes them vulnerable and also said mistreatment, elder abuse and harassment occur primarily within their respective families.

He said the trust was partaking in a "scam" and highlighted that the temple is being built using donations made by people and their hard-earned money should not be misused.He further urged the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust to not play with the sentiments of the people."The Ram Janmabhoomi Trust has purchased a piece of land in Ayodhya for ₹18.5 crore. It was sold for just ₹2 crore five minutes before it was bought by the Ram temple trust. There has been a scam in purchasing this land for the pious work of building the Ram temple. The Trust must clarify why the land was bought at such a high price," he said at a press conference in Delhi."The temple is being built using donations made by people and their sentiments are attached to it. My request to them (Ram temple trust) is only that they should not play with the sentiments of the people who donated their hard-earned money for the temple," he added.Sisodia's remarks come a day after AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh along with Samajwadi Party leader Pawan Pandey said it was a case of money laundering and sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) into the matter.Singh accused the general secretary of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, Champat Rai, of purchasing 1.208 hectares of land worth ₹2 crore in Ayodhya's Bag Bjaisi village for ₹18.5 crore with the help of trust member Anil Mishra, according to news agency PTI.On Monday, Singh, who was also present at Sisodia's press conference, said that Anil Mishra, trustee of the Ram temple trust, and Rishikesh Upadhyay, mayor of Ayodhya, were present during the finalisation of both the sale agreements.Meanwhile, Rai refuted the allegations in a strongly worded statement. "Allegations of assassinating Mahatma Gandhi were also levelled against us. We do not fear allegations. I will study the allegations levelled against us and probe them," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-land-deal-manish-sisodia-alleges-scam-by-ram-temple-trust-101623677545424.html

Jagan Reddy rebutted this charge on June 1. Raju’s affidavit on Monday was a rejoinder to the chief minister’s 98-page rebuttal.The CBI hasn’t expressed a view on Raju’s demand and left it to the judge to take a call.In Monday’s affidavit, K Raghurama Krishnam Raju named several leaders and officials who were Jagan Mohan Reddy’s co-accused in the disproportionate assets cases and were granted favours after the YSR Congress chief became the chief minister in May 2019.For example, Raju’s affidavit pointed out that senior YSRC leader Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, a co- accused named in one of the 11 charge-sheets filed the CBI, was appointed advisor to the state government with powers to carry out reviews and convene meetings including those requiring the presence of police officers.Party leader, Mopidevi Venkata Ramana, also a co-accused was first appointed as a cabinet minister and later elevated as a Rajya Sabha member. Another one, YV Subba Reddy was appointed chairman of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams Trust Board. Raju’s affidavit also cited Jagan Mohan Reddy’s decision to send a delegation of party MPs to the minister of external affairs to seek the release of Nimmagadda Prasad, another co-accused, who was detained in Serbia as an instance of how he had helped co-accused in the case. Prasad was brought back to India in March 2020.Raju said the Jagan government issued an order on April 10, 2021, that will make the chief minister the reviewing authority of annual appraisal reports of All India Service officers. “This particular order clearly fortifies the contention that the chief minister is inducing and indirectly threatening senior officers who were witnesses in a number of cases against him. This amounts to a violation of conditions of his bail,” he said. Raju said the chief secretary was earlier the reviewing authority for All India Service officers.“There is no end to the list of undue favours granted by the chief minister to the co-accused in his cases and place them in a position of dominance with a view to put fear psychosis in the minds of witnesses,” Raju said.Raju said the chief minister had already forced the state police to withdraw all the crimes registered against him for various offences, while he was the opposition leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-rewarding-co-accused-cancel-his-bail-rebel-ysr-cong-mp-to-court-101623677924969.html

The announcement was signed by AIADMK’s coordinator O Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami.Apart from the 16, the AIADMK also expelled V Pugazhendi, party’s spokesperson, from his primary membership and all other responsibilities in the party. Party functionaries across many districts such as Kallakurichi, Erode, Velore, Ramanathapuram, Madurai, Tiruchi, Thiruvannamalai, Kanyakumari and Chennai, have been removed, the statement showed.The expulsions from the party’s management came after a legislature party meeting, during which a decision was unanimously made to take actions against those who had been speaking to VK Sasikala, expelled party leader and close aide to late former chief minister J Jayalalitha.கழக ஒருங்கிணைப்பாளர் திரு. ஓ. பன்னீர்செல்வம், கழக இணை ஒருங்கிணைப்பாளர் திரு. எடப்பாடி கே. பழனிசாமி ஆகியோரின் முக்கிய அறிவிப்பு. pic.twitter.com/DdJ3WxXIeuIn its statement following the legislature meeting, the AIADMK dismissed Sasikala’s plan to return to active politics as “drama” and also said that the party “would never destroy itself for the desires of one particular family.”Earlier on May 30, an audio clip of a telephonic conversation between Sasikala and her loyalist surfaced on social media garnering wide attention. In the audio, she had mentioned her plan to take back the control of AIADMK citing differences and infighting between its leaders, without naming anyone, according to a report by news agency PTI. However, the AIADMK has strongly denied her re-entry into the party.Also read | With Panneerselvam’s photo, Palaniswami camp’s polite counter to poster warningSenior party leaders like deputy coordinator KP Munusamy, former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and few others have earlier denied Sasikala’s return to the party. “Sasikala is not a member of the AIADMK and has no links whatsoever to the party. I myself and AIADMK deputy coordinator K P Munuswamy have already made this amply clear,” PTI quoted Palaniswami as saying, earlier on June 4.On Sunday, senior leader C Ponnaiyan too said that Sasikala was no longer a member of the AIADMK. “Sasikala is not a member of our party. She belongs to TTV Dhinakaran's group. She has no locus standi to say that she is going to revive AIADMK.

BJP in-charge of Telangana affairs Tarun Chugh, Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy and other party leaders from Telangana were present on the occasion.Along with Rajender, former Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) parliament member Ramesh Rathod, former TRS lawmaker Enugu Ravinder Reddy, former Karimnagar zilla parishad chairperson Thula Uma, trade union leader P Ashwathama Reddy and a few Osmania University student leaders also joined the BJP.Rajender, a prominent OBC leader representing Huzurabad assembly constituency in northern Telangana, resigned from the TRS on June 4 and from the assembly membership on Saturday. His resignation from the assembly was accepted and the vacancy for the Huzurabad seat was notified immediately.Expressing thanks to the BJP leadership, Rajender said he would make all-out efforts to expand the footprints of the BJP across Telangana and also in the rest of South India. In the coming days, there would be an exodus of more leaders from the TRS into the BJP, he said.Originally from the Leftist background, Rajender was an active leader of the Progressive Democratic Students’ Union (PDSU), a student wing of the CPI (Marxist-Leninist) New Democracy, a splinter group of the Naxalites, in the early ‘80s.In 2003, he joined the TRS founded by K Chandrasekhar Rao and took an active role in the separate Telangana movement. He became the legislator for the first time in 2004 from Kamalapur assembly constituency in Karimnagar district and represented it twice before the constituency was changed into Huzurabad. He continued to represent the same till the 2018 elections.When KCR was a parliament member, Rajender was made the floor leader of the TRS in the state assembly. He was the first finance minister of the Telangana state when it was formed in 2014. In the second term, he was given the medical and health portfolio which he held till he was sacked recently.“My DNA is secular. My agenda now is neither right nor left. My only agenda is to get the Telangana rid of the dictatorial and feudal rule of KCR,” Rajender said after quitting the assembly membership.Meanwhile, Senior TRS leader and state civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar said Rajender’s defection to the BJP would hardly have any impact on the party. “The TRS is very strong in Huzurabad and it is going to win the by-election hands down. We shall develop the constituency 100 times more than what Rajender had done all these years,” Kamalakar, who is looking after the party affairs in the constituency, said. It was unfortunate that Rajender chose to criticise KCR, who had given him a political life, the minister added. Senior journalist and political analyst Sangem Ramakrishna said there might not be an immediate impact of Rajender’s exit on the TRS, which was strongly placed in Telangana. “However, in the long run, he might be a rallying point for the disgruntled elements in the TRS and also the OBC groups in the state. It would strengthen the BJP in northern Telangana,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sacked-telangana-health-minister-joins-bjp-vows-to-expand-bjp-footprints-in-south-101623675824995.html
14-06-2021||India||Ayodhya land deal: Congress demands Supreme Court intervention||The Congress on Monday alleged corruption by the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust in the purchase of land for the temple in Ayodhya, and sought Supreme Court intervention in it, even as other Opposition parties demanded a clarification from the Trust.Addressing a press conference, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said, “Lord Shri Ram is a symbol of faith for this nation. But the misuse and fraud of funds collected from crores of Indians for the construction of Shri Ram temple in Ayodhya is a sin and gross iniquity, in which Bharatiya Janata Party leaders are involved.”The Congress was backing the allegations made by Samajwadi Party (SP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday. AAP’s UP in-charge and MP Sanjay Singh raised the issue at a press conference in Lucknow while SP’s Pawan Pandey made similar allegations in Ayodhya.Also Watch | ‘Hindus being cheated’: Ram Temple trust accused of land scam by OppositionQuoting entries of the registered sale deed of the land, they said that the land was first purchased by Sultan Ansari and Ravi Tiwari on March 18 this year from its original owner Kusum Pathak, wife of Harish Kumar Pathak alias Baba Hardas, for ₹2 crore. Minutes later, the same land was purchased by Trust’s general secretary Champat Rai for a sum of ₹18.50 crore.Trust member Anil Mishra and Ayodhya mayor Rishikesh Upadhyay were signatories to the ₹18.5 crore land sale deed, they alleged.Citing the same land deed, Surjewala asked why the Trust purchased the land at a higher price if the members were aware of its cost.He also alleged that Tiwari, who allegedly sold the land for ₹18.50 crore to the Trust, is related to Upadhyay.Surjewala questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence over “ Ram bhakts being duped in the name of Shri Ram”. He raised three questions for the Prime Minister and demanded answers. He asked if these “sinners who disrespected Lord Ram” have the Prime Minister’s protection. He asked how could BJP leaders, who take a pledge of values and morality in the name of Lord Ram, commit such “heinous sins”. And finally, he demanded to know how much more land of this type has been bought from the donations made in the name of temple construction.Since the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust was formed by the Supreme Court in 2019, he urged the Chief Justice of India and the apex court to “take cognizance of the whole matter and order a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the alleged scam”. The party also requested the Supreme Court to conduct an audit of the donations received and the expenses made by the Trust, along with making the audit report public before the citizens.”Also Read | ‘Misuse of donation an insult to faith’: Priyanka Gandhi on Ayodhya chargesIn Mumbai, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said such allegations against the Trust “have hurt our beliefs and sentiments”. He said, “The head of the trust should come forward and clarify the allegations levelled by the SP.”Delhi deputy chief minister and senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia also sought a clarification from the Trust. Terming it a “scam”, he said the temple is being built using donations made by people and their hard-earned money should not be misused.The Trust has refuted these allegations. Trust’s general secretary, Champat Rai, said in a statement that all land that the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra bought so far has been purchased at a price much lower than the market rates. “We do not fear allegations. I will study the allegations levelled against us and probe them,” he said.UP deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said, “The Trust is the authority here. It has to reply. But I wish to ask why these people start talking about Ram Temple and Lord Ram when elections are close? They must stop being allergic to the name of Lord Ram. It was such people who were raising slogans such as, “Mandir wahin banayengey, lekin date nahin bataayeige (we will build the temple at the Janmabhoomi but won’t say when). And now, when the temple is coming up following the order of the Supreme Court, these people are again creating a nuisance.”With agency inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-land-deal-congress-demands-scintervention-101623674144700.html

The extract is used in Ayurveda for fever, especially dengue, and the researchers found that it mimicked the working of several antivirals.In the cell cultures, the researchers found that the whole plant aqueous extract reduced the viral content by 57% and the hydroalcoholic extract (a solution made with water and alcohol) reduced it by 98%.Also Read | AIIMS Delhi to begin screening children between 6 and 12 yrs for Covaxin trialsThe researchers also tested the various molecules found in the extract individually against Sars-CoV-2 virus and found pareirarine had the highest inhibition of 80%, according to the pre-print study uploaded on BioRxiv on Sunday.“First we used connectivity map – a platform that has information on the pathways of various drug – to see how the plant extract likely works. What we found is that it has similar pathways of action like many antivirals. When we did the lab-based study, we found this to be true,” said Dr Mitali Mukerji, senior scientist at Genomics and molecular medicine department at CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology.She added, “This plant extract is already used in Ayurveda for fever, dengue, and some hormonal problems. So, the safety is established. Now, only a randomised clinical trial can tell whether it does help in reducing the severity or duration of the infection in people.”Drug expert CM Gulati said, “The principle of using plant extract for treating ailments is not new. The best examples would be quinine used to treat malaria that is derived from Cinchona trees and digoxin used to treat cardiac ailments derived from digitalis plants. But the current research is in very, very early stages. The scientists have to zero in on an active ingredient, decipher its chemical structure, and then develop a usable medicine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plant-extract-shown-to-reduce-sars-cov-2-viral-replication-in-lab-csir-study-101623673545039.html

Her remarks came days after the Supreme Court asked the West Bengal government to implement the scheme “immediately" to help beneficiaries."We do not have any problem with the implementation of 'One Nation, One Ration Card' scheme. It is under process," Mamata Banerjee was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The scheme allows eligible beneficiaries to get food grain under the National Food Security Act from fair price shops across India without securing a new ration card.On Friday, during a hearing on an application filed by activists, the top court asked West Bengal government to implement it so that beneficiaries, especially migrant workers, can get subsidised food. While the counsel for the Bengal government flagged the issue of seeding ration cards with Aadhaar, the top court was emphatic that “no excuse will be considered” and that West Bengal must make the scheme functional.The scheme is currently functional in 32 states and Union territories.During the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said that apart from Bengal, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Assam have also not implemented the 'one nation, one ration card (ONORC) scheme. The counsel for Delhi said the state government has implemented the scheme.The vacation bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah asked counsel for all state governments to submit a brief note on the implementation of the scheme and other policy measures taken to ensure supply of sufficient dry ration and provision of transportation facilities to migrant workers.The application was filed in the pending suo motu case of 2020 on the issue of problems faced by migrant workers due to curbs clamped in country amid a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-problem-with-one-nation-one-ration-card-scheme-says-mamata-banerjee-101623668698914.html

So, Gadhvi decided to join the system and clean the mess.”Asked who would be the party’s face in Gujarat, he said, “The 60 million people of Gujarat are the face of AAP.” He added, “It is the 20 million people of Delhi who are AAP’s face, not Kejriwal.

He was rushed to the district hospital where he was declared dead on arrival by the doctors, police said.Police said Sulabh Srivastava (44), a resident of Station Road area, was returning home around 10pm after work. Commuters found him injured on Katra Road and called the police.Additional director general of police (ADG) Prayagraj zone Prem Prakash, who visited the spot on Monday, said that prima facie it appeared that Srivastava’s motorcycle collided with an electricity pole due to which he received serious head injuries.

UP government silent. Journalists should expose the truth, warn the administration about the danger. The government is asleep. Does the UP government, which nurtures Jungle Raj, have any answer to the tears of the family members of journalist Sulabh Srivastava?” Gandhi tweeted in Hindi.Samajwadi Party leader Richa Singh also flayed the UP government and accused the police of failing to provide Srivastava with security despite his request. “This calls for a thorough probe and action against the guilty,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/journalist-found-dead-in-up-s-prayagraj-probe-on-101623663044193.html

There are the districts where the four Himalayan shrines are located. Cabinet minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal said, “Kedarnath will be open for people in Rudraprayag district, Badrinath will be open for people in Chamoli district, and Yamunotri and Gangotri shrines will be open for people in Uttarkashi district. Locals will have to carry their negative RT-PCR report,” he said. Uniyal said Covid curfew in the state has been extended from June 15 to June 22, with some relaxations in place. He said the number of attendees at weddings and funerals has also been increased from 20 to 50. Also Read | Uttarakhand extends Covid-19 curfew till June 22 with some relaxationsRecently, state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj had also said that the plan was to open Char Dham yatra in a phased manner, first for locals and then for those from outside. Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri, and Gangotri shrines are collectively called Char Dham. The pilgrimage begins from Yamunotri in the west. It proceeds to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the east.On April 29, the state government put the yatra, which was scheduled for May 14, on hold amid a spike in Covid cases. There were also fears that the yatra could turn into another super-spreader after many seers succumbed to Covid-19 after participating in Mahakumbh in the state’s Haridwar. Following the decision, only portals of the shrines were opened for a ritual worship by the priests. Portals of the Yamunotri shrine were opened on May 14; that of Gangotri on May 15; of Kedarnath on May 17; while the portals of Badrinath were opened on May 18. The yatra could not be held last year as per the schedule on April 26 with the opening of portals of Yamunotri and Gangotri, the first two shrines that are opened after winter, because of the lockdown in March 2020. The shrines were opened for local pilgrims on July 1 last year and for those from other states in the last week of that month. In September, the state government removed the condition of negative Covid-19 reports for pilgrims.  According to Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board officials, last year over 145,000 pilgrims visited Badrinath shrine and overall, 310,000 pilgrims came for Char Dham Yatra. Of the total pilgrims, 134,000 pilgrims visited Kedarnath, 23,837 pilgrims visited Gangotri and 7,731 pilgrims visited Yamunotri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-open-char-dham-yatra-for-locals-from-tomorrow-101623659984224.html
14-06-2021||India||Filmmaker Aisha Sultana moves HC seeking anticipatory bail in sedition case for remark against Lakshadweep administrator||Filmmaker Aisha Sultana on Monday approached the Kerala high court seeking anticipatory bail in sedition case against her. Sultana was booked by the Lakshadweep Police on June 10 after a complaint from Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) Lakshadweep unit president C Abdul Khader Haji over her remarks in a television debate.Aisha Sultana, appearing on a Malayalam TV channel, allegedly called the Union territory’s administrator, Praful Khoda Patel, a “bio-weapon” launched by the Centre. The remarks were made amid anger in the region over new rules introduced by Patel, which his opponents say threaten the livelihoods of islanders.The FIR filed on June 10 Haji's complaint said the accused generated hatred and opposition to the Union government by falsely and with ulterior motives. The case was registered by Kavaratti Police under Sections 121 A (sedition) and 153 (B) (assertions against national integration) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and she was asked to appear before the police on June 20. Sultana is currently settled in Kochi.The filmmaker said she used the word but did not attack the country or the Union government. “I was referring to some of the decisions of Patel which infuriated local people. Despite popular sentiment, he continues to antagonise people. As a local resident I have right to criticise him,” she said in a Facebook post.Many local BJP leaders protested against the slapping of sedition charge against Sultana. Over a dozen of them quit the party in protest.However, the BJP downplayed the resignations, claiming that the party is intact in the island.Over the last few days, there has been an uproar against Lakshadweep administrator Praful Khoda Patel over the new reforms introduced by him, which many allege are against the interest of the islanders.People are protesting against the draft legislations like Lakshadweep Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation (Goonda Act), Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation and Lakshadweep Panchayat Regulation, 2021 among others.Patel, who was appointed as the administrator of Lakshadweep in December 2020, is facing opposition over policies introduced by him from the people of the union territory and politicians, both from within Lakshadweep and the neighbouring state of Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sedition-case-over-bio-weapon-remark-filmmaker-aisha-sultana-moves-kerala-hc-101623658445835.html

14-06-2021||India||Telangana CM gifts luxury cars to 32 additional collectors, invites criticism||The Telangana government’s decision to hand out luxury cars made by Kia Motors, bought for approximately ₹9.6 crore, to 32 additional collectors with an aim to help them carry out developmental works has made the opposition accuse it of financial profligacy during a pandemic when the state is in high debt.The vehicles were handed over to the additional collectors after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao reviewed the developmental works in urban and rural areas at his camp office at Pragati Bhavan in Hyderabad, an official spokesman from the chief minister’s office (CMO) said.“The vehicles, each costing [the state] around ₹30 lakh, were procured by the Telangana State Road Transport Authority on the instructions of the chief minister. The vehicles will help the additional collectors in extensive tours of the villages as part of their duty,” an official in the transport department familiar with the development, said.The Telangana government introduced the post of additional collectors into the bureaucratic structure of the state in February 2020 positioning it as an administrative reform and part of an overhaul of the revenue department. Additional collectors, mostly drawn from Group-I officers, were appointed in each district (except Hyderabad), and were exclusively meant for taking care of developmental projects in rural areas. However, two additional collectors, one each for local bodies and revenue matters, were appointed in 10 districts.At Sunday’s meeting, KCR said the government will extend all facilities to the additional collectors. “In every district collectorate, additional collectors will be provided a room adjacent to the collector and enjoy the same protocol of the collector,” the chief minister said.All the KIA vehicles of Carnival model were lined up at Pragati Bhavan before being flagged off by transport minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar in the presence of chief secretary Somesh Kumar and deputy transport commissioner Papa Rao.The opposition parties said the chief minister was busy “appeasing” the bureaucrats when the state was reeling under a financial crisis due to Covid-19 pandemic.All India Congress Committee official spokesman Dasoju Sravan called it an “irresponsible” decision and claimed that the state’s debt had crossed ₹4 lakh crore.“These officials already have... their official cars for the last one year. Where is the need to give them the new cars...in this hour of crisis?” Sravan questioned.He alleged that the state government was struggling to increase the number of beds for treatment of Covid-19 patients in government hospitals, and didn’t have money to buy buses for public transport or even to clear the pending bills of contractors.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesman K Krishna Sagar Rao said it was a “criminal splurge” of public money.“This decision to buy ultra-luxury vehicles for additional collectors is horrendous and unthinkable in the current public health situation. We feel this money could have been used to expand beds or provide free treatment to the poor,” Rao said.Political analyst Suresh Dharur said KCR’s move was likely to send a wrong message. “It is not that the officials are going to the villages by bicycles. They must be having vehicles. Why should the government spend nearly ₹10 crore on buying them luxury cars at this stage? This is nothing but fiscal irresponsibility,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-cm-gifts-luxury-cars-to-32-additional-collectors-invites-criticism-101623658124307.html
14-06-2021||India||Pashupati Kumar Paras elected as LJP leader in Lok Sabha||Pashupati Kumar Paras was on Monday unanimously elected as the leader of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) in the Lok Sabha, according to news agency ANI. The decision comes after five of the six MPs of the LJP joined hands against Paswan and rallied behind Paras. These MPs will be meeting Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla at 3pm today in Delhi.It has been reported that the 'rebels' have not been happy with the style of functioning of Chirag, who took over the party reins after his father, LJP founder and former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan died in 2020.“There are 6 MPs in our party. It was the desire of 5 MPs to save our party. So, I’ve not broken the party, I’ve saved it. Chirag Paswan is my nephew as well as the party's national president. I have no objection against him,” Paras, who is currently representing the Hajipur Lok Sabha seat in Bihar, told reporters during a media interaction earlier in the day. However, he said that Paswan can continue to remain a member of the party.Amid the fast-paced developments, Chirag visited Paras’ residence on Monday but couldn't meet his uncle as he was not present at that time, PTI reported. Chirag has not commented on the matter yet.The removal of Chirag can also be directly linked to the poor performance of the LJP during the 2020 assembly elections in Bihar as it managed to win only one seat out of the 134 contested.Meanwhile, Pashupati Kumar Paras also said on Monday that the LJP will be a part of the NDA. Contrary to his nephew, Paras also praised Bihar chief minister and Janata Dal (United) president Nitish Kumar by saying he is a good leader and a development oriented man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pashupati-nath-paras-elected-as-ljp-leader-in-lok-sabha-101623657675140.html

The change was not done out of revenge but out of ‘majboori’ or a compulsion to correct the course of the party while staying in the NDA, he told HT. “Yah majboori ka faisla hai.

14-06-2021||India||‘LJP pushed to brink’: Pashupati Kr Paras explains ‘coup’ against Chirag Paswan||Five Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) Lok Sabha members claim to have removed Chirag Paswan as the leader of the parliamentary party on Sunday. His uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras, who is likely to be chosen their new leader, told HT that the change was done out of ‘majboori’ or a compulsion to correct the course of the party while staying in the NDA (National Democratic Alliance), and there was no intention to merge with any party.“Yah majboori ka faisla hai. (This is a decision taken out of compulsion). We were feeling suffocated,” Hajipur MP and brother of the late union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, Pashupati Kumar Paras told Hindustan Times. The rebellion against Chirag Paswan marks an attempt to end the party’s alienation in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which hastened with LJP’s decision to contest against Janata Dal-United (JD-U) in Bihar assembly polls last November. The decision was widely believed to have damaged the JD-U’s electoral prospects, reducing its tally to 43, and nearly costing the NDA power in the state. If that was not enough, Chirag Paswan-led LJP flopped badly, winning only one assembly seat. His clout further eroded when the party’s lone MLC Nutan Singh joined BJP in February this year and in April, the lone party MLA, Raj Kumar Singh joined the JD (U) in the presence of chief minister Nitish Kumar.“After the death of Ram Vilas Paswan on October 8, 2020, some of the unilateral decisions taken by the party leadership pushed the LJP to the brink of extinction,” Paras, who was hauled during the assembly elections for praising Nitish Kumar and forced to retract his statement, said reflecting on the reasons for party’s downhill journey after Chirag took over complete control over party’s affairs following his father’s death.LJP leaders aware of the development said that Paras would be formally made the party’s national president and the leader of the parliamentary party. “We met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and handed him a letter regarding these new developments,” confirmed Paras. Besides Paras, the party MPs who have now rebelled against Chirag Paswan’s leadership include his cousin Prince Raj (LJP state president and Samastipur MP), Mehboob Ali Qaiser, Veena Devi and Chandan Singh. LJP won six Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 polls. Paras said some leaders inducted in the party in the run up to Bihar polls were primarily responsible for the bad choices made. “99% of the party leaders and cadres wanted to be in the NDA and contest Bihar assembly elections together. However, influenced by some, it was decided to contest the election independently and everybody knows the humiliation the party suffered. It was a wrong decision and today the LJP doesn’t have a single representation in the assembly,” he said. Paras, however, ruled out merger with any party. “The party is intact, only the leadership has changed. The LJP, which was founded in 2000, has been a part of the NDA since 2014, and we will continue to be in the NDA,” he said, and heaped lavish praise on Nitish Kumar. “He is a vikas purush (man of development). Bihar has developed under his regime, and we will support him in this endeavour,” he added. Leaders in the NDA, aware of the political churning in the LJP, said that Chirag Paswan’s decision to take on Nitish Kumar head on damaged the JD-U’s prospects in 36-40 seats. The JD-U was working silently ever since to damage the LJP. More than 200 LJP leaders joined the JD-U after the polls and even Paras met with JD-U MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh, a close associate of Nitish Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ljp-pushed-to-brink-pashupati-kr-paras-explains-coup-against-chirag-paswan-101623655603739.html

Likewise, for hospitals also the condition has not improved in 70 years here. But things will change now," he added.Earlier in the day, Gujarat's senior journalist Isudan Gadhvi joined the AAP in the presence of Kejriwal.Kejriwal reached Gujarat on Monday for a one-day visit to the state. “Havey badlashe Gujarat.

14-06-2021||India||On Singur land law anniversary, Mamata Banerjee vows to fight for farmer rights||West Bengal chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday vowed to continue her fight for the rights of the farmers, remembering how her party's struggle in Singur brought about a positive change in the lives of the farmers. Banerjee has been raising her voice and supporting farmers' protest against three farm laws passed by Parliament in September last year."On this day, ten years back, the Singur Land Rehabilitation and Development Bill 2011 was passed in the WB assembly after a long & difficult struggle. We unitedly fought for the rights of our farmers & addressed their grievances, bringing in positive change in their lives," Mamata Banerjee said on Twitter."Today, it pains me that across the nation our farmer brethren are suffering owing to the indifference of the Centre. Together, we shall continue our fight to ensure the well-being of the very backbone of our society. Upholding their rights remains a top priority," she added in follow-up tweet.The West Bengal chief minister met Bharatya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Rakesh Tikait last week where she promised to rally opposition-ruled states in support of the agitating farmers, and said she aims to "remove the Narendra Modi government from power".Political experts see Banerjee's statement as a bid to take her political battle against the BJP into the Hindi heartland.The meeting was part of the BKU's bid to expand its agitation in other states ahead of the assembly elections. Tikait had supported the 'No vote for BJP' campaign ahead of the West Bengal assembly elections and even campaigned for Banerjee in Nandigram.The Singur Land Rehabilitation and Development Bill, which was passed by the West Bengal assembly on June 14, 2011, was among Banerjee's signature triumphs after coming to power for the first time in May 2011. She had defeated the Left Front government, in power for 34 years in Bengal on the back of her intense land agitation.The public protests were against allocation of land to Tata Motors to produce the Nano car. After intest public agitation, Tata shelved the project and moved the company's plant to Gujarat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-singur-land-law-anniversary-mamata-banerjee-vows-to-fight-for-farmer-rights-101623653712451.html

According to news agency PTI, Paswan drove to his uncle's residence and was allowed inside after waiting for some time in his car. Paras, however, was not home, PTI reported. Chirag Paswan's cousin and MP Prince Raj also lives at the same address.Prince Raj, the LJP's state president and Samastipur MP, along with Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Qaiser--said to be unhappy with Chirag Paswan's way of working--elected Pashupati Kumar Paras in his place. They have also written Lok Sabha Speaker Om Prakash Birla and conveyed their decision of electing Pashupati Kumar Paras as the LJP leader in the Lower House.'Out of compulsion'"I have not broken the party but saved it," Paras, an MP from Hajipur, insisted adding that his group will remain a part of the BJP-led NDA and that Chirag Paswan can be part of the organisation.He also said that 99 per cent of LJP workers were unhappy with the turn of events in Bihar as Paswan led his party against the JD(U) in the 2020 assembly polls and did not perform well.Pashupati Kumar Paras told HT that the change was done out of compulsion to correct the course of the party while staying in the National Democratic Alliance, and there was no intention to merge with any party. “Yah majboori ka faisla hai. (This is a decision taken out of compulsion). We were feeling suffocated,” he said.“After the death of Ram Vilas Paswan on October 8, 2020, some of the unilateral decisions taken by the party leadership pushed the LJP to the brink of extinction,” Paras said.Paras would be formally made the party’s national president and the leader of the parliamentary party, according to LJP leaders aware of the development. “We met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and handed him a letter regarding these new developments,” Paras said.Paras also praised Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar as a good leader and "vikas purush" (development-oriented man) indicating the difference with his nephew Chirag Paswan, who has been a strong critic of the JD(U) president."Chirag Paswan is my nephew as well as the party's national president. I have no objection against him," he also said.On his part, Chirag Paswan has not commented on the development.Also read | 175 LJP functionaries join BJP; party disowns turncoatsIn March this year, as many as 175 leaders, ranging from state to district and block-level office bearers, besides panchayat presidents of the LJP, switched over to the BJP.

The development comes even as Covid-19 cases in the neighbouring districts of the border areas continue to gradually deter. Bangladesh had shut its borders with India earlier in April, and the border closure was extended twice -- on May 8 and then on May 29 -- in view of the lethal, more infectious second of the coronavirus disease pandemic.Bangladesh decided to extend border closure with India at a high-level inter-ministerial meeting on June 13, the country's ministry of foreign affairs reportedly told Dhaka Tribute. The decision was taken amid a backdrop of a rising number of Covid-19 cases in Bangladesh. The country reported its highest single-day spike in the death toll in over a month on Sunday with 47 new fatalities, as authorities take note of the alarming rise in cases. It has also been reported that the Delta variant of the coronavirus disease, which is highly contagious, is more prevalent in Bangladesh.Although borders with India are currently closed, Bangladeshi nationals who have a valid visa of 15 days or less will be allowed to return home to their country, albeit on the condition of a mandatory 14-day Covid-19 necessitated quarantine.Last month, Bangladesh foreign minister AK Abdul Momen had called the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation in the country a "crisis" and had mounted a diplomatic campaign to acquire Covid-19 vaccines from the US, China, Canada, Russia, and the UK, in addition to India. He had also expressed fears over people carrying the virus into the country, noting that although Bangladesh closed its borders with India on April 26, scores of Bangladeshis who returned from India through Benapole land port may have carried the more infectious strain of the coronavirus.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bangladesh-extends-border-closure-with-india-in-view-of-covid-19-situation-101623643428594.html

The positivity rate, which was around 8% in mid-May, stood at 2.16% on Sunday. The present set of restrictions, which include curfew from 1 pm till 5 am daily, as well as ban on inter-district movement, will end on Wednesday and the state government is expected to issue new Covid-19 guidelines within a day or two.However, health experts argued that the government should have allowed for a two-week cooling period after taking the second dose before calling employees to offices."Getting a second dose of Covid-19 vaccine doesn't give protection from possible infection..., though the severity of the infection is considerably less. The second dose doesn't give immediate results and the recipients need to wait for two weeks for the vaccine to work properly. It would have been prudent if the government order clarified that only those employees who have got the second dose at least two weeks ago need to return to work," said Dr Hemanga Baishya, office bearer of the Assam chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA).The government employees’ union in the state says it has no objection to resumption of physical attendance in offices.“Since the decision to allow all employees who have taken both doses of vaccine to join office was taken by the health department after due consideration, we have nothing much to say on the issue,” said Basab Kalita, adviser of Sadou Assam Karmachari Parishad, the umbrella organization of government employees in the state.He, however, warned that the attendance could be low since the ban on inter-district movement was still in place and many employees were yet to get their second doses.“We, however, appeal to all employees to take adequate safety measures at offices. The government should provide sanitisers and other things needed to maintain Covid-19 protocols,” Kalita said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-govt-employees-who-got-both-covid-19-vaccine-doses-told-to-return-to-work-101623644983205.html

He has already been denied bail in the Dominica high court.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and ministry of external affairs (MEA) have filed affidavits in Dominica high court establishing his Indian citizenship and crime committed by him in India. How did Choksi become one of India’s ‘Top Wanted’ with an Interpol warrant in his name? HT brings to you a quick guide before Choksi takes the stand:Who is Mehul Choksi?Mehul Choksi is the owner of the Gitanjali Group, a retail jewellery company. He is also the uncle of Nirav Modi and together, the duo is alleged to have defrauded Punjab National Bank of ₹13,500 crore. The fraud consisted of taking bank loans by raising Letters of Undertakings and showing fake transactions of jewellery import to India through shell entities.What followedChoksi and Nirav Modi fled India in January 2018. In February, CBI launched an investigation into the alleged scam. The agency made its first arrests in the case soon after -- two PNB employees and an executive of Modi’s group. In the same month, the Enforcement Directorate also seized a cumulative of ₹56.74 billion worth of diamonds, gold and jewellery from the offices of the accused.A Mumbai court in June 2018 issued a non-bailable warrant against Choksi.Also Read | Choksi a fugitive from justice, CBI tells courtIn July 2019, Interpol issued Red Notice against him. A Red Notice is sent to seek the location or arrest of a person wanted by a judicial jurisdiction or an international tribunal with a view to their extradition.Choksi has been in Antigua and Barbuda since 2018 as a citizen from where he went missing on May 23, 2021. He was found in Dominica the next day and has since been charged with illegal entry into the Caribbean country. Choksi’s lawyers, Vijay Aggarwal, Wayne Marsh, and his wife, Priti Choksi, have alleged he was abducted and taken to Dominica. While he is seeking to be repatriated to Antigua where he enjoys citizenship, Antigua PM Gaston Browne has refused to grant him entry and asked the Dominican government to directly deport him to India. Antigua has denied abduction charges but on a complaint filed by his lawyers, the island’s police is looking into the allegations, Browne said last week.Case in Dominica courtHT on Saturday reported about two affidavits India has filed in the Dominica court detailing serious fraud charges against Choksi and proof that he continues to be an Indian citizen. Choksi’s lawyers have maintained he has given up his Indian citizenship and hence cannot be deported.The Dominica court refused to grant Choksi bail saying he is a flight risk, and that he has no ties to the country. It observed the court cannot impose any conditions to ensure he will not abscond.The CBI affidavit has called Choksi the “mastermind” behind a series of companies. It says there is evidence that the businessman laundered funds using dummy companies and market operators, round-tripped in the guise of fraudulent export-import transactions with entities in places such as Dubai and Hong Kong. It says there is an Interpol red notice issued against Choksi, which is the highest level that can be issued in respect of a fugitive.Choksi’s lawyers have pleaded he was abducted, tortured and brought to Dominica on May 23. While Dominica state prosecutors have denied the allegations and have booked him for illegal entry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/choksis-illegal-entry-case-up-for-hearing-in-dominica-court-today-101623642822866.html

14-06-2021||India||BJP leadership reiterates background checks before engaging professionals||After appointments to the chief minister’s offices in Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand came under a cloud on account of the individuals’ social media statements against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the party high command reiterated that all selections should be made after assessing the ideological leanings of the candidates, said a person aware of the details.“This has been conveyed verbally by the people in-charge to all the states,” said the person.On June 8, Tushar Panchal, who has worked with Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in the past, was appointed as his officer on special duty (OSD), but following an outcry over his social media posts that were perceived to be critical of the BJP government and its ideology, he bowed out from accepting the position.In May, former journalist Dinesh Mansera’s selection for the position of media advisor to Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat was criticised. Mansera was appointed on May 17, but an uproar regarding his social media posts followed, and he declined the position.Also Read | More TMC turncoats voice discontentCommenting on the need for screening candidates, the person quoted above said, “If someone, who has commented against the BJP government or the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) or its leaders, is appointed to a senior position in the government, it sends a wrong message and is embarrassing. It also raises questions about propriety and discipline.”Panchal’s appointment had created a furore in the BJP’s state unit. Among those who tweeted against Panchal’s appointment were Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinder Bagga and a member of the RSS in Delhi Rajeev Tuli.“Panchal runs an advertisement agency and has been working with the CM for some years now. However, since he did not have an official designation, it was decided to appoint him as OSD in the CMO. A letter announcing his appointment was also issued by the government,” said a second person aware of the details.Asked if the government or the party were aware of his old tweets criticising the BJP, the second person said it could have been a “lapse”.In Mansera’s case, however, an RSS functionary said the criticism was “misplaced” as he is “ideologically inclined towards the Sangh.”Mansera, who has worked in NDTV and Sangh-affiliated newsletter Panchajanya, posted a statement on social media saying he chose not to accept the position due to the criticism he received online.This is not the first time that old tweets of individuals in government positions have been flagged for their anti- BJP stance. Last year, Rekha Sharma, chairperson of the National Commission for Women, was accused of having made disparaging and sexist tweets in 2012 by the Opposition. Sharma had eventually hidden her tweets.“There are some people who have tweeted against the BJP and RSS in the past and called us intolerant. They should at least publicly apologise for such comments,” said Tuli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-leadership-reiterates-background-checks-before-engaging-professionals-101623640903240.html

The Shaheedi Diwas of Guru Arjan Dev in 2021 is on June 14. According to the Hindu calendar, the Shaheedi Diwas or the martyrdom day of Guru Arjan Dev is observed on Jeth Sudi 4, which falls on June 14 this year.Born in 1563 in Goindval of Tarn Taran district, Guru Arjan Dev was the first martyr of the Sikh religion and was executed on the orders of Mughal emperor Jahangir. The Mughals were afraid of his increasing influence in northern India and the spread of Sikhism.He had compiled the first edition of the Sikh scripture Adi Granth, which is now known as Guru Granth Sahib.On Guru Arjan Dev's martyrdom day, people often organise religious events where they read Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Langars are also distributed in Gurudwara. This year due to the second wave of Covid-19, no big event will be organised.Every year, a batch of Sikh pilgrims, also known as jatha, travels to Pakistan to mark the martyrdom day of Guru Arjan Dev at Gurdwara Dehra Sahib in Lahore. This year, the jatha was scheduled to depart for Pakistan on June 6.The jatha would not be able to travel to Pakistan this year to mark the martyrdom day of Guru Arjan Dev as Pakistan has not granted permission to it due to the coromavirus pandemic, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guru-arjan-dev-martyrdom-day-know-about-its-significance-history-101623633731812.html
14-06-2021||India||Opposition condemns KCR govt's purchasing of luxury vehicles for IAS officers amid Covid crisis||The Telangana government came under Opposition's fire for purchasing a fleet of luxury cars for IAS officers in the state amid the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.As many as 32 new luxury multi-utility vehicles reached Pragati Bhavan on Sunday for distribution to additional collectors posted in the state.With the state exchequer in a bad condition due to less revenue and insufficient medical infrastructure, the allocation of the cars, estimated to cost about ₹25 lakh each, has raised eyebrows.Criticising the move, BJP spokesperson K Krishna Sagar Rao registered a strong opposition on his party's behalf against the "criminal splurge of public exchequer" by Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) to "appease bureaucrats" in the state."How can Chief Minister KCR justify spending over ₹11 crores to buy 32 ultra-luxury vehicles for additional collectors in Telangana State ?" the BJP leader asked.Claiming that Telangana Chief Minister is indulging into a "massive wastage of public money" in the middle of a pandemic, he termed the decision to buy ultra-luxury vehicles for additional collectors as "horrendous and unthinkable" in the current public health situation.Krishna Sagar Rao further said, "Finance Minister Harish Rao made statements recently that state has lost massive revenue with COVID-19 lockdowns and wanted increased Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) limits to raise more loans."The BJP questioned the Finance Minister's bare minimum fiscal discipline in the current economic situation as his department is releasing crores of rupees for ultra-luxury vehicles.Krishna Sagar suggested that the money used in buying luxury cars could have been used to expand beds or provide free treatment to the poor. He demanded the immediate rollback of the decision and asked the government to stop the purchase of the vehicles.He also blamed the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government for "brazen appeasement" of bureaucrats and said, "BJP wants to know, what is the Chief Minister expecting from the additional collectors with this brazen bureaucrats appeasement splurge?"The move also attracted criticism from Telangana Congress. AICC Spokesperson Sravan Dasoju called the Telangana government's move a "height of irresponsible expenditure"."The TRS government led by KCR is completely irresponsible in handling public money. As such KCR has pushed the surplus state of Telangana into a debt trap with a whopping debt of about ₹4 lakh crores," claimed the Congress leader."On top of it, when the state is in a serious financial crisis due to COVID, KCR has the audacity to buy 32 luxury cars, at a cost of ₹30 lakhs each, as a gift to his additional collectors. They already have government cars with them in good condition. What was the need to buy new cars?" asked Dasoju.The Congress leader further cornered the Telangana CM, saying that he wants to "allure" the collectors with new cars and make them "mere spectators" of his misgovernance."The TRS government does not have money to ramp up the beds in government hospitals. They do not have money to buy buses for public transport, do not have money even for making payments to the contractors, and release bills that are pending for months. In such a crisis it is completely unacceptable that KCR is misusing public money," stated Dasoju.Condemning the callous spending, he said, "We wonder if the KCR government has colluded with the car company and dealers for the unwanted deal worth crores in this financial crisis. I wonder whether it is a dubious deal of the state government to get financial relief from the car company."He further reminded the Chief Minister that he is only a custodian of public money and not the owner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-condemns-kcr-govt-s-purchasing-of-luxury-vehicles-for-ias-officers-amid-covid-crisis-101623632545351.html

14-06-2021||India||EC gets legal notice over no response to PIL||The Election Commission of India has been served a legal notice on June 13 for failing to respond to a PIL filed in the Delhi high court seeking fair and transparent internal elections in political parties. The poll body has been given seven days to respond, failing which the petitioner, C Rajashekaran, might initiate contempt proceedings against it.The case dates to November 11, 2020, when Rajashekaran approached EC seeking the establishment of internal democracy in political parties. But when he didn’t receive any response, he filed a PIL in the Delhi high court, drawing attention of the court to EC’s 1996 notice that had asked political parties to follow the rules laid down in their own constitutions regarding internal elections.On January 12, HC passed an order in which it asked EC to treat the petition as a representation. The notice sent to the chief election commissioner accused the Commission of treating the representation with “total disregard”. HT has seen a copy of the notice. HT reached out to the EC spokesperson but did not receive a response immediately.The petition had asked EC to de-register a political party for non-compliance.According to a former election commission official familiar with the matter, the 1996 notice issued by the EC that threatened “legal measures as are available, necessary and appropriate”, including de-registering of political parties, was issued in the context of lack of elections in the Indian National Congress.“But the concern was not just limited to Congress. The Commission continued to monitor party elections post 1996 and granted extensions to other political parties, while telling others to hold elections earlier than the time they sought. Many such orders were passed.”The timing of the petition is significant, given the internal turmoil in Congress over affairs in Rajasthan and Punjab, and internal elections deferred due to the pandemic.According to Rajashekaran, starting a political party has become a business. “There is no fair system, there is no oversight,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-gets-legal-notice-over-no-response-to-pil-101623628465406.html
14-06-2021||India||Patent waiver proposal on Covid vaccines gets widespread support at G7: MEA||A proposal by India and South Africa to temporarily waive patents on Covid-19 vaccines to ensure their equitable access received widespread support at the G7 summit in the UK, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Sunday.In a virtual address at an inaugural outreach session of the summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought the support of the grouping to lift patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines.The MEA said Modi's call was supported by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, WTO Director-General Okonjo Iweala and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres."I can confirm that there was widespread support in deliberations for text-based negotiations on the India-South Africa proposal for TRIPS waiver at the World Trade Organisation (WTO)," P Harish, additional secretary (economic relations) in the MEA, said at a press conference.The TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) council of the WTO is likely to start text-based negotiations on the proposal.Calling on the G7 to demonstrate leadership, Modi sought the grouping's strong support for the proposal for a TRIPS waiver at the WTO, Harish said about the prime minister's remarks on Saturday at the session titled 'Building Back Stronger-Health'"His call was echoed by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Referring to his conversation with the prime minister earlier, PM Morrison expressed his strong support for the TRIPS waiver, as did the Director-General of the WTO, Okonjo Iweala, and the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, who identified the TRIPS waiver as an important element of his 'Global Vaccination Plan'- a roadmap to vaccinate the entire global population by doubling vaccine production," Harish said.He said French President Emmanuel Macron also highlighted the need to focus on ramping up production capacity in Africa and called on India to lend its expertise as an important production hub globally.The Group of Seven (G7) comprises the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.As chair of G7, the UK invited India, Australia, South Korea, South Africa to the summit as Guest countries.The G7 has pledged to donate an additional one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines within the next year.Asked about G7's views on making available finances to boost vaccine production, the additional secretary said there was a general agreement to increase capacity in various regional manufacturing hubs and provide financing, technology transfer and skilling in these regions.On whether the summit deliberated on how the Covid-19 originated in China, Harish did not give a direct reply."The leaders of the G7 and guest countries had a very intense and detailed discussion on the need for reforming the global health governance," he said."I would like to emphasise in this regard that India has been actively engaged with the international community at the levels of the G20, the G7 and the World Health Assembly on various aspects related to dealing with the current pandemic, learning lessons and preparing for future pandemics," he added.Harish said Prime Minister Modi thanked the G7 and guest countries for the support shown to India during the difficult second wave of the pandemic and urged caution and vigilance even as things were getting better.Modi also highlighted India's 'Whole of Government, Whole of Society' approach to the pandemic, with the efforts of governments at all levels, civil society and industry synergized for best results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patent-waiver-proposal-on-covid-vaccines-gets-widespread-support-at-g7-mea-101623626660242.html
14-06-2021||India||Pangs of displacement in Jewar||It is a sweltering June afternoon and Ranjeet Singh, a resident of Nagla Ganeshi, a village in Jewar, is sitting surrounded by the rubble of what was his ancestral house till two months back. A few household items — a dressing table, a desert cooler, a few chairs, a charpoy and old wooden doors — are strewn around him.“These doors are from our baithak (drawing room), which used to be here,” says Singh, his face pensive and perspiring, pointing to a heap of broken bricks. “Everything in the village, the streets, the shops, the houses, chaupal, are now just one massive mound of rubble”.Indeed Singh’s village today looks like a bombed-out war zone, with all its 125-odd houses having been razed to make way for an upcoming airport — in Uttar Pradesh’s Gautam Budh Nagar district, roughly 80 kilometres away from Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport.Families, including Singh’s, have for now shifted to rented houses in neighbouring villages, but his new rented home was not big enough to accommodate all his belongings and cattle. “So, I sold all my cattle, and until I can figure out what to do with these belongings, I will come and sleep here every day. We had to move out in a hurry as the officials said that the work on the airport cannot begin until we vacate, as the airstrip will come up in our village,” says Singh. In the distance, one can see a few other villagers collecting bricks from the demolished houses and loading them on tractor trolleys.Nagla Ganeshi is among seven villages — Nagla Sharif Khan, Nagla Phool Khan, Nagla Chhittar, Kishorepur, Rohi, and Dayanatpur Kheda — in Jewar where land has been acquired for the airport, officially known as the Noida International Greenfield Airport. The villagers, whose houses need to be demolished, have been allocated plots in an upcoming integrated township on the outskirts of Jewar town, about 11km away from their villages.The administration has set a June-end deadline for the people to move. While all the houses in Singh’s village lie flattened, with almost everyone having shifted, the process of demolition is on in other neighbouring villages. In all, over 750 of 3,003 families whose houses are to demolished, have already moved out.But villagers, most of whom complain of being given little time to shift, say demolishing their ancestral houses and leaving behind a cherished life in the village where they were born and brought up, is an emotionally distressing experience, exacerbated by the fact that their development-induced displacement will forever alter family and neighbourhood-ties, social structure and local traditions of their villages and also the intra-and inter-village relationships that they treasured for decades.In Nagla Phool Khan village, Kayum Khan, 42, has employed about 10 labourers to demolish his house, which is spread across 4,200 square feet. He says, the family has had to demolish seven houses of the same size, belonging to his brothers.“It’s a strangely sad feeling to supervise the demolition of your own ancestral house, and the worst part is that we seven brothers will not be living together next to each other anymore in the new township, where we have been allocated plots far from each other through a draw of lots.”Kunwar Pal, a resident of neighbouring Rohi village, has entirely different worries. He says his fear of the ‘new social order’ in the upcoming sprawling new township and his aversion to norms of urban life are the reasons why instead of moving to the new township in Jewar, he will be moving to a village in Khurja district in UP, where he has some relatives.“I do not want my granddaughter to go to a co-education school here. Besides, our village is being turned into a city enclave, which might over the next few years adopt urban mores and lifestyle. I have never lived in a city, ” says Kunwar Pal, 66, speaking fluent English. “You see, I was a topper in my school,” he says and then quickly returns to the point he was making about the urbanisation of his village. “Our village is already being referred to as ‘Pocket 1’ in the new township. At least the plots should have been allotted according to who is living next to whom here,” he adds.In the new township, each of the seven villages where land has been acquired, is divided into seven pockets. While Rohi is Pocket 1, Nagla Ganeshi (Ranjit Singh’s village) is Pocket 2. Currently, the resettlement township is a vast construction site, with many villagers overseeing the building of their new houses.Ask Kunwar Pal’s 94-year-old father, who is sitting on a charpoy next to him, about what he feels about having to leave his ancestral house, and he answers the question by reciting a verse in Hindi in his low raspy voice. “The death of one’s child, the demise of one’s life partner, and loss of one’s birthplace are the most painful losses in life. I have lived here all my life and I wanted to die here at my birthplace. It would not be possible now,” he says.For Mahendra Sharma, who lives near Pal’s house, the biggest issue is where he would find space for his 26 buffaloes and cows. “They are the source of my livelihood and my entire life has revolved around them. The officials, who have asked us to move, offered no solution about what to do with them,” says Sharma.The displacement is also leading to differences between the village community.Nepal Singh, another Rohi resident, says that the neighbouring villages have doubled land rates as many people in the villages whose land has been acquired are looking to buy some land to build their houses.“Adding to our woes is the administration which wants us to leave by the end of this month even before the new township is properly built. It does not work like this,” he added.Surendra Singh, divisional commissioner (Meerut), who is also the rehabilitation and resettlement commissioner for the airport project, says, “This is a model rehabilitation resettlement project. All the village residents have been compensated for the land and given plots free of cost in the modern township which will have all necessary community infrastructure, including, community centres, school, among others. We have completed the rehabilitation and resettlement process and now it is for them to build their houses as soon as possible. ”Tell him about the villages’ problem with space for their cattle and he says, “ We have provided everything that was legally due as part of rehabilitation and resettlement scheme.”Professor Vivek Kumar, chairperson, Centre for the Study of Social Systems at Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University, says when a rural community is displaced, people are not displaced just physically, but also sociologically, culturally, and spatially, which lead to a lot of perplexities, uncertainties, and alienation. “So, wherever there is development-induced displacement, the administration should be mindful and ensure that there is a thorough study of the community and it should try to replicate the old settlement as much as possible at the new place,” he says.It is late evening and back in Nagla Ganeshi, Ranjeet Singh has been joined by Jitendra Kumar, his 27-year-old nephew. “I am a university graduate, and the government has promised me a job near the airport. As long as I get a job, I am fine with leaving my village and being resettled anywhere. There is always some price to pay for development,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pangs-of-displacement-in-jewar-101623623500035.html
14-06-2021||India||Cancel bid to extract hydrocarbon from Cauvery: Stalin to Modi||Chennai: In a strongly worded letter, Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cancel a bid called by the union ministry of petroleum and natural gas to extract hydrocarbon from the state’s protected agriculture zone and basin of the river Cauvery.He said that they have learnt of the union ministry inviting bids on June 10 for the development of oil and gas fields at Vadatheru in Tamil Nadu’s Pudukkottai district which falls under a Protected Agricultural Zone, under the Tamil Nadu Protected Agricultural Zone Development Act, 2020 which prohibits any new exploration, drilling and extraction of oil, natural gas and other similar hydrocarbons.The identified area also comes within the Cauvery basin, which Stalin said is the ‘bedrock’ of food security and agro-based economy “from time immemorial”. Stalin said that it is his government’s firm view that no hydrocarbon projects should be accepted in these regions, to protect the interests of the Agrarian community and the ecology of the region.“Unfortunately, the sentiments of the people, the probable ecological impact and the legal enactments by the Government of Tamil Nadu have not been taken into account by the relevant authorities,” Stalin said in his letter.“The calling of bids by the Government of India has already ignited public agitation in Pudukkottai and neighbouring districts apprehending the adverse consequences of hydrocarbon extraction in this Agrarian region… This ecologically fragile zone supports the livelihood of millions of farmers and farmworkers. In this context, projects to extract hydrocarbons from the Cauvery basin have faced unanimous strident opposition from all stakeholders.”Stalin urged Modi to immediately intervene and cancel the project and asked his government to consult the state before such moves. “I also request you to instruct the ministry to consult the state government ab initio before bringing any area in Tamil Nadu for any auctions in future for hydrocarbon exploration and extraction,” he said. He added that the state government has consistently opposed hydrocarbon exploration and extraction projects in the Cauvery basin and neighbouring districts.Environmental activists such as Nityanand Jayaraman have welcomed Stalin’s statement asking the union government to withdraw from the mining lease auction. “TN is not for sale, Modiji,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cancel-bid-to-extract-hydrocarbon-from-cauvery-stalin-to-modi-101623615158207.html
14-06-2021||India||Women can now train to be priests: TN minister||In a progressive step, temples in Tamil Nadu may soon have women appointed as priests if a proposal to offer them training is approved. “We will take steps to provide training to women who are interested in becoming priests. We will take this proposal to the chief minister (M K Stalin) and get necessary approvals,” PK Sekar Babu, the minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE), told reporters on Saturday. The department, he said, has received petitions from several women seeking permission to perform poojas at temples.There are temples in a few places across India where women are Archakars (temple priests), and the minister noted that women are already performing poojas in temples in rural areas.The new DMK government will also take steps to ensure to recite poojas and mantras in Tamil, besides Sanskrit. They plan to install boards in 47 temples with details of priests’ names and phone numbers who can perform the rituals in Tamil.The minister added that they would implement a government order, passed by the late former chief minister M Karunanidhi in 2006 that allows non-Brahmins who have undergone training to become priests in Tamil Nadu. He said that an announcement on the appointment of priests from all castes would be made soon by the chief minister. “This will happen in another 100 days when the scheme will come into full force,” he said. About 200-dd non-Brahmins, who passed a one-year junior Archakars course in 2007-2008, are still waiting for their appointment. Without specifying a number, the DMK had in its election manifesto promised their jobs.The announcements were made following a review meeting of regional joint commissioners of the HR&CE department to discuss matters such as vacancies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-can-now-train-to-be-priests-tnminister-101623614798230.html
14-06-2021||India||Gujarat is ready for change, says Kejriwal ahead of visit||Gujarat is now ready for transformation,” said Aam Aadmi Party supremo and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday, as he announced his visit to Ahmedabad on Monday ahead of the Gujarat assembly elections in 2022. During his visit, Kejriwal is set to inaugurate the AAP’s new state office and hold meetings with state leaders to discuss the future strategy, said officials familiar with the matter.“Havey badlashe Gujarat. Kaley hun Gujarat aavi rahyo chhu, Gujarat na bhai-behno ney malish (the state will transform now, am coming to Gujarat tomorrow and meet the people of the state),” Kejriwal tweeted in Gujarati.The AAP’s Gujarat media incharge, Tuli Banerjee, said Kejriwal will arrive in Ahmedabad on Monday morning.According to people familiar with the developments, the AAP is looking for a prominent face to lead the election campaign in Gujarat. This will be Kejriwal’s second visit to Gujarat this year.He last visited Surat in February this year, after the AAP’s encouraging performance in the city’s municipal corporation elections. In its debut performance, the AAP emerged as the main opposition to the BJP, winning 27 seats in the 120-member Surat Municipal Corporation and leaving the Congress with zero seats.The visit comes a day after two estranged sects of the powerful Patidar (Patel) community -- Kadva Patel and Leuva Patel -- came on a common platform to praise the AAP during an event in Rajkot’s Kagwad.Patidar leader Naresh Patel appreciated the “work culture of the AAP”. According to Patel, the key topic of discussion during Saturday’ meeting was to push for Patel as a chief minister contender in Gujarat.Patels, who form 14% of the electorate, have been an influential caste right since the anti-reservation agitation of the 80’s and they have been economically powerful. They have been a strong votebank of the BJP, until the 2015 Hardik Patel agitation that had helped immensely helped the Congress in the 2017 assembly polls.Earlier, the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samithi (PAAS) had extended support to the AAP candidates contesting from Patidar-dominated areas in the Surat civic elections.A Patidar leader, who was present at the meeting, said there was resentment among the community leaders that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was “giving a short shrift to the Patels”.“The chief minister is a Jain, the BJP president (CR) Paatil is a Marathi. They had a Patidar president in Jitu Vaghani, who is a Patel, but has been sidelined,” he said.A BJP spokesperson Yagnesh Dave said,“When a social community leader speaks, he should say that the Chief Minister should work for the welfare of their community. It is very selfish to say that the CM should be only from a certain caste.” As for the Patidar congregation praising the AAP, he said, “That is their personal opinion, we won’t like to comment on this.”Political analyst Vidyut Joshi said, “The Patidar leaders are seeing an opportunity in the emergence of AAP, especially after the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti backed the party in the Surat civic body polls, and AAP may well try to find a constituency in them. In this case, Naresh Patel himself aspires to be the CM, so the Patidar card.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-is-ready-for-change-says-kejriwal-ahead-of-visit-101623613939680.html
14-06-2021||India||Kedarnath shrine to get Adi Shankaracharya’s 12-feet tall statue||A 12 feet tall and 35-tonne statue of Adi Shankaracharya will be set up at Kedarnath Char Dham shrine within a month or so. It will reach Gauchar area in Chamoli district on June 25. Expressing his gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said, “This is a moment of great honour for all of us as we welcome the life-size statue of Guru Adi Shankaracharya in our state. The sculptors of Mysore have done a formidable job and have completed this beautiful statue in record time.” Kerala-born Adi Shankaracharya was an 8th-century Indian mystic and philosopher who consolidated the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta and made significant contribution in unifying Hinduism by setting up four mathas (monastic institutions) across India. The Uttarakhand Himalayas hold a lot of significance in the context of Adi Shankaracharya as he is believed to have taken samadhi at Kedarnath. It was in Uttarakhand that he established one of the four mathas at Joshimath and also established the idol at Badrinath. State tourism minister Satpal Maharaaz said Shankaracharya’s philosophy inspires people to live a life with spirituality under the fold of Sanatan Dharma. “The Mathas or monastic seats established by him are the epitome of Advaita Vedanta philosophy. The installation of the statue in Kedarnath is a moment of great pride for all of us and will further motivate us to adopt his teachings for a meaningful and better life.” The 12 feet tall 35-tonne statue has been sculpted by Mysore-based sculptor Arjun Yogiraj. He is a fifth-generation sculptor and has inherited the art from his father. He was selected to make the statue by the PMO last year and began the work in September 2020. The statue is made of Chlorite Schist Stone which is known to withstand rain, sunshine and harsh climate, said officials. In January this year, the Uttarakhand high court had directed the state government to complete the restoration of the samadhi of Adi Shankaracharya near Kedarnath Temple within a year. The samadhi was damaged in the June 2013 Kedarnath tragedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kedarnath-shrine-to-get-adi-shankaracharya-s-12-feet-tall-statue-101623609519537.html
14-06-2021||India||Will contest upcoming polls alone: Maha Cong||Mumbai Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s statement at party’s anniversary function and his meeting with poll strategist Prashant Kishor this week have left ally Congress fuming. The Maharashtra Congress, while reacting sharply to the developments, has said that it will go solo in all the elections being held henceforth in Maharashtra and its allies should not take them for granted. Pawar, during the celebration of NCP’s 22nd foundation on Thursday, had said that Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), the alliance of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress in power in the state, will fight the next Lok Sabha and assembly polls together. He said that MVA will complete its term and also hailed Shiv Sena for standing firm on its commitments on political support. A day after it, Pawar along with other party leaders, met poll strategist Prashant Kishor at former’s Mumbai residence, leading to speculations about a national coalition against the BJP. It was NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik who had fuelled the speculations on Saturday when he had said, “There is a need to form a formidable alliance of opposition parties against the BJP at the national level ahead of the next general elections. Pawar saheb had himself spoken about the need to have such a national alliance and had said that he would try to bring together all such forces.” But Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole said that his party would fight all the forthcoming elections separately. “We have already announced that we will go solo in all the forthcoming local body elections, likely to be held from November, and assembly polls thereafter. We do not want to keep our allies in the dark and ditch them ahead of the polls. We are preparing to go solo, and they are free to do so. Congress would be the single largest party in the 2024 assembly polls,” Patole said. Party’s working president Arif Naseem Khan said that the party will benefit if it fights the local elections on its own. “It will also help in regaining the old glory when the party used to form the government in the state single-handedly. What Patole said is the party’s official stand,” he said. But NCP’s Malik, while reacting to statements by Congress leaders, said on Sunday that no talks were being held among the three members of the MVA alliance on the Lok Sabha or assembly elections. “Patole aspires to become the chief minister of Maharashtra, and the statement reflects it. Every party has the right to spread its wings and such statements are necessary to keep the morale of the party workers high. The MVA alliance is ruling unitedly by taking decisions close to the heart of the people. We may fight the local body elections in alliance of three or two ruling parties or even separately, depending on the political situation at the local level,” he said. But the differences among the three allies are out in the front. The Congress, ever since the MVA government was formed in November 2019, has been complaining about being sidelined by its allies. The party leaders feel that the Sena and NCP have been on the same page when it comes to keeping Congress out of the decision-making process. NCP and Shiv Sena are likely to join hands in most of the local body elections by keeping Congress out. More than 15 municipal corporations (including Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane), 29 of 36 district councils and over 90 municipal councils are going to polls over the next 20 months. This one is considered to be a mini assembly election. BJP leader Ram Kadam said that the contradictory statements by Congress and NCP indicate the differences between the ruling parties. “It is proved that Congress is not happy with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and hence they have been talking about going solo. It needs to be understood whether Congress’ anger is over the differences or because of the other two parties grabbing the major share of power,” Kadam said. But Malik said that it would be wrong to conclude based on the statements that there are differences among the allies. Political analyst Pratap Asbe said the Congress’ central leadership decides on electoral alliances, so what the state leadership says has no bearing on it. “As far as the question of putting up an alliance of opposition parties against the BJP at the national level is concerned, it all depends on what stand the Congress will take,” Asbe said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-contest-upcoming-polls-alone-maha-cong-101623609458578.html
14-06-2021||India||As Sachin Pilot camps in Delhi, his loyalists continue attack on Gehlot||Demanding a cabinet expansion as well as other political appointments, the Sachin Pilot faction of Rajasthan legislators on Sunday continued to attack the Ashok Gehlot government even as Pilot camped in Delhi waiting for an audience with senior party leaders.Pilot, the former deputy chief minister of Rajasthan, was unable to meet Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Delhi. When contacted, Vadra’s office said there was no meeting slotted with Pilot as she is out of town. Pilot, too, said no meeting was scheduled with her.However, Pilot’s weekend trip to Delhi has triggered speculation about behind-the-scenes discussions on a planned Rajasthan cabinet reshuffle. A senior party leader said on condition of anonymity that a formula was being worked out for cabinet expansion to ensure fairness in the entire process. “We would like to have those who have had more than one term as MLA as ministers. Other options are also being discussed,” the leader said.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot can induct nine ministers to the cabinet that can have 30 members at the most. A second leader, again requesting anonymity, confirmed that talks are on, and matters will be resolved soon.But on Sunday, five-time member of the legislative assembly and former Rajasthan speaker Deepender Singh Shekhawat said the panel formed by All India Congress Committee to resolve the issues raised by Pilot 10 months ago has done nothing. “Those who helped the party form the government in Rajasthan aren’t being respected,” Shekhawat said.So far mum on the unfolding events, Shekhawat finally broke his silence and said a swift decision to ameliorate the pain of the agitating MLAs will be in the interest of the party.Shekhawat’s comments came a day after Congress MLA from Chaksu, Ved Prakash Solanki, a vocal supporter of Pilot, alleged that some MLAs told him about their phones being tapped. He, however, declined to name the MLAs. Party chief whip Mahesh Joshi dismissed Solanki’s charges as baseless.But BJP state president Satish Poonia attacked the Gehlot government and claimed that if phones were being illegally tapped in a democracy, then the chief minister and the home minister have to answer for it in the people’s court one day.This isn’t the first time that phone-tapping charges have been levelled against the Gehlot government. Last July, when Pilot and 18 other Congress MLAs loyal to him had rebelled against Gehlot, one of the accusations they had levelled against his government was of illegal phone tapping.The charge got legitimacy when an audio clip of an alleged phone conversation between a Union minister and two Congress MLAs was shared by Gehlot’s officer on special duty Lokesh Sharma.On the current crisis, another senior Congress leader familiar with the developments said the party’s national leadership will take up the Rajasthan issue in a day or two after resolving the crisis in Punjab where infighting has created problems for the Amarinder Singh government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-sachin-pilot-camps-in-delhi-his-loyalists-continue-attack-on-gehlot-101623609459193.html
14-06-2021||India||Govt lines up key bills for passage during next monsoon session||With more than 40 bills and five ordinances pending before Parliament, the Narendra Modi government’s legislative agenda is set to be busy for the monsoon session, which is set to commence in July after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic raged through the country, people aware of the matter said.A bill to designate major airports, proposed laws for the welfare of parents and senior citizens, strengthening the child protection system, and setting up of an interstate river water dispute redressal committee are some of the pending bills before Parliament.The government authorities plan to slot the monsoon session in July as Covid-19 cases are receding in various parts of the country. “We also want to find a suitable slot for the monsoon session, keeping in mind the possibilities of the next surge in Covid-19 cases,” a senior Parliament functionary said on condition of anonymity.The Union government promulgated five ordinances after the budget session had to be wrapped up earlier than scheduled due to the second wave of Covid-19. The Homoeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, The Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance and The Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance are currently in force.These ordinances will be taken up on priority as the Constitution gives a window of only six weeks from the beginning of a Parliament session for the move.The Covid-19 pandemic has affected Parliament sessions since March 2020 as it devastated myriad aspects of India’s public affairs and private lives. Last three sessions of Parliament had to be concluded midway while the entire 2020 winter session was cancelled due to the public health crisis.The passage of many bills got delayed while several discussions, primarily those sponsored by opposition parties, could not be taken up or got merged with other debates as the government managers and parliamentary authorities grappled to slot different agenda in the tight schedule.Some of the bills pending before standing committees could face delays as the panels virtually couldn’t function for almost two months in May and June due to the Covid-19 situation, the people quoted above said.Pending bills The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill: Under the Act, maintenance tribunals may direct children to pay up to ₹10,000 per month for their parents.The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill: The Bill seeks measures for strengthening the child protection set-up.The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill: It provides that every Assisted Reproductive Technology clinic and bank must be registered under the National Registry of Banks and Clinics of India.The National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research Bill: To declare six bodies located in Ahmedabad, Hajipur, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Guwahati, and Raebareli as Institutions of National Importance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-bills-await-passage-this-monsoon-session-101623609397314.html
14-06-2021||India||Govt to give away more food as granaries bulge||The Union government’s record buying of vast quantities of food grains from farmers at minimum support prices this year points to a glut of cereals, with stocks breaching previous limits, prompting the government to make additional plans to pare reserves.Even after distributing subsidised grains to nearly 730 million beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act and additional distribution of 5kg free grains per month per person under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), the government will be left with more than it requires to mandatorily keep aside as emergency reserves, known as buffer stock.Since the government pays higher prices every year to buy large quantities of cereals because of the annual increase in guaranteed rates known as minimum support prices (MSPs), Indian wheat can hardly be exported competitively. It is pricier compared to wheat from other exporting nations.In the current season, the government has procured over 41 million tonne of wheat, a record. It has so far paid an MSP value of ₹81,000 crore to cereal growers.In May, the government had a total stock of 83 million tonne of cereals (wheat and paddy), which is 11 times more than the mandatory grain reserve limit. This included nearly 30 million tonne of rice and 52 million tonne of wheat, according to official figures.Bulging stocks with the Food Corporation of India, the government’s main food-handling agency, has prompted the government to take extra measures to pare stocks.“The government has resorted to open-market sales. It is also taking steps such as distribution of food to NGOs for onward distribution to the needy, distribution to armed forces and prisons, etc,” an official said, asking not to be named. The government resorts to open-market sales usually at a price below the cost of buying these grains.The government is currently in the process of drawing up plans to make extra allocation to institutions such as NGOs and the armed forces, the official said. It has already sold 300,000 tonne of food grains in May to private traders.The PMGKAY will help clear out storage space for oncoming harvests, the official said. The scheme will continue till November.The government’s procurement of food grains stands nearly 13% higher than the previous year, caused by overproduction of grains even as the country faces a deficit of other essential commodities such as oilseeds and pulses.Of the 41 million tonne of wheat procured, 13.2 million tonne was bought from Punjab’s farmers, the highest, followed by 12.8 million tonne from Madhya Pradesh and 8.4 million tonne from Haryana farmers.“Higher prices mean Indian wheat must be sold at a minimum of $38 a tonne, which is higher than global prices,” said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.New MSPs announced on Wednesday for summer-sown crops are geared toward nudging farmers to shift away from plentiful cereals, by setting higher prices for oilseeds and pulses, whose output and supply are relatively scarce. For instance, India imports up to two-thirds of its vegetable oil to meet domestic demand.MSPs are federally fixed floor prices for crops aimed at avoiding distress sale by farmers and signalling a benchmark rate for private traders. But private traders can pay higher rates or, as is often the case, lower than MSP, depending on market forces of demand and supply.However, farmers are yet again likely to grow more cereals than oilseeds, a lopsided cropping pattern because the government mainly buys wheat and rice at MSP rates and distributes them to beneficiaries through the public distribution system at subsidised rates. This is primarily how farmers benefit from the MSP system.“This doesn’t really help India’s nutritional security. The PDS system means the poor has access to a lot of carbohydrates but not enough of other nutrients at affordable prices,” said Alokesh Khandekar of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).Experts say the real nudge to farmers to diversify away from plentiful cereals would be to guarantee procurement of oilseeds and pulses in sufficiently large quantities. “The higher MSPs for oilseeds and pulses signals farmers about the rate which they should get, not what they actually get from the markets,” said KS Mani, a former faculty with the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-give-away-more-food-as-granaries-bulge-101623609277278.html
14-06-2021||India||ICMR eyes trial to study efficacy of therapies used in Covid treatment||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is planning an adaptive clinical trial of mild Covid-19 patients to test the safety and efficacy of several therapies used in treatment, including antiviral drugs that have been allowed under restricted use.For the process, ICMR has floated an expression of intent for hospitals and institutions to participate in the initiative, on which it will be collaborating with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) to execute the project.“ICMR along with Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi) is proposing to conduct a multi-centre, adaptive platform trial in mild COVID-19 patients, titled ‘An open-label, multicentre, randomised, adaptive platform trial of the safety and efficacy of several therapies, including antiviral therapies, versus control in mild cases of COVID-19’,” says the document uploaded on ICMR’s website.In an adaptive clinical trial there is flexibility of making modifications in either dose, or regimen, etc prospectively based on the response as the process goes forward. It will be a phase 3 trial as therapies are already used to treat some other health conditions, and have been repurposed to treat Covid-19.According to the proposal document, the intervention arms to start with will be a combination of oral nitazoxanide (anti-parasitic) and inhaled ciclesonide (corticosteroid); and a fixed dose combination of artesunate and amodiaquine (anti-malarial), and Ivermectin (anti-parasitic).The control arm will be the standard of care arm, which is the basic care needed as opposed to the intervention arm that has new treatment options included for the disease or health condition.“An expression of intent from institutions, hospitals and other organisations interested with the facilities and capacity available to participate in the above-mentioned clinical trial, which will enrol participants from the community,” says the document.The primary objective of the trial is to compare the efficacy of alternative treatment strategies versus control on the risk of progression to moderate or severe respiratory disease.The secondary objectives are: to compare the safety of each study arm to control, up to day 21 of follow up; to compare the rate of hospitalisations due to Covid-19; to compare the time to hospitalisation due to Covid-19; to compare the rate of hospitalisations for other reason than Covid-19; to compare the disease-free rate in each study arm versus control; to compare the death rate; to compare time to worsening of oxygen saturation (SpO2 < 93); to compare the capacity to prevent severe progression between study arms; and to identify risk factors for severe progression.The study duration will be 22 days, and according to the proposal document, between 2,000 and 3,000 patients will be included… with approximately 700 participants meant to be enrolled per arm of intervention.“It’s just an expression of intent at the moment that’s put out for those who might be interested in participating in this adaptive trial that is being planned,” said an official familiar with the developments, on condition of anonymity.The deadline for receiving responses from those eager to participate is June 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-eyes-trial-to-study-efficacy-of-therapies-used-in-covid-treatment-101623609037244.html
14-06-2021||India||Low positivity rate during Mahakumbh casts doubt on data accuracy||A probe launched into private labs carrying out fake Covid-19 tests to meet targets during the Mahakumbh in Haridwar will also look into apparent data inconsistencies – the 10-week average test positivity rate beginning April in Haridwar was 4%, while the figure for the rest of Uttarakhand was 13.7% – with officials saying on Sunday that “a comprehensive investigation has been ordered”.The Haridwar district administration has ordered a probe into allegations that fake Covid-19 reports were issued by private labs engaged by the Uttarakhand government to conduct tests during the festival, which was attended by millions between April 1 and April 30.During the Mahakumbh festival period, overall active cases in the state jumped from 100,911 to 179,933. During the period, Haridwar reported an average positivity rate of 2.9%, while the corresponding number for the rest of the state (excluding Haridwar) 14.2%. The test positivity rate is the percentage of people who test positive for the disease among of all samples tested.Dr SK Gupta, director of the State Medical and Health Department, said all aspects will be investigated. “We are also surprised at the low test positivity rate in Haridwar and, therefore, a comprehensive investigation has been ordered.”When asked about the wide gap between the data for Hardiwar and the entire state, Subodh Uniyal, cabinet minister and spokesperson of the state government, said the government had nothing to hide. “On the contrary, we have initiated a probe into this to know the extent to which fake testing was done. The probe will make clear how much testing was fake and how much financial bungling private labs have committed. All things will be clear after the probe report is submitted. And we are committed to having transparency in all this.”Experts said the lopsided nature of data was a matter of concern, indicating irregularities in the tests conducted in the district.Dr DD Choudhary, the Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) state secretary, said it was surprising that the area that hosted the planet’s largest religious gathering reported a positivity rate that was lower than other parts of the state.Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Social Development for Communities Foundation (SDC), said: “We knew something was not right when it came to data that was coming from Haridwar compared to other districts. Now when allegations of fake tests have come to fore, the state government should not hesitate in accepting errors and after thorough probe, take action against the erring labs and make changes in the state-wide data to nullify the anomalous data.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/low-positivity-rate-during-mahakumbh-casts-doubt-on-data-accuracy-101623608978606.html
14-06-2021||India||Monsoon advances across country 14 days early: IMD||Monsoon has entered almost all parts of the country, except some areas of Uttar Pradesh, parts of Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat, within a span of 10 days and its progress is at least a fortnight in advance, according to scientists at the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).Monsoon is normally expected to cover all parts of the country, except a small part of Rajasthan, by July 5. It advanced to most parts of Madhya Pradesh, entire Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar, most parts of east Uttar Pradesh and some parts of west Uttar Pradesh, entire Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and some parts of north Haryana, Chandigarh and north Punjab on Sunday.It was in 2013 when the monsoon had last covered the entire country on June 13, as per dates analysed by O P Sreejith, head, climate monitoring and prediction group, IMD Pune.The northern limit of monsoon (NLM) is passing through Diu, Surat, Nandurbar, Bhopal, Nowgong, Hamirpur, Barabanki, Bareilly, Saharanpur, Ambala and Amritsar. The conditions are favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon into most parts of Madhya Pradesh, remaining parts of east Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and some more parts of west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab in the next 48 hours, the weather body has said.There has been 25% excess rain over the country since June 1. Of the 36 subdivisions, 12 recorded ‘large excess’ rain (60% above normal), 10 recorded ‘excess’ (20% to 59%) and nine recorded ‘normal’ (-19% to 19%).“In the last two to three days, pre-monsoon rain started occurring in parts of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. Parts of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh reported heavy rain. Some parts of Uttar Pradesh also reported 10 to 12 cm rain. There is no western disturbance affecting the northwestern region now. This is only because of strong monsoon winds blowing over the region. The easterly winds have picked up, so the IMD has declared monsoon onset over many parts of northwest India,” R K Jenamani, senior scientist, National Weather Forecasting Centre, said.“Monsoon has been very active this year right from its onset. The westerly and south-westerly winds are very strong over the Arabian Sea and now a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal is pulling the monsoon flow. Both branches on the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal side are supporting the advancement of monsoon over the country, except in dry regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat,” Jenamani explained.The new monsoon dates were issued by the weather body last year based on the onset data from 1961 to 2019, and withdrawal data from 1971 to 2019. Until 2019, the onset and withdrawal dates were determined based on records between 1901 and 1940. As per the old monsoon progress dates, the monsoon would cover the entire country only by July 15.Monsoon’s progress over the entire country has advanced in recent years, according to IMD scientists.“We had issued new monsoon onset and withdrawal dates last year because we noticed that monsoon dates had advanced in some regions and delayed in some regions in recent years due to many factors, including climate change. The thresholds have changed now. For example, the new onset dates are delayed by three to seven days in many parts of central, west and east India because we noticed this delay while the complete coverage of the monsoon in the country has been advanced,” M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, said.Rajeevan added: “This year is exceptional because the monsoon has covered parts of central India very early. Monsoon has covered the entire country by June end in the past but this year, its trajectory is exceptional. Monsoon dates have definitely changed in recent decades, it’s a very dynamic system. Its movement is strongly influenced by low pressure systems forming over the Bay of Bengal. I remember a very long time ago the first monsoon low would form over Bay of Bengal around June 15, but now it’s forming early as you can see.”“Last year too the monsoon had covered the entire country by around June 26, so it’s not rare. The movement of monsoon depends on how early a low-pressure system forms. Its active progress will sustain till the low-pressure system sustains and then the monsoon progress may weaken temporarily. In recent years, monsoon onset dates have advanced because of a change in its pattern,” D S Pai, scientist and head of climate research services at IMD Pune, said.A low pressure area is lying over northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining coastal areas of West Bengal and north Odisha. The low pressure area is likely to move west-northwestwards across Odisha, Jharkhand and north Chhattisgarh in the next two to three days. A trough (area of low pressure) is running from central Pakistan to the centre of low-pressure area over northwest Bay of Bengal and another trough (area of low pressure) is running from the cyclonic circulation associated with low pressure area to east central Arabian Sea. An offshore trough (area of low pressure) at mean sea level is also running from north Maharashtra coast to Lakshadweep area.Under the influence of above systems, widespread rainfall with isolated thunderstorm and lightning is likely over most parts of northwest, central, east, northeast and south Peninsular India and over parts of west India.Heavy to very heavy rainfall is very likely over parts of northwest India during the next three days, over parts of east, central and west India during the next three to four days, over parts of northeast India during the next five days and over parts of south Peninsular India during the next four to five days. Extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm) is also very likely over Konkan and Goa on June 14 and 15 and over coastal Karnataka and central Maharashtra on June 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-advances-across-country-14-days-earlyimd-101623608917274.html
14-06-2021||India||A year after his death, CBI yet to conclude its Sushant probe||A year after actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Bandra house in Mumbai, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is yet to conclude whether he died by suicide or there was foul play in his death.The premier investigation agency is currently studying a psychiatric evaluation carried out by experts of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) to assess Singh’s state of mind prior to death, people familiar with the development said.It is also examining the reports shared by CFSL on the electronic devices as well as dump data of the relevant cell tower locations to determine what happened on June 14 last year, when Singh was found dead, the officers quoted above said.Also Read | Sushant Singh Rajput dropped out of Ram-Leela, Half Girlfriend and more films. Here's whyTo be sure, the CBI investigation into Singh’s death began in the first week of August last year. Prior to that, Mumbai Police were investigating it and did not find any foul play. Subodh Jaiswal, the current CBI director, was heading Maharashtra police at that time.The 34-year-old actor was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai’s Bandra on June 14. Rajput’s father, KK Singh, lodged a complaint with the Patna police against Rhea Chakraborty, her parents and her brother, Showik, on June 25. The case was later transferred to CBI. Two other agencies — the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) — are also investigating different aspects pertaining to the case.A CBI official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the investigators don’t want to rush their findings even though the medical board of AIIMS concluded in September 2020, after studying the post-mortem exam and viscera reports, that the actor’s death was a case of suicide.Dr Sudhir Gupta, head of forensic science and toxicology, AIIMS, said: “We already submitted our findings to the CBI according to which the cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging. There was no injury on Sushant Singh’s body, no struggle marks, no disturbance of clothing. Also, nothing suspicious was found in his viscera.”Gupta further said the AIIMS medical board’s findings are consistent with the post-mortem exam report of Dr RN Cooper Municipal General Hospital in Vile Parle, Mumbai. “It’s a classic case of suicide and the whole panel was unanimous on this,” he added.Singh’s family members and lawyer Vikas Singh have, however, termed the AIIMS report faulty.A CBI officer with knowledge of the matter said the probe team sought clarifications from the AIIMS team on multiple occasions in the last 5-6 months. “It (the team) is studying the forensic, electronic and psychiatric analysis reports right now.”Vikas Singh said on Sunday: “I am only hoping that CBI is able to bring out a watertight case instead of doing a shoddy job, which doesn’t stand scrutiny of courts. It’s a little too long but maybe because CBI wants to look thoroughly into the whole thing that they are taking time.”He asked: “Why hasn’t CBI done custodial interrogation of persons staying with Sushant Singh at that time?”In a statement issued in December 2020, CBI said it was conducting the probe in a thorough and professional manner using the latest scientific techniques.“During the investigation, advanced mobile forensic equipment including the latest software has been used for extraction and analysis of relevant data available in the digital devices and also for analysis of dump data of the relevant cell tower locations related to the case,” CBI said.It visited cities including Aligarh, Faridabad, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Manesar, and Patna to collect evidence and record statements. Among those examined in the last 10 months include Singh’s friends, staff, his doctors, actress Rhea Chakraborty and her family members, several members of the film fraternity, etc.“The investigating team and senior officers have visited the place of incident on numerous occasions for better understanding of the circumstances related to the incident. The experts of CFSL, New Delhi, considered the best in their field in India, also visited and examined the place of the incident. The experts also carried out simulation exercises,” the agency said in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-year-on-cbi-yet-to-conclude-probe-into-sushant-s-death-101623608017071.html
14-06-2021||India||More curbs eased in Delhi; all shops, salons to open||Beginning Monday, Delhi will be step closer to a complete unlock as all shops will be allowed to operate through the week, restaurants will reopen for dine-in after nearly two months of closure and restricted functioning of weekly markets will be permitted, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Sunday, with the national capital emerging from of its worst wave of Covid-19 infections so far.Government officials later said salons and barber shops, too, can restart.The chief minister said the outbreak in Delhi is largely in control but the government will continue to observe the trends in the coming weeks. “If (daily) cases continue to keep going further down, all restrictions can be scaled down in a phased manner in the coming days. However, if cases go up, we may have to impose restrictions again. I urge everyone to strictly adhere to regulations and Covid-19-appropriate behaviour,” he said at a digital press briefing.Also Read | As Delhi unlocks, bruised restaurant industry hopes for reprieveSunday’s announcement is the third time that the Delhi government has withdrawn lockdown restrictions in subsequent weeks. “From Monday 5am, more or less all economic activities will be allowed except a few,” Kejriwal added.All shops in markets, market complexes and malls can reopen from 10am to 8pm from Monday, instead of operating in an odd-even basis, the CM said. In the past week, half the shops in markets and malls were allowed to open on alternate days of the week.Now, all shops in the city — essential and non-essential — can open with no restrictions. This also includes salons and barber shops, at least two government officials said. Spas, however, will remain shut for now.Kejriwal said weekly markets — which were barred during the lockdown — can reopen but only one weekly market per municipal zone can operate in a day with up to half of the normal count of vendors at a time. Delhi has a total of 12 municipal zones.“No weekly market will be allowed to function on roadsides. The weekly markets can function at suitable nearby grounds/school grounds, where SOP/guidelines of DDMA are strictly implemented,” an order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority said. It also said random testing of Covid-19 will be carried out by district authorities outside these markets.Restaurants can open their doors for dine-in patrons, but only with 50% seating capacity to ensure social distancing on a “trial basis” until June 21, the order released after Kejriwal’s address said.Consumption of alcohol, tobacco, pan and gutka is prohibited in restaurants, malls and markets, the DDMA order said. A third senior DDMA official later clarified that restaurants cannot serve alcoholic drinks and bars will remain closed for now.“A very close watch and supervision will be maintained on the overall functioning of markets, market complexes, malls and restaurants,” DDMA said, warning that if cases of the disease start increasing in the city, these places will be “closed forthwith without any loss of time”.Places of worship, too, can open but devotees will not be permitted inside, the DDMA statement said.Some of the previous restrictions and relaxations will remain as they are.This means private offices can function with up to 50% staff in attendance, public buses and Delhi Metro services will run as usual at 50% seating capacity, and cabs and autorickshaws can carry two passengers per vehicle. The cap of 20 guests for weddings, which can only be held at courts or inside personal residence, will remain. Funerals can be held with up to 20 people in attendance.All educational institutes will remain shut; so will swimming pools, gymnasiums, cinema halls, banquet halls, entertainment parks, public parks and banquet halls, the order said. All gatherings — social, political, religious and academic — are still barred.Delhi went into a strict lockdown on April 19 as a mounting caseload of Covid-19 cases weighed down the health infrastructure in the city, which was firmly in the grip of its fourth wave of infections. The runaway outbreak — which was the worst the city has seen in over a year of the pandemic — forced people to scramble from hospital to hospital for medical oxygen and life-saving drugs, while bodies piled on in crematoriums across the Capital.The situation eased in early May as the central and Delhi governments scaled up health facilities and the spread of the virus slowed down, likely as an impact of the lockdown and the adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour.The seven-day average of daily infections, which indicates a region’s Covid-19 curve, has fallen to 271 a day for the week ending Sunday – a drop of 99% from the April 23 peak of 25,294 average number of cases a day, the highest ever recorded in the city. On Sunday, Delhi added 255 new cases and 23 more deaths.The Delhi government, which earlier this month allowed factories and construction activities to restart, is now focusing on economic revival along with preparing in advance for a potential fifth wave of infections in the city. The Aam Aadmi Party-led government earlier said it is preparing for a peak of around 37,000 infections per day in the next outbreak by increasing the number of hospital beds, creating robust medical oxygen infrastructure and storing stocks of essential medicines.Experts say it is crucial that restrictions are withdrawn in a phased manner, crowding in public places is banned, and mask compliance is enforced strictly.“The government should be very meticulous about the phased relaxations. Hundred percent mask compliance should be mandatory, not just on paper, but it should be enforced efficiently as more public spaces open up. For markets and offices, the government should draft a policy of staggered timings to ensure that the crowd is under control. The government should keep a close watch on Covid-19 trends and take its time in lifting restrictions from closed spaces such as gyms, cinema halls, etc. Also, gatherings of any kind should not be allowed at this stage,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the clinical virology department at Christian Medical College in Vellore.Restaurant owners welcomed Sunday’s announcement, but urged the government to allow bars to open as well. Manpreet Singh, a Delhi-based restaurateur and treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI), said: “It is a welcome decision. The industry could not recover from the shock of the first lockdown by the time the second lockdown happened. The industry is in distress. We hope that in the coming days, we will witness economic recovery. We will ensure that all regulations and Covid-19 protocols are followed. But the government should also allow bars to open. Prohibiting bars, especially when liquor stores are open and dine-in is allowed, makes no sense.”The reaction from organisers of weekly markets echoed similar views. “Allowing weekly markets to finally operate is a welcome move. The government should have allowed them earlier with strict protocols. But better late than never. Weekly market vendors are in extreme distress. Many of them are migrants and they have been struggling for food and ration,” said Arbind Singh, coordinator of the National Association of Street Vendors of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-curbs-eased-all-shops-salons-to-open-101623607957018.html
14-06-2021||India||15 mths after peace pact, NIA begins probe against new rebel Bodo group||Fifteen months after 1,615 cadres of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) signed a peace pact with the Centre and laid down weapons, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has initiated a probe into the formation of a new outfit formed by some of the surrendered ultras, people familiar with the developments said.The new rebel group — National Liberation Front of Bodoland (NLFB) — is headed by MD Batha, who was among 1,615 Bodo insurgents to surrender on January 30, 2020. It is said to be operating from the jungle area of Soraibil-Jamduar in the region, the people quoted above said.Agencies came to know about the outfit in February first week this year, when during a naka (checkpost) checking at Nasraibil Bridge under Soraibil, Assam police officers stopped two vehicles (one Scorpio and one Innova).A huge cache of arms and ammunition, including five AK-56 rifles, eight magazines of AK-56, under barrel grenade launchers, Chinese hand grenades, mobile sets, etc., were recovered and six suspects – Sanmanjay Basumatary alias Bogla, Rabinath Narzary alias Ganda, Pungka Basumatary, Mwktang Basumatary, Manipual Mushahary and Swmkwr Basumatary — were arrested.Initial investigation has revealed that the arms, ammunition and explosives were being taken to the jungle for NLFB so that it can launch violent terror acts in the region. The ministry of home affairs, considering international ramifications of the matter, decided to hand over the probe to NIA recently, the people said.Raising demand for a separate Bodoland state, NLFB announced its formation in March, just ahead of assembly elections in Assam, through a press statement in which it also accused the Centre and the Assam government of not taking interest in resolving the Bodo issue.“We are still not free from the political suppression and oppression. The land, where we breathe is our land and the land which produces resources for us is our land. We want to live in this land free from the threat of our culture, tradition, language and political rights. Today, the unwilling motive of India government and the Assam government to solve the issue has compelled us to take a new decision to struggle and fight for our rights. So, today we have formed a new arms revolutionary group with a nomenclature and style National Liberation Front of Bodoland (NLFB). We swear to fight for our rights till the last drop of our blood in our vein until our demand is fulfilled,” the outfit said in March.Investigators handling the case said they believe that currently, there are 30-40 cadres in NLFB inside the jungle and some overground workers but they have access to arms and ammunition so they can be dangerous.The government signed a memorandum of settlement with NDFB and two other factions on January 27, 2020 to end the 50-year-old Bodo crisis after which 1,615 cadres surrendered with some 4,800 weapons on January 30, 2020. The outfits had disbanded themselves on March 9-10, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-mths-after-peace-pact-nia-begins-probe-against-new-rebel-bodo-group-101623605438064.html
