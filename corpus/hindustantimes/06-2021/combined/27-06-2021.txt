27-06-2021||Lucknow||Pride month: Taking big leap with short film route||The LGBTQI community members in Lucknow have taken the short film route to bring their ‘coming out’ and struggle stories into the public domain. Around 20 films have been made in this series, and another one on Kajal Kiran, a transgender gram pradhan from Bidhnu block, Kanpur Dehat, is in post-production.Four of them — Abeer dealing with self-acceptance, Jatin on family acceptance, Tanzeel on homosexuality and All About Prep on health issues — have been earlier screened at 22nd International AIDS conferences at Amsterdam and won prizes. Besides, I Am What I Am and The Mirror won prizes at the Blued Queered Flick Festival, New Delhi.“Such short films do leave a mark. They opened much-needed dialogues between community, family and society. They sensitively deal with queer issues,” says Sumit Srivastava, an executive director.Tanzeel Ahmed tells us about his film. “It shows how I reconcile my faith into my religion. For me, it was a step ahead to accepting myself with my orientation with more confidence. Also, I was surprised to see my old friends sending me ‘proud of you’ messages. I come from Gorakhpur, so it brought a ray of hope for the people in small towns as well,” he says and adds that now he wants to open a TG Clinic in Lucknow.LGBT activist Yadavendra Singh Darvesh, who directed most of these shorts, says, “After watching them, one guy came out to his family, and I provided counselling to his parents and also screened Jatin’s film for the entire family. The second case was from Bangalore, where a mother of a lesbian girl got in touch with me post-screening of these movies in her city. She wanted to know issues so that she can understand her daughter well.”Ritwik Das, the writer of Kajal Kiran’s short film and member of Awadh Queer Pride Committee, tells that his inspiration was also a show. “I came out of the closet after watching the Satyamev Jayate episode. Listening to Simran ma’am (Sheikh, transwoman) and documentaries shot on Laxmi (Narayan Tripathi, activist) ma’am also inspired me,” he says.A graphic designer by profession and cinematographer for this film Megha Nandi feels that visual medium is the best way to bring a change and impact the mindsets of the people towards understanding the sensitive issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/pride-month-taking-big-leap-with-short-film-route-101624818309055.html

27-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh hospitals gear up for third wave||Amid the possibilities of a third wave of Covid-19, the health authorities have started ramping up medical facilities and infrastructure in the government hospitals to control the case fatality rate (CFR) in Chandigarh.Though the third wave is not expected until next two months, experts feel that ramping up health facilities in hospitals is necessary as the second wave was more severe than the first.Besides adding ICU beds and ventilators in government hospitals, the authorities are focusing on procuring essential drugs and equipment in advance. “Since the supply of Covid-19 essential drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were erratic during the second wave peak, we have decided to procure all essential drugs in advance. We are also buying oxygen concentrators to avoid shortage during the peak,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director health services, Chandigarh. ‘Could infect more children’“As per health experts, the third wave could infect more children. So we have decided to make the Sector-45 civil hospital as a 42-bed paediatric Covid centre. Of the total beds, 12 will be made available for ICU while 30 will be oxygenated. Essential machines like BiPAP and X-ray machines will also be provided. The department is also hiring paediatricians and support staff to run the centre,” she said.Dr Jasbinder Kaur, director-principal, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, said, “Since some of the ventilators are faulty, we are focusing on repairing them and we will be getting more to handle the Covid-19 spike again. Besides, we are adding 30 more ICU beds in the hospital, which will take the total to 100.”Meanwhile, the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) is ready to face the Covid-19 surge in case of an emergency. “We have sufficient ICU beds and orders have been placed for buying 20 more ventilators, which will take Covid-reserved ventilators’ count to 100,” said professor Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER.Special focus on oxygen plantsLearning from the second wave, the health authorities have now kept their focus on increasing the availability of medical oxygen in city hospitals. “Proposal has been sent to the central government to set up three oxygen generation plants in three UT hospitals, including the civil hospitals in Sector 22, Sector 45 and Manimajra. Two of the three hospitals will soon get approval and at least 200 litres of oxygen per minute will be generated at each plant,” Dr Kang added.Besides, three oxygen plants are being set up at PGIMER, with a capacity of 1,000 litres of oxygen per minute each. Professor Jagat Ram said, “The plants will start functioning in July.”‘Get jabbed to avoid third wave’Health experts said that if people do not adhere to Covid safety protocols and will not wear face masks, especially in public places, a third wave may hit Chandigarh soon. “Looking at the trend and people’s complacency, a third wave may arrive from August to September,” said Dr Kang, while urging people to get vaccinated at the earliest.The department has set the target to administer at least the first dose to all eligible 7.12 lakh citizens by the end of July. Door-to-door vaccination drive is also planned for the senior citizens in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-hospitals-gear-up-for-third-wave-101624818068987.html
27-06-2021||Chandigarh||Hot and humid weather to continue in Chandigarh||With monsoon on a “break”, weather is likely to stay hot and humid for another week in Chandigarh. Weather scientists have said monsoon is unlikely to progress towards Delhi and neighbouring states of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan for at least a week as it was entering a “break spell” from June 29 apart from unfavourable conditions that were not likely to spur it further on its path.This spell, officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, will likely get heavy rainfall confined to northeast India and subdued showers in the remaining parts of the country till at least July 5.Amid this dry spell, maximum temperature in Chandigarh went up from Saturday’s 35°C to 37°C on Sunday, and is likely to rise further to 38-39°C in the next three days. Even minimum temperature rose from 22.1°C to 25°C, and is likely to remain around 27-28°C in the coming days.Even as monsoon arrived in Chandigarh on June 13, there has been only one spell of rain since then, with 15.4mm recorded on June 16. However, localised conditions created by high temperatures had led to 4mm rain accompanied by high-speed winds in wee hours of Saturday. According to the weatherman, such localised drizzles and winds may occur again, but the intensity will be weaker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hot-and-humid-weather-to-continue-in-chandigarh-101624817951222.html
27-06-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala railway division sends parcel train to Bangladesh||The Ambala Railway Division, for the first time in its history, sent a special parcel train beyond India’s border to Benapole in Bangladesh with cotton yarn on Sunday.This earned the division ₹25.69 lakh for carrying 468 tonnes of freight in collaboration with mgX.com, a subsidiary of MGH Group, a Singapore-based shipping conglomerate, officials said.This train, consisting of 20 parcel vans, was flagged off by Vivek Sharma, senior divisional commercial manager, Himanshu Pant, director and CEO of MGH India, and other railway officials.Sharma said that businessmen in and around Punjab and Haryana have been transporting commodities by road to Bangladesh in small quantities, which is costly for them.“During the lockdown, they could not move goods by road. Then, railway staff and officials approached them and explained the transportation facilities by rail. To move the consignment by goods trains, it is mandatory for farmers and businessmen to mobilise the quantity in bulk,” he said. Officials in a statement said that each van was loaded with 430 cartons , weighing around 23 tonnes and the total weight carried by the special parcel express is around 468 Tonnes.“MGH will be providing end-to-end transportation solution to its customers for exporting yarn, fabrics and FMCG goods from their respective factories across Ludhiana and Baddi to their buyers’ factories in Bangladesh, including the customs clearance on both the sides of the border,” a statement reads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-railway-division-sends-parcel-train-to-bangladesh-101624817948923.html
27-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh bike sharing project delayed once again||The launch of the first phase of the public bicycle sharing project has been delayed once again. It was initially scheduled to start in April this year, but after the firm managing the project failed to comply with the deadline, the Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) gave it a two-month extension. Now, it has again sought more time, citing logistic problems caused by Covid lockdown restrictions.“The firm was facing logistics problems due to lockdown restrictions, which delayed the work. Now, we don’t expect it to be completed before July-end,” a senior CSCL official said.“A major section of the project under the first phase is ready. But, there were some issues with availability and transportation of bicycle parts and other infrastructure. The firm’s consignment of parts was stuck between the manufacturing centre and assembling plant,” the official added. Chief executive officer of the CSCL has even written a demi-official letter to the authorities of a southern state, requesting that the transportation of requisite parts from one state to another is allowed. Using public bikes free, for nowIn the meantime, residents can avail public bicycles free of charge, which were made available under the cycle4change challenge. The challenge ended on May 31, and thereafter, the CSCL had directed the firm to stop charging people. Earlier, ₹10 for an hour and ₹5 for half an hour was being charged.Currently, 225 bicycles, including more than 100 pedal-assisted e-bikes, are available from 25 docking stations spread across the city. The stations include prominent locations such as Rock Garden, high court, Sukhna Lake, PGIMER and Sectors 17, 22, 34, 35 and 43.617 docking stations to be establishedUnder the CSCL’s project, 5,000 bicycles will be provided in the city along with a network of 617 docking stations, giving last mile connectivity to users. The size of the project will make it India’s largest and densest public bike sharing network. The original deadline for the entire project was March 2022. But now, with the first phase delayed by atleast three months, the overall timeline is also likely to be delayed. The project is being developed in four phases of 1,250 cycles and 155 docking stations each where pedal-assisted e-bikes with charging facility will be made available.All bicycles will be GPS-enabled and be monitored from a command-and-control centre with 24X7 helpline facility. The PBSS project is being implemented and operated by the concessionaire M/s Smart Bike Tech Private Limited, Hyderabad, for a period of 10 years on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-bike-sharing-project-delayed-once-again-101624817890917.html
27-06-2021||Lucknow||MANN KI BAAT: PM praises UP’s Tokyo-bound athletes||Athletes from Uttar Pradesh (UP) to be part of contingent for Tokyo Olympics, especially race walker Priyanka Goswami and ace javelin thrower Shivpal Singh, found mention from Prime Minister Narendra Modi who in his Sunday’s radio show ‘Mann ki Baat’ praised their grit and determination and urged the country to boost their confidence.The Tokyo Olympics will be held from July 23 to August 8.While referring to athletes set to be part of the Indian contingent to the Olympic event, the PM picked life stories of Goswami and Singh for special mention, lauding their determination and perseverance.Goswami, who would be competing in the 20km race walk event, comes from a humble background. Her father works as a bus conductor. She qualified for the Olympics during the national championship this February at Ranchi where she also broke the national record.“As a child, Priyanka adored the bag that the medal winners were presented with. It was this fascination that made her participate in the race-walking competition for the first time. Now, she is a big champion,” Modi said in his talk show. Highlighting the consistent efforts of Singh, who hails from Varanasi, the PM said Shivpal’s entire family has been associated with this game. His father, uncle and brother are all proficient in javelin throw.“His commitment and an emotional attachment for the sport, as it is a part of his family tradition, made him qualify for the mega event,” the PM added. Urging people to encourage the athletes, the PM also said that all the athletes have endured “years of toil” and the country should back them without putting them under pressure for the Tokyo Olympics. PM also mentioned Praveen Jadhav, and archer Dipika Kumari. Deepika’s father is an auto rickshaw driver. “We wish all our champions well.”“Chirag Shetty and Sattwik have qualified. Shuttler Sattwik suffered from COVID, and Chirag lost his grandfather to the pandemic, but they have persevered,” he said.He also mentioned about the humble beginnings of defender Bhavani from Tamil Nadu. “When we speak of Olympics, who can forget the legendary Milkha Singh,” the PM said remembering the legendary athlete who succumbed to COVID-19 recently. “We lost him a few days ago. But I had the fortune of speaking to him before he passed away, when I told him that he had led the Indian contingent in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and he should encourage the current Indian contingent, he agreed. Unfortunately, we lost him before that, the PM said.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that the state drew inspiration from the PM’s encouragement and support to the sports fraternity and adopted a similar approach to promote and foster the sports culture by supporting the talented sportspersons in the state. “The talented players of our state were deprived of adequate resources since long. However, our government is leaving no stone unturned to provide all necessary assets to the sportspersons in order to help them shine nationally and internationally,” the CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mann-ki-baat-pm-praises-up-s-tokyo-bound-athletes-101624817828081.html
27-06-2021||Mumbai||Covid in Maharashtra: Stricter curbs from Monday||With Maharashtra now adopting level three as the base limit in terms of Covid-19 restrictions, many districts that had started relaxing lockdown restrictions would now roll them back and impose further curbs from Monday, amid reports of the more transmissible Delta Plus variant across the state. The state fears the strain could become more severe in case of a third wave. The Maharashtra government had on Friday decided to reduce the five-level relaxation plan (based on positivity rate and bed occupancy) to three. The first two levels, which had maximum relaxations, were removed till further order.Mumbai would continue to follow the same ongoing restrictions (level three), despite its low positivity and bed occupancy rate, so as to avoid any spurt in Covid-19 cases. The state on Sunday reported 9,974 Covid-19 cases, including 739 in Mumbai, taking the tally to 6,036,821, while the toll stands at 121,286.State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate described the rolling back of relaxations a preventive step. “We are at the descending stage of the second wave and hence do not want to take any chances. Both the Central government and the World Health Organisation (WHO) have advised us to take preventive steps in view of the mutation and we are adhering to them,” he added. This means that in places like Thane, Navi Mumbai and Pune where malls had opened will be shut and shops being allowed to function under regular timings will have to adhere to the 4pm limit.The Chamber of Association of Maharashtra Industries and Trade (CAMIT), which represents the manufacturing and retail traders, has slammed the step. “Our business has fallen by over 60% and we are not able to sustain in such a restrictive environment. There is no logic in not opening malls and imposing restrictive timings on shopkeepers as we take all necessary precautions to contain the spread of the virus,” said Mitesh Mody, secretary, CAMIT.Mumbai on Sunday recorded 13 deaths, with its toll reaching 15,396. There were 210,866 tests done on Sunday, while the number of recoveries clocked 8,562. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 122,252.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, said the mutant variant is more lethal than the original one. “This Delta Plus variant is worse and can cause more devastation as it means more virulency as well as hospitalisation of patients,” said Dr Shaikh. “Citizens need to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and even the government needs to strictly enforce punitive actions if it wants to rein in this virus,” said Shaikh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-in-maharashtra-stricter-curbs-from-monday-101624817587961.html
27-06-2021||Other||BMC needs to look at more sustainable, timely ways to deal with waterlogging: Mumbaiites||Mumbaiites affected by waterlogged streets every monsoon have one message for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) – while measures are being taken across the city to ease waterlogging woes, not enough is being done in a timely manner. The Opposition has also slammed the civic administration for shoddy pre-monsoon work and the civic body’s failure to learn lessons from the previous waterlogging incidents. On June 23, HT conducted its annual monsoon audit with the help of three experts. HT visited seven spots — three nullahs in the western suburbs and two in the eastern suburbs as well two chronic waterlogging spots in the Island city. The panel of experts comprised senior urban planner and architect Rohit Shinkre, retired deputy engineer of BMC’s stormwater drains department Dilip Kamlakar Pathak and BMC’s retired assistant engineer Udaykumar Shiroorkar.In a two-part series on Friday and Saturday, HT reported the panel’s verdict after the audit. The three experts on HT’s panel concluded that Mumbai is yet again not ready to handle the monsoon. BMC has claimed that it has completed 104% of nullah desilting work across the city. While BMC’s effort to stay ahead of its pre-monsoon work cannot be denied, not enough has been done on ground to prepare the city for the rains.Reacting to HT’s audit report of Mumbai’s monsoon preparedness, Ravi Raja, leader of Opposition in BMC, said, “Like every year, this year too, no cleaning or desilting work have been completed. The BMC claimed to have completed over 100% of desilting work, but on ground only 30-35% of the work is done. We have been demanding for a video-recording of the desilting work, but it has not been done and every year, the taxpayers’ money is being wasted.”In tune with the suggestions presented by experts who were part of HT’s panel for the audit, citizens who have borne the brunt of waterlogging or partnered with BMC in the past to bring solutions to the problem in their areas believe that the civic corporation needs to look at more sustainable ways to deal with the issue, apart from carrying out the routine work of desilting nullahs properly. After the audit, Shinkre said, “I feel that BMC is trying hard to do what it can to make the city monsoon-ready. Much of what can be done in this regard is fairly cosmetic in nature. We need some very deep strategic changes to manage our city and try and address the problems to make the city monsoon-ready.” According to Debi Goenka, executive trustee of non-profit organisation Conservation Action Trust (CAT) the city’s stormwater drains are supposed to cater to monsoon water, but over the years they have doubled up as sewage lines, and dumping grounds. “BMC has been trying to convert natural creeks to canals, with concrete beds and sides, so as to maintain the storm water drains. However, due to this, the water has nowhere to go. With loss of mangroves, sea water is coming more towards the inland areas, aggravating the waterlogging situation during monsoon,” Goenka added. HT’s panel of experts graded the ongoing work for construction of underground water-holding tanks at the chronic flooding spots of Gandhi Market and Hindmata with an average of 0.5 and 1.3 marks out of the total 5, citing the work as expensive in comparison to its utility. Citizens have given HT mixed responses over the work that is being done. Civic activist and Matunga resident Nikhil Desai said, “The type of investment being done by installing huge pumps to drain out water from Gandhi Market area will solve the problem [of waterlogging] and such solutions are welcome. But the implementation has to be quick and smooth.”However, Goenka said, “How many times does Mumbai flood in the monsoon? Five-six times? We would like to see the calculations on the capacity of the underground water-holding tanks being build to mitigate waterlogging at Hindmata and Gandhi Market. For example, have we calculated how much water gets logged in these areas in comparison to the capacity of these underground water-holding tanks?” Other political leaders have slammed BMC for inaction. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator Prabhakar Shinde said, “We have been saying no work has been done. When BJP inspected Somaiya [Everard], Gazdar Bandh and P&T nullahs, we saw that desilting has not been done. Even though the administration claims that 100% of the pre-monsoon work has been completed, in reality, there is no proper work done by the contractor, and hence, waterlogging takes place. There is no supervision over the contractor’s work, and thus it gets ignored. As a result, citizens suffer every year.” Desai said that if the problem of waterlogging in the city needs to be resolved, quick planning and constructions are necessary. “After the 2005 deluge, BMC was to augment the drainage system to 50mm, but that has not happened even till today. Hence, by the time we augment our drains to handling 50mm rainfall on an hourly basis, the need will increase. This will later be a cycle where we will be spending money but won’t get the desired results, “said Desai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bmcneeds-to-look-at-more-sustainable-timely-ways-to-deal-with-waterlogging-mumbaiites-101624817407902.html
27-06-2021||Chandigarh||NHAI’s ₹700-crore project to decongest Mohali’s Airport Road||The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is set to begin work on ₹700-crore greenfield alignment to decongest the Airport Road in Mohali by providing an alternative route to traffic moving from Delhi side to Himachal Pradesh, J&K and parts of Punjab. A greenfield road is built in an area that has never been developed or built up. The 32-kilometre road from IT City Chowk near the Chandigarh International Airport to the Kurali-Chandigarh road will be 60-foot wide and cross Nagiari and Devi Nagar villages among others. It will also help further decongest roads in Chandigarh and Zirakpur.The NHAI has already acquired around 400 acres of land in 28 villages, and compensation ranging from ₹55 lakh to ₹4.12 crore per acre has been announced depending upon whether the land is outside or within the municipal limits.Work to begin in a monthAccording to an NHAI official, who did not wish to be named, Ashoka Buildcon Limited has been finalised to begin work on the project within a month.Mohali district revenue officer (DRO) Gurjinder Singh Benipal said: “Land acquisition process has been completed and we have received ₹100 crore to be given to the landowners of around 10 villages. We will soon disburse the amount.”In February 2020, Lok Sabha member Manish Tewari had taken up the matter of an alternative route with Union minister Nitin Gadkari, following which the ministry in its letter had stated that the NHAI was checking the feasibility of a greenfield section. After scrapping the project to widen the 40-km Kharar-Banur-Tepla road in July 2019, the NHAI has come up with this project. The previous project was scrapped owing to its high cost. The NHAI will also widen the 40-km stretch from IT City Chowk to Ambala, via Banur and Tepla, to six lanes.GMADA to widen Airport RoadIn view of heavy traffic and frequent road mishaps, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) is all set to widen a 6-km stretch of the Airport Road starting from Chhat village leading up to Sector 82.At present the stretch has two 33-foot-wide carriageways, which will be widened to 44-foot each. A senior GMDA official said the proposal had been prepared, “but we are waiting for approval from the authorities concerned”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nhais-700-crore-project-to-decongest-mohali-s-airport-road-101624816809478.html
27-06-2021||Noida||No entry without jabs: Noida high-rises, societies to restrict domestic helps||NOIDA: Many high-rises and residential societies in the city have decided to restrict, from July 1, the entry of domestic helps who have not taken at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. While various residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) and apartment owners’ associations (AOAs) claimed that they have taken this step to check the Covid-19 spread, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration said that instead of issuing such diktat, the residential bodies need to help such workers get vaccinated.Yogendra Sharma, president of the Federation of Noida RWAs (FONRWA), said that around 25 RWAs and AOAs have decided to not allow domestic helps – who do not have their inoculation certificates – on their premises from July 1. “It’s a welcome move by these associations. Some societies had recently organised vaccination camps for the helps. As the government is providing free vaccination to everyone over 18 years, what is wrong in asking them to have their shots? We can’t deliberately leave our residents exposed to the virus,” he said. Sharma said that most of the RWAs and AOAs in sectors 27, 30, 34, 35, 39, 41, 45, 50, 52, 55, 56, 72, 82, 100 and 104 have made compulsory to have inoculation certificates for the entry of domestic helps and other workers from July 1. Echoing similar views, Rajiv Garg, president of Sector 27 RWA, said that from July 1, the workers will have to produce their vaccination certificates before entering the society premises. However, GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that in a recent meeting held with different RWAs and AOAs, they were asked to be proactive in ensuring 100% vaccination of the eligible population in their respective societies and adjacent areas. “We’ve not issued any order to restrict the entries of domestic helps, plumbers, electricians and other mechanics in any society. And, the societies should enable these workers to get the vaccine doses, instead of issuing such orders for them. What the associations should do is that they must help the domestic helps or other workers in getting the slots. If the RWAs or AOAs approach us with the list of such workers, we can also arrange exclusive camps for them in the respective areas,” the DM said. Meanwhile, the domestic helps said that they are facing difficulties in having the shots. Naina Das, a domestic help who works in Sector 27, said that despite standing for hours in the queue at the district hospital on Saturday, she couldn’t get the vaccine dose. “It was a chaos there. I and my three friends – also the domestic helps – failed to get our turn. We’ll try our luck at some other booth on Monday,” she said. Usha Sinha, another help in Sector 104, said that she lost her Aadhaar card while standing in the queue at the vaccination camp in the district hospital. “When my turn came, the vaccination staff asked me to show my Aadhaar card. When I opened my bag, it was not there. Now, I’ll have to get another copy of my Aadhaar card to receive the vaccine dose,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/no-entry-without-jabs-noida-high-rises-societies-to-restrict-domestic-helps-101624816387802.html
27-06-2021||Other||Nappy change can indicate a congenital disease||LUCKNOW: If one of the legs of your new-born isn’t spreading as much as the other from the central point while you change the nappy, it may be a congenital problem called developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). “There are several symptoms for DDH but three can be kept in mind by parents. One is movement of leg, second is equal length of both legs and third a family history of DDH,” said prof Ajai Singh, HoD, paediatric orthopaedic at the King George’s Medical University. A webinar ‘Early diagnosis of hip dysplasia: screening and referral guidelines’ was organised by the department of paediatric orthopaedic to mark the hip dysplasia awareness month. KGMU experts discussed screening and referral guidelines for hip dysplasia with paediatricians in the webinar, and also guided them on how to identify it at the very first visit of the child. About 9 or 10 children are born with hip dysplasia among 1000 live births. “The first point a doctor can identify is when parents bring them for vaccination at clinic after 3 or 4 weeks or birth. The aim of this webinar was to make paediatricians aware about hip dysplasia and their responsibility to identify the same,” said Prof Singh. Dr Suresh Chand, assistant professor paediatric orthopaedic KGMU and Dr Shalini Tripathi, additional professor, paediatric orthopaedic, also spoke in the webinar. “If the problem is diagnosed within a few weeks, it can be treated with the help of a strap in a few weeks’ time. If ignored or diagnosed late, a surgery may be required,” said Prof Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nappy-change-can-indicate-a-congenital-disease-101624816328527.html

Police said the three were living in a rented accommodation at a highrise in Sector 75. They were nabbed from Sector 18 following a tip-off from an informant.According to police officials, Ruslen had come to India on May 10, 2019 on a tourist visa and was sent to Tihar jail within a couple of weeks allegedly in connection with a cyber crime. He allegedly met Ravi in jail who was lodged there in connection with a murder case. Ruslen was released on February 1, 2021 after which he had started living in Noida.“He holds a diploma in electronics and is well-versed with cloning technology. He himself prepared the circuits and skimmers, parts for which were ordered from a spy goods website,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.Police said the group allegedly would install the skimmer devices and mini cameras at unmanned ATM kiosks across the National Capital Region. They would collect the data of users, clone their ATM cards and then withdraw money from their bank accounts.“There are more people associated with the operation, including other foreign nationals, and we are working to trace them. The total amount skimmed by the suspects is being verified through bank account details, though it is suspected to be in lakhs,” said a senior police official, on condition of anonymity.Police recovered 28 cloned cards along with laptops, phones, seven skimmer boards, a camera, card readers, a hard drive, several pen drives, multiple tools and other electronic gadgets. The suspects were produced before a magistrate and later sent to jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/foreign-national-among-three-held-for-cloning-atm-cards-in-noida-101624816327859.html
27-06-2021||Noida||Field survey at Dhanauri wetland soon to declare it Ramsar site, says forest dept||Noida: The Gautam Budh Nagar forest department has decided to seek help from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and World Wide Fund for Nature-India (WWF India) to expedite the process for conservation of the Dhanauri wetland and declaring it as a sanctuary — a task pending for several years.Forest officials said that a team of experts from the WWF will conduct a field survey at the wetland soon, so that the Dhanauri wetland can be declared a Ramsar site — a wetland of international importance. Meanwhile, forest officials have written to senior officials for them to seek help from WII to declare Dhanauri as a bird sanctuary.“We are taking help from the WWF India to declare Dhanauri wetland as a Ramsar site or a wetland of international importance. A team of experts from WWF will be visiting Dhanauri wetland in the first week of July to conduct the ground work and expedite the long-pending task,” divisional forest officer, PK Srivastava.Stating that “officially notifying Dhanauri as wetland and declaring it a Ramsar site and a bird sanctuary are the three major tasks pending”, Srivastava added that the district forest department has escalated the request to the higher authorities in the department to approach the premier institute WII.“We have written a letter to the forest conservator, Meerut, urging them to approach the WII, Dehradun, with a proposal for the conservation of Dhanauri wetland. The WII is yet to be approached, though, once roped in, it will help with the official notification of Dhanauri and thereby, a conservation plan,” he said.On being asked the reason for the delay, as it was in 2018 that the divisional forest department first sent a proposal to declare the waterbody as a wetland under Wetland Rules 2017 and later in 2019 to declare it a Ramsar site, officials said that “such work often takes time”.“We had been gathering a lot of information regarding Dhanauri, including its actual size, remote sensing images, number of stakeholders involved, number of farmers that own the land in the zone of influence, etc. This is a tedious task. The Covid-19 pandemic slowed the fieldwork further. Now that we are roping in the expert agencies, we hope that this task will be done soon,” added Srivastava.However, Anand Arya, a Noida-based birder who found the Dhanauri wetland and led a legal battle for its conservation, said that the forest department had been “very lethargic“.“They had been sitting on it for over seven years, when we first approached them for its conservation. As a result, over time this statuary wetland lost its original glory and continues to degrade. It’s high time that something is done in a timely manner and someone is held accountable before this wetland is completely lost,” said Anand Arya.The National Green Tribunal, in a March 2015 order in the case, had ordered to initiate the process of conserving the wetland.Spread over 101 hectares in Greater Noida and once home to over 211 species of birds, the Dhanauri wetland, a major Sarus Crane habitat in Gautam Budh Nagar, has suffered a habitat loss and drop in bird populations over the years.In April this year, the forest department had to rush to fill the wetland using borewells after it ran dry for the first time. In January 2021, the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) 2021, held by Wetlands International South Asia and the district forest department, found a drop in bird population over four times as compared to 2020. The AWC 2021 found only 1,344 birds against 6,227 birds in January last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/field-survey-at-dhanauri-wetland-soon-to-declare-it-ramsar-site-says-forest-dept-101624816269712.html
27-06-2021||Chandigarh||Covid-19: No death in Chandigarh for four days||Chandigarh on Sunday reported no death due to Covid-19 for fourth consecutive day, while 15 people tested positive for the virus.The daily infection count in the tricity stood at 33, with 14 cases surfacing in Mohali district and four in Panchkula. In terms of deaths, there was a lone fatality, that of a 49-year-old man from Mansa Devi Complex in Panchkula.Meanwhile, the active caseload dropped to 554 from Saturday’s 594. Mohali has 280 active cases, followed by 203 in Chandigarh and just 71 in Panchkula. Recovery rate is above 98% across the tricity while daily positivity rate is below 1.3%. Amid a decline in the second wave of the pandemic, the tricity had reported the first case of the Delta Plus variant of the coronavirus on Saturday, raising renewed concerns.According to the World Health Organisation, the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), first identified in India, is spreading in at least 85 nations, and is the “most transmissible of the variants identified so far”. Delta Plus (B.1.617.2.1) is its more virulent version, which has raised concerns about its capability to evade immunity built by vaccination or the previous infection.The first case in the tricity was that of a 35-year-old resident of Chandigarh, whose swab sample along with that of 49 other patients tested positive for Covid-19 since May were sent by the UT health department for genome sequencing to the National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi, on June 6. Genome sequencing attempts to draw out the complete genetics of the viruses.“The sample of a 35-year-old man, who is a resident of Vikas Nagar, Mauli Jagran, was tested positive for the Delta Plus strain, which is believed to be more transmittable and dangerous. The patient was tested positive for Covid-19 on May 22, and he has recovered from the virus,” Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, Chandigarh, had said.In view of the circulation of the new and more transmissible variant strains in the community, health experts have advised people to adhere to safety protocols and get vaccinated. “Vaccination at the earliest is the only key to protect ourselves from getting infected with these dangerous strains,” said Dr Kang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid19-no-death-in-chandigarh-for-four-days-101624816269212.html

The victim, Anivesh Kumar, filed a complaint at Sector Beta 2 police station, police said.“I had reached Pari Chowk around 8:30am to catch a bus for Lucknow. Soon, a car reached the spot and the driver offered me a lift. There were two more persons inside the car,” the victim in his complaint. According to police, on the way, the suspects asked him to hand over the belongings as they would “check” his bag for any illegal thing. The three suspects later snatched ₹4,500 cash and his two debit cards, which were bearing PIN numbers on the back, from him. Rameshwar Kumar, SHO, Beta 2 police station, said the suspects then dumped the victim. “The suspects went to an ATM kiosk and withdrew ₹96,000 in multiple transactions using the debit cards,” he said. The SHO said a case has been registered against the suspects under Section 392 (robbery) of IPC. “A police team has launched a search for the suspects,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/greater-noida-man-robbed-of-1-lakh-on-pretext-of-lift-in-car-101624816267950.html
27-06-2021||Noida||Noida: After losing loved ones to Covid, people turn to psychiatrists for grief support||The slump in Covid-19 cases may be helping to bring the city back to some sort of normalcy after the second wave ravaged many homes in April and May, but for many their lives had been changed forever.According to official data, 358 people lost their lives to Covid between April 1, 2021 and May 30, 2021 in GB Nagar. The mental toll is unaccounted for.Dr Abhay Singh Tomar, a psychiatrist at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida, has treated at least 100 patients during the second wave. The most common diagnosis is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is associated with severe mental weakness after suffering a loss or accident.“The patient finds themselves getting worried and anxious to save someone who has already passed away. In some cases, they are afraid Covid may infect their family again and they will not be able to save them,” said Dr Tomar.And then there is “survivor’s guilt” where people think they could have done more to save their loved ones.“Sometimes they think that they are the ones who went out and brought the infection home that led to the death, some blame an establishment like a hospital or a doctor.Such issues may result in anxiety or depression,” said Dr Tomar. Dr Ritu Gautam, counsellor at Sharda Hospital, Greater Noida, adds that death due to Covid is more difficult to process for a family member due to the lack of physical presence. Many critical patients were locked away in ICUs making it impossible for the “final goodbye”.“Closure is very important to process grief. In one such case, a woman who lost her husband remains in trauma and guilt as she could not spend his last moments with him,” said Dr Gautam. Noida-based counselling psychologist Simran Luthra has started an online support group for such people. “In the past two months, I have consulted 15 people have sought help to deal with grief caused due to the sudden and unexpected death of their loved one due to Covid,” said Luthra.She adds that in one such case, the person came on the brink of alcoholism. “The complete shock and trauma is triggering repressed issues in some people, like in one case where professional help had to be sought by a man’s friends after he turned to drinking after his father’s death. Mental health issues have become aggravated for those who have already been dealing with it,” she said.Delhi-based psychotherapist Nishi Joshi has been offering grief support.“My youngest patient was a 11-year-old girl who lost her mother, while the oldest was a 60-year-old who lost their son. People who don’t know how to deal with the loss of a loved one are hit with shock within days of diagnosis. This has been a traumatic episode which needs professional help to process,” said Joshi.She added that the stigma around seeking professional help is a deterrent. “In cases where friends or family refer the person to a therapist, there is a lot of resistance seen from them. There needs to be more talk about mental health in order for people to feel more comfortable seeking professional help in case they are unable to handle their mental and emotional health,” said Joshi.Dr Tomar said that timely professional treatment has been helpful in all the cases.“The consultations for most of these cases is still going on as the professional help enables the patients to come to terms with the loss and offers them emotional aid. While the grief remains the same, the mechanism to handle it changes with counselling and therapy sessions,” he said.GB Nagar Chief Medical Officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that while such cases have not been highlighted to the district health department, arrangements will be made for mental health support if needed. “We are not aware of cases where family members of those who died due to Covid have come forward for mental health support. However, if such a request is made to the district health department, arrangements will be made,” said Dr Ohri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-after-losing-loved-ones-to-covid-people-turn-to-psychiatrists-for-grief-support-101624816027888.html

And the government then levied ₹9 per litre and ₹3 per litre tax on petrol and diesel. Now, in 2021 the BJP government is taking ₹33 per litre and ₹32 per litre tax on petrol and diesel. The BJP government has increased excise duty on the two fuels 12 times so far,” she said. Priyanka said that in April 2020, the crude oil price in the international market was the US $ 19 per barrel, yet the BJP government did not extend the benefit to the people. Instead, it was benefitting the oil companies and “filling their pockets”, she said in a statement issued by the UP Congress Committee on Sunday. “Despite the exponential drop in crude oil prices in the international market in comparison to 2013, this government has increased petrol and diesel prices 50 times this year and in 135 districts of the country, petrol prices have crossed ₹100 per litre,” said said. She further said that in 2014, the BJP government realised ₹21.5 lakh crore through taxes on petroleum products and now when the people’s economic condition was not good because of the pandemic, the government extracted ₹4 lakh crore from fuel taxes. “Now, the question arises as to why this government did not extend to the people the benefit of the fallen crude oil prices in the international market? How far is the 300% hike in tax realisation justified,” she said. Priyanka said that in the past seven years, the government realised ₹21.5 lakh crore through taxes on petroleum prices, but what did the people get in return? Why had the government made increased prices and increased taxes on petrol and diesel a means to loot the people, she asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/priyanka-questions-central-govt-over-fuel-price-hikes-101624815967903.html
27-06-2021||Mumbai||Another Maratha group holds bike rally in south Mumbai||Days after Maratha Kranti Morcha, the umbrella outfit representing the Maratha community, announced a halt on its ongoing silent marches demanding reservation for one month, an outfit, Maratha Kranti Sangharsh Morcha (MKSM), held a bike rally from Somaiya Maidan at Chunabhatti to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) in south Mumbai. The MKSM has put forth 10 demands in front of the state and has warned of a massive march on August 9, if the state fails to act upon them. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders Prasad Lad, Kalidas Kolambkar and Vinayak Mete of Shiv Sangram, which is an ally of the saffron party, participated in the rally. The demands include review petition in the apex court, sizable provision for SARTHI and Annasaheb Patil Financially Backward Development Corporation, hostels for the youth from the community in every district, recruitment of youth who had secured government jobs from the quota before it was quashed, among others. “The community is not divided, although our way of agitation may be different. We have full faith and respect for Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, but we do not believe in government’s assurances as it has failed to keep them. We held 58 silent marches in 2016-17, after which reservation was given. We believe that the demands cannot be fulfilled without aggressive agitation. If the government fails to respond positively in the next few days, we will have a massive march in Mumbai in the next few weeks,” said Rajan Ghag of MKSM. He said his outfit has no link to any political party and they had invited leaders from all parties. Lad said, “The state has been taking the issue of the reservation very lightly. We are here to warn it that the agitation will be further intensified if quick steps are not taken.” The BJP has been advocating aggressive protest, while its MP Sambhajiraje has sought an amicable solution and urged the community to not resort to the streets. Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, a descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, is leading the under the umbrella outfit’s agitation for Maratha reservation which was quashed by the apex court on May 5. The MP has stalled the agitation for one month after holding two silent protests in Kolhapur and Nashik on June 17 and 21, respectively. He had expressed satisfaction over the steps taken by the state after a meeting with CM Uddhav Thackeray and other ministers last week. Virendra Pawar of Maratha Kranti Morcha said, “We did not participate in the rally as it is against our principle of avoiding public gathering amid pandemic. Maratha Kranti Morcha is a mass movement and different outfits can have their views on agitation, which is why we did not oppose the rally.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/another-maratha-group-holds-bike-rally-in-south-mumbai-101624815907924.html

The party was organised in two private bungalows and police allegedly recovered multiple drugs including cocaine, charas and marijuana from the venues.“We have traced a Nigerian national in Mumbai who is suspected to have suppled contraband to the party,” said additional superintendent of police Sharmistha Walavalkar of Nashik Rural.She added, “We have registered three separate cases against the people found at the party — one under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, the second for selling and consuming drugs and a third case is registered for violating Covid-19 norms. The process of arresting the suspects is going on as per their roles found.” Police got information about a high profile party in the bungalows where drugs will be consumed. A police team comprising around 50 personnel raided the bungalows, added Patil. “The party was organised to celebrate the birthday of an individual and many people from Mumbai participated in the party. The people participating in the drug party include four Bollywood and south Indian film actors, a reality TV show contestant and two prominent choreographers,” said Sachin Patil, superintendent of police, Nashik Rural.They all were taken for medical tests in a government hospital and their blood samples were taken to confirm how many consumed cocaine and other drugs. As per preliminary investigation, all appeared to have consumed drugs, added Patil.“Bungalow owners who rent properties for functions or parties in our jurisdiction have already been instructed to inform us and give details including the number of people participating in functions. But the owners did not inform us, so we have also booked them in the case and legal action will be taken against them,” said Walavalkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/igatpuri-police-raid-party-in-private-bungalows-arrest-22-with-drugs-101624815608511.html
27-06-2021||Mumbai||Medical students urge PM Modi to help them return to universities in China||After months of attending lectures online, Indian students pursuing medicine from Chinese universities have now approached Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi for help. In a letter addressed to the PM on Saturday, the students have requested the government to intervene and start talks with the Chinese government to help take students back to their respective universities.“We are 25,000 Indian students studying in Chinese universities who have been forced to participate in online classes for the past 17 months because of travel and visa restrictions. Our medical study requires a lot of practical and group work, but our entry to China and our respective universities is banned for the past year-and-a-half and we are suffering every day,” read the letter. According to the rules in China, MBBS students, after completing their five-year medical course, immediately have to complete a 52-week physical internship in assigned hospitals to be awarded their degree. While first-, second- and third-year MBBS students are currently attending lectures online, final-year students are at a loss as their internship can only be completed once the lockdown restrictions are lifted. “What’s worse is that for the past few months, students from China and South Korea have been allowed back on campus and are attending offline classes while the rest of us are struggling with online classes. Most of us have missed practical classes which form a big part of medical studies,” said a student on Twitter. A hashtag, #takeusbacktochina, has been trending on several social media groups for some months now.Earlier this month, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) issued a notice in favour of students studying in international universities who are stuck in India due to the pandemic. MEA issued a notice asking such students to write to its overseas Indian affairs (OIA) office about difficulties in reaching their university. “Indian students studying abroad who are stuck in India owing to Covid-19 pandemic restrictions and mobility issues can send their coordinates, that is, email ID and mobile number to OIA-II Division at emails: us.oia2@mea.gov.in and so1oia2@mea.gov.in,” said the notice on the official website.For the past few months, students across the state have been approaching the state government as well as the Centre via social media, hoping to attract their attention. While many students are waiting for lifting of the temporary ban on international flights to be able to travel to their chosen destination, others have also shared concern over their inability to access visas. “Our request to PM Modi is that the government approach the Chinese government and push for the return of Indian students to China. We are ready to follow all necessary quarantine rules in order to be accepted back at our universities,” states the letter.CA students seek to postpone examAround 6,000 chartered accountancy (CA) students have approached PM Narendra Modi’s office to take cognisance of the upcoming exam CA exam which is scheduled to take place in the offline mode between July 5 and 20. The students have asked PM Modi to direct the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) to postpone these exams by a few weeks until all students are vaccinated. Since many have also been allotted exam centres very far from their city of residence, students have also demanded that ICAI permit students to use their hall ticket as an e-pass to travel, in view of the restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/medical-students-urge-pm-modi-to-help-them-return-to-universities-in-china-101624815607793.html
27-06-2021||Mumbai||JEE Adv 2021 information brochure released; exam and admission rules tweaked this year||Even as engineering aspirants are waiting for clarity regarding dates for the pending Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains rounds, the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur released the information brochure for JEE-Advanced (JEE-Adv) 2021 this week. While most rules remain the same, the organising institute has tweaked some eligibility and admission rules keeping the pandemic in mind.For starters, students who cleared JEE Mains in 2020 and could not appear for both the JEE-Adv papers last year due to Covid-related issues, will be allowed to register directly for the JEE-Advanced 2021 exam. “This is a one-time measure valid only for JEE-Adv 2021. These candidates will be considered in addition to and not as part of the total number of candidates who would qualify from JEE-Mains 2021 for appearing in JEE-Adv 2021,” states the information brochure.Until now, an aspirant had to score 75% or more in the Class 12 board exams to be eligible for JEE-Adv but this year, the criteria have been tweaked considering the fact that all school education boards in the country scrapped Class 12 exams this year. “Candidates should have cleared their class 12 exams and should be among the top 2.5 lakh successful candidates including all categories in JEE-Mains 2021,” highlights the brochure.Another change has been introduced to the female quota seats across IITs this year. Unlike last three years when a uniform quota of supernumerary seats was allotted to female candidates across IITs, in 2021-22, this quota will differ from one institute to another. “The number of supernumerary seats in various programs will be decided by individual IITs ensuring that every institute has at least 20% female enrolment in undergraduate programs.”In 2017, the intake of girls in B Tech programmes at IITs was a mere 9.3%. In 2018, the IIT admissions council decided to introduce supernumerary seats, implying new seats created in addition to existing seats, for female students with the addition of 800 (14%) seats across 23 IITs in 2018 while the number stood at 946 (17%) female-only seats across IITs in 2019 and at least 20% of the undergraduate class by 2020.“This specific change in admission rules has been introduced considering that several IITs have already managed to surpass the 20% quota. So this year, IITs that have managed to admit 20% or more female students in certain programs can reduce the intake for those particular courses whereas those where the criteria still have to be met, the intake quota of supernumerary seats can be increased by individual institutes,” said a senior professor from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.Since dates for JEE-Mains are yet to be released by the National Testing Agency (NTA), no information on the schedule of JEE-Adv 2021 has been revealed in the information brochure. “Exam dates will be announced soon,” states the information brochure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jee-adv-2021-information-brochure-released-exam-and-admission-rules-tweaked-this-year-101624815487778.html
27-06-2021||Mumbai||128 died of black fungus in Mumbai hospitals since Feb||A total of 128 of the 741 diagnosed with mucormycosis or black fungus, since the start of the second Covid-19 wave in February, have died in city hospitals. Forty of the victims were from Mumbai, data shows. Mucormycosis is a serious, but rare fungal infection caused by a group of moulds called mucormycetes. According to doctors, it causes blindness, organ dysfunction, loss of body tissue and can be fatal, if not treated in time. “As the city has several tertiary-care super speciality hospitals that are well-equipped to provide timely treatment to patients who need surgical and medical intervention, we get a large number of patients from outside the city. So far, we have recorded 128 deaths due to mucormycosis in the city, but most of the deceased are from outside Mumbai,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Doctors said most patients from outside Mumbai delay their treatment for mucormycosis (which has an overall mortality rate of 50%), contributing to the fatality rate. “Compared to the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, there have been more cases of black fungus in the second wave. Most of the patients we receive come in by the time the fungus generally spreads furthermore, including the brain,” said Dr Renuka Bradoo, head of department of ear, nose, throat (ENT), Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, which is also known as Sion Hospital. In May, the hospital recorded around 33% mortality rate. However, with the flattening of the pandemic curve, the number of daily admission of patients with mucormycosis has fallen by almost 40% at major civic-run hospitals. Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of BYL Nair Hospital, said, “The daily Covid-19 cases started declining from May, so fewer patients are developing post-Covid complications like mucormycosis. The daily admission has dropped to a great extent compared to April.” Currently, 384 active mucormycosis patients are undergoing treatment in Mumbai. Of this, 274 patients are from outside Mumbai and 110 patients are residents of the city. Most patients need three-four weeks for complete recovery. Some patients are kept longer to check on the possible regrowth or further spread of black fungus in other parts of the body. For instance, at present, 112 patients with mucormycosis are undergoing treatment at King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel, which has special wards for fungal treatment. “The treatment takes longer than Covid-19 as they require hospitalisation and surgery. Only 10% of the admitted patients get discharged after full recovery,” said Dr Hetal Marfatia, head of the department, ENT. According to a guideline issued on May 17 by the state’s commissioner of health services and mission director, National Health Mission (NHM), patients with high blood sugar, if required, need to be examined by an ENT specialist for symptoms of mucormycosis. If needed, the patients can also be examined by an ophthalmologist. “The immunity gets compromised in a Covid-19 patient due to some medicines like Tocilizumab and steroids. So when they get exposed to mucor mold, which is commonly found in soil, plants, manure, and decaying fruits and vegetables, it becomes life threatening. It affects the sinuses, brain and lungs,” said Dr Girija Suresh, senior ophthalmic consultant, Fortis Hospital, Mulund. Steroids reduce inflammation in the lungs of Covid-19 infected patients. But it also reduces the immunity and increases the blood sugar levels in the Covid-19 patients. Dr Ajay Doiphode, president, Association of Otolaryngologists (AOI), blamed unregulated usages of steroids that lowers the immunity in the body as one of the primary reasons for the surge in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/128-died-of-black-fungus-in-mumbai-hospitals-since-feb-101624815367881.html
27-06-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Admissions based on Class 12 formula tricky, warn experts||The recent decision by several education boards to scrap Class 12 board exams due to the pandemic and mark students based on the previous year’s performance has invited mixed reactions from different stakeholders. For many, this move to assess students and further admissions based on a formula to derive marks has brought back memories from a decade ago, when admissions to junior college admissions were rocked by formula-based rules for three consecutive years from 2008 to 2010, delaying the admissions process all three years.“Though the education boards feel a similar formula will mean a level playing field for students from all boards, this is not true. Somehow, some students will be at a disadvantage. This year too, I fear a repeat of an admissions process with lots of confusion and ambiguity,” said a former official of the Maharashtra State Board for Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE). Between 2008 and 2010, admissions to first-year junior college (FYJC) seats witnessed a series of new formula-based admissions which led to complaints and furore from several student groups. This was followed by a series of public interest litigations (PILs) filed by aggrieved parents and students, ultimately delaying the admissions process by a few months. In 2008, the state government introduced a 70:30 formula which meant that colleges had to reserve 70% of their seats for local students and the remaining 30% for outsiders. This move was scrapped the same year after receiving flak from students and parents. In 2009, the state government put together a formula to base Class 10 marks of students on a percentile formula during admissions. This move too was scrapped after being quashed by the Apex court. “Every year, the state government was coming up with admission rules that give an upper hand to state board students, under the pretext that other education boards give inflated marks to their students. We spent a good part of 2008 and 2009 just filing petitions in the Bombay high court and the Supreme Court in order to give justice to students from other boards,” said Sudhir Madhani, parent activist. Madhani was one of the many parents who dragged the state government to court every year in 2008, 2009 and 2010 against ‘unrealistic and unfair’ admission formulas. This year, Covid pushed all education boards to rethink their decision of conducting board exams at a time when the country was grappling with a second wave. Scrapping of exams was unanimously accepted by all, but the decision of boards to now base Class 12 marks on a formula is not going down well with parents and students.The approved mechanism for Class 12 students of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) includes a 30:30:40 formula, which takes into account a student’s performance in the last three examinations (the 12th pre-board, the 11th finals, and the 10th board) to settle at a score for the theory component of the examination that could not be held. The theory portion accounts for 70% or 80% of a subject score, with the remainder coming from internal practical tests that most schools managed to complete prior to the outbreak of the second wave of Covid-19. In the case of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE), the formula will take into consideration the students’ Class 10 ICSE Board exam results, project and practical work in subjects, and best marks obtained in school exams in Class 11 and 12. While the Maharashtra state education board is yet to clarify their stand on how the Class 12 marks will be derived in the absence of the board exams this year, parents are already worried that formula-based marks will put state board students at a disadvantage.“Unlike other education boards, the Maharashtra state board can be very strict in giving marks for internals as well as theory paper and this puts state board students at a disadvantage in comparison with other board students,” said Sudha Shenoy, parent and activist. She added that every year, state board students have lost out on seats in desirable colleges because, in comparison, their counterpart from another education board has scored better. “Even with the new formula that other boards have introduced to derive Class 12 marks this year, our state board students will suffer because internals marks in other boards are higher compared to our schools and this will create a problem when marks will depend on such numbers/scores,” she added. While CBSE and CISCE boards have clarified their stand on Class 12 marks, the Maharashtra state board is yet to bring clarity on this matter. “We have news from some states of parent groups challenging the CBSE evaluation formula, so announcing any decision before understanding the response of the stakeholders will be difficult,” said a state government official. He added that the government will release a decision on this subject soon.Admission formulas2008—The 70:30 admission formulaAccording to this formula, admissions to first-year junior college (FYJC) courses will be divided in a way that local students get more leverage on a college seat as compared to those who don’t belong to that city or state. This move was introduced by the state government to give an advantage to students from that particular city/district on college seats as compared to their fellow students from other cities/states.The government, in a GR, had stated that FYJC colleges will reserve 70% of their seats to local students and the remaining 30% to outsiders. This invited uproar from students across Maharashtra and neighbouring states and after a long court battle, it was finally dropped by the state government and scrapped for good.2009—The percentile formulaAs per this formula put together by the Maharashtra state government, a student’s marks had to be calculated in comparison with the aggregate of the top ten scorers of that particular education board. The idea was to bring parity among first-year junior college (FYJC) aspirants from various education boards.Percentage=100xM/AA—Aggregate percentage of marks received the 10 toppers of a particular boardM—Marks of the student whose percentile is to be calculatedThis formula was challenged by parents of several ICSE and CBSE class 10 students in the Bombay high court, and a six-month-long battle ensued. The state government also took the matter to the Supreme Court only to be eventually quashed by the apex court2010—Best-five policyAccording to this formula introduced and implemented by the Maharashtra state government, where the five best scores out of six subjects in class 10 exams will be considered for the final percentage. In 2010, this formula was originally introduced for Maharashtra state board students only, and eventually, after a series of petitions, the same formula was extended to class 10 students from all education boards and is applicable during FYJC admissions to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-admissions-based-on-class-12-formula-tricky-warn-experts-101624815247843.html
27-06-2021||Delhi||Withdraw cases lodged against farmers for protest marches: Samyukt Kisan Morcha||Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Sunday demanded the withdrawal of cases registered against farmers during their protest marches on June 26 to mark seven months of their agitation against the Centre's three farm laws.SKM, the umbrella body of farmer bodies spearheading the agitation, said the Chandigarh police has booked several farmer leaders on several charges.Farmers on Saturday marched towards the Raj Bhavan in different states to submit memoranda, addressed to the president, and to governors to mark seven months of protests against the Centre's three farm laws."In Chandigarh, it is reported that FIRs have been filed against several SKM leaders and many other protestors under IPC sections 147, 148, 149, 186, 188, 332 and 353," the SKM said in a statement.It alleged that after barricading the roads, the "police also resorted to using water cannons and lathicharge on the protestors"."On top of this kind of undemocratic and authoritarian behaviour, cases are now being filed against SKM leaders. Samyukt Kisan Morcha condemns this and demands that the FIRs be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," it said.In many places, farmers were not allowed to even take out rallies to Raj Bhavans and there were detention and lock-ins of SKM leaders, it said."SKM condemns this and points out that this itself is an illustration of the failure of democracy and the undeclared emergency that we are going though," it said in the statement.Noting that cases have been filed against 15 farmers in Hisar who had taken part in a protest against a BJP meeting on June 25, the SKM said the FIRs should be withdrawn immediately.The farmers started their stir against the contentious farm laws in November by camping at Singhu border between Delhi and Haryana, besides at Tikri and Ghazipur borders.The protesting farmers have demanded the withdrawal of the Centre's farm laws and that a new law be made to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.The protesting farmers will mark Monday "Kisan Mazdoor Bhaichara Diwas" at Sunehra protest site near the Haryana-Rajasthan border, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/withdraw-cases-lodged-against-farmers-for-protest-marches-samyukt-kisan-morcha-101624814992796.html
27-06-2021||Other||Legal intervention needed to protect interest of customers of wedding industry||New Delhi: The pandemic has exposed the unfair contract terms deployed by wedding businesses to deny refunds to consumers who were forced to cancel their bookings on account of Covid-19.The nationwide lockdown last year as well as the lockdowns and restrictions on large gatherings imposed by state governments during the second wave of the pandemic this year, have led to many families having to postpone the wedding and cancel their bookings. The subsequent refusal by venue owners to return their money, has led to considerable distress among consumers in different parts of the country.The consumer complaints in this regard reveal several exploitative practices, requiring the intervention of the consumer protection regulator- -the Central Consumer Protection Authority- constituted under the Consumer Protection Act of 2019.First and foremost, a booking amount should be a small percentage of the total charge for the venue. Instead, it is found that most of these wedding halls are collecting the entire amount in advance, several months before the wedding date. These are not small amounts and run into lakhs to rupees. Second, they incorporate contract terms that are highly prejudicial to consumer interest. For example, they say that these booking deposits are non-refundable. Some say that the consumer forfeits the right to a refund in case of cancellation or even change of date! There are also clauses that impose a hefty cancellation charge. Some of them even give the businesses the right to cancel the booking and give the hall to someone else and also retain the advance paid by the consumer! In short, the contracts are heavily loaded against consumers and restrict their rights given under the Consumer Protection Act.These arbitrary clauses are mostly not read out or explained to the consumer at the time of booking. But even if consumers are informed of these conditions, they have no option but to accept them, because it is impossible to find a venue that does not impose such discriminatory conditions.Consumers can of course seek the help of the consumer courts to get back their money from venue owners, but given the large number of complaints that such denial of refunds have generated, this is a fit case for the Central Consumer Protection Authority to take up. In fact, there is an urgent need for the authority to quickly investigate into these cases, formulate a clear policy vis-à-vis refunds, declare all those unfair contract terms as illegal and unenforceable and also ensure that these contracts are in future fair to both parties.The new Consumer Protection Act of 2019 recognises the need to protect consumers from unfair terms in consumer contracts and defines what constitutes an ‘unfair contract’. Accordingly, “Imposing on the consumer any unreasonable charge, obligation or condition which puts such consumer to disadvantage” is an unfair contract. Similarly, “Imposing any penalty on the consumer, for the breach of contract thereof which is wholly disproportionate to the loss occurred due to such breach to the other party to the contract” is an unfair contract and therefore a violation of the consumer’s right to a fair deal.I must mention that last year, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the United Kingdom investigated into similar complaints of wedding businesses using unfair contracts to limit their liability in respect of refunds, following cancellation of bookings due to Covid-19. It then issued a ‘Guidance’ on the topic to ‘help consumers understand their rights and help businesses treat consumers fairly’. Subsequently, in an open letter to the wedding sector on September 7, 2020, CMA explained what terms were unfair under the law and said such clauses in the contracts of wedding businesses were unenforceable. CMA also asked businesses to examine their contracts and ensure that they meet the requirements of law. “Where businesses do not comply with consumer law, they risk action by the CMA or any other enforcer under the consumer protection law, such as local authority trading standards services”, the letter said. CMA has also issued Guidance to businesses on how to write fair contracts and avoid unfair contract terms.There is need for similar intervention here too, to protect consumer interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/legal-intervention-needed-to-protect-interest-of-customers-of-wedding-industry-101624815127827.html

27-06-2021||Other||One more held for murder of wrestler Sagar Dhankad||Police have arrested one more suspect on Saturday in connection with the murder of wrestler Sagar Dhankad, who was allegedly beaten to death by two-time Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar and at least 12 other men at Chhatrasal Stadium in May. Police, on Sunday, said with this, the total number of people arrested in Dhankar’s murder case has reached 12, while non-bailable warrants have been issued against six more suspects, who are still evading arrest. The suspect arrested on Saturday has been identified as 22-year-old Gourav Lora--a wrestler by profession and also a close aide of Kumar. Lora was with Kumar and was involved in the alleged attack on Dhankad and his two friends, including Sonu Mahal, who is said to be a relative of wanted gangster Sandeep alias Kala Jatheri, said police.“We arrested Lora from Delhi around 9.30pm on Saturday. He was produced before a court, that remanded him to our custody for two days. Interrogation of Lora is important to recover the stick he used to assault Dhankad and the clothes he was wearing at the time of the attack,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj.Police said after the alleged attack on Dhankar, Lora had been hiding at various places in Delhi and Haryana. The investigating team had been conducting searches to nab him. On June 26, the team received inputs that Lora was in Delhi and arrested him.The police, however, did not divulge the area from where he was nabbed, neither the reason behind his presence in Delhi. Police said Kumar and his associates allegedly assaulted Dhankar and two of his friends at the stadium on the intervening night of May 4 and 5 with hockey sticks, baseball bats and other blunt weapons, over an alleged property dispute. Dhankar eventually succumbed to the injuries. The police claim Kumar is the “main culprit and mastermind” of the murder and said there is electronic evidence where Kumar and his associates can be seen beating Dhankar. A Delhi court on Friday extended the judicial custody of Kumar, who was arrested on May 23, along with co-accused Ajay Kumar Sehrawat, till July 9. So far, Kumar has been in police custody for 10 days and under judicial custody for 23 days. Kumar was recently shifted to Tihar prison from Mandoli jail, following apprehensions that he may be attacked by accomplices of Kala Jatheri, who are lodged in the same jail, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-more-held-for-murder-of-wrestler-sagar-dhankad-101624814887784.html

Last week, the SMC had razed nine illegal constructions built in farmhouses in the Aravallis.Sandeep Malik, executive officer, SMC, said, “We will write to the district administration, seeking cooperation from all departments concerned to stop fresh illegal encroachments in the Aravallis. The farmhouses that are already constructed have electricity and water connections but are illegal as those have been built on the Aravalli land. Because of other connections available with them, it becomes difficult for us to demolish these illegal structures.”He added that “monitoring becomes easy” if other departments like forest, power, water, and revenue also keep a check on such illegal encroachments. The letter is being drafted and will be sent this week.The SMC has been receiving complaints of fresh encroachments, such as construction of walls, in the past two months, Malik added. Earlier this month, the authority had sent notices to 15 such farmhouse owners, and nine of the structures were demolished last week.According to records submitted in the National Green Tribunal (NGT), there are 434 illegally constructed farmhouses in the Aravallis in Gurugram.During the lockdown due to the second wave of Covid-19 in the past two months, cases of encroachments have increased in the Aravallis of Gurugram and Faridabad. Gurugram forest department officials say every week, they receive an average of two complaints of fresh illegal encroachments being made in the Aravallis.Recently, the forest department closed an illegal route constructed through the forest near Damdama in the Sohna forest range. The department has also formed a 30-member team to check illegal encroachments in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/smc-seeks-district-admin-s-help-to-prevent-illegal-encroachments-in-aravallis-101624814829844.html

A spokesperson for IL&FS spokesperson said that the money would be paid to the banks that financed the project, namely Andhra Bank, PNB, Indian Overseas Bank, Indian Bank, Punjab & Sindh Bank, UCO Bank, Bank of India and Dena Bank (presently Bank of Baroda), Corporation Bank, Central Bank of India and IIFC (UK) Ltd. The Gurugram Rapid Metro project was developed by IL&FS through its subsidiary special purpose vehicles (SPVs), Rapid Metro Rail Gurgaon Limited (RMGL) and Rapid Metro Rail Gurgaon South Limited (RMGSL), between 2009 and 2013.The spokesperson said that all the banks were partners in either of the subsidiaries. Ajit Balaji Joshi, the chief administrator of HSVP, said that they had deposited the money in an escrow amount as per the directions of the Supreme Court. “This matter is in arbitration and money has been deposited in the escrow account as per the order of Supreme Court,” he said. The case pertains to litigation between IL&FS and HSVP over the operation of the Rapid Metro rail project, which came to halt due to lack of traffic on the route. IL&FS officials said that due to multiple unmet obligations, they had terminated the concession agreement and demanded termination payments as per the agreement, in case of default by HSVP. The HSVP, however, disputed the contention and challenged the matter in the Punjab and Haryana high court. The high court ruled in September 2019 that operation and maintenance of the metro link be handed over to HSVP and directed the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) to carry out a financial audit of total debt due. The court also ruled that the HSVP must transfer 80% of the debt due, as determined by the CAG, to an escrow account. In September 2020, the auditors determined the debt to be ₹2,407 crore and the high court took note of the same on September 28, 2020, said IL&FS officials. The HSVP, however, raised several objections to the CAG audit report.The concessionaire, IL&FS, then moved the Supreme Court, seeking termination payments from the HSVP, after the authority failed to pay an amount of ₹1,925 crore amounting to 80% of the debt due of ₹2,407 crore, as per the CAG audit. On March 26, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled against the HSVP and directed the authority to deposit ₹1,925 crore within three months. The IL&FS spokesperson described the development as “unprecedented” and said it would greatly boost the morale of infrastructure and project development companies across the country.“The Supreme Court ruling on March 26, 2021, followed by HSVP’s compliance with the order and transfer of the payable amount to the IL&FS Group entities, will go a long way in protecting the interest of stakeholders and lenders in the Indian infrastructure sector. This ruling will also set a precedence for other projects wherein infrastructure companies, including IL&FS, are seeking payment of their legitimate dues and enforceability of valid contracts and concession agreements with various state governments,” the company spokesperson said.Appropriation of any amount from the escrow account shall be subject to further orders of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal or other competent legal authority, as per the order, and the same would be duly complied with by IL&FS, the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rapid-metro-case-hsvp-transfers-1-925-to-escrow-account-101624814828504.html

The XENs sanctioned and allotted projects amounting to ₹1 crore — all related to streetlighting — without taking necessary approvals from senior officials, according to the MCG officials.Either the additional MCG commissioner or the XEN (electrical wing) has the power to sanction, approve, or allot projects related to streetlighting. Taking cognisance of this, Bishnoi served notices to the officers concerned, asking them to explain their actions in writing, before any disciplinary action was initiated against them.“It has been observed that you (seven XENs) are exercising the powers which are not conferred upon you, and this way, you are abusing your official position in the MCG... This act on your part is an act of unbecoming behaviour of an officer, gross moral misconduct, indiscipline and disorderly behaviour. Before any action is initiated, you are hereby reprimanded to stop preparing the estimates and executing all works related to the street lighting and all electricity and further to handover the ongoing works to the XEN (electrical) concerned,” excerpts of Bishnoi’s order read.Bishnoi’s order further states that it is “abundantly clear that an administrative approval and work allotment for all works pertaining to street lighting and electric works, amounting up to a sum of ₹1 crore, is to process through concerned XEN electrical, superintending engineer, chief engineer, joint commissioner, or additional commissioner”.However, as per the available records of the MCG, the seven XENs in question were found to be preparing all estimates, and also executing works concerning street lighting, and other electric works on their own instead of putting up such projects for administrative and financial sanctions to the senior officials or the XEN (electrical) for approval.XEN (electrical) also served noticeBishnoi also served a notice to the XEN (electrical) on Sunday. During a field visit on Friday morning, he found that streetlights were turned on in Sector 38, Khandsa Road, and adjoining sectors. Stating that it was a wastage of electricity and finances, Bishnoi, in his notice, told the XEN that “he is neither carrying out proper monitoring or supervising street lighting”.His order further stated that the MCG’s agency, looking after operation and maintenance of streetlights, is also not working properly. Bishnoi has directed the XEN to improve the supervision of his staff and issue a notice to the agency concerned, and also impose a penalty against it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/7-mcg-xens-served-notices-over-misconduct-in-street-lighting-projects-101624814828943.html
27-06-2021||Gurugram||MCG goes ahead with waste-to-wonder project||Officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram on Sunday said that the civic body is continuing with its work on a waste-to-wonder project at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Park in Sector 17, despite residents’ objections.According to officials, MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja visited the site and said that around 30 structures, based on the theme of automobiles, will be developed from junk and erected in the park. Ahuja visited the park on Friday evening for a site inspection.Ahuja said that the project will cost around ₹2.5 crore and structures, such as ships, buses, trains, helicopters, cars, bikes, aeroplanes, cycles, UFOs, vehicles from Batman superhero movies, swings, tricycles and a statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, will be placed in the park.“The waste-to-wonder project will also have six selfie points and a food court will also be developed around the park. After the completion of this project, people will get a better place to visit in Gurugram and it will attract tourists not only from different parts of the country, but also from abroad,” said Ahuja, in an official release issued by the civic body following his visit.In August last year, taking inspiration from the waste-to-wonder park set up at Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi, the MCG decided to develop a similar project for Gurugram as well. The waste-to-wonder project in Delhi opened in February 2019 and has replicas of the Seven Wonders of the World, all of which are made from scrap.MCG officials privy to the matter said that of the 30 structures, construction of 29 are nearing completion while work on a solitary structure is at a nascent stage. The structures have been developed using items such as pipes, metals, rusted iron and old vehicle parts, among other junk materials.Residents of sectors 14 and 17 have been protesting against MCG’s project ever since the park was reopened on June 2 after Covid-19 restrictions were lifted after a gap of two months. The park is located adjacent to Sector 14 and falls under Sector 17.Residents said that during April and May, when the park was closed for the public, the park became heavily concretised and also many trees were axed to make space for the structures.The residents’ welfare association (RWA) of Sector 14 also filed a petition on the matter at the Punjab and Haryana high court, the hearing of which is scheduled to take place on June 29.“Similar to the Sarai Kale Khan project, the MCG should have developed the waste-to-wonder project on barren land instead of axing a large number of trees and removing shrubs and grass to develop it in Netaji Subhas Park. Given the city’s green cover is already in a major crisis, the MCG should have developed it on areas where encroachment is common so that government land remains preserved,” said Sanjeev Agrawal, a member of the Sector 14 RWA.He said that the park has been a popular walking spot for residents of Old Gurugram over the past three decades, but it has “lost its charm” due to the project.“Walkers no longer want to visit the park as paths have narrowed or blocked due to the waste-to-wonder project and the absence of greenery has also made several patches dusty. Due to these reasons, we are pursuing the matter legally in the high court and hoping for a decision in our favour,” said Agrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-goes-ahead-with-waste-to-wonder-project-101624814769158.html

Police said they laid a trap and caught him with 500 grams of heroin on June 23. A case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act was registered and Ishaq was arrested, they said.During the interrogation, DCP Biswal said, Ishaq allegedly revealed that he started his career as a car mechanic and previously worked in Bengaluru, Jaipur and in UP’s Rampur. “Last year, Ishaq came in touch with one Bareilly-based drug supplier and joined his drug trafficking network. He was introduced to some Delhi-based habitual drug peddlers, including Mohammad Tabrej, who was involved in 18 cases and was arrested last month with his wife and associate, along with 500 grams of heroin,” said the DCP.DCP Biswal said that Ishaq, who visited Delhi once every week to allegedly deliver heroin to clients, always travelled in buses to avoid getting caught and delivered the consignments mostly in the evening.

Gaurav Dipanker, state president of BEd Qualified Candidates Struggle Committee, said, “We will move Patna high court on Monday as we are not satisfied with the decision. Our main concern is to get jobs in the current phase of recruitment rather than getting assurance for future recruitment. We are already struggling for three years as we took the exam thrice.” Meanwhile, TET Shikshak Sangh (TSS) has also come up in support of the protesting candidates. Amit Vikram, the state convener of TSS, said, “The appointment authorities are entrusted with the responsibility of preparing the merit list, but the Bihar School Examination Board itself declared students included or excluded from the merit list, which was against the laid norms. Besides, marks obtained by candidates in their intermediate, graduation and BEd exam is given weightage during merit list preparation.” “We urge the government to opt the fair and transparent way of teachers’ recruitment else we would move the high court for seeking justice,” he addedAs per a report submitted by the review committee on Saturday, STET certificates issued with effect from February 11, 2011, will remain valid for lifelong as NCTE has asked all states to take necessary actions in terms of validity extension.“Candidates who have qualified STET exam whether in 2011 or 2019 will be eligible for recruitment in the seventh phase as well as in future recruitments. The appointment authorities constituted under district boards and civic bodies would prepare a merit list for the appointment of teachers,” the report said. A four-member review committee was constituted on June 22 to assess the cases of candidates who had qualified STET 2011 but their certificates were not being considered valid for the appointment and also those who qualified STET 2019 but their names did not figure on the merit list.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/stet-2019-candidates-not-satisfied-over-inclusion-of-previously-qualified-teachers-in-7th-pay-commission-threaten-to-move-hc-101624813867749.html

Even in Varanasi and Gorakhpur, the BJP was badly defeated in the district panchayat members’ polls (held in April). And now the unopposed election of the BJP nominees is no less than a miracle. The BJP proved once again that it does not respect the public mandate,” the former chief minister said.In the last four years the BJP had betrayed the people at every step, all essential items saw a steep price rise, law and order was demolished, and thousands lost their lives under “corona mismanagement”, he alleged.“The people will teach the party a lesson in the 2022 UP assembly polls,” he said.On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh has hit back at the Samajwadi Party (SP) for making allegations about his party in connection with the district panchayat chairpersons’ poll nominations. “Facing a certain defeat, the SP leaders are now blaming BJP though their leader has found a way to shun owning defeat by blaming district party chiefs,” he said in Bundelkhand. “They who abused each democratic institution, are now talking ethics and morality. When SP leaders were indoors at the height of Covid surge, the BJP cadres were out, helping the poor and needy,” the state BJP chief added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/akhilesh-accuses-bjp-of-adopting-unethical-tactics-in-up-district-panchayat-chiefs-polls-101624813808244.html

27-06-2021||Kolkata||Debanjan Deb: Saga of conman who spent his money to run fake vaccination camps||Debanjan Deb was the epitome of success. The coveted IAS tag behind his name, a blue beacon car to ride on, social media posts which showed him off posing with the citys power elite at various functions, were all his to flaunt.Earlier this year when a Tagore bust in North Kolkata was unveiled by a local library, the plaque below had a list of dignitaries who were present or were involved in siting the bust. Alongside the inscribed names of a member of parliament, state legislators and other dignitaries, was Deb's name, with the job description of 'joint secretary' to the government of West Bengal.For his classmates at the citys Taki House school, he was a backbench boy to be proud of.However, when news broke on television channels that Deb was a conman, who had held fake vaccination camps and duped people into believing he was an IAS officer and a top official with Kolkata Municipal Corporation, his friends and neighbours were stunned.Celebrities and politicians with whom he had posted pictures on social media started scrambling to distance themselves from the man, who they said"We used to call Debanjan, Debu. He was a very mediocre student. A timid boy who never got into any mischief. When we heard he had gone up in life, we were happy and proud who could imagine that he had actually transformed into a smooth-talking conman," Deb's classmate, in Taki House in Sealdah, who did not wish to be named told PTI."It seems like a dream which went awry and turned into a nightmare, the classmate added. Now none of his friends or neighbours want to own up to being close to him. He has disgraced us, our school we feel jittery about telling anyone we knew him," the friend said wryly.His father Manoranjan Deb, a retired deputy collector of the state excise department, has taken to bed in shock and refuses to meet anyone, while neighbours have effectively boycotted the family.Deb completed his graduation in Zoology from Charuchandra college and took admission for a masters degree in Genetics at Calcutta University which he never completed. Things started taking a new turn in 2014 when Deb appeared for the civil services examinations."Debanjan could not crack the UPSC preliminary examinations but told his parents that he was successful and will be travelling for probationer training," said a police officer investigating the cases against the 28-year-old conman, which now range from cheating to attempt to murder as his fake vaccination camos have administered injections on some 2,000 people, the after effects of which are yet to be ascertained.Instead of travelling to Mussoorie for his training, Deb went to work with an event management firm and during that stint came out with a few song albums. In 2017, he was back and told his parents that his training was over and he had gained a place in the state secretariat.Last year, after the outbreak of the pandemic, the young 'IAS officer' started procuring sanitisers, masks, PPEs, gloves and rented a few rooms at a club in Taltala to run his business."He had made good profit in dealing in goods them and in the process started meeting officer-in-charges of several police stations, a few politicians and other influential people," the police officer said.To build a rapport with politicians and top functionaries he started donating consignments of masks, sanitisers and PPE kits, very often in the presence of a local leader. Invariably he would tell politicians, top bureaucrats and policemen that he was a social worker. Photographs of such functions tarted appearing on his social media posts, which took care to use the term "public servant" to describe him. However, to the public at large he let it be known that he was an IAS officer, a claim he did not make either on his facebook or twitter account.He went to great lengths to establish his identity as a government official, printing fake letterheads and identity cards. Even fake email accounts resembling Kolkata municipal corporation accounts were set up. While KMC uses kmcgov.in, Deb used kmcgov.org.Fake bank accounts too were opened using forged identity cards of Kolkata Corporation officials, which were used to rout payments.He opened a new "Urban Planning and Development" company and set up an office in Kasba where he office to resemble a KMC office."He not only printed several documents bearing fake KMC logos, he also managed to have made writing pad having the state government's Biswa Bangla logo as well as holograms of the civic body," the police officer said.Everything could have continued to run its course for some more time, but for his mistake in inviting actress and TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty to take the anti-Covid jab at one of the free vaccination camps run by him. The actress suspected it was a fake for some reason and alerted Kolkata Municipal Corporation officials, who soon found out that Deb was an imposter and had him arrested.While the police officers investigating him say that they understand his desire to make money through his company or gain a fake social standing by posing as an IAS officer, they are still clueless why he did is "charitable free vaccination camps" spending money out of his pocket in buying anti-biotics which were injected and hiring nurses and doctors for the job.Psychologist Debasish Chakraborty who has studied similar cases, says that there is a category of individuals who are willing to run the risk of getting into serious trouble merely to get a kick out of duping people."It's a form of pleasure seeing people giving you respect and attention even through false means. This seems to be true in Debanjan's case," Chakraborty told PTI. This seems to have led Deb to appear as a social worker and start Covid- 19 vaccination camps free of cost to all, the psychologist said."He was not even bothered about the medical risks associated with injecting antibiotics like Amikacin, an antibiotic medication used for a number of bacterial infections. He had become desperate for the fame which was not his," Chakraborty said.

In our case, I made both my children as the nominees. The company has given us all four cheques worth ₹2.5 lakh - two that have to be submitted on July 4 and two in December. But we doubt these cheques will get encashed,” said Ulhas Gonde, who lost his wife in the fire. While the relatives are struggling with the compensation, the company has plans of staying in operation for a long time in the future. Either that or the company is making false promises to the deceased people’s relatives. “Someone sent a message saying the company has promised one family member per deceased with employment in their company on a permanent basis. ESI (insurance) letter has to be filled and submitted in the insurance company’s office in Baner. We got a call saying the cheques are ready, but we have not yet found it within us to go back there and collect,” said Somnath Ghodake who lost his elder sister in the fire. The local administration, on the other hand, is yet to receive the amount from the state government which had promised ₹5 lakh to the next of kin of all deceased in the fire accident. There is also no update from the Prime Minister’s disaster relief fund which had promised ₹2 lakh to the next of kin of each deceased. “We have received ₹1 lakh per person, but we have not issued cheques yet. The remaining amount got sanction last week and we are hoping that it will reflect in the bank account by this week. The cheques for the total amount of ₹5 lakh will be issued immediately afterwards. For the Prime minister’s national relief fund, we have sent all the required information but have not heard back from them,” said Abhay Chavan, tehsildar of Mulshi. The paperwork for land acquisition for a fire station, for which the Mulshi industrial association and the Pune metropolitan region development authority (PMRDA) have been making efforts, is also yet to see the light of day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pirangut-fire-20-days-after-incident-families-await-compensation-101624811647567.html

27-06-2021||Lucknow||UP district panchayat chiefs’ polls: BJP, Opposition trade barbs after controversy over nominations||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Opposition fired verbal volleys at each other on Sunday after Saturday’s controversy-hit nominations for the zila panchayat chairpersons’ polls.While the BJP looked to have the upper hand in a majority of the 75 districts, the Opposition, which has accused the ruling party of “foul play”, sought to portray it as BJP’s “desperate bid” to make an impression ahead of the 2022 UP assembly polls.The zila panchayat chairpersons are elected by zila panchayat ward members. In April, maximum ward members backed by SP had won the polls and the BJP now looked to make amends in the elections for the zila panchayat chairpersons. The scene would be a little clearer on June 29, the last date for the withdrawal of nominations. Political observers are expecting several “withdrawals”. The final picture would be officially known on July 3, the voting and counting day. As of now, the BJP looked set to win unopposed in at least 17 districts, the SP in its bastion of Etawah even as the Opposition-backed zila panchayat members were holding press meets to talk of the alleged “irregular practices” by the administration. “The BJP is headed for a landslide win, a trailer ahead of the 2022 UP polls. The SP was unable to find candidates and workers in several places and that’s why it even expelled district chiefs at 11 places, majority of them in places where they were unable to put up candidates,” said UP BJP spokesman Manish Shukla. Dismissing the charge, SP MLC Udaiveer Singh said, “The BJP has read the writing on the wall. Just wait for a few months when people will finally show the door to this government.” The BSP that had backed candidates for zila panchayat ward members’ polls, surprisingly didn’t put up candidates for zila panchayat chairpersons’ posts, even in places like Ghaziabad and Moradabad where it had several zila panchayat ward members. The Congress put up just one candidate in the state – in Rae Bareli, the Lok Sabha constituency of party chief Sonia Gandhi as it looked like a straight contest between SP and BJP in Amethi, another Congress bastion that BJP wrested in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. “The manner in which Opposition candidates were beaten up, prevented from filing nominations is shocking,” UP Congress Committee (UPCC) Ajay Kumar Lallu alleged. Police arrested several SP workers in Mahoba who had come prepared to wave black flags at visiting UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh.In Unnao, images of party MP Sakshi Maharaj blessing rebel Arun Singh, who filed his nomination as independent despite being hurriedly replaced by the BJP, embarrassed the ruling party.In Etah, both BJP and SP got two candidates each to file the nomination. There are 41 districts where there is a straight contest primarily between BJP and SP though in 11 other districts, a three-way contest is likely, provided there are no withdrawals in these districts by Tuesday. A maximum five candidates are in the fray in Bhadohi. UP BJP chief hits out at SPUttar Pradesh BJP chief Swatantra Dev has hit out at the Samajwadi Party (SP) for making allegations about his party in connection with the district panchayat chairpersons’ poll nominations. “Facing a certain defeat, the SP leaders are now blaming BJP though their leader has found a way to shun owning defeat by blaming district party chiefs,” he said in Bundelkhand. “They who abused each democratic institution, are now talking ethics and morality.

The dry spell has led to extra burden on groundwater as the farmers are pumping out more groundwater to keep the crop alive in lack of rains and with the maximum day temperature being around 40°C.In more worry to the farmers, the Meteorological Centre, Chandigarh has predicted no rain in most districts of Haryana in the next three days and scattered showers in some places on July 1. According to the IMD report, the state has received 49.5mm rainfall since June 27. This is higher than the normal 38.9mm and last year’s 47.7mm but experts said that most of the rainfall occurred before beginning of paddy transplantation (June 15).The last two weeks largely remained dry in most paddy growing belts of the northern districts of Haryana and farmers were largely dependent on tubewells for irrigation.The farmers said the electricity supply of eight hours to agriculture feeders is insufficient as they are depending on tubewell water.Delayed monsoon has affected marginal and small farmers most as they do not have tubewells installed. “We are waiting for rain to start transplantation on our two acre land as the irrigation department did not open water in irrigation canals,” said farmer Raghubir Singh, of Karnal’s Nilokheri.Farmer Jai Singh, of Bhootmajra village in Kurukshetra, said, “I transplanted paddy on two acre and now the crop is dying due to lack of water. The tubewell water is not sufficient to irrigate the entire crop.”“In the lack of rain, I have decided to sow the remaining two acre using direct seeding method,” he added.Dr ML Khichar, agrometeorologist at Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, in a statement, said monsoon winds are not able to move down towards Haryana as the monsoon turf is moving up towards the Himalayan foothills in north. “Favourable conditions for activation of monsoon winds are likely to form only after the next five to seven days. The weather in Haryana is likely to be generally variable but dry till July 2,” he said.However, deputy director agriculture department Karam Chand said as of now, there was no major impact of the dry spell on paddy transplantation and farmers having no irrigation source can go for DSR method.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dry-spell-in-haryana-worries-paddy-growers-101624810033137.html

The videos were shared from his verified Twitter handle and on the Facebook page. Later, Congress MP from Ludhiana Ravneet Singh Bittu also retweeted Warring’s videos. Singla added instead of sand, fly ash of non-functional coal-based power generation facility is being used for developmental works in the city. “Sand and earth is also being excavated without any government authorisation, at the behest of Manpreet Badal and his brother-in-law, Jaijeet Singh Johal,” he alleged. Demanding a fair probe, the Akali leader also claimed that a bid was made to attack him while he making the video of the illegal mining. Warring, however, tagged chief minister Amarinder Singh with a demand to take action against the people who are behind all this. “These are the people who are pulling Congress down,” tweeted Warring.In a written statement, Manpreet’s office rubbished all charges that Singla has levelled. The communiqué was silent on Warring’s allegations.Senior deputy mayor Ashok Pradhan said Singla was misleading the public by creating confusion between fly ash and sand. “Construction material for development work is being used as per prescribed standards. There is no complaint from any quarter about the quality of work being done. If any laxity is found, payment to contractors will be stopped,” said Pradhan. There was no clarity on who is using fly ash of the thermal plant.Lehra Mohabbat-based thermal plant DP Garg chief engineer, who also has the charge of Bathinda’s unused power plant, did not respond to calls and text messages.Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said huge stock of fly ash is lying in dykes spread over 800-acre and its commercial use lies with the thermal plant management. “There are no sand deposits in or around the thermal plant. The administration has not received any complaint of any mining activity, but I will get the matter examined,” the DC added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/warring-posts-akalis-video-alleging-illegal-mining-all-muck-says-manpreet-101624809548181.html
27-06-2021||Lucknow||Pan-India law against religious conversion required, says prominent seer||Swami Yatindranand Giri, mahamandaleshwar of the Juna Akhara, has demanded a pan-India anti-religious conversion law, population control bill and a review of the Constitution. Giri is in Lucknow where he will attend an event on Monday. [Mahamandaleshwar is a title used by some Hindu monks of the Dashanami order of renunciates founded by the Adi Shankaracharya. When a person is called mahamandaleshwar, it means he has been elevated by his peers to the highest level of traditional, Hindu spiritual leadership.] “An anti-conversion law is need of the hour. We need such a law throughout the country to check this menace of conversion,” said Giri. Raising the issue of the recent arrest of two people by the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism (ATS) squad on the charges of carrying out a conversion racket, Giri said: “Such conversions are going on a large scale throughout the country.” “We need to create awareness among masses about conversion by allurement,” he added. Giri advocated parents educating their children about “these conversion activities”. He stressed on abolition of the caste system, which was “also responsible to some extent for conversions”. Besides, he emphasised on the need to introduce a pollution control bill. “Most of the problems are due to the increasing population of the country. I have been requesting successive governments to bring a population control bill,” Giri said. He called for a two-child policy and making its violation a criminal offence. “Even the population of the entire Europe combined together is much less than India’s population. In such a scenario, how can you expect things to improve?” he said He also said, “There is a need to review the Constitution. The existing Constitution does not address issues that are relevant today.” “A new Parliament building is being constructed. Before it becomes functional, there must be a review of the Constitution,” he added. On the controversy over allopathic medicines and Ayurveda in the context of Yoga guru Baba Ramdev’s recent statement on allopathy, Giri said: “No one is ruling out the efficacy of modern medicines. But allopathy doctors have always tried to run down Ayurveda.” “It has been proved on several occasions and even in this pandemic that Ayurveda is no less important than allopathy,” said Giri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/panindia-law-against-conversion-required-says-prominent-seer-101624808528115.html

Bhaskar Rakhmaji Sinare (50), Vinodkumar Annasaheb Shrikhande (49), and Ravindra Daulatrao Kawade (52), all residents of Ahemednagar. The three doctors collectively got an amount of ₹6.04 crore for helping a businessman secure a loan. A complaint in the matter was lodged by Pandharinath Salve (56) official of Nagar Urban Co-operative Bank Limited, Ahmednagar. “They planned with around 20 others to get a loan worth ₹22 crore passed from the Pimpri-Chinchwad branch of the bank headquartered in Ahmednagar. The bank was told that the loan was for industrial purpose, for extension to a company owned by Baban Chavan (one of the accused). A part of the plan to show that the extension was built on a land that the doctors sold to Chavan for ₹9 crore when it is valued at ₹2 crore,” said senior police inspector Vasant Babar of the Economic offence wing of Pimpri-Chinchwad police crime branch. The doctors were arrested from Ahmednagar on Friday evening and produced in Pimpri court on Saturday. They were remanded to police custody till June 30 by the court, according to public prosecutor Vaishali Patil of Pimpri court. “It is suspected that Chavan used the rest of the amount to clear his earlier loans and to pay the others to help him secure the loan,” said PI Babar. The accused include senior bank officials and Chavan’s company employees. One doctor named Nilesh Vishwasrao Shelke (47) is already in police custody in the case. Among the 20 others booked in the case, four are out on bail, nine have anticipatory bail, two are dead, and five others, including the main accused, are yet to be arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/three-doctors-in-police-custody-for-loan-fraud-case-101624806787214.html

State-owned Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) will provide four vehicles for trial run in coming weeks. It is the first such trial run in the country to use EV for solid waste. The city generates more than 2,100 tons of solid waste and is collected and transported to solid waste processing plants which are located in different parts of the city. The PMC motor vehicle department spends around ₹90 crore per year for the maintenance of vehicles which includes fuel, repair, maintenance, and staff salary. Mahesh Doiphode, deputy commissioner of vehicle department of PMC said, “EESL approached us and showed interest to provide EV to carry waste. At present, we are using 200 ‘ghanta gadis’ to collect garbage in different parts of the city. There are 200 such ‘ghanta gadis’ in operation.” He further said, “As per discussion with company officials, they are ready to provide EV for trial basis to use to collect waste in the city. After the performance, we will make a decision to procure it or not.” According to officials, Due to the increasing fuel prices, PMC is seriously conserving to increase the share of outsourced vehicles. The share of outsourced vehicles is around 30 per cent and the PMC wants to increase it up to 40 per cent. If the EV model will give us good results, it will also help us to cut expenses on fuel. Right now, PMC spends around ₹40 crore on fuel. Ajit Deshmukh, deputy commissioner of solid waste department said, “It will be helpful to us. But I will decide after trial. The company will provide us ghanta gadi.” EESL is promoted by the Ministry of Power, Government of India as a Joint Venture of four reputed public- sector undertakings NTPC Limited, Power Finance Corporation Limited, REC Limited and Powergrid Corporation of India Limited. Deepak Kokate, regional manager of EESL said, “We have selected PMC as it has already started a program to purchase EV. So, we have decided to provide four vehicles for trail run for two weeks. It has the capacity to carry five tons of garbage load. It will save 25 per cent on overall expenses including fuel and maintenance. We will provide four vehicles to PMC for a trial run.” “After successful implementation of the project, it will be implemented across the city. National Institute for Transforming India (NIITI) Aayog is going to monitor a pilot project, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-undertake-trial-run-of-ev-for-garbage-collection-101624806667202.html

The citizens’ garden is a second such initiative as part of the communitarian efforts being undertaken by local residents to increase green cover in the area. The area falls under the reserve forest zone and had been witnessed rapid urbanisation and massive tree cutting during past one decade. Corporator Bhangire said “We are creating some of the best parks in Pune in Mohammadwadi through citizens’ initiative. The funds for the project have been sanctioned but due to Covid-19 the work of the first park was stuck and will not get a boost. Similarly, the current plot at Gemini society will be transformed into garden. We have appealed to the citizens to protect the gardens as part of their own responsibility and as public representative, we have backed the project with whatever is required from the PMC.” Social worker Atik Pathan of Gemini society said, “It was a long time wish that citizens’ park be developed on amenity space. In a short span of time this space will be transformed into a state-of-the-art joggers’ park with flora and fauna taking into account the rich biodiversity and reserve forest area of their location into consideration as the area comes under forest zone. We have received strong support from the area corporator for this national mission of increasing green cover in Mohammadwadi by establishing a unique plan in the most urbanized set up of the city.” Area resident Pravin Suryavanshi said, “An absence of open spaces in the area has further aggravated the environment problem leading to congestion and pollution. Mohammadwadi can emerge one of the model areas of smart city development and development of public parks with the sole objective of preserving the forest cover and environment will help the citizens fight against Covid-19.” Green warrior Pravin Kumar said “The initiative of the people will lead to increase in forest cover and fight challenges like climate change which is drastically affecting the globe.” The plush area which houses societies comprising Gemini, Imperial, Raheja Vista, Elena, Ganga Florentina and several other residential societies houses a population of over 4,000. Ganga Kingston society has already petitioned the ministry of environment to declare the area as an ecologically fragile zone and increase tree count and forest cover in the area. The area is also home to the country’s prominent citizen forest named ‘Anandvan’ which is home to several rare species of birds like peacocks and trees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mohammadwadi-gets-second-citizens-park-through-citizens-initiative-101624806547188.html
27-06-2021||Pune||Serious crimes rise in city in comparison to 2020||The city has witnessed as many as 139 cases of attempted murder from January to June in comparison to only 44 cases in 2020. During the last six months, 38 cases of murders were reported in the city while the figure was around 36 last year. The number of serious crime cases has left citizens worried in the city. The crime under the category of attempt to murder has seen an increase at the time when a sustained crackdown has been launched against organised crime and nearly 30 organised crime gangs have been incarcerated by the orders of Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta. Also, the city has seen a rise in the number of body offences causing injuries using weapons for 2021. The city has seen around 530 offences lodged till the end of May while the number of offences was around 410 last year. According to the crime branch officials, the main reason behind attempt to murder cases have been trivial issues like staring and public insult. Old rivalry between clashing groups is also one of the factors behind rise in murderous attacks between the groups inimical to each other. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale said “There was a strict lockdown last year and people did not venture out but this time citizens are moving across the city despite restrictions which is of concern for the police. Also, we have solved most of the murder cases and complete investigation is being done for the serious crimes as the investigation is still in progress.” Slum pockets located in Bibvewadi, Kondhwa, Hadapsar, Bhavani peth, Yerawada, Wanowrie and Sinhagad road witnessed serious group clashes where rival gangs attacked each other as eight such criminals on police record have been killed during last year. Factors like domestic disputes, poverty, job losses and other insecurities are also being considered as probable caused behind the rise in crimes by the police. The city police have also applied Maharashtra Control of Organised crime act (MCOCA) to more than 30 gangs operational in the city to send a stern message to the criminals that no nonsense would be tolerated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/serious-crimes-rise-in-city-in-comparison-to-2020-101624806488668.html

On May 28, police had seized tramadol capsules of ₹15 crore from a Himachal Pradesh-based pharmaceutical firm. Addressing a press conference, senior SAD leader Virsa Singh Valtoha said a case should also be registered against former Punjab Police IGP Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh for his alleged involvement with one of the accused in the drug smuggling case. Valtoha’s allegation comes after the rural police added the name of Congress’ former district president Rajiv Bhagat, who switched to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) two months ago, as an accused in the drug case. Valtoha alleged, “Bhagat is close associate of Kunwar Vijay Partap. He was made AAP’s in-charge from Amritsar-West constituency after he paid a huge bribe to the senior AAP leadership. This should also be probed. It needs to be established if Bhagat had used drug money, at the instance of Kunwar Vijay Pratap. Police must probe the call detail record between the two.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hand-over-rs-15-cr-tramadol-seizure-case-to-ncb-sad-101624805587752.html

The DC’s recommendation comes after additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Preeti Yadav’s inquiry report indicted Jagsir and Sandeep. The case relates to the auction of a plot on August 19, 2013, on the directions of the Nabha civil court. The court had ordered the tehsildar to auction 175 square yard of a 492 square yard plot of M/s Banarsi Dass Ram Chand. According to the ADC’s inquiry report, the two officials sold the entire plot for a ₹17.2 lakh, whereas the then market rate was over ₹70 lakh. Bidder Harjinder Singh deposited ₹4.3 lakh as 25% of the auction amount with tehsildar Jagsir, who submitted a receipt to this effect. After controversy erupted over the illegality, another court cancelled the auction. The matter came to light when a computer operator, appointed on contract, Amanjot Singh, turned a whistle blower. Officials, however, in league with the purchaser got a First Information Report (FIR) registered against Amanjot and got him sacked. In another twist, the then Punjab DGP Suresh Arora shifted the probe in the plot auction case to the vigilance bureau.The vigilance cancelled the FIR against Amanjot and started departmental proceedings against erring police officials for lodging a wrong case against him. The vigilance also asked the revenue department to conduct a departmental probe against the then Nabha tehsildar Jagsir and his clerk Sandeep. This probe was marked to ADC Preeti. Probing the charges against the two revenue officials, the ADC’s inquiry report submitted to the DC states that it had been proven that officials overstepped their power and auctioned the entire plot in violation of court order. Her report also notes that the accused had destroyed the auction record, so that the truth wouldn’t come out.The whistle blower Amanjot said, “I paid the price of being honest, and faced a false FIR for working as rules. Initially, the accused also tempted me to join them in the misdeed, but I stayed true to my principles. I hope that the department takes strict action against both the officials.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tehsildar-reader-indicted-for-selling-nabha-plot-at-throwaway-rates-in-2013-101624804690738.html

As per the police, Naik refused to give ₹100 to the intruder.Police officials in Jharsuguda said the miscreant entered the residence of the former Sambalpur University vice-chancellor when he was not there. Upon his arrival at around 12.30 pm, the culprit demanded ₹100.“The youth entered the former V-C’s bedroom when he was not there. The youth named Rimit Dura, 20, seemed to be drunk and kept demanding ₹100. When Naik came home at 12.30 pm, he confronted the youth for trespassing into the house. He then asked his son-in-law to call up the police. This seems to have enraged the miscreant who hacked him with the axe that he was carrying and left him bleeding profusely at the spot,” said Jharsuguda SP Bikash Chandra Dash.Naik was rushed to a private hospital in Jharsuguda, where he succumbed to injuries during treatment.Police arrested Durua from a nearby forest after two hours of search and are interrogating him about his motive for murder. Police officials said as the youth was into the timber business, Naik may have been opposing his felling of trees.Naik, a prominent academician of western Odisha, was appointed the vice-chancellor of Sambalpur University in June 1998 and served till July 2001. A gold medallist in M.Sc.(Zoology) from Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Naik went on to head the Zoology department at Utkal University where he retired in June 1998.His research interests included cytophysiology and immunohistochemistry of the pituitary gland from fish to mammals, and localization of (then newly discovered) neuropeptides (having Morphin-like action), such as Enkephalins and Endorphins in the brain of vertebrate animals. He was selected by the UGC in 1979 to undertake advanced training as a visiting scientist at the University of North Carolina, USA, under the Indo-US Exchange Programme (Fulbright-Hay Programme).A keen lover of nature, Naik reforested the bald Andhari hill and the forest around it in Jharsauguda district after his retirement. Though Andhari was a dense forest and a habitat for wild animals, in the 80s it lost most of its 1,000-hectare tree cover due to indiscriminate felling of trees. Guided by him, Naik’s son and local villagers initiated the conservation of the Andhari forest with community participation.In 2013, the Andhari Vana Suraksha Samiti, started by him, was given the ‘Prakriti Mitra’ award. In 2012, he was appointed as the honorary Wildlife Warden for the Jharsuguda district. ‘Doordarshan’ produced and telecast a documentary film depicting the life and works of Dr Naik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/celebrated-environmentalist-and-former-university-v-c-killed-in-odisha-101624804629304.html

The second wife approached the court after the married daughters of the deceased constable’s first wife claimed rights to the ₹50 lakh compensation as well as the pension and gratuity benefits of their father as a result of which the benefits were withheld.The court appointed a mediator to ensure that the feuding women reached a consensus and settled the matter amicably. After mediation, the second wife agreed to let the married daughters have a share in the compensation and other post-death benefits. However, the HC ordered that a part of the post-death benefits be deposited with the court till final orders. The division bench of justice S C Gupte and justice M S Karnik while hearing the petition of Rekha Khandait, the wife of deceased head constable Jayant Khandait who was attached to the traffic education department, Byculla and succumbed to Covid on May 26, 2020, was informed by advocates Rushabh Sheth and Pratibha Rupnawar, that she was the second wife of the deceased constable and had a son too.The advocates informed the court that after the death of the head constable, the police decided to process the ₹50 lakh compensation and other benefits accruing to his family. However, when Rekha applied for it, the married daughters of the deceased constable also claimed a right to the benefits like the government aid, payout from the Mumbai Police Foundation Trust as well as 7th Pay arrears, Death-cum-Retirement Gratuity, General Provident Fund, Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme Amount, Group Insurance Scheme and Leave Encashment dues.It was submitted that the second wife had a right to the benefits accruing in the name of the constable but in light of the claims by the two daughters the payouts had been withheld which was resulting in the widow being unable to take care of herself and her son.In an earlier hearing on March 25, another bench of HC after hearing the submissions had appointed advocate Rajiv Patil as a mediator and asked the disputing women to settle the matter amicably.On June 19, Patil informed the bench that the women had reached a settlement and had agreed to share the benefits accruing in the name of the deceased head constable.After hearing the terms of the settlement, the court, in its order allowed the widow to receive the pension. The compensation amounts were to be shared equitably among the three women. The court however ordered that while the two daughters would be entitled to claim half of the post-death benefits, the other half would be deposited in fixed deposits by the court which would be renewed from time to time till the case was finally decided.The bench, while allowing the second wife and daughters to apply for succession certificate, restrained the state from appointing anyone from the relatives till the matter was decided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-allows-widow-of-constable-to-get-part-of-benefits-claimed-by-daughters-101624802466773.html

Concerned with the loss of the rare archaeological site, Chirand Vikas Parishad, a group of heritage enthusiasts, wrote to the state archaeology department on Saturday and requested to take measures to prevent the erosion.“A big chunk of the archaeological site has already been eroded and devoured by the Ganga in the past few days. And during a visit to the site on Ganga Dussehra on June 21, we found that it’s under the threat again. River Ganga is swelling up and might inundate riverbanks any day,” said Sriram Tiwari, secretary of the Chirand Vikas Parishad.“We have written a letter today to the state archaeology department to take action. We are expecting some response in a few days.”Chirand site is considered rare among the archaeological sites across the country because of the rare pieces of evidence related to the growth of human civilisation there. The mound located at the site contains archaeological evidence of a step-by-step evolution of civilisation from the Neolithic age to the Pala age.“During the excavations conducted there in the 1960s, settlements and buildings of Kushan age were unearthed. However, these days, the buildings and walls are covered with thick grass and bushes. Bricks are coming out of walls while the ancient age pots, which can still be seen intact in walls, are being trampled by cattle and human beings,” Tiwari said.State archaeology director Karuna Kumari could not be contacted despite repeated efforts.Another state archaeology official, based on anonymity, said two monument attendants have been deputed at the Chirand site to take care of the maintenance work. “But they never send the status report of the site and monument,” he said.CP Sinha, former KP Jaiswal Research Institute director, said Chirand need immediate conservation works. “It’s the only site in the state where we can witness the gradual growth of civilisation consecutively. One can see there the crops cultivated by Neolithic people and the kind of huts they used to build,” he said. The site had also yielded evidence of the copper and iron age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/famous-archaeological-site-in-bihar-faces-threat-of-erosion-101624801867323.html

Recently, she has been selected as one of 40 girls to be chosen from a list of 45 countries for 100% Cricket Future Leaders Program, which enables girls to take up leadership roles in cricket.Rana’s story has been one of perseverance, belief, consistency and hard work; right from the beginning. She started working as a reporter, and became India’s second female sports editor of a TV news channel, while still under the age of 30. And in her illustrious career, she has reported from 14 countries, witnessed some of the biggest sporting moments live, and interacted with top athletes across the world. “In my life, one thing lead to another and that makes be believe more strongly in the power of my dreams and hard work,” she says, recalling the very start of her professional journey in 2000s. “In my school days, in 1999, my spiritual mentor sent me to watch the Cricket World Cup in England, which exposed me to the sport industry,” she recalls, adding how sports was never looked at as a “parameter of success” and how her journey was laden with “rejection, failures, self-doubt, heart breaks, challenges, and gender bias”. Feeling grateful to leaders, who spotted her merit, she shares how she has covered marquee sport moments such as World Cup, Olympics, Commonwealth Games and more. “My dual experience of media and management played a key role in my selection to represent India at the ICC programme. I’ve been doubted with my understanding of the game, and its boardroom functioning. I’ve also experienced the highs of breaking a big story, interviewing legends, reporting on stories that have caused a shift in power corridors of the sport ecosystem. But over the years, I realised, we must let our work do the talking,” says Rana, who is Mumbai-based, and had also covered the 26/11 terror strike for over 40 hours non-stop. And her interactions with some of the top sportspersons has come with some beautiful life learnings. Rana says she has learned “consistency and hard work from Sachin Tendulkar”, and how to be “neutral through the highs and lows from MS Dhoni”. She adds: “The best part of covering sport is having conversations with athletes, administrators beyond the camera. I learnt to never giving up on my dreams from Sania Mirza, physical and mental transformation from Virat Kohli, moving a team to chase common goal like Rohit Sharma, mental toughness from Leander Paes and so many more... In fact, my life’s first peach iced tea was with Sachin at his restaurant, where I went to interview his business partner but ended up interviewing Sachin himself!” Taking her recent selection as a “huge honour and responsibility”, Rana says, “It’s not often that you get an opportunity to represent your country at an international arena, and make it to a list where cricket’s governing body looks at the selected members as talent that has the potential to be future leaders in world cricket. As an Indian, I feel proud that I’ve an opportunity to represent our great nation along with 28 other countries. I’m a girl who had nothing to lose and looked at every constraint as a catalyst to chase my dreams more aggressively. And I always strongly believed in letting my work do the talking,” she concludes.

This is how the villagers have been operating ever since the pandemic started last year, they said.“After the Covid-19 started in March last year, the first thing we did was lock our village and there was no entry for outsiders. Secondly, if a village resident returned from other states, we quarantined him/her outside the village. Thirdly, we spread awareness among the villagers not to come in contact with any outsiders,” said sarpanch of Jaram village, Somru Ram Kawashi. Jaram was one of the fifteen villages which remain unaffected by the pandemic.The other villages which remain unaffected from the pandemic include Khuchepal, Taneli, Mullare, Kutarem, Jihakorta, Koderipal, Munga, Narenar, ChoteGadam, Pratabgiri, Kidiriras, Phursampurkhurd, Vasanpur, Jaram and Pundari.All these villagers are Maoist-affected and the population is between 300 to 1000.The district administration also took various precautions with the help of villagers since the initial days of Covid-19.“The villagers were made aware of signs and symptoms, mode of transmission of the disease and precautions to be taken during the pandemic. Also, people are made aware of the screening centre and treatment centre of Covid-19. Panchayat-wise teams are deployed to monitor and screen people for Covid-19 who come from outside the state and keep them in institutional quarantine. We ensured that the residents of these villages must get all essential items during the lockdown,” said Dantewada collector Deepak Soni.Villagers believe that information given by the district administration regarding signs and symptoms, mode of transmission of the disease and other information helped them. Also, villagers helped other people of the village to spread awareness about the Covid-19 in their local language.“In our village, with the help of others, we barred entry of outsiders and followed Covid-19 guidelines.

We are proud that our villages remained unaffected from the pandemic,” said Dilip Bhogami, resident of Pundari village.District officials said in these villages, active case surveillance is being conducted periodically and Covid-19 vaccines have been given to residents.“The district administration has made arrangement and provided local employment to the villagers in their respective villages through various government schemes like MGNREGA, self-help groups, and Shaheed Mahendra Karma Tendupatta Sangrahak Samajik Suraksha Yojana,” said Soni.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/15-villages-of-bastar-s-dantewada-remain-unaffected-from-covid19-101624798027539.html
27-06-2021||Delhi||Romance Delhi in rains, far away from the madding crowds||Monsoon is knocking at the doors of Delhi, finally! Wondering how to venture out to unwind and yet stay safe by ditching the crowded spots such as markets and malls? We suggest some lesser known historical monuments that provide the perfect serenity to soak in, as you recuperate from the second wave and try to keep anxiety at bay by being under the open sky. Pir Ghaib — the missing saint Situated right behind the Hindu Rao hospital premises is the Pir Ghaib structure and baoli. The baoli today has little water and a tunnel that was present in the area is no longer accessible. For those visiting, Joydeep Dey, from Dastan Stories to Tell, who conducts walks to heritage places, says, “The name literally means a saint who went missing. The legend of it being named Pir is because some say during medieval times it was the abode of a fakir. The other story goes that the place was a shikargah (hunting lodge) of Feroz Shah Tughlaq. It has two storeys and people say it was also used as an observatory, for some of its remains can be seen. During 1857, it was the only source of water for the British soldiers, hence in fear that the mutineers may poison it, they had a guard who’d look after the structure.” Where: Hindu Rao Hospital Complex, Civil LinesAdham Khan and a filmi linkThe tomb of Adham Khan — son of Mughal emperor Akbar’s wet nurse Maham Anga — was built after Khan was executed for a murder. Visitors may remember Khan’s character from the movie Jodhaa Akbar (2008). But the place, popular for the expansive view of Mehrauli and the Qutub Minar, is not remembered for Khan. Ramit Mitra, from DelhiByFoot Adventures, says, “Such is the tale of time, if you ask a person in Mehrauli where this tomb is, they wouldn’t know. But mention ‘bhool bhulaiya of Mehrauli’ and they will immediately point it out to you! The tomb, like most Mughal-era tombs, was raised on a platform and the space beneath it had chambers, leading from one to another. In the long passage of history, people got lost after entering those chambers or felt scared, as they grew bat and bird infested. And soon locals started calling it the ‘bhool bhulaiya’ or the labyrinth.” Where: Seth Sarai, Mehrauli Isa Khan and his tombDedicated to Isa Khan Niyazi, a minister of Sher Shah Suri in the 16th century, the mausoleum will delight history buffs. “Isa Khan’s tomb is the most exquisite of the early tombs in the city. Built of red sandstone, it has beautiful tile, plaster and stone work. There is calligraphy on the structure which speaks of Isa Khan, and the ceiling is magnificent,” says Ratish Nanda, from the Aga Khan Trust for Culture.Abu Sufiyan, from Purani Dilli Walo Ki Baatein, a cultural platform, adds, “Whenever I am in this place, I can easily imagine how splendid it would have been. The tiles even today tell of the grandeur of that time. The best part is, though it is situated inside the Humayun’s tomb complex, it is relatively desolate and allows the peace and quiet people would be seeking today.” Where: Humayun’s Tomb Complex, Nizamuddin EastFor a romantic sunset at Adilabad FortManaging to remain elusive for years with very little footfall, Adilabad Fort, built by Mohammed-bin-Tughlaq, is one of the few structures remaining of Tughlaq-era architecture. Lack of proper signage and access has kept this monument away from the limelight but it is the perfect place for a quiet evening for a view of the sunset.“Adilabad Fort regained its charm when the ASI repaired it around 2010-11. Inside the small fortress the ASI’s horticulture division has laid out lawns and gardens with extensive flower beds etc. It is an interesting place to view its gargantuan neighbour, the fort-city of Tughlaqabad. One of the prime reasons we still take people for a visit to the fort,” says Mitra.Where: Tughlakabad Institutional AreaDjinns, fairies and Feroz Shah Kotla fortSituated between the old and new cities of Delhi, Feroz Shah Kotla fort was constructed by Sultan Feroz Shah Tughlaq, as part of his capital Firozabad. But what makes this fort a must visit is the fact that people believe it is home to supernatural forces! “It is one of the few places where one can find calm in the chaos of Delhi. Many believers come here to write letters to djinns and fairies and unburden their hearts, believing their problems will be solved,” says Asif Khan Dehlvi, of Delhi Karavan. And the Ashoka pillar inside the fort forms a unique link between the Mauryan Empire of 3rd century BC, and the Delhi Sultanate of the 14th century AD. The pillar, one of the many set up by Mauryan emperor Ashoka across his realm, was found in Ambala and brought to Delhi by Tughlaq and set up in the fort. “All tourists we take to the fort, talk about the serenity of spending the evenings, watching the sun go down on the Capital and being enriched by the history that has stood the test of time,” adds Dehlvi.Where: Balmiki Basti, Vikram NagarAuthor tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/romance-delhi-in-rains-far-away-from-the-madding-crowds-101624796633641.html

Tejashwi Yadav said that Chirag can take forward Ram Vilas Paswan’s legacy if he joins the ‘existential fight’ against MS Golwalkar’s ideology. Golwalkar was a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader and its second chief.Tejashwi's comments regarding Golwalkar also come after Chirag Paswan said that the BJP’s silence is hurtful regarding the recent leadership trouble in the LJP. “The silence definitely hurts. I expected them to be a little more vocal. There are rumours that the local or state unit of BJP may be involved in this,” Chirag said while speaking to Hindustan Times during an episode of The Interview. Chirag and Tejashwi: A tale of two Bihar GenNext leadersTejashwi during the interview lashed out at the rebel LJP leaders Pashupati Kumar Paras, Prince Raj, Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Kaiser claiming that they have betrayed what Ram Vilas Paswan stood for. These leaders declared Pashupati Kumar Paras as the party’s national president and ousted Paswan from his post earlier this month. Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla has recognised the Paras-led faction as the leader of the LJP. From leadership aspirations to losing LJP, how Chirag Paswan got outmaneuveredChirag during the interview said that Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar always worked to harm the LJP. “This is a problem with the JD(U). Not just me, Nitish worked against my father as well. They have a problem with they cannot see a Dalit leadership evolving. The creation of the Dalit-Mahadalit idea is an example of that,” Chirag said.“It is obvious but maybe he is not directly involved in this but if his partymen were involved in this and he remained silent that clearly shows you are supporting them. Definitely, yes, it is Nitish Kumar and his party men who have targeted not only my party but also my family members,” Chirag further explained.Ram Vilas Paswan: A man who bridged political divisions“Ram Vilas Paswan was a socialist and a firm believer in the idea of social justice throughout his life. He fought caste supremacy, poverty and inequality during his political journey. The real tribute to him would be carrying forward his values and legacy and which is possible only when if Chirag joins this existential fight against Golwalkar’s 'bunch of thoughts',” Tejashwi was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Tejashwi also said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) abandoned its old allies after returning to power in the state as well as after 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Yadav also said that the RJD has always stood beside LJP. He recounted that in 2009 when LJP did not have a single MLA after losing the 2009 elections Lalu Prasad Yadav sent him to the Rajya Sabha from the Rashtriya Janata Dal quota. Tejashwi Yadav also announced that the RJD will celebrate Ram Vilas Paswan’s death anniversary on July 5 to commemorate his contribution to the state.Tejashwi’s decision to celebrate the late Union minister’s birth anniversary comes amid Chirag Paswan’s decision to begin Ashirwad Yatra to celebrate the birth anniversary of his late father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tejashwi-asks-chirag-to-abandon-bunch-of-thoughts-tells-him-join-opposition-101624793502556.html

They had earlier put up a banner declaring the MLA had gone “missing” from his constituency. The RJD’s leader’s statement comes close on the heels of the factional feud in the Lok Janshakti Party and ahead of RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s return to state capital in July.RJD’s ally Congress said Tejashwi’s statement “carried weight”. “The leader of the opposition’s claim carries weight. NDA leaders are in touch with us as they are not pleased with the government,” party leader Kuntal Krishna said.However, the ruling Janata Dal –United (JD-U) dismissed Yadav’s claim. “No power in the world can bring down Nitish Kumar’s government for five years. If Tejashwi Yadav is claiming to be in touch with some JD-U MLAs, then many RJD MLAs are in touch with us. But, at this time we will not say anything more than this because politics is also considered a game of possibilities,” said JD-U MLC Upendra Kushwaha. The JD (U) had earlier claimed that Congress MLAs in the state are ready to defect. BJP leader and spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel suggested that Tejashwi first needed to sort out questions over his own leadership. “Yadav has nothing to do with the people of Bihar or the people of his own area. The people of the area had even put up a poster of the missing MLA. When people needed them, they did not go... and now they have come. They are dreaming that the government is going to fall in two to three months. But his dream will remain a dream,” said Patel.Yadav has been targeting the state government recently over the discrepancies in Bihar teachers’ recruitment examination result and claimed that it was a result of Nitish Kumar promoting corrupt officials. “No work can be done in Bihar without a scam. There is corruption in all departments including health, education, road construction,” he said, while commenting on the incident, where a young man was allegedly given an empty injection in the name of a Covid-19 vaccine jab in Chapra. BJP MP and former Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi said, “Tejashwi Yadav has made his political intentions clear with his statement against taking the anti-coronavirus vaccine. In fact, the political agenda of Rahul Gandhi’s disciple Tejashwi Yadav and other opposition parties is to prove that the vaccination campaign is a failure. It is [done] only to defame the government.” Though Yadav’s statement has set the political scene abuzz, political experts do not give it much importance. “This is true that he did not visit his constituency after the elections and the people there are particularly angry with him and have started showing their displeasure. Yadav might have said these things to soothe their anger,” said Gyanandera Yadav, an associate professor and head of the sociology department at College of Commerce in Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-to-fall-in-2-3-months-claims-tejashwi-yadav-nda-rejects-theory-101624784225366.html

27-06-2021||Delhi||More delay in Covid vaccine 'Sputnik V' roll-out in Delhi-NCR||The roll-out of Russian Covid-19 vaccine 'Sputnik V' at various private hospitals in the Delhi-NCR region has been delayed again, officials said on Sunday."We do not have a clarity on the dates of the vaccine roll-out," a spokesman of Apollo Hospitals said.Indraprastha Apollo here had earlier said that it would tentatively start administering the two-dose vaccine by June 25.An official of Madhukar Rainbow Children's Hospital said the facility has also not received Sputnik V doses so far from Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy's Laboratories, the marketing partner for the vaccine in the country. "There is a delay on the part of the suppliers. They have not shared any specific reason for it. I think it could be related to the supply of both the doses together," he said.Sputnik V uses two different viruses that cause the common cold (adenovirus) in humans. The two doses, given 21 days apart, are different and not interchangeable.Fortis Healthcare, which had said that it would make Sputnik V available at its Gurgaon and Mohali hospitals, has also not started administering the Russian vaccine to people so far.The Centre has fixed the price of the vaccine at ₹1,145 per dose. The maximum price of Covishield for private COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) has been fixed at RS 780 per dose, while that of Covaxin at ₹1,410 per dose.Russia's Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology has developed the vaccine and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) is marketing it globally.Dr Reddy's Laboratories has been importing the shots from Russia. Over a period of time, the vaccine is also going to be manufactured in India. According to Gamaleya and the RDIF, Sputnik V has demonstrated an efficacy rate of 92 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/more-delay-in-covid-vaccine-sputnik-v-roll-out-in-delhincr-101624778958810.html
27-06-2021||Patna||Bihar forms 4 panels to improve health of beleaguered higher education||The Bihar state higher education council (BSHEC) has constituted four different committees comprising vice chancellors and experts to undertake sweeping reforms in state’s beleaguered higher education. A decision to this effect was taken following a meeting of the SHEC, chaired by education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary, officials said.The first of the four, academic reforms committee, comprising vice chancellors (VCs) of the Central University of South Bihar (CUSB), Patna University, director higher education, Patna Women’s College principal, state project officer and an expert, will provide academic inputs to the education council for preparation of the state higher education plan by reviewing the curriculum.Besides, it will also suggest academic reforms, viz. implementation of semester system, choice-based credit system etc. The semester system, started at the post-graduation level in Bihar, remains half-baked, while at the under-graduate level it is still a non-starter despite several attempts. The committee will also give inputs for mainstreaming of vocational education, which is suffering due to lack of facilities and quality faculty support.The second committee will aim to find ways to boost accreditation of state institutions, assessed under the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) norms. Bihar has barely 100 colleges out of 250 constituent units that are accredited with most of them in B or C grade. None of the state universities managed A grade, which could be won by only seven colleges. There are only seven colleges in the A grade. Under the new education policy, NAAC accreditation is a basic requirement, linked to funding. Several state institutions have slipped further in new rankings due to the stringent NAAC norms. For example, a NAAC report released earlier this year said Patna’s BN College slipped to C grade from B++ due to “many of the faculty members being actively engaged in political activities of the state that affects the academic work of the college”.The third committee will focus on stimulating the academic environment and developing a database of all the universities and colleges on quality parameters to identify gaps, and work for their removal by adopting best practices shared by national and international experts. The fourth committee will prepare the roadmap and action plan for implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) – 2020.With an aim to improve the gross enrolment ratio (GER) and quality in higher education centres, the BSHEC was constituted as a basic requirement under the national higher education mission (Rashtriya Uchchatara Shiksha Abhiyan or RUSA). The BSHEC has been given the responsibility of suggesting a roadmap for implementation of the new education policy (NEP) in the higher education sphere.Social analyst and former head of department of economics, Patna University, professor NK Choudhary said that adhocism at the top was at the core of all the problems. “Putting the right people in the leadership role will solve a lot of problems, which unfortunately is not happening. Higher education needs vision and continuity. Hopefully, this will also be addressed. The large-scale vacancies in the universities and colleges also need to be filled at the earliest,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-forms-4-panels-to-improve-health-of-beleaguered-higher-education-101624777024784.html
27-06-2021||Jaipur||Religious places marriage halls to reopen, market timings extended in Rajasthan||The Rajasthan government on Saturday gave further relaxations from restrictions imposed to curb the second wave of coronavirus in the state by extending hours of operation for markets and allowing marriage ceremonies and reopening of religious places with restrictions. Public transport and movement of private vehicles have also been given the green signal with certain conditions in the new guidelines called Unlock 3.0, which will be effective from June 28. Markets or commercial establishments such as gyms and restaurants, where at least 60% of the workforce has received at least the first dose of coronavirus vaccine, will be allowed to stay open for additional 3 hours till 7 pm. Marriage ceremonies will be allowed in banquet halls from July 1 with presence of no more than 40 guests but the ban on taking out marriage processions, holding feasts and disc jockeys will continue as per the guidelines. The government offices will now be allowed to open till 6 pm, while business establishments, where employees have been vaccinated, can remain open till 7 pm. Full physical attendance will be allowed in government offices with less than 25 staff members and 50% for the rest. In offices, where 60% of the personnel have received the first dose of the vaccine, 100% staff will be allowed to attend to work physically. The office hours will be from 9:30 am to 6 pm. The guidelines have also allowed the operation of city/mini buses if the driver and conductor have got at least the first dose of the vaccine. Similarly, private vehicles will be allowed to ply from 5 am to 8 pm except for Sundays. Public parks will also be open to all from 5 am to 8 am. Night curfew in the state will be in effect from 8 pm to 5 am on weekdays and on the weekend, it will begin on Saturday 8 pm and end at 5 am on Monday.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that vaccination was the only effective way to prevent coronavirus but reminded people of the experts’ view that threat from the new variants of the virus remained. He therefore advised adherence to the Covid containment protocols such as wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing to protect against the possible third wave of the disease. Rajasthan recorded five more coronavirus deaths and 141 fresh cases on Saturday, taking the total number of fatalities and infections in the state to 8,910 and 951,967, respectively.

27-06-2021||Lucknow||This Bareilly man gave dignity to the departed in second wave of Covid-19||He gave dignity to the dead when there was despondency all around during the second wave of Covid-19 and many people could not even say a final goodbye to their loved ones.Mohammed Ghizaal Siddiqui battled the pandemic situation in his own way while doctors, paramedical staff and other frontline workers also did so with firm determination.Siddiqui, a general merchant who is in his late fifties and hails from Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly district, says he performed around 385 burials and cremations during the Islamic holy month of Ramzan, which started on April 13, coinciding with the peak of the Covid second wave.He is perhaps the only person in UP to have performed the last rites of such a large number of people in the second wave.The task of giving dignity to the departed, especially unclaimed bodies is not new to Siddiqui, who says he has been doing it for the last 38 years.But the number of bodies he had to lay to rest during the second wave made the pandemic experience much grimmer for him.“In the last 38 years, I have handled more than 7000 unclaimed dead bodies, including the ones whose family members couldn’t afford giving the last rites to their loved ones, but this situation was different. In a mere 30 days during Ramzan, I gave burials to around 345 bodies and performed the cremation of around 40. I would pray to Allah to not to make me see this horrific phase again in my life,” says Siddiqui as he goes through the records of the bodies at his office in the Quila locality of Bareilly.Initially, he says, he never thought that he would have to lend a helping hand to the families of the Covid-19 patients. “But when I saw people in such a helpless state that they couldn’t perform the last rites of their loved ones, I thought if not me, then who else would (do it) and I decided to lend a helping hand to the family members of Covid patients,” he says.Siddiqui also says the peak 30 days starting from April 12 are still fresh in his memory when he used to get around 20 to 30 calls for assistance daily and about 10-12 of the callers sought help for performing the last rites of their loved ones.“There were situations when all the family members were in isolation or hospitalized. In some situations, all members of the family were dead. In a majority of the instances, no family member turned up to perform the last rites,” says Siddiqui.In particular, one instance from Shahmatganj locality of Bareilly moved Siddiqui to the core. He received a distress call from two Muslim sisters, asking for help in performing the last rites of their father and brother who passed away due to Covid-19. “Their mother was hospitalised and the father and the brother were dead. There was no one to attend the bodies. I then attended the bodies and gave them a decent burial,” he recalls.He says he is thankful to his wife Sufiya and his children for supporting him throughout.“During the initial days of service to the patients who died due to Covid, I called my wife and said I did not want to risk their (family’s) lives, hence I would be residing in isolation at another house of ours for a few days. But my wife’s reply moved me. She said: nothing could harm us since you are serving humanity. Please come and stay with us, we will take all precautions to keep us all safe,” he recalled.Sufiya Ghizaal, Siddiqui’s wife, says she made sure that the clothes were handled carefully and washed thoroughly in hot water.“In that entire phase, we also made sure that we took proper steam (inhalation), wore mask and followed other precautionary measures,” she adds.She also says this phase was terrifying for her as well even though she had been seeing her husband attending unclaimed bodies for the past three decades.Siddiqui also thanked the people of Bareilly who helped him from behind the scenes in bearing all the expenses of his noble work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/this-bareilly-man-gave-dignity-to-the-departed-in-second-wave-of-covid19-101624742581786.html

27-06-2021||Lucknow||UP district panchayat chiefs’ polls: Nomination day reveals shifting political loyalties||The nomination day scenes for the zila panchayat chairpersons’ elections on Saturday revealed interesting insights — from missing candidates or proposers to unopposed nomination, from rebels to political loyalties that shifted by the hour. The election is scheduled on July 3.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may have the upper hand by getting maximum zila panchayat chairpersons elected, many of them “unopposed” in key districts like Gorakhpur and Varanasi.On the other hand, the opposition Samajwadi Party (SP) complained that its candidates were prevented from filing nominations. The BJP had fallen behind the Samajwadi Party in the first round of the rural panchayat polls held in April for ward members. It appeared to be looking to make amends now in the zila panchayat chairpersons’ polls where many independents went with the ruling party. Senior ministers and BJP functionaries remained present for the nomination even as SP too got its senior leaders like Ram Govind Chaudhary to be there.Amid allegations of foul play in at least 12 districts, the SP candidates “failed” to show up for nomination or their proposers went ‘missing.’ At several of these places, the BJP workers had an altercation with Opposition members, mostly SP, who, political observers said, had dominated the opposition space in the run-up to the 2022 UP assembly polls. Dismissing allegations of foul play, UP BJP spokesman Manish Shukla said, “The Samajwadi Party couldn’t even find candidates in nearly 25 places. The BJP is of course set for a big win as SP’s claims lie hollow.”The SP expelled its chiefs in 11 districts after the nomination period and several BJP leaders were seen sharing the expulsion letter of the party that they claimed was proof of the SP not being able to even keep its candidates together.These polls also showcased possible allies for assembly elections.“So, while SP-RLD combination looked set to continue its alliance for the 2022 UP polls, and BJP and Apna Dal’s alliance too looks firm, Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party’s (SBSP) chief and former UP minister Om Prakash Rajbhar’s backing of the Samajwadi Party is an interesting development because SBSP is planning to set up a front of small parties against the BJP,” said Irshad Ilmi, a veteran journalist and political observer. The BJP that left two seats for its ally Apna Dal (Sonelal), didn’t contest Etawah, the SP bastion. The BSP didn’t file nomination even in seats like Moradabad where 11 zila panchayat ward members backed by it had won in the first round of the rural polls, said locals. “Even in Ghaziabad, where also several ward members backed by BSP had won, the party didn’t file nominations for the zila panchayat chairpersons’ poll,” a local politician claimed. In Banda, the BSP’s nomination was reportedly cancelled, claimed locals. In Baghpat, the RLD candidate switched sides to the BJP and then came back to the RLD fold in a few hours of political drama. In Unnao, the BJP candidate Shakun Singh was up against not just the SP candidate, but also against party rebel Arun Singh who filed his nomination as an independent.Relatives of some party lawmakers accompanied him for the nomination, making it clear that the sudden withdrawal of his candidature by the BJP and his replacement with wife of a slain lawmaker hadn’t gone down well with Arun Singh, a zila panchayat ward member considered close to the family of four-time former MLA Kuldeep Sengar, who has been expelled from BJP and disqualified from the assembly after his conviction in a rape case. The rape survivor’s appeal against his nomination had forced the BJP to effect the last-minute change, party leaders said. In Hathras, the BJP fielded Seema Upadhyaya, the wife of former BSP minister Ramvir Upadhaya. In Kanpur, the party chose Swapnil Varun, the daughter of Kamal Rani Varun who was a minister in the Yogi Adityanath government and had died of Covid-19 last year. Swapnil had recently met chief minister Yogi Adityanath after which it was clear that she was being considered.In Amroha, the party fielded former MP Kanwar Singh Tanwar’s son Lalit Tanwar who is set to be elected unopposed after the cancellation of SP nominee Shakeena Begum’s nomination on technical grounds. In Chitrakoot, BJP candidate Ashok Jatav was likely to be elected unopposed as no candidate filed nomination.Samajwadi Party leader Sachin Yadav, son of former UP minister Narendra Singh Yadav, joined the BJP in Farrukhabad from where BJP decided to back Sachin’s sister Monica Yadav, ex-wife of SP leader Dharmendra Yadav, as an independent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-district-panchayat-chiefs-polls-nomination-day-reveals-shifting-political-loyalties-101624741501672.html

On completion of the survey, the details will be digitised and smart cards, having complete family details, will be provided to the nomads. The smart cards will help extend a range of facilities to the tribal migratory population,” said Choudhary.It was informed that based on the survey, a range of different facilities will be provided by the department which include transit facilities , livestock services, healthcare, education, livelihood initiatives, essential services and infrastructure. The plan also includes capacity building of the nomadic population.Choudhry said, “This survey will cover intra-district, inter-district, inter-province and inter-UT/ state. A list of 14 major migratory routes was discussed in a recent meeting and district teams were asked to minutely work on the migratory routes and suggest facilities required for the population. The department is also coordinating with districts in Ladakh, Punjab and Himachal for information on inter-state/UT migration.”He said during the survey, the officials will conduct a host of studies on tribal culture, art, languages, traditional practices, livelihood measures, education and socio-economic conditions. The survey is likely to be completed by July 31, 2021, and the tribal affairs department has earmarked a budget of ₹3 crore for the survey.Founder, tribal research and cultural foundation, Javeed Rahi termed it a good step, however, he said he has doubts that the survey will be over by July 31. “It’s not so easy to conduct the survey when most of the tribals are up in the mountains.”Rahi, who has worked with the tribals, said that as per the 2011 census, the population of tribals in J&K was around 20 lakh. “At least 30% of them go for full or semi-migration. Some even go for one month. In general, this is a good step that needs to be appreciated and the department should involve all the stakeholders to complete survey.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jk-plans-first-survey-of-nomadic-population-101624740902320.html

He said during the all-party meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the parties – NC, Peoples Democratic Party and Communist Party of India (M) – which are part of Peoples’ Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) talked about the agenda of the alliance before Modi.“We didn’t talk about anything that was outside the agenda of the Gupkar Alliance. The alliance said that we don’t accept changes of August 5, 2019 and whatever needs to be done to undo that, we will do that constitutionally, politically legally and peacefully,” said Omar.Leaders from BJP, Congress, J&K Apni Party and People’s Conference also participated in the meeting – the first political outreach since BJP government’s abrogation of the special status of J&K under Article 370 on August 5, 2019 and the splitting of the region into two union territories – J&K and Ladakh.As the centre brought changes in J&K, it restricted people in J&K to their homes by imposing curfew and snapping communication channels to prevent large scale protests against the move. All the mainstream political leaders including the Abdullahs and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti were put under detention for months.Following the decisions, a bunch of petitions are pending before the Supreme Court against the effective abrogation of Article 370.“I don’t believe that just because the issue (of revocation of Article 370) is sub-judice or it is before the Supreme Court that it is not a subject for discussion. Unfortunately, these words (not to discuss because it was sub-judice) were taken by two people – (Congress leader) Ghulam Nabi Azad and (former PDP leader) Muzaffar Beig – during the meeting,” he said.“Of course it is subject for discussion. It was talked about in our DDC polls. We will continue to agitate the matter legally, constitutionally and peacefully. That is our right and we will exercise that right,” he said.Omar said that even though so many matters are before the Supreme Court, does that mean we stop talking over them.“For the longest time Babri Masjid demolition was in front of the Supreme Court, did BJP stop talking about it. They continued to press their agenda on Ram Temple and therefore even if the matter (of Article 370) is before the Supreme Court that does not stop us from stating our point of view and we will continue to do that,” he said.“In plain words, Farooq Abdullah as well as Mehbooba Mufti told the prime minister that BJP took 70 years to fulfill their agenda of revoking Article 370. And if we took 70 weeks or 70 months or whatever time to reverse that we will not back down from that mission. We told the prime minister and he was listening,” he said.Omar said that they won’t deceive people by telling them that they will get it reversed during this government. “If we said that we will get a reversal of August-5 decisions from Modi, that would be deceiving people. Those who took it away, shall we tell people that we will get it back from them,” he said.“But before the speech of the prime minister, (Congress leader) Ghulam Nabi Azad saab talked on our behalf. He told the meeting that we don’t accept this timeline of delimitation first, then elections and then statehood. We accept statehood after delimitation and then elections. Return statehood if elections are to be held,” he said.He said that the NC has authorised Dr Farooq Abdullah to take a view on the delimitation commission as and when necessary. “There has been no fresh approach from the commission to the party. And when it makes an approach, Dr Farooq Saab has been authorized to take a view,” he said.Farooq on plebisciteFarooq Abdullah said, “I made it very clear (in the meeting) that the first prime minister of India (Jawharlal Nehru) promised us a plebiscite but went back on it. Before (1996) elections, Narasimha Raoji promised us autonomy. He said ‘sky is the limit but not independence’. We said we have never asked for independence, we have asked for autonomy. He promised us on the floor of the house. Where is that?I said frankly there is a level of mistrust and that mistrust has to be removed. How you remove it, you have to take that call. That is why even Dr Karan Singh today has said that statehood must be brought forward. So let’s not jump and see what they do. How do they remove that mistrust or will they continue that mistrust.”Ball in Centre’s court now, says J&K Congress president Mir post post PM’s APM 
27-06-2021||Lucknow||President Ram Nath Kovind for giving impetus to technical education||Looking to give an impetus to technical education, President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday assured cooperation and even central government assistance to a number of ideas and proposals mooted by the vice chancellors of Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University (CSJMU) and the Harcourt Butler Technical University (HBTU) and IIT-Kanpur director during his one-on-one meetings with these academicians. Both CSJMU and HBTU are in Kanpur.CSJMU vice-chancellor Prof Vinay Kumar Pathak claimed that he had proposed to the President to set up an ancient science and technology centre of excellence on the campus to help modern students to understand the richness of ancient Indian science and technology.“President Kovind agreed to help us from the Centre and also from the state… The President also said Kanpur University should grow by leaps and bounds and he is there to help us take varsity to new heights,” said Prof Pathak, adding that he was congratulated by the President on being appointed vice chancellor in April this year.In his discussion, President Kovind told Prof Pathak that he, too, is an alumnus of CSJMU Kanpur and had also contributed ₹1 lakh last year, like many other old pupils. He said the alumni should come forward to help their alma mater in whatever way they could to take the institution to new heights.Prof Samsher, vice chancellor of HBTU, said that he proposed central university status for HBTU, which would celebrate its centenary this November.“HBTU centenary celebrations will be held on November 25 and I have invited him to grace the occasion as the chief guest. President Kovind received the letter of invitation and asked me to get in touch with his office for the formalities,” said Prof Samsher.HBTU vice chancellor said he briefed the President about the progress of the institution and how it had contributed to technical education in the state.“It was here I seized the opportunity to invite President to be our guest during the centenary celebrations and requested him to help in granting central university status to the institute during the big occasion,” he said.Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur director Prof Abhay Karandikar, after meeting the President, tweeted, “Briefed him about upcoming School of Medical Research and Technology. He showed keen interest in the project and wished good luck.”He further tweeted, “Discussed various innovations that IIT Kanpur has done recently.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/president-kovind-for-giving-impetus-to-technical-education-101624740301708.html

Addressing mediapersons here after returning from Delhi, Raina said, “After abrogation of Article 370, both PM and Home Minister have amply clarified that full statehood will be restored when the situation normalises in Jammu and Kashmir. As far as Kashmiri leaders are concerned, if they are dreaming of restoration of Article 370, which gave birth to separatism, terrorism and Pakistan’s evil designs in J&K and which was responsible for killing of hundreds of innocents, it is next to impossible. Till doomsday it (Article 370) will not be restored”. In a clear reference to Kashmir-centric parties and mainstream Kashmiri leaders, Raina said “registered political parties should forget about it (Article 370) and contest elections in right earnest for the welfare of the people of J&K”. To another query, he said, “there was a political deadlock in J&K for the past over two years. PM’s initiative has ended this deadlock and he has said that we need strong J&K and strong India. Therefore, it is a clear message to all that we all have to work for the welfare of the people of J&K”. Besdies Raina, former deputy chief ministers, Nirmal Singh and Kavinder Gupta also attended the June 24 all-party meeting. He also clarified that Ladakh was now a separate UT with separate LG and that was the truth. Asked about the statement of senior Congress leader P Chidambaram that the Centre wants to hold assembly elections before restoring the statehood to J&K, Raina said, “He was not in the meeting but there are some leaders in the Congress who are making anti-national statements. They should stop making anti-national statements.” He also claimed that during the all-party meeting, the J&K BJP demanded de-freezing of some of the seats reserved for PoJK areas in the J&K Assembly. “We are separately raising this issue with delimitation commission chairperson Justice (retd) RP Desai shortly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/article-370-won-t-return-till-doomsday-raina-101624739941828.html

Advisor to Lieutenant Governor Baseer Ahmad Khan directed the officers to evolve a mechanism to intensify vaccination and cover the maximum number of people, particularly in Srinagar and Kupwara districts.“Accelerate awareness programmes in areas which are registering low vaccination. Teams should be specifically constituted to educate the people about the benefits of vaccination and for clearing doubts due to rumour mongering,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-342-new-cases-j-k-reports-lowest-daily-count-in-3-months-101624739462153.html

Khursheed, who had got married in his late 40s, is a victim of the forces’ torture. He had turned sterile after he was brutalised at a torture centre in Srinagar during an interrogation in 2002. He is among thousands of Kashmiris left disabled post the torture by forces as well as militants. Lost eye sight, dislocated joints, fractures, stomach ailments, nephrological problems, impotency and sexual problems, internal organ injury, cardiac problems, hypertension, urinary incontinence, complete/partial paralysis, amputations, deformity, nerve damage are some of the impacts on the health of 1,200 torture survivors from four districts of Kashmir, a study carried out by the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS) found. The report endorsed by former UN special rapporteur Juan E Mendez says “torture emerges as part of a routine (which is) intrinsic to the very existence of the Indian State in Kashmir.” Among hundreds of case studies that it mentions, is Mohammad Syed of Maisuma in Srinagar. Twenty-four-year-old Syed was arrested in the 1990s for the first time and taken to an interrogation centre in Jammu, where he was kept for two-and-a-half months. This was followed by detention in Kathua Jail and then in Nainital Jail, Allahabad, where he was detained for 14 months before being finally brought to Satwari interrogation centre in Jammu. Syed has said that interrogators there would “beat them with anything they could find”. He adds that he is “unaware as to what hit him in the eye due to which he lost complete vision in his left eye”. Syed has had six surgeries already, but infection spread to his other eye as well, leaving the carpet-weaver completely blind. He now depends on donations for survival. The victims revealed to JKCCS that torture of Kashmiri prisoners was not limited to physical beating only. Many victims have spoken about Srinagar’s infamous interrogation centre PAPA 2, where over 350 inmates were provided a single bathroom where they were allowed to go only once in 24 hours. The report includes accounts of people who said they would take medications “to induce constipation.” Silence and the endless pursuit for helpAmong 432 cases that JKCCS followed, only 27 had reached out to the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) for help. This means not even 7% of torture victims muster courage to ask for justice in Kashmir. Among them, just 20 people had got any recommendations of help from SHRC. Among those who got recommendations, most haven not been endorsed by the government. In 2017, as per JKCCS, 75% of these recommendations were rejected by the then state government. Khurram Parvez, a human rights activist based in Kashmir, says India has “institutionalised” torture in Kashmir. “India signed the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UNCAT) in 1987. It has been 34 years, but it has still not ratified that convention,” he said, adding that India is among only four of 81 signatories to the convention to not ratify it. Other three include Brunei, Haiti, and Sudan. In 2010, the Lok Sabha had passed the Prevention of Torture Bill but till date, there has been no nod to it. Khurram adds that not passing such a bill reflects “Indian government’s commitment to torture.” He adds that while parts in India have witnessed police brutality and torture at different instances, in Kashmir “torture is a never-ending process.” Calling torture is an “institutional tool of Indian government” for state oppression, he says that not even once has Indian government made any effort to rehabilitate all these torture survivors. Parvez adds that inaction towards torture in a community increases the acceptability of violence among its people. On legality of torture, Parvez says there is no law in India which allows torture. “But what allows perpetration of it at grassroots level is the absence of any law to criminalise it,” he adds. He suggests that ratifying UN convention by criminalising torture would be a step towards preventing more persecution. “This should be done by bringing a law in the Parliament as well as in legislative assemblies across India,” he says, adding that recurring income and health support to disabled torture victims should be also provided, besides holding the torture criminals guilty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-wounds-that-never-heal-kashmir-s-torture-victims-struggle-for-a-normal-life-101624739221540.html

In its two-day meet, which concluded in Dharamshala on Saturday, the BJP working group, an extended core group of top leaders, mulled over strengthen the party structure at the grassroots level.BJP’s chief spokesperson Randhir Sharma said first of all, the party is geared up for byelections to Mandi Lok Sabha and the assembly segments of Fatehpur and Jubbal-Kotkhai, which may be announced anytime soon.“The party has already deputed incharges and co-incharges for these segments and they have toured the areas and met the local leaders,” said Sharma.As per the report submitted by them, the atmosphere is favourable towards BJP and the party will win all three byelections, he added.He said on the organisational front, the party had decided to conduct training of party office-bearers and workers in July, August and September.These trainings will be organised virtually at state, district and block-level and then at the village level.First of all, the state working committee will hold a meeting virtually on June 30. Then meetings of district working committees will be held from July 1 to 15 and block working committees from July 16 to 30, said Sharma.One important decision taken by the party, Sharma said, is to organise conferences of elected representatives of Panchayati Raj Institution and Urban Local Bodies.“In these conferences, titled as “Panch Parmeshwar Sammelan”, the elected representatives will be apprised of the party as well as government programmes so that they participate in the development process more actively,” said Sharma.He said a meeting of party media in-charges and spokespersons will be held in July.“The government will be completing four years in power in December and the party has decided to launch a massive public outreach programme to publicise the achievements of state and central government among the masses on the occasion,” he said.Police probing incident involving Dharamshala MLAReplying to a query, Sharma said police were investigating the incident involving Dharamshala legislator Vishal Nehria, whose wife has accused him of physical and mental torture.“It will be too early to say anything.

As per the latest directions, all essential and non-essential shops can remain open during the curfew relaxation period from 5am to 7.30pm. With the curfew being gradually relaxed across the district, traders and restaurateurs had been lobbying for easing of the Sunday lockdown as a bulk of their sale usually takes place on Sunday. Wholesale traders had been one of the worst affected sectors due to the Sunday restrictions as customers from different districts and states would only visit the wholesale markets in the old city areas such as Chaura Bazar, Akalgarh Market, and AC Market on Sunday. Special markets used to be put up in the areas in anticipation of the Sunday rush in the pre-Covid era. Chaura Bazar shopkeepers’ association general secretary Gurcharan Singh Chann said, “This is a major relief for traders as 30-35% business takes place on Sunday in wholesale markets. However, business is unlikely to pick up pace immediately as our clients have also suffered financial setbacks during the lockdown.” Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal general secretary Sunil Mehra said while the announcement will help businesses to inch towards normalcy, a relief package should also be announced for traders who have suffered significant losses.” Earlier this week, representatives of the Beopar Mandal had threatened to raise a stir unless Sunday restrictions were lifted. Representatives of the Hotel and Restaurant Association said the decision will certainly improve businesses, but things will not come back on track until bars are allowed to open. The association’s president Amarvir Singh said, “There will be 40 to 50% increase in restaurants’ footfall due to this decision.” The weekend lockdown had come into force on April 26. However, night curfew from 8pm to 5am is still in place in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/traders-restaurateurs-rejoice-as-sunday-lockdown-lifted-in-ludhiana-101624738141248.html

Energy minister Shrikant Sharma, chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari, additional chief secretary (energy) Alok Sinha, additional chief secretary (finance) Radha Chauhan, chairman M Devraj and managing director Pankaj Kumar were among those present in the meeting. The CM, according to an official who attended the meeting, directed the officials to find ways to pull UPPCL out of the immediate financial crisis, but at the same time he also asked the UPPCL to increase its income by plugging in leakages and improving billing efficiency.In a detailed presentation made to the CM, the energy department officials pointed out that UPPCL’s cumulative deficit stood at ₹90,500 crore which included ₹81,612.07 crore debt liabilities and ₹24,461 crore power purchase liabilities. The corporation, it was told, also had to pay ₹3,000 crore to the coal companies.“The UPPCL needs an immediate financial assistance of ₹12,000 from the government to have cash flow,” it was said in the presentation.The officials sought the CM’s help for payment of ₹9,847 power dues pending against various government departments. It was told that the urban development department alone had bills worth ₹4808 crore pending against it.The officials requested the CM that the remaining amount of ₹2,850 crore in the ₹14,500 crore budget sanctioned to the energy department for 2021-22 be released. The UPPCL said that it would require additional government funds of ₹20,681 crore because power tariff, as directed by the government, was not increased this year.UPPCL also enumerated its achievements to the chief minister in the presentation. The corporation, the officials said, met the highest power demand for 23,867 MW on September 16, 2020 against the previous highest demand for 16,110 MW recorded on March 31, 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uppcl-seeks-immediate-assistance-of-12-000-cr-from-yogi-adityanath-govt-101624738082813.html

Fearing arrest, Sidhana moved Delhi’s Tis Hazari court seeking anticipatory bail in the case, with his counsel asserting that he has no role to play in the incident. Additional sessions judge Neelofer Abida Perveen posted the matter for July 3 and directed the police to not arrest him until then. This came after police sought more time to make submissions on his pre-arrest bail plea. Sidhana had earlier denied involvement in the Republic Day violence.

It was strengthened later.Phul village was established by the warrior that paved way for the expansion of Phulkian rule in the modern states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh is a scion of the Phulkian misl lineage. His forefather Baba Ala Singh, who established the Patiala principality, was Phul’s grandson.Assistant professor of history at Government Rajindra College in Bathinda Kulwinder Kaur said descendants of Sikh warrior Baba Phul later established the erstwhile princely states of Patiala, Jind and Nabha.“Phulkian misl had a huge significance in the Sikh history. The dynasty ruled Malwa belt for centuries,” she said.Director of the department of cultural affairs, archaeology and museums Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar said conservation work has been allotted to protect the heritage site. She said offices of the block development and panchayat officer (BDPO) and water supply in the fort will be relocated.According to the chief engineer of the state archaeology department Yogesh Gupta, ₹7 crore would be spent for the restoration work.A spot visit on Saturday speaks volumes of neglect of the heritage site by the state archaeology department. Of the four bastions, two have vanished and most part of the structure has crumbled.The fort is surrounded by about 20 shops rented by the Rampura municipal council and a sizeable portion of the fort area has been encroached upon by residents.Official sources said there is no plan to declare it a protected monument as it will require a strict implementation of rules of removing encroachments and prior approval of the local body for any kind of construction in the vicinity of the fort.As the state agencies failed to take up any restoration work, a group of local youth formed the Phulkian Riyasat Society in 2018 to conserve the crumbled building. They spent ₹16 lakh on the facelift. However, the volunteers erred and a part of the fort lost its vintage value.Society president Hussan Sharma said urinal pots were installed on the main gate and the fort was used as a garbage dump site.“Aghast over the gross neglect, we used cement, concrete and painted few parts of the fort. When a top Bathinda district official in 2018 sensitised us against the use of any modern construction material, we stopped all activities. Later, with the support of the local Congress legislator and revenue minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar, restoration work has started,” said Sharma.Volunteers said the BDPO office should be converted into a museum and archived information about the clan should be displayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/neglected-for-years-rs-7-cr-facelift-to-revive-historic-phul-fort-s-glory-101624737963762.html
27-06-2021||Pune||Startup mantra: Jeevtronics’ product is critical care intervention for masses||It’s a “cranks and batteries” startup that at the core is leveraging a desperate need in rural India to deliver solutions that will “light up” the country with “life”. The macro view has a social hue that colours the endeavour with deep sense of service to those not yet in the power zone of tech innovation.Cue Denmark’s midfielder Christian Eriksen collapsing in the stadium while playing a Euro 2020 game with Finland. He has suffered a cardiac arrest when he received urgent medical attention, including CPR, and was awake within 20 minutes as he left the stadium on a stretcher.Eriksen was indeed fortunate to have his teammates and medical team “fully aware and equipped” about medical treatment needed in such conditions.If Eriksen was doing a kickabout in rural India, it’s likely he would not have survived; unless of course, Jeevtronics’ ‘SanMitra 1000 HCT’ was at hand.Jeevtronics, a cardiac innovation-based company from Pune, has designed a novel hand-cranked defibrillator that will deliver a bi-phasic shock to the heart with less than 15 seconds of cranking. It’s the flagship product from an innovation assembly line that has also cranked out, what the founder claims, is the “Only solar lamp company whose product has been in operations for four years without a battery change - the world’s longest-lasting solar-powered home lamps.”That is Ashish Gawade, who along with, Aniruddha Atre, are the Pune entrepreneurs with the “US exposure” (see graphic), that are behind Jeevtronics.The two defining phrases the duo like to drop when speaking about themselves are: “technological innovation” and “bottom of pyramid”.Getting one to reach the other is what the Jeevtronics journey has been about.In the beginning…Inspired by Swami Vijnananand at the Manashakti Centre, Gawade decided to do something for the underprivileged population in India. He returned to India from the US in 2006, and started working for Cummins India. While on the job, he figured out major problems in the rural areas of the country, including regions adjacent to major cities like Pune and Mumbai. In 2008, Gawade and Atre decided to foray into entrepreneurship. Atre stayed back in the US and provided technical support for products to be launched. He returned to India in 2010.Says Gawade, “Our social enterprise is called, “Bottom of Pyramid Energy and Environmental Innovations”. We had planned to work in areas of rural electrification in an environmentally friendly manner and our first initiative was to provide a green low-cost power source for “un-electrified” or “under-electrified” homes. We had developed a human-powered pedal generator named “Chakra”. When solar lamps were introduced, demand for our product contracted. We then decided to launch our own “Prakhar” lamps and other devices which could be powered by both, solar and human power.” Cue the longest longest-lasting solar-powered home lamps quote.Enter the defibrillatorWhile working on the solar powered lamps, Gawade and Atre realised that there are other problems faced by the rural population due to a lack of electricity or irregular power supply. Enter the life-saving defibrillator.As per the Jeevtronics early research, a defibrillator is a critical instrument in ICUs and ambulances.A patient can be saved if the shock is delivered within 10 minutes of the cardiac attack.Considering the short span of this life-saving window, defibrillators should ideally be available in ambulances, primary health care centres and other small hospitals in rural and urban regions of our country.Atre said, “In India, these devices are majorly imported, and many small nursing homes use refurbished devices to meet the regulation requirements. Due to a lack of defibrillators the casualty rate in India is three to four times higher when compared to developed countries. Global norms require one defibrillator per three ICU beds, however, in India, we have one such device per 50 or 100 ICU beds. Hence, we decided to make low-cost and robust defibrillators to address the needs of the rural population.”In August 2013, Jeevtronics – Jeev meaning life, coupled with electronics and engineering-based innovation – was cranked into life.“We developed the world’s first dual powered (grid+ hand cranked) defibrillator, which is reliable and works even in areas without electricity,” Atre adds.Called the ‘SanMitra 1000 HCT’, USPs include the claims that it does not require any battery changes, ever. “Thereby making it the world’s total cost of ownership defibrillator,” Atre points out.In addition, Jeevtronics has developed a made-in-India ambulance grade defibrillator. “We have named it as Jeevtronics ‘SanMitra 1000 HCT EMS’, which has been tested at ARAI and will be priced at fraction of the cost of MNC brands,” Atre added.The duo said, “Devices like defibrillators are mostly used by the nurses or other medical staff in a very critical condition and less by the highly-qualified specialists and doctors. Hence, while designing the device, we had to keep this factor in mind and we came up with a very simple and easy-to-use interface.”Capital gainsTotal capital raised in form of loans and grants has been ₹6 crore, including a Biotech Ignition Grant (BIG) of ₹50 lakh by DBT-BIRAC, Government of India. Current revenue as per Gawade is ₹1.1 crore.“We have turned revenue positive and booked a modest profit this year. We are looking forward to raising funding for further expansion and sales of our products in India and abroad,” said Gawade.“The Jeevtronics SanMitra Defibrillator was donated by Jeevtronics to AIIMS Nagpur for use in Covid patients on December 19, 2020. It was received and installed in the Covid ward of AIIMS Nagpur in January 2021. Since January it has been used in several Covid patients and has proved extremely useful during the times of this pandemic during resuscitation of several patients,” said Dr Amrusha Raipure, associate professor, Department of Anaesthesiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Nagpur.The several medical accreditations and certifications on the Jeevtronics’ resume include, the Slovak National Accreditation Service (SNAS) Europe; the National Accreditation Board for Certification Bodies (NABCB) India’ and the International Accreditation Service (USA). The ISO13485 certification is important for implementing and maintaining quality standard of medical devices.Jeevtronics’ manufacturingThe total production capacity of Jeevtronics’ manufacturing unit in Karvenagar is eight units per day. Jeevtronics also has four patents for its technology. The unit employs 14 people currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-jeevtronics-product-is-critical-care-intervention-for-the-masses-101624737844041.html

The head constable, identified as Ranjit Singh, 50, who was deputed at Police Lines, had gone missing on August 16, 2012, under mysterious circumstances. The FIR has been lodged on the complaint of his wife Seema. The couple have three children and lived in Rishi Nagar.“On August 16, 2012, my husband left for work, but did not return. When I informed the police, instead of lodging a missing person’s complaint, they made me run from one police station to another. All this to no avail,” said Seema.Disappointed by the inaction, she went to live with her parents in Jammu. However, the police personnel kept contacting her to inform that her husband was not reporting to work. “Instead of looking for my husband, they kept informing me about his absence from duty, though I had told them about my husband’s disappearance.”It was only on February 18, 2020, that the PAU police station lodged a missing person’s report, she said.Seema said that when she received intimation from the police department that they had initiated the procedure to dismiss her husband for being absent for so long, she submitted a complaint to Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal. On the top official’s directions, the PAU police lodged an FIR under Section 346 (wrongful confinement in secret) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and initiated a probe.Sub-inspector Jaskamal Singh said the police are trying to trace the head constable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nine-years-on-probe-launched-into-missing-head-constable-s-disappearance-in-ludhiana-101624737781383.html

Delta plus is a mutated version of the more aggressive B.1.617.2 or delta strain of the Covid-19 that drove the second wave of infections in India. In a letter to Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan, Union ministry of health and family welfare secretary Rajesh Bhushan has asked the state to take immediate containment measures and send maximum samples to the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequencing Consortia (INSACOG) for testing, besides prompt tracing as well as vaccine coverage.Bhushan said characteristics of the “variant of concern” include increased transmissibility, stronger binding to receptors of lungs and cells and potential reduction in monoclonal antibody response.Meanwhile, hectic activity was witnessed in the health department in Ludhiana on Saturday a day after the confirmed presence of delta plus variant in a 68-year-old patient. Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma and civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia held a virtual meeting with the health department officials in which modalities were discussed to contain the spread of the new variant. The health teams were sent to Jand and Latala villages for intensifying testing.District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat said besides contact tracing, intensive testing will be carried out at Latala village where the son of the 68-year-old patient runs a mechanic shop.“As we received the report on Friday, we will conduct fresh testing of the people in the area. Vigorous contact tracing will be carried out to track the people with whom the patient had come in contact with. More samples collected from the area and will be sent for gnome testing,” said Dr Bhagat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/delta-plus-variant-centre-asks-state-govt-to-take-up-intensive-containment-measures-101624737723988.html

The DGP office, said a preliminary report regarding the scuffle was received on Saturday and the same is being examined. The five-page report has indicted superintendent of police Gaurav Singh, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur’s security in-charge additional superintendent of police Brijesh Sood and CM’s personal security officer Balwant Thakur for indiscipline, it is learnt. “The report is confidential,” said Madhusudan while refusing to divulge any details. Director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Kundu issued an advisory to IPS and HPS officials to “always remain calm and poised” while interacting with other fellow officers and the general public and to ensure high standards of professionalism and graceful conduct. After studying the report, the yellow book (government of India guidelines on security protocol to highly vulnerable persons) and other evidence on record, the PHQ will send a report in the matter to the state government, said the DGP’s office. The incident has occurred near the Bhuntar airport. In videos that surfaced on social media, Gaurav Singh is seen slapping Brijesh Sood. At this, Balwant Singh kicked the SP. The DGP, in a two-page advisory, said, “There is no gainsaying that the image of the HP Police has taken a beating after the recent incident of an ugly spat between senior police officers in front of dignitaries at Kullu.” “It is also obvious that it has undone the cumulative good work by the HP Police during the last one year,” it added. Not only has the incident become viral on social media, it has also elicited a negative and highly uncharitable public response, the advisory said. All efforts in ensuring better service delivery to the public, all the unprecedented drug seizures and all the effort put into fighting the COVID-19 pandemic by the Himachal Pradesh Police have been overshadowed by visible public sparring, it added. The advisory further stated, “Such conduct is totally unwarranted and undesirable. It is unprofessional to the point of dereliction of duty and also raises issues of compromises in the VVIP security.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kullu-scuffle-report-indicts-3-hp-cops-for-indiscipline-dgp-issues-advisory-101624737721743.html

Reportedly, the PSIEC has issued notices to around 700 allottees in Phase 7 asking them to shell out ₹830 per square yard (including interest) as enhancement fee for the plots. Industrialists, however, contend that the principal enhancement amount is ₹68 per square yard.Now, that the deadline to pay the fee has been extended from June 30 to September 30, the industry is pushing the government to waive off interest on pending payment.Focal Point Phase 8 Industrial Association president OP Bassi said, “Had the deadline not been extended, industrialists would have had to pay the enhancement fee with an added 21% compound interest with retrospective effect from 2016, when the notices were first served. However, the government should waive off the interest being charged on pending fee in this time of crisis. Even under the amnesty scheme of the government, 15% interest on pending payment is being charged, which is not acceptable.”Industrialists rued that the government had already collected 100% anticipatory enhancement from the industry, while allotting plots and notices had been served yet again for recovery of fee. Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) president Gurmeet Singh Kular said six years ago, the department had issued notices for recovery of ₹249 per square yard as enhancement charges but the matter was finally settled at ₹24 per square yard. “The government should waive off the interest. The industry is happy to pay the principal amount. This additional financial burden will burden industrialists, who are already reeling due to the pandemic.” Focal Point Phase 8 Industrial Association chairperson Rajnish Ahuja said the industry is in talks with the government for waiving off the interest. PSIEC chairperson Gurpreet Gogi said the industry will get at least three months extension and this period might be extended further. “A proposal for one-time Settlement (OTS) of enhancement fee has been forwarded to the government by the department for waiving off interest. The final decision has to be taken by the government,” said Gogi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/enhancement-fee-ludhiana-industry-gets-3-month-breather-on-deadline-seeks-interest-waiver-101624737483324.html

The coaching centres had been shut down on April 20 after the state registered a significant surge in cases. The government’s decision has been hailed by coaching centre owners, who are raring to get business back on track. A coaching centre owner, who did not wish to be named, said, “We have already informed students about resumption of physical classes and are getting our premises sanitised. Only students with vaccination certificates will be allowed to take offline classes, others will continue with virtual classes.” Students have been directed to wear masks and maintain social distancing in classrooms and on the premises. There are around 750 assorted coaching institutes in the district, the majority of which are located in Feroze Gandhi Market, near the ISBT, Model Town, Sector 32, Khanna, Doraha, Samrala and Macchiwara.Sunil Misra, owner of Kirpal IELTS Coaching Institute, Model Town, said, “We have around 65 IELTS aspirants who have been taking online classes. All our students are eager to attend physical classes. Students who have received the first dose of vaccination can start Monday.” The pandemic has hit the once highly profitable coaching business. Misra says he had around 120 students last year but there was a dip in enrolment this year due to the online mode of teaching.These institutes polish IELTS aspirants in four spheres — reading, writing, speaking and listening. After a nationwide lockdown was imposed last years, coaching centres were allowed to resume business in October when authorities had allowed schools to reopen for classes 9 to 12 with parents’ consent.Meanwhile, coaching institutes preparing students for entrance examinations such the joint entrance examination (JEE), national eligibility-cum-entrance test (NEET) and others qualifying examinations have decided to request the state government to also allow them to reopen their institutes.Tejpreet Singh, co-founder and chief operating officer, Edusquare, said, “The government must allow other coaching institutes to reopen as well as students respond better to physical classes than online classes. Last year, we had over 700 students, only 450 remain this year. We, too, have to pay rent, salaries and maintain infrastructure in the institute and resumption of physical classes will help us break even.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-ludhiana-ielts-coaching-centres-can-open-doors-for-vaccinated-students-101624737481888.html

27-06-2021||Lucknow||PM Modi writes to kin of BJP workers who died due to Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has written letters to the families of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers who died in Uttar Pradesh due to Covid-19.“Individual letters are being sent to cadres from the PM office,” a BJP leader said, adding that the gesture indicated the party’s leadership’s continued focus on the state. The move comes in the midst of a BJP campaign in UP to connect with families of those party workers and citizens who lost their lives due to Covid-19.The prime minister’s letters were sent separately to each family. Modi, who is also the Varanasi MP, has recalled the contribution of the party workers and added that he felt their loss. Three ministers and seven party lawmakers, their family members and countless cadres succumbed to Covid-19 since March 2020 in UP. Though the letters are reaching the intended recipients now, they are dated June 9, just a week after the party’s national general secretary BL Santhosh had first arrived on a fire-fighting mission to UP, where assembly elections are due early next year. After Santhosh’s first visit, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev had begun undertaking visits to cadres’ homes across the state. The UP government has also begun accommodating cadres to various commissions and boards. The party, BJP leaders said, has also fielded family members of deceased functionaries in the zila panchayat chairpersons’ elections. “The party’s outreach campaign to cadre homes by state BJP leadership will continue. In each of these visits, we are telling the cadre that though their loss is irreplaceable, the party is there with them,” a BJP worker said. Praising the PM’s move, the UP BJP chief tweeted, “We aren’t just a political party. We are a family.” “That’s why the PM has sent letters to share grief of family members who lost their loved ones,” he said.Some BJP workers like Dilip Srivastava, a party corporator from Indiranagar in Lucknow, also organised a function to pray for those who died of Covid-19. Several BJP leaders, including former minister Rajendra Tiwari and party spokesman Hero Bajpai, were present.The BJP has also made preparations for the 78th edition of PM’s radio talk show Mann ki Baat on Sunday.“Now, on the last Sunday of each month, the party workers would hear the PM’s radio talk at the booth level,” a BJP leader said. BJP national president JP Nadda has shared a letter sent to him by one Anand Swaroop Dwivedi praising PM’s talk show.“The BJP chief has urged cadres to hear Mann ki Baat at a booth level worker’s place,” a BJP leader said, describing the party’s plan to build an emotional connect with cadres in an election year.CAPTION: BJP corporator Dilip Srivastava organised a function in memory of cadres who lost their lives during the Covid surge.

Actor, director and writer Mita Vasisht joined the session that was moderated by Niyati Chitkara, director, Chitkara Schools. The theme of the session was emerging relevance of theatre and performing arts in quality education. Vasisht spoke on how theatre-based education, with a strong focus on non-verbal communication, self-expression, voice-over and voice modulation, body language, dialogue and content delivery, and creativity on the part of instructors can be useful in the classroom.She emphasised the extensive functionality of ‘role-play’ as a tool for teaching and learning, the contribution of theatrics towards the development of students’ communication skills and cognitive abilities, the role of cinema (Edutainment) in changing the educational landscape for the better, and the significance of theatre in instilling the virtues of compassion, cooperation, authenticity, and responsibility in the youth of the nation. Touching upon her journey as an educationist and her experiences of playing a wide range of characters in movies and television such as Teeba in City Stigma, Trishna in Kahaani Ghar Ghar Ki and Mandira Mathur in Criminal Justice, Vasisht reiterated and reaffirmed her faith in supplementing the traditional classrooms with activities based on performing arts, theatre and cinema. Madhu Chitkara, pro-chancellor, Chitkara University, said, “Evoking a passion for learning in students requires teachers to be creative, ingenious and positively offbeat in a way that captivates the interest of students and addresses the varying needs of all kinds of learners. Theatre-based education could very well be employed for targeting all kinds of skills with and beyond the cognitive ones. In a world as fast as ours, these skills could surely help youngsters in paving their own path to success.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/actor-mita-vasisht-interacts-with-chitkara-varsity-bed-students-int-l-school-teachers-101624737302844.html

Another 660MW generation facility at Talwandi Sabo Power Plant (TSPL) has been non-operational since March.Power engineers see this as yet another instance of the laxity of the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) in dealing with Independent Power Plants (IPPs). For the record, IIPs are now producing only 2,560MW of power against their installed capacity of 3,920MW.“For the entire year, consumers bear the fixed cost expense of these plants for not drawing power. When power from these plants is actually needed, some go out of operation. We have already demanded revision of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) in favour of consumers,” engineers have been maintaining this stance for a long time. They add that the PPAs were so badly drafted that there was no penal provision for outages in peak season. On Friday, the PSEB Engineer Association had also accused the PSPCL management of bringing about a power crisis in the state.For now, the PSPCL is meeting rising power demand by mainly procuring from the grid and making other arrangements.Paramjit Singh, director (generation), PSPCL said, “We hope that GVK will be operational by Saturday midnight. The PSPCL management has directed TSPL to operationalise its unit at the earliest.”PSPCL SUPPLIES RECORD 3,029 LAKH UNITSEven with the generation from private power plants hit, PSPCL achieved record power supply of 3,029 lakh units on June 25 (Friday). PSPCL chairman and managing director A Venu Prasad said, “The previous record of power supply was 3,018 lakh units on July 2, 2020. PSPCL had purchased 216 lakh units from own sources and another 929MW from power exchange to meet demand. We are prepared to supply up to 13,700MW to the state.”He added that over 8-hour power supply was ensured to Amritsar, Sangrur, Bathinda and Faridkot districts. He appealed to PSPCL’s agitating employees to end their protest against staff and material shortage, etc, in the larger interest of farmers and power consumers, especially as the covid-19 pandemic raged on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-power-demand-peaks-another-540mw-private-plant-conks-out-101624735682033.html

On Friday, ED conducted raids for around nine hours at multiple places related to Deshmukh in Mumbai and Nagpur. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to misuse Central investigation agencies to create trouble for Deshmukh as well as the three-party state government. “Allegations were made against Deshmukh owing to personal grudges. The Central agencies are harassing him by using those allegations. Earlier, the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) conducted raids but could not find anything against him. Now by reopening 10-15-year-old cases and pointing out errors, ED is trying to trouble him. Deshmukh and other MVA ministers are being targeted deliberately,” said state NCP chief Jayant Patil. Sanjay Raut, the Member of Parliament (MP) from Shiv Sena – NCP’s ally in the state – said that it has become a regular practice to harass MVA leaders by the means of Central agencies. Raut said, “Harassing leaders with the help of central agencies is not new anymore. Yesterday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar already commented on this. Be it Shiv Sena or NCP we all are being harassed. However, MVA is strong enough. We will see what needs to be done.”Another MVA ally, the Congress, termed the raids an attempt to finish political opponents. “We are clearly of the view that the action by the Central agencies is based on vengeance and is an attempt to finish political opponents,” said senior Congress leader and Public Works Department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan.Deshmukh is facing a probe after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh accused him of extorting establishments in Mumbai. Singh made the allegations in an eight-page letter to the chief minister on March 20, three days after his transfer from his post to the Maharashtra home guards as the commandant general for allegedly mishandling the Antilia case, in which 20 lose gelatin sticks were found in a car near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home.After the raids, Deshmukh on Friday told the media that he was falsely implicated. “Singh made false allegations against me only after he was transferred from the Mumbai Police commissioner’s post. Why didn’t he make the allegations while holding the post?” Deshmukh told reporters on Friday evening. He also said that the gelatin sticks were planted and Mansukh Hiran – the owner of the car found near Antilia – was murdered when Singh was the Mumbai Police chief. Five police officers – Sachin Vaze, Riyazuddin Kazi, Vinayak Shinde, Prakash Dhumal and Sunil Mane – were associated with the crime intelligence unit (CIU) at the Mumbai Police commissionerate and directly reporting to Singh. He was removed from the top cop’s position as his role was suspicious in the Antilia case, alleged Deshmukh.Singh’s letter accused Deshmukh of giving Vaze – police officer held in the Antilia case – a target of collecting ₹100-crore a month from bars, restaurants and hookah parlours, among several other allegations. Deshmukh stepped down as the state home minister on April 5, following a CBI probe order against him by the high court (HC).In response to the allegations, BJP said that the probe has started on HC’s order and it has no role to play in the case. “Singh was appointed as Mumbai Police chief by MVA government. The officer appointed by them made the allegations, based on which probe against Deshmukh was initiated. BJP has not played any role, as the probe by the Central agencies began following HC’s order,” said state BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-using-agencies-to-trouble-leaders-of-maharashtra-s-ruling-parties-101624735380633.html

Active cases slightly increased to 121,251 as 8,752 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours. The state saw 179 casualties, taking the toll to 120,881. Kolhapur reported the highest toll with 30 deaths. The district recorded 21 deaths, while the city reported nine fatalities. It was followed by Mumbai with 15 deaths.“We have achieved another milestone by administering 731,181 doses in a day. This is the most vaccinations in a day in the state till date. The state is achieving a milestone in vaccination every day. Yesterday, we crossed the 30,000,000 mark of vaccination doses,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary, health department.The state has achieved 31,027,027 vaccinations so far.Mumbai also reported its single-day highest of 154,226 vaccinations on Saturday, according to the data of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). A total of 869 prisoners in Arthur Road Jail are also included, followed by the majority being 106,780 from the 18-44 age group. Overall, 5,093,485 citizens have been vaccinated in the city.Meanwhile, Covid-19 cases have hit a plateau in the state and are not going down. For the past 20 days, they are in the range of 8,000 to 10,000 cases. This has concerned the state in the backdrop of 21 Delta Plus variant cases found in six districts. The state is on alert as the transmissibility and virulence of the new variant is more than any other variants and a threat of a possible third wave, the officials said.The average daily cases in the past 26 days was also recorded at 10,835. However, it is far less than May, when the average daily cases was 36,820, according to the figures released by the state health department.State health minister Rajesh Tope, too, has expressed his concern over stagnation. “The daily cases have hit a plateau and are not going down. It is a cause of concern for us as they are stagnant between 8,000 and 10,000,” Tope on Wednesday.As a preventive measure, the state government imposed stricter norms by reducing the five-level relaxation plan to three. The first two levels having maximum relaxations have been removed till further order, according to a notification issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Friday.“New variants like Delta, Delta plus etc. have come to spread and are fuelling the potentiality of imminent (4-6 weeks), more severe third wave across a wider geographical area,” the notification further mentioned.“The stagnancy in daily cases is the effect of unlocking and relaxations provided across the state. In such a scenario, strict implementation of the existing lockdown restrictions is very important. Since, the state government has reduced relaxation levels on Friday, the daily cases are likely to start reducing in the eight to ten days,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state task force and director, critical care, Fortis Hospital, Mulund.According to the fresh notification, malls and theatres have been completely shut across the state once again. Section 144 has become applicable and not more than five people can gather at a public place, while movements should be minimal post 5pm. Shops selling essentials can stay open till 4 pm on a daily basis and those related to non-essentials are allowed to operate only on weekdays. Gyms, saloons will be operational only till 4 pm, with appointments and without air-conditioners.

27-06-2021||Other||BJP, Congress hold protests across Maharashtra for OBC quota||Demanding restoration of the 27% political reservation for the OBC (Other Backward Class) community in local government bodies, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) resorted to ‘chakka jam’ (road blockade) and ‘jail bharo’ (voluntary arrest) protests at various places on Saturday.The Congress, too, held state-wide protests against the BJP-led Central government, blaming it for the Supreme Court’s decision to quash OBC reservation. The party alleged that the Centre did not provide census data, which led to the quashing of the quota.OBCs are on the verge of losing their political reservation in all local bodies across the state after the Apex court in a verdict directed the Maharashtra government to appoint a dedicated commission for collecting empirical data and fix the reservation of the community based on it. No seat can be reserved for the community in the upcoming local bodies until the state completes the entire process.The BJP held protests at many places, including Mumbai, Thane, Pune and Nagpur, which saw the participation of all senior state leaders from the party. Former BJP minister Ashish Shelar and others were detained by the police for holding a road blockade at Mulund toll naka.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis was detained briefly by the police after he held a protest in Nagpur. While addressing a gathering, he said, “OBC reservation was abolished owing to the incompetence of the state government. Despite that, the MVA (Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi) government is blaming the Narendra Modi-led BJP government in the Centre. If elected back to power, I’ll ensure that the reservation is restored or else will retire from politics.” He was responding to the claims made by the Congress that the Centre is not providing census data which led to the situation. On Friday, the Congress had released a letter written by Fadnavis on August 1, 2019 – during his tenure as CM – to NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar, asking the latter to direct officials to provide district-level data of Maharashtra with geographical identification particulars, caste category and names.At a protest in Thane, Leader of Opposition in legislative Council Pravin Darekar has alleged that state minister Chhagan Bhujbal failed to provide justice to the OBC community in Maharashtra. Around 150 BJP workers staged rasta roko (road blockade) at Anand Nagar toll naka on Saturday morning. Later the local police dispersed the crowd. “Bhujbal claims to be the leader of the OBC community. But he has failed in meeting their demands despite being part of the cabinet. He should submit his resignation as they [the state government] have failed to safeguard the reservation for OBCs, among many things, forcing the BJP to go into protest mode. The failure of the state government is evident in the issue of Maratha reservation as well,” said Darekar. In Navi Mumbai and Panvel, the BJP held chakka jam. Legislator Prashant Thakur said, “The state government has failed totally on all fronts. It has an agenda and is working accordingly to deny us our rights. There is no justice even for OBCs. The state has failed to get the legal order for reservations and announced elections.” Congress held protests at Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Nanded, among other places. Senior Congress leader Chandrakant Handore, who was leading a protest in Mumbai, said, “The Central government didn’t provide empirical data to the Supreme Court deliberately when BJP was in power. Now OBC reservation has been quashed, and only the Modi-led Central government is responsible for this.”The Navi Mumbai unit of the party held protests at Congress Bhavan in Vashi as well as its Nerul office. Indian National Trade Union Congress’ (INTUC) Navi Mumbai president Ravindra Sawant said, “Had the Central government given the census data required, the Supreme Court would not have quashed the OBC reservation quota in local bodies.” Darekar has slammed the Congress for protesting. “I am surprised that the Congress is also protesting, aren’t they a part of MVA? They can take up the issue in the Parliament. All that the Congress is doing is drama through these protests,” he said. Meanwhile, an all-party OBC brainstorming meeting has also been called by Congress leader and state minister Vijay Wadettiwar in Pune Saturday. Bhujbal, while addressing the meeting, said, “Empirical data is absolutely necessary to resolve the issue of OBC reservation. It is not anyone’s personal property. The Central government should immediately provide the data as it is difficult for the state to collect it during the pandemic.”(With inputs from Ankita G Menon, G Mohiuddin Jeddy)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-congress-hold-protests-across-maharashtra-for-obc-quota-101624735141333.html

The effort aims at modernising the infrastructure of higher education institutes in rural areas.As per a letter written to the director of higher education department by Yogendra Dutt Tripathi, special secretary on June 25, Governor of UP Anandiben Patel has cleared a budget of ₹30 million for the project. HT has a copy of the letter.According to the plan, the higher education department will develop e-learning parks in 120 of the 170 government colleges in the state. A majority of these 120 colleges are located in the rural pockets where several students from the nearby areas peruse their higher education. The e-learning park will have a high-speed internet facility which can be accessed by the students for free to look for online study material, join webinars and get information about the latest developments in their subjects.The e-learning parks will be established in the libraries of these colleges. Each park will have at least one updated desktop computer, a printer and a high-speed internet connection with a router, as per the letter.The need for such a facility was felt during the Covid-19 pandemic. In absence of high-speed internet, it was difficult for students in rural pockets to continue their education online.It has been advised that principals of the college will look over the operation of the e-learning park. The principals have also been asked to inform students about the lab and encourage them to use it. The Governor has also ordered to open the e-learning park till 8pm in areas of very poor or no internet connection to ensure maximum students avail the facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/30mn-allotted-for-setting-up-e-learning-parks-in-120-govt-colleges-in-rural-areas-101624734842007.html

27-06-2021||Delhi||Oxygen audit panel report not final, says subgroup chief Dr Guleria||A report by a group under the Supreme Court-appointed panel to audit medical oxygen use in Delhi is an interim document and not the final word, AIIMS director and chairman of the subgroup Dr Randeep Guleria said on Saturday, indicating that claims of a fourfold exaggeration in demand by the Capital were inaccurate.A political row has erupted between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the interim report. The report suggested there was “gross discrepancy” in recording the requirement of medical oxygen by 183 of Delhi’s hospitals, which asked for 1,140MT as opposed to the actual requirement of 209MT.Dr Guleria said the controversy over exaggerated demand was unnecessary as the requirement of medical oxygen was dynamic in nature, adding that the report by the subgroup he heads was interim and people should wait for the final version. “The final report will cover all terms of references,” he told Hindustan Times. He added that the report only talked about how much oxygen was needed and how much was used by hospitals, which was dynamic at the time.Also Read| 'Fight over, can we do some work?': Kejriwal to Centre amid row over oxygenAccording to an NDTV report, when asked if the report was exaggerated four times, Dr Guleria said: “I don’t think we could say that.” The Delhi government has said that the report is invalid, and its findings incorrect. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday the acute shortage of oxygen during Covid-19’s fourth wave in the national capital was real, even as he appealed for an end to the political controversy and for everyone to work together.The panel is a subgroup headed by Dr Guleria. Its other members are Subodh Yadav, a joint secretary in the Jal Shakti ministry, Dr Sandeep Budhiraja from Max Healthcare, Bhupinder S Bhalla, principal secretary, home, Delhi government, and Sanjay Kumar Singh, the controller of explosives at the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO).In the annexures attached with the report, two of the members — Dr Budhiraja and Bhalla — submitted discordant notes on the procedure and details of the findings. An internal note by Bhalla on Friday evening suggested some members of the panel had not approved the report.“It’s an interim report and it’s subjudice. It has been given to the court; we have submitted it as was required. It’s an ongoing process and it’s difficult to say what the final report will actually say,” Dr Guleria told news agency ANI. “Oxygen requirement and what was actually used has been shown and discrepancy has been there. It is not correct to say that it was less or more, because that is something which is dynamic,” he added.Also Read| Oxygen report fuels war of words in Delhi“The matter is in the Supreme Court. We need to wait and see what the top court says about it. Undercounting of active cases and other factors need to be considered,” he told NDTV.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta on Saturday demanded Kejriwal’s apology for “oxygen mismanagement” and said his government “exaggerated” consumption of the life-saving gas.The report marks the latest chapter in a spat between the Centre and the Delhi government. The Delhi government’s position was that the Union government was not allocating it enough oxygen. The Centre’s position was that Delhi’s needs were overstated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/oxygen-audit-panel-report-not-final-says-subgroup-chief-dr-guleria-101624733686951.html
27-06-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column:Infuse life with joy, self-contentment||“Taking joy in living is a woman’s best cosmetic.” I recently came across this quote and it immediately struck a chord with me. The quote is not exclusive to women but applies to humanity as a whole. Indeed, it is imperative to be comfortable with oneself, to forgive oneself, and yet, keep striving towards growth. Self-contentment and joy should always be our lives’ basic ingredient. Contrary to popular perception, contentment and the need to progress can coexist.While joy can and does come from external sources, it will not last unless we feel it within as well. At times, we may not be able to feel the joy, but staying on the chosen path and keeping up with our duties can help spark joy with time. While working as a therapist, I would suggest my clients to stay put and go with the flow, and that the feeling of joy will eventually have to follow. Consider an employee who might not ‘feel like’ going to a monthly office get-together on a particular instance, but, dresses up and shows up with a smile anyhow. Chances are that they will not regret it and will pat their back for taking the decision later. A simpler analogy is that we usually don’t ‘feel like’ exercising, at least not till we develop a habit. But, every time, once we begin to do it, we feel good. Action does have immense power, to change our mindset, to put things in focus, and to shift our perspective. Another way to infuse joy in life is carving in some ‘me time’ as well. A friend once asked what should be done during this me time. It so happens that we have become so accustomed to our routines and of always being occupied that spare moments invoke a dread. This was felt by many of us during lockdown, self-isolation and quarantine. Me time is very subjective. While one may use it to reflect and ponder, another may use it for zumba and while some may like to flip through old photo albums, another may enjoy watching TV. It is like a call to find our calling.Also, we have a duty towards ourselves, which is recovering from our mistakes. Dwelling in guilt or repentance does not offer anything. For instance, often in the middle of a heated situation, I remind myself that I have cent percent right to my mental wellbeing. It may not solve the problem at hand immediately, but definitely strengthens my capacity to deal with it, because, instead of a reaction, I automatically choose a response.Last but not the least, if one’s thought process seems to be going haywire, and there is no meaning or sense to life, it is always worthwhile to talk about it, whether to a professional or a trusted friend. But talk one must. Keeping emotions bottled up is a sure-shot recipe for distress. As said by Audre Lorde, an American writer and feminist, “When we speak, we are afraid our words will not be heard or welcomed. But when we are silent, we are still afraid, so it is better to speak.” Sharing one’s joys and sorrows is essential to one’s psychological survival. So, to keep my joie-de-vivre alive, I make it a point to enjoy my own company, to accept and love myself, and, to keep in touch with friends and family. I hope you do, too.reemaban@gmail.comThe writer works as an assistant professor (psychology) at Rajiv Gandhi Govt College in Saha (Ambala)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-infuse-life-with-joy-selfcontentment-101624734601203.html

The Ganga at Kachala in Badaun was flowing 0.1meters above danger mark, as per the update. Most of the villages affected by flooding are located in low lying terai region like Mordabad, Sambhal, Amroha though parts of Rampur, Pilibhit and areas of Lakhimpur, Shravasti and Balrampur that borders Nepal, officials said. “Some villages in Thakurdwar, Kanth and Bilari have been affected largely been affected by rise in water level of Ram Ganga river which passes through the district,” district magistrate, Moradabad Shailendra Kumar said. Rise of water level in Sharda river, which passes through parts of Pilibhit and Lakhimpur Khiri have caused flooding in low lying areas. In Moradabad region at least 48 villages, under the Sadar area, have been affected due to flooding. In Pilibhit, villagers of some 28 villages located in north and east of the district have been separated from the district headquarter and in Lakhimpur Kheri district nearly 58 villages have been hit. A dozen villages each in Shravasti and Balrampur have also been cut off due to rains in last 24 hours. Officials said the exact damage caused by flooding was yet to be assessed. “We have set up around 34 flood relief posts in vulnerable areas. These posts are coordinating with the district administration to provide relief to people in affected villages,” said district magistrate of Shravasti, TK Shibu. “The state level disaster management team has also been pressed in for relief work. The teams are working in tandem with other departments. The situation is being handled well by our teams,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/monsoon-fury-several-villages-marooned-as-rivers-flow-above-danger-mark-in-up-101624733460581.html

He was in town to attend a meeting of office-bearers of the AAP legal cell; he is the president of the legal wing. Accusing the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) of being hand-in-glove with each other, he claimed, “The new SIT will come out with a similar report which was submitted by the panel I led.” He added, “The police and the state government have been trying to destroy evidence, and did not even cooperate fully with my panel. No CCTV footage was provided to us even when the DC had stated on record that cameras were installed at the site, and were functional two days before the incident. The government failed to interrogate persons, including cops, named in our report.”“If the government makes the report public, even a layman will know who was responsible for the incident. My commission did 90% of the work and the government just needed to interrogate the persons involved,” he claimed, adding that he was contemplating handing over his report to Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh. The retired judge claimed that the culprits will be jailed, if the AAP assumed power in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sit-just-a-political-stunt-ahead-of-2022-polls-says-justice-zora-retd-101624733161160.html

The couple, in their 2011 suit, urged the court to restrain Thakores from feeding birds in the balcony of their flat. Shah claimed that Thakore had erected a platform outside their balcony to feed grain and water to birds and that the grains would fall in their house. The couple also claimed that pigeon droppings would fall on the window, causing foul smell and odour. The applicants also said the grains fed to birds were full of insects, which would also fall in their balcony. They also claimed that apart from disturbing their sleep, the bird feeding was also leading to skin issues for them.The application stated that Shahs had requested Thakore family to stop feeding birds in the balcony and the society had also passed a resolution restraining members from feeding birds in their balcony, but since Thakores were undeterred, the applicants were compelled to move the city civil court suing Thakores and the housing society.Thakore family, in response to the suit, claimed Shahs and their domestic helps had been causing pain and suffering to the birds by hitting metal tray to shoo off the birds when they come to eat. This, Thakores claimed, is a crime under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. They also claimed that since Shah and his servants hit the feed tray, the grains fell everywhere. This, they added, caused panic in birds. The defendants further added that they had been requesting the society to allot a special place for feeding birds but it has not been done.The court after hearing both sides observed that, “This is really very unfortunate for the act of kindness the defendant has to beg. The society is also party to the present suit. If possible they should consider the request of the defendant by allocating particular place for bird feeding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/feeding-birds-from-balcony-is-nuisance-to-neighbours-mumbai-court-101624733100622.html
27-06-2021||Mumbai||After NCB grilling, Iqbal Kaskar back in Thane jail||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Saturday returned Iqbal Kaskar, brother of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim, to Thane jail after interrogating him for a day in connection with a drug trafficking case.NCB had on June 15 arrested seven persons from Mumbai and Thane and seized 17.3 kilograms of hashish from them. Preliminary probe had revealed that two of the arrested accused — Rajvinder Singh and Gurmit Singh — had travelled from Punjab to Mumbai on bikes, purportedly carrying the contraband in their backpacks. Investigation in the case has revealed that one of the seven arrested accused, Shabbir Shaikh, was Kaskar’s close aide, following which the probing agency took his custody on Friday from Thane jail, where he has been lodged in an extortion case.In 2015, both Kaskar and Shaikh were arrested by JJ Marg police for allegedly assaulting a real estate broker after he refused to fulfil their demand of ₹3 lakh protection money, said a NCB officer. After coming out on bail, Shaikh got involved in drug trafficking and Kaskar had allegedly contacted him from jail many times, said the NCB officer. The officer added that the agency will decide whether to rope in Kaskar as an accused in the drug trafficking case or not, after evaluating evidence.Kaskar, deported from the United Arab Emirates in 2003, was arrested by the anti-extortion cell of Thane Police on September 18, 2017, along with two of his accomplices — Mumtaz Shaikh and Israr Sayyed — for allegedly extorting ₹30 lakh from a Thane-based builder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/after-ncb-grilling-iqbal-kaskar-back-in-thane-jail-101624733041601.html
27-06-2021||Lucknow||Customers show faith as dine-in resumes||As the dine-in resumed from June 21, the restaurants in the state capital reported good response from the Lucknowites. Currently, food joints are allowed to function on weekdays till 9 pm with 50% capacity and they are shut for dine-in on Saturdays and Sundays due to corona curfew. The past week projected an encouraging response from the city foodies who turned-up in good numbers. “It’s great to be back in business but as we have to close by 9 pm, so definitely we are losing on the night business which is usually our peak hour. If we are allowed to open on Saturdays and Sundays for dine-in, with proper Covid-protocols, then we will be able to revive our businesses much faster,” says Manoj Bachani of Richi Rich restaurant. College student Yash Srivastava, while sipping his coffee at his favourite Rovers Café in Hazratganj, share that he came all the way from Indira Nagar to taste a piping-hot cuppa at his favourite food joint which is now open for dine-in. Clubs in the state capital are back in action. “We have ensured that the entire staff is vaccinated for the safety of our patrons. Now we are functional till 10 pm as per new excise department circular. It does not restrict us to close on any day but since restaurants are not allowed dine-in on Saturday-Sunday, so we are operating only on five days,” says Oudh Gymkhana Club secretary Ashok Agarwal. The plush lounges are slowly making a comeback too. “At Vibhuti Khand circuit, I hope by first week of July most of us will restart operations. In our complex, Farzi Café, My Bar, Firefly and Vintage Machine are already functional. We are opening from July 1. Hopefully, the weekend closure and 10 pm (only for restro-bars) restriction will be removed which is the major business period,” says Gaurav Singh partner of Boombox. The Flying Saucer Café, in the same locality, is also opening its doors from June 28. Kamli Bristo that was launched for public in April this year and immediately closed due to partial corona curfew is also staging a comeback in July. Hilton Garden Inn’s head of F&B operations Akash Rathod informs that, with 50% permissible capacity, they have closed the week with nearly sold-out occupancy at their restaurant. “We are requesting guests to get reservations done so that they don’t have to wait. The dine-in turnout was phenomenon,” he adds. For safety reasons and drive-in experiences foodies are opting for dining at suburban joints as well. “We have people driving in from main city for an open ambience food experience. We are offering a pre-fixed menu that people are enjoying to the hilt. We even have guests coming for a weekend stay with food packages combined,” said Ramada Lucknow’s deputy general manager Amitesh Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/customers-show-faith-as-dine-in-resumes-101624733041069.html

With this, Punjab became one of the 11 states and union territories in the country where the price of petrol has gone into three digits.Fuel remains most expensive in Mohali, with even diesel priced at ₹91.58 per litre. In Panchkula, petrol is available for ₹95.63 and diesel for ₹89.05, followed by ₹94.35 and ₹88.29, respectively, in Chandigarh.“This is unprecedented. Before 2021, a price of even ₹80 per litre was considered excessive,” said Ashwinder Mongia, president, Mohali Petroleum Dealers Association, while blaming the central and state governments for “exploiting the common man”. “Petrol pumps in Punjab are suffering huge losses due to the price disparity with Chandigarh. This is not a viable business anymore. We will consider holding protests to catch the attention of the authorities. The government must start imposing GST on fuel to regularise the taxes,” he said.The rising diesel prices have transporters in the tricity worried too. BL Sharma, general secretary, Chandigarh Transport Association, said: “Prices of daily use items and vegetables are likely to rise if this trend continues. At present, many transporters are operating on losses due to the scarcity of work, but once the pandemic situation improves, the prices will go up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/petrol-price-breaches-100-per-litre-in-mohali-101624732921072.html

Authored by journalist late Surjit Singh Sokhi, the SGPC had first published the Punjabi book titled ‘Sikhan Da Qataleam’ (Massacre of Sikhs) in June 1985 in four volumes.As these volumes were never printed again, only one copy of the book was available with the Sikh Reference Library that functions on the premises of the Golden Temple. All volumes have been clubbed in the latest edition. Releasing the book along with senior vice-president Surjit Singh Bhitewad; honourary chief secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami; members Bhai Ram Singh; Bhai Manjit Singh and incharge (literature) Gurmeet Singh, SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said, “The year 1984 gave unforgettable wounds to the Sikhs.”“After the Indian Army’s attack on the Sri Harmandar Sahib (Golden Temple) and the Akal Takht in June 1984, massacre of Sikhs was carried out in November 1984 across the country, including Delhi, which the community can never forget. This is the brutality that has proved to be a permanent disgrace for the then Congress government,” she said.“Sokhi has done a remarkable and historic job of recording, in this book, information gathered from eyewitnesses of the November 1984 Sikh genocide,” she added. The SGPC president added that the Dharam Prachar Committee has made an effort to make people, across the world, aware of the particulars of this shameful ‘genocide’ against the Sikhs by compiling the book’s four parts. “This book will keep alive the atrocities perpetrated on the Sikh community by the then Congress government,” she added.Bhitewad and Dhami said, “It is a historic resource for future generations, which will continue to educate the youth on the atrocities perpetrated on the Sikhs.” The SGPC is also reprinting the ‘White Paper’ it issued on the Operation Bluestar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-36-years-sgpc-reprints-book-on-1984-anti-sikh-violence-101624732861278.html
27-06-2021||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Chandigarh tricity reports first Delta Plus case||Amid a decline in the second wave of the pandemic, the tricity on Saturday reported the first case of the Delta Plus variant of the coronavirus, raising renewed concerns. The World Health Organisation on Friday revealed that the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), first identified in India, is spreading in at least 85 nations, terming it the “most transmissible of the variants identified so far.” Delta Plus (B.1.617.2.1) is its more virulent version, which has raised concerns about its capability to evade immunity built by vaccination or the previous infection.According to the Centre, over 50 cases of Delta Plus variant have been detected in at least 12 states in the country, with Maharashtra reporting the highest number of 22. Two cases have been reported in Punjab as well, while none has surfaced in Haryana so far. The first case in the tricity is that of a 35-year-old resident of Chandigarh, whose swab sample along with that of 49 other patients tested positive for Covid-19 since May were sent by the UT health department for genome sequencing to the National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi, on June 6. Genome sequencing attempts to draw out the complete genetics of the viruses.“The sample of a 35-year-old man, who is a resident of Vikas Nagar, Mauli Jagran, was tested positive for the Delta Plus strain, which is believed to be more transmittable and dangerous. The patient was tested positive for Covid-19 on May 22, and he has recovered from the virus,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services, Chandigarh.Officials said the man and all his family members, including two senior citizens and a child, had reported mild symptoms of the disease in May, but none was hospitalised. All have fully recovered, even as no one was vaccinated at the time of contracting the virus.Now, the department has sent samples of the man’s four family members for genome sequencing. “For the past few days, no case of Covid-19 has been detected at Vikas Nagar in Mauli Jagran, but we will step up testing in that area as well as across the city to diagnose positive patients at the earliest,” said Dr Kang.66% samples test positive for Delta variant According to reports received by the health department on Saturday, variants of concern have been detected in 35 out of the 50 samples. Besides the one Delta Plus strain, the Delta strain (B.1.617.2) was found in 33 samples and the UK or Alpha strain (B.1.1.1.7) in one sample. Even last week, 61% of 25 samples of patients tested positive from May 5 to 24 at the PGIMER — a period that saw the second wave peaking in Chandigarh — had tested positive for the Delta variant. Meanwhile, the Chandigarh department is awaiting results of 29 samples sent on June 22. In view of the circulation of the new and more transmissible variant strains in the community, health experts have advised people to adhere to safety protocols and get vaccinated.“Vaccination at the earliest is the only key to protect ourselves from getting infected with these dangerous strains,” said Dr Kang.Prof Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER, Chandigarh, said: “Citizens are advised to follow Covid appropriate behaviour. They must wear masks and should follow social distancing norms in public places. This will help in controlling the spread of variants.”Two patients succumb, 57 test +veMeanwhile, the tricity reported two fatalities due to Covid-19 on Saturday while 57 people tested positive for it.Twenty cases each surfaced in Chandigarh and Mohali, followed by 17 in Panchkula. The two deaths were reported from Mohali and Panchkula. Chandigarh has recorded no fatality for the past three days.The tricity’s active caseload has come down to 594 from Friday’s 636. As many as 303 cases remain active in Mohali, followed by 220 in Chandigarh and 71 in Panchkula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid19chandigarh-tricity-reports-first-delta-plus-case-101624732742286.html
27-06-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: Wake up before all great Neptune’s ocean empties||‘To err is human...’ is a timeless adage. It seems human beings have grown fond of their follies and have an unfortunate penchant for repeating them. We are rudely shaken out of this complacency over and over again by some calamity or the other, yet we always sink back into our old habits. Poet and satirist Alexander Pope’s prophecy, “Sole judge of truth in endless error hurled” rings true , especially when it comes to the water crisis, which is looming large on a global scale. However, we seem to be intent on turning a blind eye to it. Each morning the cleaning fever grips our colony. The educated seem putty in the hands of their maids. Pipes are connected to taps, the motor is turned on and a water canon is aimed at each nook and corner: swish-swash, broom-broom. Heaven forbid that a mobile call or passerby interrupt, as an animated gossip session ensues with the free-flowing pipe abandoned. Sheer wastage! The concatenation effect is so strong that the entire neighbourhood is engulfed in no time. While the floors and kitchen slabs gleam in homes, the mucky puddles outside the gate are nobody’s concern. Poor pedestrians have to hopscotch their way or fume silently as a passing vehicle drenches them in a muddy spray. That’s not all, stagnant water attracts stray animals and is a breeding ground for all sorts of germs and pests. As far as the damage to street roads or creation of potholes is concerned, one can always blame authorities. Where a bucket or two would suffice, we splurge significantly more. Moreover, these days almost every house has a fleet of vehicles and a hired help is employed to scrub it. The omniscient water pipe makes an appearance and all vehicles are unscrupulously doused. A liberal rub of detergent, followed by high-pressure spray would certainly leave vehicle shiny and spick and span, but few can empathise with the aftermath. Why not visit a washing station instead? Resources will be recycled and wastage minimised. A swipe on your vehicle, akin to a caress, will certainly be a loving gesture as well as exercise for our limbs.Any protest falls on deaf ears. Reasoning is lost in the “dreary desert sand of dead habit” and one is labelled reclusive and unsociable. Try hard as one may, it is impossible to make people understand.Potable water inundating the streets and going down the drain is a colossal waste! The water crisis is not just an issue to be raised in global summits or national symposia but it is the common man’s concern as well. Not so long ago, everyone was running frantically from pillar to post to procure life-saving oxygen. The pandemic is a clarion call for humanity to mend its ways. While ‘all great Neptune’s ocean’ could not wash Macbeth’s hands, at the current pace, we will pretty soon not be left even with the proverbial chullu bhar water to drown in.kalrasuruchi@yahoo.com The writer teaches English at Hindu Girls College, Jagadhri||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-wake-up-before-all-great-neptune-s-ocean-empties-101624732741088.html
27-06-2021||Chandigarh||Guest Column: Dear doctor, dear no more||“What is there to celebrate?” my colleague had shot back when I mentioned that Doctor’s Day (July 1) was just around the corner. Clearly, he was not yet over the ill-considered remarks of an acquaintance.The latter had begged my friend to arrange an ICU bed for his father whose oxygen levels had dipped dangerously after contracting Covid. My doctor friend had taken great pains to have him admitted to a private hospital despite a scarcity of beds. A week later, after his father had passed away, the same acquaintance was seen accusing doctors of unnecessarily putting patients on ventilators and expensive drugs to make money. He scathingly called them “maut ke saudagar.”The epithet, “merchants of death”, had me thinking and took me back to my introduction to this ‘merchandise.” I was a third-year medical student in the midst of a rigorous month-long maternity duty. Sadly, the lesson was delivered by a set of triplets born two months too early. They were tiny, under 800g each. The first was stillborn, the second gasped and turned blue, while the third died 15 minutes later, despite our fervent attempts to save her. For months after the incident, I was jolted out of my sleep by the weak whimpering of the preemies who had died before they were expected to be born.I was told that the guilt and grief of losing a patient hits the hardest the first time around and then it gradually becomes easier to process. However, the truth is that doctors lose a part of themselves with each patient that passes away in their care. Thus, I was apprehensive when the government recently recruited medical students to carry out Covid duties. Apart from the danger of being exposed to the infection, I wondered how they would cope with the turmoil. They may possibly become cynical, suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome, or be scarred for life as they watch medical science kneel before the might of a tiny non-organism. More importantly, I deliberated on whether it was fair to toss them into situations that may cause emotional and psychological distress before they had developed the requisite resilience?A deluge of assaultsI was struggling with these thoughts when reports of assaults on medical professionals started pouring in. The trickle quickly transformed into a deluge. Petrified, I spoke to a friend, who said it was simple mathematics. In the first wave there were fewer patients and fewer deaths, and hence fewer assaults. With an increase in mortality during the second wave, there were bound to be more dissatisfied people who needed a target for their frustration and grief. Health professionals being ‘frontline warriors’ are an easy target. Irresponsible statements by the government and self-styled healers adds fuel to the fire.Health professionals will continue to be assaulted till the time the perpetrators are not punished. Sadly, even if the miscreants are arrested, they are seldom charged. The conviction rate for mob fury, arson, assault, lynching and even murder is abysmally low in our country. Laws are in place but until they are used, they will not be a deterrent and transgressors will continue to do what they can get away with it.Social psychologists need to delve into reasons for this trend of violence against doctors. In most cases, money will emerge as the common denominator. If the monetary factor is taken out of the equation, the dissatisfaction will be considerably less. We as a society save for marriages, education, houses and vacations, but few account for expenditure on disease and disability. This unpreparedness can be blamed on false promises of “free healthcare” made by successive governments. So, when sickness strikes, funds have to be borrowed or re-purposed. It is pertinent to mention here that the ‘free’ state-run hospitals are considered incompetent and are often the last resort. Even government officials are notorious for preferring privately run hospitals for their kith and kin. If the high and mighty cannot trust the system they have put in place, then how can the common man do so.Unrealistic expectations Earlier, small nursing homes were the backbone of the healthcare system in India. These were typically set up on loans by couples who worked day and night to provide patient care at nominal rates. Due to different laws and accreditation rules, they are slowly being replaced by swanky corporate hospitals, which have better facilities under one roof. Setting up a tertiary care centre that meets the requisite guidelines costs money, which will inevitably be recovered from the patients. In such a scenario, the state is being high handed in fixing impossible rates for the private sector to function in. If the government with all its paraphernalia cannot provide reasonable healthcare to the masses, how does it expect individuals to do so?Medical professionals have faced the brunt of the Covid catastrophe. They have been subjected to the risk of exhaustion, illness and death. They have suffered moral distress while prioritising patients for ventilators and risked legal liability when asked to work beyond their core competency. They have been demeaned, discriminated against and have had their integrity doubted. There have been instances where they have been asked to vacate their homes in lieu of Covid duty. Let us ponder on that this Doctor’s Day.dr_manjugupta@icloud.comThe writer is a Gharaunda-based gynaecologist .

27-06-2021||Other||For unemployed six-day fasting teacher atop mobile tower; it’s either job or death||Patiala At a time the state’s politics has been centered around jobs and compassion, Surinderpal Singh, 36, is ready to die to get a bit of both, for himself and his 12,000 fellow unemployed, protesting ETT-TET qualified teachers. Having climbed atop a 260-foot mobile tower near Leela Bhawan in the city 98 days ago, he has been on a fast unto death for the past six days. His condition could yet become a talking point in the corridors of power. Unemployed Elementary Teachers’ Training (ETT)-Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) have been demanding a state government notification for recruitment for 12,000 vacant posts of this cadre. They are also seeking an increase in the age ceiling to 42 years, and that the government should only consider ETT teachers, while filling posts in its primary schools. The condition of Surinderpal, of Bianpur village in Gurdaspur district, deteriorated on Saturday with blood level dropping to 40mg/deciliter, following which other protesters tried persuading him to come down, but he refused to yield. “I did not climb up to come down without the government giving it in writing that it will accept our demands and will deliver on these in a specified time,” Surenderpal, who has eaten only what other protesters brought to him atop the tower said. For answering nature’s call, he had a pot with him, yet took only the bare minimum of food to avoid inconveniencing anyone. Last week, he had sought permission from the state government to kill himself. His father, Paras Ram, 80, who still works as a salesman in the local vegetable market, said, “It is fearful to see my well-educated and qualified son start such a tough struggle to get a job for himself and for others.” “Previously, I wanted him to stay atop the mobile tower till the government me their demands. Now, however, I fear for his life. I want him to come down and then continue the fight for his rights,” a tearful father said, adding that he had spoken to his son over phone three days ago. Deep Banarsi, the leader of ETT-TET qualified unions, said they have been trying to convince Surinderpal to come down for days, but he had put his life in danger for deaf and dumb government authorities.“We are sending other members atop on a rotational basis to take stock of his health. We believe that he is now at a stage where he does not fear death. At 260-ft, the weather gets extremely harsh (cold) at night and you have to limit your water, food intake to avoid urinating or passing stool,” Banarsi added. Patiala deputy commissioner Kumar Amit said, “I have held over 15 meetings with the union and also arranged their meetings with top officials and the education minister. We are aware of the deteriorating health of Surinderpal and are in talks to get him to climb down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/for-unemployed-six-day-fasting-teacher-atop-mobile-tower-it-s-either-job-or-death-101624732501067.html

27-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt decides to take over private schools for violating RTE norms||The Delhi government has decided to take over the management of a private aided school in Punjabi Bagh after receiving complaints from parents about arbitrary extra fees allegedly being charged in violation of the Right to Education (RTE) act, 2009.In a statement issued on Saturday, the government alleged that Swami Sivananda Memorial School in Punjabi Bagh was also deliberately failing its students and asking them to repeat the same grade. “Taking into account the complaints of parents, Delhi government constituted an inquiry committee for this matter. The committee found inadequacies in the functioning of the school and found that the issues raised by parents about the school are true. Upon presenting the report, the school management was given a chance to defend itself but they were unable to give any reasonable answers about the anomalies in its functioning,” the statement read.“Considering the inadequacies and complaints which were found to be correct, Delhi government has decided to initiate the process of taking over the school management as per the provisions of Delhi School Education Act of 1973,” the statement added.Ashok Rao, general secretary of the society that runs school, denied all allegations and said that the management did not receive any communication from the Delhi government till Saturday evening. “The school has not changed any extra fees from parents. What government is referring to as extra are charges parents willingly accepted to pay for some additional facilities. Besides, the school did not fail anyone deliberately. If we were failing students like that, we would not have had 500-plus enrollment that we have currently.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-decides-to-take-over-private-schools-for-violating-rte-norms-101624731720502.html
27-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi adds 85 Covid-19 cases, fewest in over 420 days||The city on Saturday reported just 85 new cases of Covid-19, the fewest in a day since April 30 last year, and the second time in a week that the city added less than 100 fresh infections.The city has now added an average of 110 new cases a day over the past week, the lowest in 427 days, going back to end-April last year, before even the first surge of infections hit the Capital.The test positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive — also dropped to an all-time low of 0.12%. Experts regard the positivity rate as a crucial metric to gauge the spread of an infection, and the World Health Organization (WHO) says that an outbreak can be considered to be under control in a region when this number is below 5% for a two-week period.In Delhi, the positivity rate has stayed below this threshold for 37 days and below 1% for 27 days, shows data shared by the state government.The positivity rate remained below 1% for 82 consecutive days between end-December and mid-March.Meanwhile, nine more people died of the infection on Saturday, showed the state government’s health bulletin. The city has added fewer than 10 fatalities of the infection for five consecutive days now.The number of people with the infection in city hospitals stands at just over 1,000. At the peak of the fourth wave in Delhi, there were over 20,000 people in hospitals, as per the data shared by the Delhi government.“Once a large proportion of the people have been exposed to the infection, it becomes endemic, occurring in small numbers in pockets. Such low level of infection is only possible when endemic levels have been reached. Delhi along with places like Maharashtra and Punjab that saw the explosion of cases initially have reached the endemic levels and the entire country is likely to follow soon, probably by mid-July,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/capital-adds-85-covid-19-cases-fewest-in-over-420-days-101624731721129.html

27-06-2021||Delhi||Nobody should be short of oxygen in third wave, says Delhi CM Kejriwal||A day after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) sparred over an interim report on Delhi’s oxygen requirement during the second Covid-19 wave, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged the central government to work together “so that no one is short of oxygen in the third wave”.“If your fight over oxygen is over, can we get back to work? Let’s make such a system together so that no one suffers due to lack of oxygen in the third wave. In the second wave, people faced a severe shortage of medical oxygen. Now this should not happen in the third wave. If we fight amongst ourselves, then corona will win. If we fight together, the country will win,” Kejriwal said in a tweet in Hindi on Saturday.Also Read| Oxygen audit panel report not final, says subgroup chief Dr GuleriaA political battle broke out between Delhi’s AAP government and the BJP on Friday over an interim report by a subgroup under the Supreme Court-appointed panel to audit oxygen utilisation in the Capital. This, even as questions remained about whether this version of the report was meant for submission to the court, and whether everyone in the panel had signed off on it. The report said Delhi’s administrations and hospitals exaggerated the demand for medical oxygen, which the BJP drew on to attack the CM.On Saturday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia slammed the BJP-led central government and called it “Bharatiya Jhagda Party”. In a tweet in Hindi on Saturday, Sisodia said: “The leaders of Bharatiya Jhagda Party only know how to fight. They are concerned neither about [the availability of] oxygen nor about the third wave. When the third wave will hit the country, then they will move to some other state to fight elections [and] make people quarrel among each other. Once the election is over, they will again resume attacking and fighting with the elected governments in different states.”The Delhi BJP, in its response, said the AAP leaders refuse to be held accountable for anything. “The problem with AAP leaders is that they refuse to be accountable. Ever since the report prepared by the SC-mandated committee highlighted how the Kejriwal government failed to handle the oxygen crisis in Delhi, the AAP leaders have been raising irrelevant issues to avoid a reply on the main issues pointed by the committee,” said Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor.Also Read| BJP slams Delhi government for ‘exaggerating’ oxygen requirementThe report suggested there was “gross discrepancy” in recording the requirement of medical oxygen by 183 of Delhi’s hospitals, claiming that the government projected an oxygen demand of 1,140MT as opposed to the actual requirement of 209MT. It also assessed the oxygen demand in a meeting on May 13 as 290-400MT, at a time when representatives of the state government continued to seek 500MT of oxygen.The Delhi government has said that the report was invalid, and its findings incorrect. In a tweet in Hindi on Friday, the Delhi CM said: “My crime — I fought for the breath of my two crore people. When you were doing an election rally, I was awake all night arranging for oxygen. I fought, pleaded to get oxygen for people. People have lost their loved ones due to lack of oxygen. Don’t call them liars, they are feeling so bad.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nobody-should-be-short-of-oxygen-in-third-wave-says-delhi-cm-kejriwal-101624731361020.html

This will not only help us control pollution levels but also increase greenery for future generations,” Rai said.Meanwhile, the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) also started its mass plantation drive on Saturday as part of the ‘Van Mahotsav’, setting a target of planting 3,850 saplings, and five lakh shrubs this monsoon.On Saturday morning, NDMC chairperson Dharmendra, secretary B M Mishra and other senior officials, along with some morning walkers, planted saplings of kalpvriksh, putranjiva, amaltas and other indigenous varieties of trees across Nehru Park.Other areas where saplings were planted are Safdarjung Road, Palika Niketan, RK Puram sector-10, Lodi Garden, Shankar Road, Talkatora Garden, Pandara Road, Jai Singh Road, Central Park Connaught Place, Lodi Colony, Teen Murti Marg, Maharishi Raman Marg, Moti Bagh, and Mandir Marg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-environment-minister-gopal-rai-kicks-off-plantation-drive-in-capital-101624731301000.html
27-06-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt launches three-stage teaching-learning action plan for its schools||Re-connect with students, provide emotional support and bridge learning gaps, and then begin academic activities — this was a three-stage action plan Delhi government released on Saturday for the ongoing academic sessions for nursery till Class 12 in all its schools, while reiterating that schools in the national capital will continue to remain closed till further orders, in view of the covid-19 pandemic. The government also said it will regularly assess students using “innovative methods”.Schools in the national capital have mostly been closed since last March in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and the teaching-learning process has shifted to online or hybrid modes in that time. Institutions reopened briefly for classes 9 to 12 between January and February only for remedial classes, practical work, and pre-boards/mid-term examinations, and the government later ordered schools to close when the second wave of the pandemic hit in April.According to the action plan released by the Delhi government’s directorate of education (DoE), in the first stage, between June 28 and July 3, schools will start reconnecting with students. During this time, teachers and heads of schools will contact students and parents, update contact details, set up WhatsApp groups and prepare a list of students without smartphones or cellphones.In the second stage, between July 5 and July 31, schools will provide emotional support to students and try to bridge learning gaps, the government said in a statement.Emphasising the importance of providing emotional support, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said, “The learning loss has been massive due to the onset of the pandemic. This year, we not only need to reduce learning loss but also provide deep emotional support to our children. They need to be mentally prepared for any teaching-learning activities.”The third stage will begin from August 2, when schools start conducting regular subject-wise online classes and also provide worksheets and hard copies of assignments to the students who do not have access to digital devices or internet connectivity. “Students who have difficulty accessing digital devices will be provided short notes capturing the points of their online classes. These notes can be collected by the parents from the school on a weekly basis. Similarly, the parents who do not have smartphones can collect the worksheets on a weekly basis from the school of their child,” a circular issued by the DoE said.The Delhi government also that it will assess students every month using an “innovative approach” to understand their participation and learning levels. “The nature of these assessments will be based on project/activity/assignment. It shall assess the foundational competencies, effective knowledge, understanding, critical thinking, analytical approach, problem-solving, and creativity, etc using the content of the month as reference,” the DoE circular added.Principals of Delhi government schools welcomed the action plan.“It’s good that the government is planning to first provide emotional support to students before starting the teaching-learning process. This is necessary, considering the emotional trauma they went through during the second Covid-19 wave,” said Dr Devinder, principal of a government school in Rouse Avenue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-launches-three-stage-teaching-learning-action-plan-for-its-schools-101624731300398.html

27-06-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: When film-making resembled like theatre rehearsals...||The writing process of “Nautanki Saala” started sometime during the end of May 2012. Actually, the project did not have an official title then and we were going ahead with the literal Hindi translation of the original French movie (named ‘Après Vous’) “Pehle Aap”. I shifted to Mumbai since I knew that this was now a concrete project in hand. Also, this was the first project wherein a rough shooting schedule was already drawn up. So, there was a deadline to meet. That was because the actors had been finalised on the basis of the original film and they were kind enough to place their trust in us — writers. Rohan just told me to go with the flow and continue creating scenes without moving away from the story of the original film. Also, time was of the essence as the actors had already given their dates. My friends had planned a weeklong vacation long before I had signed this film. But I looked at it like a perfect writing getaway. They would go out during the day, I would stay in the room and write non-stop. By the time they returned, it would usually be late and even I would get a chance to take a break and unwind. I managed to write the entire flow of events of the film during the week and sent it to Rohan. It was a mixed document. Some scenes had dialogues. Others only had a scene description. I did this as I wanted him to have an idea of the complete picture as soon as possible. Even he responded well and resent the document to me, breaking it down in sequences. I knew the basic theory of screenwriting, that it had three main parts – introduction, conflict and resolution. I also knew that as a rule of thumb these three were also divided in percentages and that the “conflict” part would take up most of the pages of a script. To be honest, while writing my previous scripts, I used to start well but lose my way somewhere in the middle, and then try to salvage the end hurriedly. I was still developing my craft. Since I had a ready film handy while writing this script, I did not face that issue. But the breakdown of the script in sequences just opened my eyes to a different way of writing scripts – one that I tend to follow now. Rohan and my co-writer Charudutt Acharya, introduced me to the eight-sequence approach to writing. It follows the three-act structure, but it further divides the script into smaller, manageable sequences. Also, writing in a film writing software helped in leaps and bounds. I had read a few screenplays before so I knew the syntax. But, actually using a software instead of a normal word processor made me write faster. And I finished the entire script, complete with dialogues and song situations in the coming week. Once the script was ready, I took a printout and felt happy that I was able to write nearly a hundred and twenty pages! There was a problem with that too though. It meant that the film was most likely longer than it should have been. Usually one page is about a minute or seventy-five seconds of screen-time. Plus, there were four songs in the film. So, this was already a hundred-and-fifty-minute-long film. So, one of the most important part of the next draft was to edit it. To do this, Charu, Rohan and I sat in one room and connected the laptop to the projector. We could now read the script on a much larger screen and that helped in focusing more on each and every written word. Without taking out any scene or any line of dialogue, we just changed the language of the scene descriptions and made similar cosmetic changes. We managed to make the script a lot cleaner and reduced its size by nearly seven pages! After multiple readings of the script in front of different department heads and actors, even we started realising which scenes, which dialogues were working and which were not. Newer versions with changes were being created every day. Sometimes more than one newer version was written in a day. As we neared the commencement of principal photography, rehearsals were organised. It was a pleasant surprise for me as they resembled a lot like theatre rehearsals, that I was used to. I felt at home here. Those rehearsals helped us further identify problem areas in the scripts. Scenes that were working on paper, but felt flat while performing. We got a chance to improve them there and then instead of wasting everyone’s time on set. Principal photography began in a few weeks. It was a surreal feeling. Not only because I had written something. The script was in the hands of almost every person on set. Every department was referring to it while working. I was part of the team that had created a document which was the base for the work of every other department. I had never looked at a script from that point of view before, and now I cannot unsee that!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-when-film-making-resembled-like-theatre-rehearsals-101624719359816.html
27-06-2021||Chandigarh||Chaos in Chandigarh as farmers break police barricades to enter UT||Farmers from Punjab broke police barricades on the Mohali-Chandigarh border to march into the Union Territory en route to Raj Bhawan on Saturday afternoon before they were stopped at the Press light point on Madhya Marg, a few kilometres from governor VP Singh Badnore’s official residence. Another group of farmers from Haryana was headed for the state capital from the Panchkula-Yamunanagar highway around the same time but was stopped at the Chandigarh border. Though the police had issued an advisory to avoid certain routes in view of the protest march called by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha to mark seven months of the farm agitation, traffic came to a standstill in Chandigarh between 1pm and 4:30pm. Traffic snarls were also reported in parts of Panchkula. Police use water cannons Supporters of 32 farm organisations starting gathering at the Amb Sahib Gurdwara in Mohali from where they started their march towards Chandigarh around 12:40pm. Chandigarh Police had sealed 13 entry points into the city and even put up PCR vehicles, CTU buses and barbed wires to barricade the roads, but farmers rode through without much resistance with the help of tractors. Police even resorted to the use of water cannons near YPS Chowk (Mataur barrier), but by 2pm, the farmers coming from Mohali reached Sectors 17 and 22, the heart of the city. Both the governors reside near Sukhna Lake at the northern end of the city. The area was barricaded to prevent them from reaching the area. The farmers were stopped by the police near the Press light point. An officer from the governor’s office took the memorandum from the farmers, following which many went back on their own and some were dropped in buses till the Chandigarh border. Around 1,500 cops had been deployed in the city. “Police personnel handled the situation very maturely, and barring a minor altercation, the protest passed off peacefully,” said senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh, Kuldeep Singh Chahal. Haryana farmers stop at border The group coming from Haryana was being led by activist Yogendra Yadav and Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union president Gurnam Singh Chaduni. The farmers started gathering outside Nada Sahib Gurdwara since early morning and started the march towards the Housing Board Chowk (Chandigarh-Panchkula border) post noon. However, amid heavy police deployment, they did not enter Chandigarh and handed over a memorandum addressed to Satyadev Narayan Arya to an officer of the Haryana governor’s secretariat in Panchkula. Police said no untoward incident was reported. Deputy commissioner of police, Panchkula, Mohit Handa said: “We were constantly in touch with farm leader and dealt the situation with dialogue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chaos-in-chandigarh-as-farmers-break-police-barricades-to-enter-ut-101624704119720.html

He lashed out at his successor, President Joe Biden, and reiterated false claims about losing in a rigged 2020 election.“We won the election twice and it’s possible we’ll have to win it a third time. It’s possible,” Trump said at the rally in Wellington, Ohio, a state he won comfortably in 2016 and 2020. He lost the overall election in 2020, but continues to call it a victory and the reference to possible success in 2024 a “third time”.Trump hasn’t yet announced his intention to run again, but has hinted it several times, signaling that he is not prepared yet to end his unconventional tryst with US politics.He is seeking to tighten his grip on the Republican Party as its strongest and most popular leader around, disbursing endorsements to supporters and punishment to recalcitrant Republicans who have either opposed him, criticised him or voted to impeach him.Saturday’s rally was intended, among other things, to support Max Miller, a former Trump White House aide who is challenging sitting Republican member of the House of Representatives Anthony Gonzalez, one of the 10 Republican congress members who voted to impeach Trump for the January 6 Capitol riot.Trump has vowed to campaign against all 10 in the 2022 elections in which Republicans are seeking to wrest both chambers of congress - the Senate and the House - from Democrats who control them now with razor-thin majorities.They are evenly matched in the Senate, where US vice-president Kamala Harris’s tie-breaker vote gives Democrats the edge.“We will take back the House, we will take back the Senate, and we will take back America, and we will do it soon,” Trump said at the rally.Trump portrayed his successor, President Biden, as weak and as someone who is endangering America’s strength and compromising its advantages abroad by returning to the agreements he had walked out of - such as the Paris accord on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-teases-possible-2024-run-at-his-1st-big-rally-since-leaving-white-house-101624818548932.html

Few details have been provided by authorities on the charges against the women or on sporadic trials that have been closed to the public.Their release follows that of prominent activist Loujain al-Hathloul in February who had served half of her custodial sentence on broad cybercrime and counterterrorism charges. She still faces a five-year travel ban.Human Rights Watch welcomed the report by ALQST on Twitter of the release of Badawi and Sadah: "These brave women should have never been detained in the first place. They should have been appreciated for leading change in Saudi Arabia."Badawi received the United States' International Women of Courage Award in 2012 for challenging the Saudi male guardianship system, and was among the first women who signed a petition calling on the government to allow women to drive and to vote and run in local elections.Sadah, from the restive Shi'ite-majority Qatif province, has also campaigned to abolish the guardianship system.CrackdownThe women's rights activists were detained before and after the kingdom in 2018 lifted a ban on women driving as part of social reforms that have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent that has also netted clerics and intellectuals.Badawi's former husband is serving a 15-year jail sentence for human rights activism. Her brother Raif Badawi, a prominent blogger, is serving a 10-year sentence on charges of insulting Islam and for cyber crime.U.S. President Joe Biden's administration has taken a tough stance over Saudi Arabia's human rights record, which came under the spotlight after the October 2018 murder of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.Washington in February released an intelligence report implicating de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Khashoggi's killing. The prince denies any involvement.In April, the State Department voiced concern about the sentencing of a Saudi aid worker by a counterterrorism court to 20 years in prison followed by a 20-year travel ban.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-releases-two-women-activists-detained-3-years-ago-says-rights-group-101624806269610.html

US forces had invaded the country following the September 11 twin tower attack, and Pakistan had joined the “war on terror” providing assistance in exchange of American support.The foreign minister’s admission comes a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan told reporters that Pakistan will be sealing its border, the Durand Line, with Afghanistan if the Taliban attempts to take over the country with their military might.“What if [the] Taliban try to take over Afghanistan through [the] military? Then we will seal the border because now we can, because we have fenced our border, which was previously [open], because Pakistan does not want to get into, number one, conflict. Secondly, we do not want another influx of refugees,” Khan said.The Durand Line which separates Pakistan and Afghanistan has become a contentious issue for both countries ever since Pakistan started fencing it during Khan’s tenure. Afghanistan claims this geopolitical boundary drawn by British Colonial administrator Sir Henry Mortimer Durand in 1893 has no “legal sanctity”.Pakistan on its part is hopeful that this 2,640 Kilometer long fenced barrier will deter a refugee influx of ethnic Pashtuns into the country if the Taliban take over. In 1989, after the Soviet Union had withdrawn its troops from Afghanistan a bloody civil car had broken out in the country, forcing millions of Afghans to cross over to Pakistan. Khan and his government, fearing a similar wave of refugees post US withdrawal, are racing against time to finish fencing its border hoping to keep history from repeating itself.Khan criticised the decision to withdraw troops claiming that the leverage Pakistan had over the Taliban has been diminished by US withdrawing troops. “...reason is that the moment the United States gave a date of exit, Taliban basically claimed victory. They’re thinking that they won the war. And so, therefore, our ability to influence them diminishes the stronger they feel," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-will-shut-its-border-with-afghanistan-in-national-interest-if-taliban-takes-over-post-us-withdrawal-101624813032555.html

Hopeful patients have bombarded doctors with their queries after FDA approved Biogen’s Aduhelm for Alzheimer’s disease, an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, and eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks. Alzheimer’s patients want to know whether the drug might be right for them.“It's not a simple yes or no,” said Dr Alireza Atri, a neurologist at the Banner Sun Health Research Institute in Arizona.Doctors are still trying to figure out who should receive the drug which does not reverse mental decline but, at best, slows the disease marginally. The approval of Aduhelm itself was controversial and triggered a swift backlash from many experts. Three experts even resigned from an FDA committee over the agency’s decision to approve a medicine that only slowed the mental decline in one study that was marred by hard-to-interpret results.Also Read | Exercise training may prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease, says studyAduhelm is the first Alzheimer's medication in nearly 20 years and has been granted conditional approval based on its ability to get rid of harmful clumps of plaque in the brains of patients with early forms of the disease. The approval, however, isn't limited to those early patients and anyone with Alzheimer's, at least theoretically, could get prescribed the drug.“Currently available therapies only treat symptoms of the disease; this treatment option is the first therapy to target and affect the underlying disease process of Alzheimer’s," Patrizia Cavazzoni, MD, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement after the approval.Many providers have said that it will take weeks or months before they are ready to give the drug as insurers still need to determine which patients to cover for the expensive treatment that could cost more than $50,000 a year. Doctors worry that emotions will affect decisions by patients and families in seeking the drug.“People are desperate. It's a really horrible disease,” said Stanford University's Dr Michael Greicius, but added that he has no plans to prescribe Aduhelm.“I don't think there's sufficient evidence that it works, and there's plenty of evidence that it can harm patients,” he said, questioning the efficacy of the FDA-approved medicine.Also Read | Covid-19 linked with Alzheimer's disease-like cognitive impairment: StudyGreicius said he plans to lay out a “compelling and compassionate” case for not providing the drug to his patients but he worries that some patients may simply turn to other doctors to get the prescription.Apart from the side effects of Aduhelm, doctors worry that an earlier diagnosis combined with the drug's incremental benefit may simply prolong the hardships of those caring for someone with Alzheimer's.“It could turn out that it actually increases your caregiver burden if it's just slowing things down a little bit,” said Dr Suzanne Schindler of Washington University in St. Louis. “I think it's going to be really disappointing for a lot of people.”(With AP inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-are-desperate-fda-approved-alzheimer-s-drug-causes-worry-for-doctors-101624809608466.html
27-06-2021||World||Death toll in Florida condo collapse rises to 9, over 150 still unaccounted for||The death toll from the collapse of a Florida beachfront condo building has risen to nine as search-and-rescue efforts continue, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Sunday.One person died in the hospital, and workers pulled four more bodies from the wreckage, the mayor said.Scores of rescue workers remained on the massive pile of rubble, working to find survivors among the more than 150 people who remain unaccounted for. Four of the dead have been identified and next of kin notified, the mayor said.Four days after Thursday's collapse, more than 150 people remain unaccounted for in Surfside, and authorities and loved ones fear the toll will go much higher.As rotating teams of rescuers used heavy machinery and power tools to clear the rubble from the top and tunnel in from below, the Noriega family hoped that their 92-year-old matriarch, Hilda Noriega, had somehow survived.When Mike Noriega heard that part of the condominium tower where his grandmother lived had collapsed, he rushed with his father to the scene. They arrived at a nightmarish 30-foot pile of broken concrete and mangled metal, the remains of the 12-story building known as Champlain Towers South.But among the flying debris, they stumbled across mementos that bore witness to Hilda’s life on the sixth floor: an old picture of her with her late husband and their infant son, and a birthday card that friends from her prayer group sent two weeks earlier with the acronym “ESM,” Spanish for “hand-delivered,” scrawled across the yellow envelope with a butterfly etching.“There was a message in the mess of all this,” said Mike Noriega, who last spoke with his grandmother the day before the disaster. “It means not to give up hope. To have faith.”Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett sought to assure families Sunday that rescuers were working nonstop. “Nothing else on our mind, with the only objective of pulling their family members out of that rubble,” he told ABC’s “This Week.”“We’re not going to stop doing that -- not today, not tomorrow, not the next day. We’re going to keep going until everybody’s out.”The Noriega family described Hilda as a fiercely independent and vivacious retiree — in Mike's words, “the youngest 92-year-old I know ... 92 going on 62.”Hilda Noriega had called Champlain Towers South home for more than 20 years. But six years after her husband's death, she was ready to leave. The condo was for sale, and she planned to move in with family.She loved living near the ocean and friends, but “when you lose a spouse, you want to be surrounded by family ... and she wanted to spend more time with her family and grandchildren,” said Sally Noriega, Hilda's daughter-in-law.Hilda Noriega was a loving person who built a life with her husband and raised a family after coming to the U.S. from Cuba in 1960, her daughter-in-law said.“She was just one of those people who from the first time she met a person she instantly loved that person, and that person instantly loved her,” Sally said.Carlos Noriega, Hilda's son and police chief of nearby North Bay Village, was one of the emergency responders atop the pile.The Noriegas don't entirely know what to make of the treasured mementos found amid the chaos, but Sally said: “We are a family of faith. We’ll just leave it at that.”They are among dozens of anguished families awaiting word on the fate of loved ones. The wait has been agonizing.The atmosphere inside a hotel ballroom where around 200 family members were being briefed by authorities Saturday was tense, two people present told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations.The two said families frustrated with the slow pace of recovery efforts had demanded they be allowed to go to the scene and attempt a collective shout — an attempt as much to find survivors as a cathartic farewell to those who had died.The mayor said Saturday that the identification of three bodies had dropped the number of people unaccounted for down to 156, and crews also discovered other unspecified human remains. The remains are being sent to the medical examiner, and authorities are gathering DNA samples from family members to aid in identification.A video posted online showed an official briefing families. When he said they had found remains among the rubble, people began sobbing.Late Saturday, four of the victims were identified, as Stacie Dawn Fang, 54; Antonio Lozano, 83, and Gladys Lozano, 79; and Manuel LaFont, 54.Burkett said a city official had led a cursory review of the nearby Champlain Towers North and Champlain Towers East buildings but “didn’t find anything out of the ordinary.”The news came after word of a 2018 engineering report that showed the building, which was built in 1981, had “major structural damage” to a concrete slab below its pool deck that needed extensive repairs, part of a series of documents released by the city of Surfside.Further documentation showed the estimated cost of the repairs would total over $9 million. That included more than $3.8 million for garage, entrance and pool remediation and nearly $3.2 million for fixes to the exterior façade.While officials said no cause for the collapse early Thursday has been determined, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said a “definitive answer” was needed in a timely manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-in-florida-condo-collapse-rises-to-9-over-150-still-unaccounted-for-101624809839490.html

These reactions come days after Kim’s appearance on state television following months of absence from the public eye."Seeing respected general secretary (Kim Jong Un) looking emaciated breaks our people's heart so much," a North Korean citizen told the state broadcaster, reported Reuters."Everyone is saying that their tears welled up," he added.Reports of Kim’s weight loss began to do the rounds after footage of North Koreans watching a clip of plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea held on June 17 on a giant screen in an unspecified location was broadcasted on the official state television channel, reported Reuters.North Korea analysts who studied the footage closely said Kim appeared to have lost weight as the strap of his expensive watch appeared tighter and his face looked significantly thinner. The 37-year old who is around 5ft 8 inches tall and weighs 140 kilograms may have lost as much as 10-20 kilograms, reported the Associated Press.Also Read: US has 'wrong' expectation for dialogue: Kim Yo JongKim, who is himself fond of liquor and smoking, comes from a family with a history of heart disease.

Yo-jong is also believed to be her brother’s successor.Hong Min, a senior scholar at the Seoul-based Korea Institute for National Unification, told the Associated Press that the apparent weight loss can also be a sign of the Supreme Leader’s attempts to improve his lifestyle. Min insisted that if his health was indeed failing he would not make an appearance in public to address an important plenary meeting of his party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-koreans-are-heartbroken-over-kim-jong-un-s-recent-weight-loss-101624804135176.html

Many EU member states have started issuing the digital “vaccine passport” that will enable Europeans to move freely for work or tourism. The immunity passport will serve as proof that a person has been vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), or recently tested negative for the virus, or has the natural immunity built up from earlier infection.While the European Union had earlier said that member states should issue the certificates regardless of the type of Covid-19 vaccine, the technical specifications of the ‘Green Pass’ indicate that obligation would be limited to “vaccines that have received EU-wide marketing authorization.”At present, four vaccines have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that can be used in the EU member states: Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech), Moderna, Vaxzervria (AstraZeneca), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson).Also Read | Can Indians travel to Germany, South Korea, US? Check latest visa, vaccine rulesCovishield, a version of AstraZeneca Covid vaccine manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), has not been approved by the EMA for the European market. The EU green pass will only recognise the Vaxzervria version of the AstraZeneca vaccine that is manufactured in the UK or other sites around Europe.The recipients of Covishield largely include Indians and citizens of low- and middle-income countries who were immunised with vaccines distributed by the WHO co-sponsored COVAX initiative.However, member states have the option to accept other vaccination certificates in case the travellers have received Covid-19 vaccines not approved by the EMA.According to the website schengenvisainfo.com, Iceland will allow restriction-free entry to those who have been vaccinated with one of the vaccines authorised by the EMA or the WHO. Apart from the EMA-approved vaccines, the UN health agency has included Covishield, CoronaVac, and Sinopharm under its Emergency Use List.On the other hand, France has clarified that it will facilitate easy entry for those vaccinated with one of the EMA-approved vaccines, and not others, like the Russian and Indian vaccines.EU leaders expect to have vaccinated around 70% of the adult population in the region when the digital certificate will be available for use. The vaccination certificate is not a substitute for a travel document and holders must also provide a passport or identity card.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covishield-excluded-from-new-eu-covid-green-pass-even-after-who-approval-101624803271741.html

Sir Peter Horby, the chairman of the UK’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the modelling of the Alpha variant, first detected in Kent, allowed scientists to predict its transmissibility and spread.“That same modelling for the Delta variant would suggest that that’s a more transmissible strain, it will be very difficult to control and so I think we will see it spreading in Europe, unfortunately,” Horby, also a professor of emerging infectious diseases in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, said.The UK government faced criticism for not implementing stronger border measures to check the spread of the Delta variant earlier this summer. Britain expanded its travel “red list” only after the second wave of coronavirus, believed to be largely driven by the Delta variant, had started wreaking havoc in India.Also Read | Bangladesh to Australia: List of countries imposing fresh curbs due to Delta variantWhen asked whether a delay in stronger border measures allowed the Delta variant to become the dominant strain, Horby said that it’s clear that the variant, first detected in India, started to spread within the UK after its introductions from other countries.“So I think there is a case to be said that that did happen and stronger border measures may have delayed that, may even have prevented it. But there is an obvious trade-off that policymakers and politicians have to make between absolute complete restrictions and stopping various viruses coming in,” Horby told BBC.World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Friday said that the Delta variant, first identified in India, is spreading in at least 85 countries, adding that it is the “most transmissible of the variants identified so far”.Britain has already extended the full reopening of businesses by four weeks and countries across the world, including Bangladesh, Australia, and Israel, have started imposing restrictions due to the fresh surge. More than 70% of coronavirus cases in Portugal’s Lisbon region are from the Delta variant, which is said to be rapidly spreading to other parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-variant-will-spread-across-europe-says-expert-amid-virus-surge-101624796224818.html

Speaking to Geo News, Chaudhry stressed that Pakistan considers Osama bin Laden a terrorist and al-Qaeda as a terrorist outfit.Addressing Pakistan’s national assembly in June last year, Imran Khan had termed bin Laden, who was killed in 2011 by US special forces in Abbottabad, a “martyr.” "I will never forget how we Pakistanis were embarrassed when the Americans came into Abbottabad and killed Osama bin Laden, martyred him," Khan had said.Pakistan was not informed in advance when the US Navy Seals carried out Operation Neptune Spear to eliminate Osama bin Laden under cover of darkness in Abbottabad. Bin Laden was accused of engineering a number of terror attacks worldwide, particularly targeting the American installations including the twin towers of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.Also Read | Osama bin Laden supported, funded Nawaz Sharif: Ex-Pak envoy Abida HussainImran Khan had come under fire from opposition leaders for portraying bin Laden as a “martyr.” "He destroyed my nation, and [Khan] is calling him a martyr," former foreign minister Khawaja Asif had then blasted Khan in the parliament. Imran Khan’s remark on the slain al-Qaeda terrorist resurfaced after a year following Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s recent interview with TOLO News."He [Imran Khan] was quoted out of context. And, uh, you know, a particular section of the media played it up," Qureshi said.When the foreign minister was pressed by the interviewer whether he disagreed that bin Laden was a martyr, he took a brief pause and said, "I will let that pass."Qureshi also deflected blame from the Taliban for the surge in violence in neighbouring Afghanistan. “You try and create this impression that the violence is high because of Taliban, again, that would be an exaggeration. Aren't there other elements over there who are playing the role of a spoiler?” said Qureshi, suggesting that Islamic State and the Afghan government were responsible.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-calling-osama-bin-laden-martyr-was-slip-of-tongue-says-pak-minister-101624791534542.html

The 50-page document was discovered with the help of an anonymous tip to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The UK government said that it was investigating how the documents landed there, adding that an internal inquiry had been launched into the matter.Also Read | How Matt Hancock footage got leaked to press, UK to investigateAccording to news agency AFP, the documents found at the bus stop contained 50 pages of top-secret information about Britain's ministry of defence, including a possible military presence in Afghanistan at the end of NATO operations there. Primarily, however, the papers dealt with the Russian reaction to the passage of a British warship through Ukrainian waters off the coast of Crimea.The warship in context is a British navy destroyer named the HMS Defender, which is sailing close to the coast of Crimea, as per the BBC. Russia had annexed Crimea from Ukraine back in 2014, so it saw the British destroyer's presence in the Black Sea as a violation of its territorial waters and fired a series of warning shots in retaliation, the broadcaster added.It is to be noted that Russia's annexation of Crimea has still not been recognised by a vast majority of the international community. The UK, however, had denied any malintent and said the ship was simply making "an innocent passage through Ukrainian territorial waters in accordance with international law."Also Read | UK liaison officer at Indian navy facility that monitors threats in Indian OceanNow, the retrieved documents seem to show that Britain already knew the kind of reaction it would provoke from Russia and yet continued to pursue its course, lest an alternate route made Moscow think of the UK as "being scared/running away". The papers also revealed that by letting the warship take this route, the UK government was, after all, hoping to gain an opportunity to "engage with the Ukrainian government... in what the UK recognises as Ukrainian territorial waters."The secret documents retrieved at the Kent bus stop were reported lost from the Ministry of Defence last week, the government said, adding that investigation is underway into the matter. "It shouldn't be able to happen," Brandon Lewis, minister for Northern Ireland, was quoted as saying. "It was properly reported at the time... there's an internal investigation into that situation," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-government-s-top-secret-defence-documents-found-at-bus-stop-in-kent-101624788619838.html
27-06-2021||World||Xi Jinping’s continuation in power could be ‘very destabilising’ for party: Experts||The Communist Party of China (CPC), with President Xi Jinping at the helm of affairs, is gearing up to celebrate its centenary on July 1. While the 90 million-strong member CPC has gone back to one leader party, especially after the removal of the two-term limit on the presidency, experts warn that continuation of Xi after two terms could potentially be “very destabilising” for the party in the future.In a deviation from normal practice, CPC did not name a successor to the General Secretary during the second tenure of the party leadership, and the Chinese president is expected to remain as their paramount leader during the reshuffle of the party’s governing bodies at the twice-a-decade Party Congress next year.South China Morning Post said in its report Friday that the twice-a-decade Party Congress next year will shed light on how he plans to tackle succession. According to the Hong Kong-based daily, the succession plan could prove to be Xi’s biggest challenge and will shape the party for decades to come.Also Read | China inaugurates 1st fully electrified bullet train near Indo-Tibetan borderDeng Xiaoping, the moderate “paramount leader” of CPC who guided the party till 1997, invented a collective leadership structure that accommodated all groups and sections within the party. But Xi, unlike his predecessors, did not endorse a successor at the end of his first term in 2017 and observers suggest that the emergence of a new leadership line-up next year remains highly unlikely.Amid global adversity in the wake of a pandemic, Xi’s supporters project his leadership as the need of the hour for the country but, according to Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London, that could spell trouble for the party. “When succession finally looms, it can potentially be very destabilising if the structure and/or process is not clear and well defined,” Tsang told the Washington Post.Also Read | Rap turns ‘100%’ patriotic in China for Communist party’s 100th birthdayNis Gruenberg, a senior analyst at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, told SCMP that though Xi has bought more time to establish his vision of the party-state by abolishing term limits, he has also inserted “enormous uncertainty” into the leadership system, “which...could destabilise the leadership system as soon as Xi...has gone.”Xi has solidified his own leadership position but potentially pushed the country towards a destabilising succession crisis, according to a joint report by the Centre for Strategic International Studies in the US and the Lowy Institute in Australia. The report, published earlier in April, suggests that China’s political path is shrouded in great uncertainty.“The global impact of a twenty-first century succession crisis would be immense,” the think-tanks said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-s-continuation-in-power-could-be-destabilising-for-party-experts-101624787129652.html
27-06-2021||World||Joe Biden may not visit Japan for Olympics, First Lady likely to attend: Report||US president Joe Biden may not be visiting Japan for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, reported a regional newspaper on Sunday. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, it is likely that the US president's wife, First lady Jill Biden, will be making the trip on her own. Japan is looking forward to hosting her for the opening ceremony on July 23 and a possible meeting with prime minister Yoshihide Suga afterward, the newspaper added, without specifying its sources.Notably, US president Joe Biden has oft confirmed his support for Japanese prime minister Suga in holding the 2020 Tokyo Olympics this year, despite the threat of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic looming in the air. Japan is the United States' major ally in Asia, and it seems like Biden intends relations to remain cordial, with an eye on furthering diplomacies in the Korean peninsula.The 2020 Summer Olympics is scheduled to be held from July 23 to August 8 later this year, the reason behind the delayed date being Covid-19 related restrictions last time. It was originally slated to take place from July 24 to August 9 in 2020.Although Japan has said that the multi-sport event will not allow spectators, there are persistent worries among medical experts and public health professionals that holding the Tokyo Olympics could once again trigger a fresh wave of infections in the East Asian island nation. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has urged the public to watch the Games on television.Several schools near Tokyo have already shunned the Olympic and the Paralympic events for fear of Covid-19, cancelling more than half of the 280,000 tickets reserved for them, news agency Reuters said on Sunday, citing the reportage of a Japanese daily. The federal government lifted a coronavirus-related state of emergency for Tokyo and eight other prefectures this month, but health professionals warned of signs in recent weeks that infections may be on the rise again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-may-not-visit-japan-for-tokyo-olympics-first-lady-likely-to-attend-report-101624785812905.html

He was replaced by Sajid Javid, former chancellor of the exchequer, marking the second high profile exit in the Boris Johnson-led government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-matt-hancock-footage-got-leaked-to-press-uk-to-investigate-101624786717713.html

Speaking at a short film festival in Islamabad, Khan said that mistakes were made initially as the Pakistani film industry was "influenced" by Bollywood, resulting in a culture that continued the practice of copying and adopting another nation's culture."So the most important thing I want to say to young filmmakers is that according to my experience of the world, only originality sells -- the copy has no value," Imran Khan said, according to the Dawn newspaper in Pakistan. He further emphasised the importance of originality and urged the Pakistani film industry to come up with new ways of thinking.Referring to the influence of Hollywood and Bollywood in Pakistan's popular culture, Imran Khan said people in the country do not purportedly watch local content unless it has a commercial spin. "So my (advice) to young filmmakers is to bring your own original thinking and don't fear failure," he was quoted as saying. "It is my life's experience that the one who is afraid of defeat can never win."Imran Khan's statements come amid the backdrop of Pakistan intending to revise its perception in the world. Speaking about Pakistan's "image" as perceived globally, Khan said that the country is misrepresented as "soft" due to a sense of inferiority and defensiveness ranging back to the so-called 'war on terror'. "The world respects those who respect themselves," said Imran Khan, adding that Pakistaniyat should be promoted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-copy-bollywood-imran-khan-s-advice-to-pakistani-filmmakers-101624778426292.html

Sajid Javid, former chancellor of the exchequer, was named as Hancock's replacement, news agency Bloomberg reported.Also Read | UK minister Matt Hancock, who broke Covid-19 rules by kissing aide, resignsSajid Javid, who has previously served two terms in the UK cabinet -- first as the chancellor of the exchequer and later as the home secretary -- walked back into the office of state on Saturday, this time as the health minister. He now holds the prime responsibility of taking on the reigns of the country's medical infrastructure amid what is arguably the toughest of recent medical crises -- the Covid-19 pandemic. Not only does Javid have to steer the United Kingdom out of what will hopefully be the final stages of the pandemic, but he will also need to catch up on a vast backlog of ministry operations, reported The Guardian, adding that an anxious health sector is keeping a close watch on this transition.Matt Hancock, in his resignation letter to UK prime minister Boris Johnson a day prior, mentioned that the government owes “it to people who have sacrificed so much in this pandemic to be honest when we have let them down.” Notably, Johnson was under mounting pressure on Saturday to fire his health secretary after the admission that he broke Covid-19 guidelines by kissing the employee sparked accusations of blatant hypocrisy.Also Read | Matt Hancock ‘sorry’ for flouting Covid-19 rules“The last thing I would want is for my private life to distract attention from the single-minded focus that is leading us out of this crisis,” Hancock wrote, taking responsibility for the current situation. “I want to reiterate my apology for breaking the guidance, and apologize to my family and loved ones for putting them through this,” he said. “I also need (to) be with my children at this time,” he said.British tabloid 'The Sun' had released photos and videos of the minister in an embrace and kissing his aide in an office at the Department of Health, evoking demands of resignation from the opposition Labour Party which termed his position "hopelessly untenable".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sajid-javid-named-uk-health-secretary-after-matt-hancock-quits-over-controversial-affair-101624760778265.html

Blinken called for allied nations of the United States to band in solidarity against challenges posed by an increasingly assertive China. "And I want to be clear on this, our goal is not to hold China back," he said, adding, "It is not to establish a policy against China. It is to support a free and open system based on the rules and standards that France and the United States established after WWII, and which have served us well."Also Read | ‘This means war’: China warns US over military ties with TaipeiThe statements come in the backdrop of recent criticisms at the G7 and NATO summits against Beijing's ambitious political gambits. While the participating countries took out joint statements criticising the Chinese government over its recent controversial exploits in human rights, trade ties, and coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic cooperation, there have been marked differences in the trans-Atlantic partnership regarding how exactly to go about it.The US prefers a hardline approach, calling out the Communist Party of China's lies at the outset, and it seemingly wants to take its allies down this road as well. In his interviews, president Joe Biden has described the US-China rivalry with an almost fantastic edge, framing it as a conflict of interest between democratic forces and autocratic regimes. On the other hand, its allies in Europe, particularly Germany, where chancellor Angela Merkel was instrumental in penning down an EU-China investment agreement deal, might not be too keen on openly antagonising China.Also Read | US unveils strategy to counter rising ChinaThe US administration realises that there is a disparity in approach, and has hence called for greater convergence among its allies.

"Vaccination plus masks, because just a vaccine is not enough with 'Delta.' We need to make an effort over a short period of time, otherwise there would be a lockdown," Vujnovic said on the live YouTube show, according to news agency ANI.Vujnovic said that vaccination is essential because it lowers the probability of spreading the virus and lowers the risks of severe disease. Vujnovic warned that "additional measures" will probably be required as well.

27-06-2021||World||For George Floyd’s murder, Derek Chauvin sentenced to 22.5 years in prison||A US court on Friday sentenced former police officer Derek Chauvin to 22 and a half years in jail for the murder of African-American George Floyd, whose death last year led to the biggest outcry against racial injustice in the US in generations.Judge Peter Cahill went beyond the 12-and-a-half-year sentence prescribed under state guidelines, citing Chauvin’s “abuse of a position of trust and authority and also the particular cruelty” shown to Floyd.“This (jail term) is based on your abuse of a position of trust and authority and also the particular cruelty shown to George Floyd,” Cahill told Chauvin.The punishment - which came after Chauvin broke his yearlong silence to offer condolences to the Floyd family and express hope that they eventually have “some peace of mind” - is one of the longest prison terms ever imposed on a US police officer in the killing of a Black person.Still, Floyd family members and others were disappointed. The sentence fell short of the 30 years prosecutors had requested. And with good behaviour, Chauvin, 45, could get out on parole after serving two-thirds of his sentence, or about 15 years.Floyd’s brother Rodney called the sentence a slap on the wrist, saying the family has “suffered a life sentence for not having him in our life, and that hurts me to death”.Outside the courthouse, a crowd of about 50 people clasped hands or placed them on each other’s shoulders. The reaction was subdued as people debated whether the sentence was long enough.At George Floyd Square, as the intersection where Floyd was pinned to the pavement is now known, members of the crowd broke into applause, and several said, “We’ll take it.”The fired white officer was convicted in April of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for pressing his knee against Floyd’s neck for up to 9 and a half minutes as the 46-year-old Black man gasped that he couldn’t breathe and went limp on May 25, 2020.President Joe Biden called the sentence appropriate. “I don’t know all the circumstances that were considered but it seems to be under the guidelines, that seem to be appropriate,” he said.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-george-floyd-s-murder-derek-chauvin-sentenced-to-22-5-years-in-prison-101624754924388.html

In a news conference, she described the blaze as “very deep” and said rescuers faced “incredible difficulties” because of the flames.A fire hose blasted one of the lower floors on the north side of the tower as white smoke or steam streamed out, and a bitter, sulfur-like smell hung in the air.“The stench is very thick,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said.A crane removed pieces of debris from the more than 30-foot pile in the city of Surfside, and scores of rescuers used big machines, small buckets, drones, microphones and their own hands to pick through the rubble.Among those anxiously awaiting word of missing loved ones was Rachel Spiegel, whose mother, 66-year-old Judy Spiegel, lived on the sixth floor. Speaking alongside her siblings, she said Saturday that “we’re trying to hold it together.”“I know my mom is a fighter. I know she loves us. I know she doesn’t want to give up. So, you know, it’s day three, so it’s hard,” Spiegel said.One hundred fifty-nine people were still unaccounted for two days after Thursday's collapse, which killed at least four.Authorities announced they were beginning an audit of buildings nearing their 40-year review — like the fallen Champlain Towers South — to make sure they’re safe. The mayor asked other cities in the county to join the building review and said there will be state and federal funding to help.Federal Emergency Management Agency officials have joined local and state authorities at the site, DeSantis said. He added that a nearby “sister building” of the collapsed tower is also being looked at because it was built at the same time and with the same designer.Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said he was working on a plan to temporarily relocate residents of the Champlain Towers North, which was constructed the same year and sits about 100 yards away from the collapsed building, and that FEMA has agreed to pay for lodging.Burkett added that he was also trying to arrange an emergency inspection and until that happens, he can’t tell residents whether they’re safe in their homes.“I know that the identical building collapsed for an inexplicable reason,” Burkett said. “Buildings in the United States do not just fall down. ... Something very, very wrong was going on at that building, and we need to find out.”The mayor said he didn't plan to order residents to evacuate, but if he lived there, “I’d be gone.”Surfside city staffers were also gathering details about a third building, Champlain Towers East, which was built in a different style and appears to have been constructed at a different time.The news came after word of a 2018 engineering report that showed the building had “major structural damage” to a concrete slab below its pool deck that needed extensive repairs, part of a series of documents released by the city of Surfside.While officials said no cause for the collapse early Thursday has been determined, DeSantis said a “definitive answer” was needed in a timely manner. Video showed the center of the building appearing to tumble down first, followed by a section nearer to the beach.The 2018 report was part of preliminary work by the engineering company conducting the building’s required inspections for a recertification due this year of the building’s structural integrity at 40 years. The condominium tower was built in 1981.The government of Israel said it was sending a team of engineering and rescue specialists to assist in the search. Israeli media have reported that some 20 citizens of that country were believed to be among the missing.Another 22 people unaccounted for were from Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay and Paraguay, including relatives of Paraguayan first lady Silvana de Abdo Benítez.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deep-fire-slowing-rescue-effort-at-collapsed-florida-condo-101624737684652.html

Earlier this week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded more than 1,200 cases of heart inflammation in people who received messenger RNA Covid-19 vaccines.The risk from the vaccine is surfacing particularly after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and the symptoms usually appear within a few days of vaccination, the Food and Drugs Administration said. Those witnessing mildest of symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or a fast, fluttering or pounding heart after vaccination, should immediately seek medical attention, officials said.The update in fact sheets for patients and health care providers appeared on Friday on the website. In a joint statement, top government health officials and medical organisations said the side effect is "extremely rare" and usually mild in young people. People who see these side-effects recover on their own or with minimal treatment, the statement said. More than 130 million Americans have been fully vaccinated with mRNA shots, according to the CDC, and there have been few reports of serious adverse effects. Two-dose Covid-19 vaccine regimens made by Moderna Inc. and partners Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE rely on the technology.With inputs from Agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-pfizer-vaccines-warn-of-heart-inflammation-risk-101624733897021.html

27-06-2021||India||Jammu IAF station hit by 2 explosions||Security agencies were investigating the suspected use of drones by terrorists after two “low-intensity” explosions hit an Indian Air Force station in Jammu on Sunday, leaving two IAF personnel injured and prompting multiple teams to join the probe.The explosions hit the station a little after 1:30am on Sunday and caused minor damage to a building, with security experts and officials saying this could be the first time drones were used in an attack on a major installation in the country.Jammu and Kashmir’s director general of police Dilbag Singh said that the twin blasts at the IAF’s technical airport was a “terror attack”. It was reported at the high-security technical area of the Jammu airport that is manned by the IAF in Satwari area on the outskirts of the city.“A drone with payload in both the blasts at Jammu airfield is suspected to have dropped the explosive material. The police have registered an FIR and investigation is on,” Singh said.The first blast at the airport, which is used for VVIP movement and armed forces’ strategic operations, took place at 1:37am, causing minor damage to the roof of a building, and the second one – said to be weaker in intensity – was reported at 1:42am in an open area, according to an IAF official.Singh said the police and other agencies were working with IAF officials to ascertain the specifics. A team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) was also at the spot.The air force said the blasts were also being probed by a high-level IAF team. “There was no damage to any equipment. Investigation is in progress along with civil agencies,” the IAF’s official Twitter handle said.There have been several incidents of Pakistan-based terrorists using drones in the border areas of Jammu and Kashmir to drop arms, ammunition, drugs and money to fuel terrorism in the region. But experts indicated that drones have previously not been engaged by terrorists to carry out attacks.Following a series of back-channel contacts between Indian and Pakistani security officials, the two countries recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in February. The truce has largely held, helping to ease bilateral tensions, though recent reports have suggested the back-channel contacts have stalled.Pakistan has also issued several strong statements in recent weeks about what it claims were the Indian government’s plans to carry out more changes in Jammu and Kashmir. India has rejected these statements, noting that Kashmir is an integral part of the country and Pakistan’s comments amounted to interference in internal affairs. On Sunday, the J&K Police said they had detained two people for questioning over the blasts. An official, who asked not to be named, said the “possible target of the drones was the aircraft parked in the dispersal area”.Another official said that the first blast created a hole in the rooftop of the building, indicating the use of “adequate amount of explosives”. Soon after the second blast, a bomb disposal squad and forensic experts rushed to the site, the official said on condition of anonymity.The incident comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi told political leaders from Jammu and Kashmir that elections would be held there once delimitation is carried out, two years after the special status of the erstwhile state was revoked.Defence minister Rajnath Singh is currently in Leh to take stock of the security scenario. A senior official said in New Delhi that the defence minister was expected to review the security situation in Jammu. The defence minister’s office said he spoke to Vice Air Chief, Air Marshal HS Arora, over the airport incident.It was not immediately clear from where the drones took off and investigations were underway to track their flight path, an official told news agency PTI.Investigators scanned CCTV footage, including from cameras installed on the boundary walls of the airport. The aerial distance from the Jammu airport to the international border is about 14km, the official said.While officials were investigating the drone attack, a person, suspected to be linked to Lashker-e-Taiba, was arrested along with an improvised explosive device (IED) weighing around 6kg, the DGP said.“The suspect has been detained and is being interrogated. More suspects are likely to be picked up in this foiled IED blast attempt,” Singh said.The Jammu airport is a civil airport with the runway and the ATC (air traffic control) under the IAF.Jammu airport’s director Pravat Ranjan Beuria told PTI there was no disruption in flight operations due to the explosions. “Flights to and from Jammu airport are operating as per schedule,” he said.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-blasts-at-jammu-airport-injure-two-101624818309581.html

Deaths from this variant have also been recorded in the country. Experts have said more study is required to find out more about this variant, but within a week after the variant was classified as a variant of concern, experts have gathered some new information regarding the variant.Here are 10 things to know about Delta Plus1. The variant has a greater affinity to the mucosal lining in the lungs, but it does not mean that the virus will affect the lungs more -- more than other variants.2. The disease is mild in those who are vaccinated. Even a single dose of vaccination has made the variant less severe. A fully vaccinated woman from Rajasthan was affected with the Delta Plus variant. She was asymptomatic and she has already recovered.3. At present, there are around 50-55 Delta Plus cases identified in the country. The number could be higher as many individuals may be asymptomatic.Delta Plus variant has greater affinity towards lung tissues, says govt body head4. It was earlier said the Delta Plus resists monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy, in which antibody is artificially produced in the body. Experts have said that this characteristic does not confirm that the variant will also resist antibodies produced by vaccines.5. In India, the spread of the infection is localised and sporadic. Some states have reported the variant but it is concentrated in particular areas of those states. So the distribution is not widespread.6. The variant has been there in the country as early as April. The first sample in which Delta Plus was found was collected in April in Maharashtra.7. So, it can not be said that the variant is highly transmissible, experts said, as the variant, for the last two months, have not spread beyond 50 cases.8. The mutant present in Delta Plus was also present in the variant first found in South Africa. It may not prove to be very virulent alone. N501Y and K147N (the mutation present in Delta Plus) together may become immune-escape.9. The plus in Delta Plus does not denote that this variant is stronger than Delta. It only denotes an addition to the same variant.10. So far, Delta Plus remains less transmissible than Delta. If the number of cases remains like this, then Delta Plus will not emerge as a dominant variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/localised-infection-more-affinity-for-lung-tissues-10-things-we-know-about-delta-plus-101624814079636.html

Here's what ICMR chief says||The Indian Council of Medical Research is studying the effect of vaccines against various variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as at a later stage a change in vaccine composition can be suggested according to the circulating variants of concern and variants of interest, ICMR chief Dr Balram Bhargava has recently said. Vaccine composition is easily modifiable, especially that of the mRNA vaccines, but whole virus inactivated vaccines can also be modified. But this is only a need-based solution that the ICMR has thought of as a way forward, Dr Bhargava said.As the Covid-19 virus is replicating, its variants have become a reason for concern as every variant appear to be stronger than the previous one. For example, the Alpha variant which was first reported in the United Kingdom has now got overpowered by the Delta variant, first reported in India. Now, the Delta variant is responsible for 90 per cent of Covid-19 cases in the United Kingdom. Several other countries have now reported this variant.It is crucial to study whether the existing vaccines are equally effective against these emerging variants, whether there is any change in the severity in the cases, or in the requirement of hospitalisation. A comparative study of vaccines' performance against Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta is available, according to which Covishield and Covaxin are effective against all these variants.The ICMR is studying the impact of the vaccines against the Delta Plus variant, which is being sporadically reported from various states in the country. In other countries too, the variant has been reported. India has classified the variant as a variant of concern though there is not enough evidence to suggest whether Delta Plus is more transmissible than Delta. Experts have said that the very localised cases in India are not enough to claim that Delta Plus is spreading rapidly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-vaccine-composition-be-changed-according-to-delta-delta-plus-here-s-what-icmr-chief-says-101624810044034.html

The San Francisco-based microblogging company, which is under fire in India for not "complying" with local rules, did not comment on this development, the news agency said. This one again leaves Twitter without any local officer, while keeping a local officer for grievance redressal is a mandatory provision under the new IT rules of India.For long, Twitter did not have any grievance redressal officer in India. As the government mandated that all social media intermediaries operating in India will have to mention the name of the resident grievance officer on their sites, Twitter appointed Dharmendra Chaturas the interim grievance officer. But now his name is no longer displayed on the site, PTI reported.How an AR Rahman song got IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad blocked from TwitterThe disagreement between Twitter and the Centre has been going on since January this year when the government asked Twitter to take action against accounts that trended #farmersgenocide during the farmers' tractor rally on Republic Day. As the row escalated in the following months, Twitter temporarily removed the 'verified' badge from President Ram Nath Kovind's personal Twitter account and from several accounts of RSS leaders including Mohan Bhagwat's. Then it flagged a tweet of BJP leader Sambit Patra as manipulated media and very recently it blocked IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad's Twitter account for an hour over alleged copyright infringement.Parliamentary panel on information technology, headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, recently met Twitter India's public policy manager Shagufta Kamran and legal counsel Ayushi Kapoor and said that the platform has to follow the rule of the land. The committee will seek an explanation from Twitter for locking out the I-T minister, Shashi Tharoor said adding that the same happened with him as well.Meanwhile, the microblogging platform has lost its intermediary status in India and is now editorially responsible for what users post on the platform. After this, Ghaziabad Police lodged an FIR against Twitter over an incident that took place in Loni, for which Twitter India MD Manish Maheshwari was called by the Ghaziabad Police to join the probe, but Karnataka high court has granted Maheshwei relief and said that no coercive action can be taken against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitters-interim-grievance-officer-for-india-quits-amid-disagreement-with-centre-report-101624805607754.html

They are still under observation and will be discharged after doctors' nod, the officials also said.Two IAF personnel were injured when two explosives-laden drones crashed into the station around 1.40am. The blasts took place within six minutes of each other. The first blast ripped off the roof of a single-storey building at the technical area of the airport manned by the IAF in Satwari area of the city. The second one was on the ground.Earlier in the day, air chief marshal RKS Bhaduria, who is on an official visit to Bangladesh, telephoned the two injured personnel and asked about their condition. He is also monitoring the situation in Jammu constantly and is in touch with the officials regarding any development.According to the initial probe, a shaped charge (explosive device) was used for the attack, news agency ANI reported quoting officials.Meanwhile, a team of National Investigation Agency (NIA), Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) are at the scene to probe the matter. The officials are probing all possible angles into the incident.Earlier in the day, director-general of police, Dilbag Singh termed the explosions a "terror attack." He also informed about a person being arrested who was carrying 5-6 kgs of an improvised explosive device (IED). The arrested man is suspected to have an affiliation with the UN-designated terrorist organisation, Lashkar-e-Taiba." This recovery has foiled another major terror attack. The suspect is being interrogated and more suspects are likely to be arrested in connection with the foiled attempt," Singh said to the media.There are also reports that claim the blasts were carried out with the help of drones, if true, this would be the first-ever drone strike at an Indian military installation.So far, it is not clear where the drones took off for the air force station. The aerial distance from the Jammu airport to the international border is 14 km.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-air-base-blasts-two-injured-personnel-doing-fine-under-observation-101624804831462.html

This year, the government started a year-long programme to mark the 125th birth anniversary of the freedom fighter, which was inaugurated by PM Modi on January 23 in Kolkata.

May this team work with determination and fulfil the aspirations of the wonderful people of Puducherry," Prime Minister Modi tweeted.Best wishes to all those who took oath as Ministers in Puducherry today. May this team work with determination and fulfil the aspirations of the wonderful people of Puducherry.Earlier, the cabinet formation was delayed to various reasons. A day after his swearing-in, CM Rangasamy contracted Covid-19 and was hospitalised at a private hospital in Chennai. Negotiations between the AINRC and the BJP over cabinet portfolios also contributed to this delay.Also Read: Internal rift delays Cabinet formation in PuducherryTogether, the coalition has 16 directly elected members in the Puducherry legislative assembly: 10 from the AINRC and six from the BJP.

The total strength of the assembly is 33, of which 30 are elected by the voters and the remaining three are nominated by the central government. Since the BJP is in power at the Centre, the party nominated three of its members as MLAs, taking its total strength in the House to nine.In February, the previous Congress-led government collapsed just months before the completion of its five-year term.

We will be able to vaccinate children aged between 12-18 years in August,” Dr Arora said.Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D will be the first DNA vaccine in the world and will be India’s fourth addition to the vaccine arsenal. DNA-Plasmid based ZyCoV-D will be a three-dose vaccine, according to a report published by news agency PTI. India has granted emergency use approval to the Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Russia’s Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology-Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) developed Sputnik-V. India is also looking forward to Biological E’s Corbevax.People familiar with the development of the vaccine told news agency PTI that Zydus Cadila is likely to apply to the central drugs regulator seeking emergency use approval for their Covid-19 vaccine later this month. The vaccine is already being tested on children. “When Zydus comes for licensure, hopefully in the next two weeks, maybe we have enough data to take a view on whether the vaccine can be given to children,” NITI Aayog member (Health) VK Paul said earlier.Dr Arora also said that the government is planning to administer 1 crore doses every day in a bid to immunise everyone within six to eight months while commenting on an ICMR study that said that the third wave is likely to hit the nation late. He said based on the ICMR study India has a window of 6-8 months to immunise everybody.

If Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna can be added to the vaccination drive, then the drive will obviously get a boost, the Centre said. Efforts are going on at the level of the highest political executive in the country and also at the highest diplomatic level."It is submitted that since these efforts are at a very advanced stage, it is neither desirable nor possible to give comprehensive details of these facts. As and when these efforts materialise, the speed of vaccination will be further augmented and enhanced," it said.Pfizer says its vaccine highly effective against Delta variantGovernment sources earlier told that the agreement with foreign vaccine makers is being finalised as Pfizer is ready to supply vaccines to India. Moderna has already clarified that it won't be able to supply vaccines to India this year.The Centre has already modified its rules for foreign vaccines and decided that vaccines which already are authorised by WHO and other national regulators will be given emergency use authorisation in India without a local clinical trial. Instead of a pre-approval trial, the government has made provision for a post-approval parallel bridging clinical trial.But the foreign vaccine makers have sought legal protection from the government, which reportedly is the bottleneck where the agreement is stuck, as no vaccine maker in India enjoys legal indemnity. If the government extends this provision to foreign vaccine makers, it may have to do the same to Indian vaccine makers. Pune's Serum Institute of India has already approached the government seeking this protection.Pfizer CEO Dr Albert Bourla has recently said that the deal will get finalised very soon. "My hope is that very soon we will finalise the approval of the product in India by the Indian health care authorities and the agreement with the government so that we can also start sending vaccines, on our side,” Bourla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/efforts-at-highest-political-diplomatic-level-govt-on-deals-with-pfizer-j-j-moderna-101624801455382.html

A meeting was held on Saturday at the sports complex to review the progress of the under-construction International Sports University. The meeting hall was barely 15 steps away from where they got down from their cars, but they chose to use the athletes' track as their parking lot, the MLA said, adding that there was also a provision to use an elevator to reach the meeting hall. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, Maharashtra sports minister Sunil Chattrapal and minister of state Aditi S Tatkare were present at the meeting.Maharashtra sports department reacted to the accusation and apologised. It also clarified that only Sharad Pawar's vehicle was allowed to park there so that he doesn't have to walk. And permission was given to park on the concrete road near the track.

A team of National Investigation Agency (NIA) also arrived at the Air Force Station earlier in the day.The authorities are also working to ascertain the flight path of the drones.A major tragedy averted?Earlier in the day, police arrested a person, suspected to have an association with Lashkar-e-Taiba, a United Nations-designated terrorist outfit, the director-general of police Dilbag Singh confirmed. He was taken into custody along with an improvised explosive device weighing around six kg, Singh said said.The person was tasked with triggering the IED in a crowded place. "The suspect has been detained and is being interrogated. A major terror attack has been averted with this recovery. More suspects are likely to be picked up in this foiled IED blast attempt," Singh also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-probes-attack-at-jammu-air-base-rajnath-singh-to-review-situation-101624793513108.html

27-06-2021||India||Gupteshwar Pandey who handled Sushant Singh Rajput death case says he will only serve God now||Bihar's former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey who was in the thick of Bihar versus Maharashtra government tussle in the investigation into Sushant Singh Rajput's death in 2020 is now a religious preacher. His only interest now lies in God and this transformation is not sudden, as he has told news agency ANI.Months after Sushant Singh Rajput's death on June 14, 2020, his father registered an FIR in Patna. Gupteshwar Pandey, who was a well-known IPS officer of Bihar, then came to the national limelight as he sent a Bihar Police team to Mumbai for a parallel investigation. This was followed by his regular diatribe against Mumbai Police regarding the investigation. He was also criticised when he said actor Rhea Chakraborty has no 'aukat' to comment on Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.In September, Pandey took voluntary retirement from his service and joined the JD(U). Bihar went to elections in October, but without Pandey getting a ticket from his hometown Buxar as the seat went with the BJP. In between all these, Gupteshwar Pandey became viral because of a video made featuring him as'Robinhood Bihar Ke'. This was not his first attempt in politics. In 2009, he wanted to contest the Lok Sabha election on a BJP ticket for which he took retirement from his service but finally was not granted one.Now it's all water under the bridge as the 'Robinhood' of Bihar has become a katha vachak, reading sermons from Bhagwad Gita. As he said, the transformation is not sudden and he used to do the same when he was in the service, but not in the public because of his service code of conduct. Recently, he addressed quite a few religious sessions for the Ayodhya Ram Mandir Trust, which brought his new avatar to the public."There comes a point when you want to know the purpose of life, and in knowing God. I am no exception. We think that material achievements will make us happy, but the real happiness lies in God. I only want to serve God now," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gupteshwar-pandey-who-handled-sushant-singh-rajput-death-says-he-will-only-serve-god-now-101624789342332.html
27-06-2021||India||Delta Plus variant has greater affinity towards lung tissues, says govt body head||The Delta Plus variant of Covid-19 has a greater affinity towards lung issues as compared to other strains, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) head Dr NK Arora has said, but it does not mean that it can cause severe lung disease or has higher transmissibility, he has clarified.The Delta Plus variant which was identified on June 11 was recently classified as a variant of concern by the Union health ministry on Tuesday. India has detected 51 cases of Delta Plus across 12 states with Maharashtra reporting maximum cases. “Delta plus is having greater affinity to mucosal lining in the lungs, higher compared to other variants, but if it causes damage or not is not clear yet. It also does not mean that this variant will cause more severe disease or it is more transmissible,” Dr Arora was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. He also pointed out that the disease is generally mild in all those who have vaccinated with either a single or double dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.Arora said that the number of identified cases of Delta plus variant could be higher as asymptomatic individuals with Covid-19 may be spreading the virus. He highlighted that there is a need to keep a very close watch on the spread to understand the transmission efficiency.He said that it is important to note that the genomic surveillance component has picked up at the right time and early enough. Since the government has identified the variant of concern, it means that states can now take action based on data shared with them. State governments can make micro plans for districts where the virus has been identified in order to contain its spread.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has already written to chief secretaries of 7 states and a Union Territory on Friday sharing the names of districts where cases of Delta Plus variant has been found and asked them to initiate widespread testing, prompt tracing as well as vaccine coverage on a priority basis.Dr Arora said that it is too early to assess whether the Delta Plus variant can trigger the third wave of Covid-19. He also said that if one observes closely, they can see that for the last 8-10 days the number of Covid-19 cases is stuck at 50,000 and some places are reporting higher numbers of cases. The wave has not settled down, Arora said.Dr Arora said the second wave will influence the community’s response to another variant and the third wave will depend on what amount of the population were infected in the second wave. He highlighted that if a large proportion of people were infected then they may develop a 'common cold-like illness’ and may not develop any 'serious or fatal illness’.Arora also said that vaccination is necessary to neutralise damages that the probable third wave of Covid-19 can cause. He said if vaccination can be coupled with appropriate usage of masks and strict adherence to Covid-19 preventative measures then the damage caused by the variant as well as the probable third wave can be effectively contained.(with inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delta-plus-strain-shows-greater-affinity-towards-lung-tissues-101624787049492.html

Rajesh Hirave, from Dulariya village in Betul district, was one of the people the Prime Minister spoke to during his Mann Ki Baat address and urged to shun vaccine hesitancy.The chat between PM Modi and Hirave was pre-recorded and aired on Sunday as part of Mann Ki Baat programme.Forty-three-year-old Hirave told PM Modi that dangerous information is being spread about the vaccines being administered in the country. Hirave said he has received messages on WhatsApp claiming that people are dying after being vaccinated. But the Prime Minister said this information is false. PM Modi gave his own example and urged Hirave to take a shot of the vaccine which he said is the only way to stop the infection from spreading."After talking to the prime minister on Friday, I along with my family members got the vaccine shot for prevention from the coronavirus infection on Saturday," Hirave told news agency PTI.After bring prodded by the Prime Minister, Hirave also encouraged other people in his village to take the vaccine shot. He claimed that 127 people from his village got vaccinated.PM Modi also interacted with Kishorilal Dhurve, who lives in Hirave's village. The Prime Minister said that his nearly 100-year-old mother has also taken both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine, and asked him to trust science."The threat of Covid-19 remains and we have to focus on vaccination as well as follow Covid-19 protocols," PM Modi said.India launched the nationwide vaccination programme against Covid-19 on January 16 this year and till now, has inoculated more than 320 million people.India, meanwhile, recorded 50,040 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, according to Union health ministry data, which took the nationwide tally to 35.51 million. The Covid-19 death toll rose by 1,258, including 511 deaths reported from Maharashtra, the health ministry data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/encouraged-by-pm-modi-on-mann-ki-baat-man-takes-covid-19-vaccine-shot-101624786459914.html
27-06-2021||India||Shiv Sena claims misuse of CBI, ED; questions why no probe in Ayodhya land deal||The Shiv Sena on Sunday again alleged that the Central investigation agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) were being misused to target political opponents instead of probing the alleged scam in land deal for the construction of the iconic Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.“Our freedom fighters did not fear the tyranny of the British government but in independent India, political activists fear the Central investigation agencies. The freedom fighters bravely went to prison and to the gallows but political activists are forced to surrender to harassment by the Central agencies,” Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said in his weekly column Rokhthok in Saamana, a Shiv Sena mouthpiece.Raut’s editorial comes in the backdrop of ED raids on former state home minister Anil Deshmukh in the money laundering and bribery case and the Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik’s allegation of harassment by the Central agency in a case of money laundering. Sarnaik recently wrote to Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray claiming his “harassment” could end if the Shiv Sena re-aligned with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“The raid on Anil Deshmukh’s house resembled as if he was a dacoit from Chambal. These agencies are riding roughshod over the state governments and it appears that they have been told to harass Maharashtra and West Bengal,” said Raut.Claiming that the Central agencies have become a political tool for the ruling parties since 1975, Raut said, “The [Telugu Desam Party or the TDP] MPs Y S Chowdary and C M Ramesh defected to the BJP in 2019 after the Income Tax (IT) department raided them for [alleged] tax evasion and money laundering. Their harassment stopped after they joined the ruling party and today they are relieved. Such incidents have forced an aggressive leader like Sarnaik, who had initially pledged to fight such agencies, to surrender, as his family is being dragged into this,” said Raut.Raut said even PM Narendra Modi and union home minister Amit Shah had faced similar ordeal when the Congress-led government was ruling the Centre.Raut said that such tactics do not augur well for the country and questioned how Central agencies “swept the cases” registered against political leaders under the carpet if they joined the ruling party.The MP questioned why CBI or ED was not probing the alleged land deal in Ayodhya. “The biggest land scam has taken place in the Ram Temple deal in which relatives of the Ayodhya mayor sold the land parcels for crores after buying them at much cheaper prices. This needs to be probed by the Central agencies, but until now it’s untouched,” he said.The BJP said Sena’s allegations of a witch hunt by Central agencies was a “ploy to save corrupt leaders”. “The Sena is using the Ram Mandir ploy to save its corrupt extortionist leaders from action. They are trying to divert attention from the corruption issue,” party MLA Ram Kadam said.However, political analyst Surendra Jondhale said there was a perception that Central agencies were being misused and the government should understand that this was likely to be “counter-productive” in the long run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-claims-misuse-of-cbi-ed-questions-why-no-probe-in-ayodhya-land-deal-101624786625640.html
27-06-2021||India||'Covid 3rd wave will depend on...': Govt's expert panel chief NK Arora lists 3 points, talks about Delta Plus||The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India is receding and Delta Plus, the new variant of Delta, has created fresh concerns as all epidemiologists have predicted a third wave of the pandemic as almost inevitable. But Delta Plus can not be yet linked to a third wave of the pandemic, Covid-19 Working Group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation chief Dr NK Arora has said. But he asserted that as variants are linked to new waves, the possibility can not be dismissed at all."Waves are linked to new variants or new mutations so there is a possibility as this is a new variant, but whether it will lead to a third wave it is difficult to answer as it will depend upon two or three things," Dr Arora told PTI.Explained: Delta Plus variant symptoms and how to protect yourselfThe variant alone may not hit the country hard, Dr Arora said, as there are three other factors that will also control the new wave of the pandemic if it comes.First, the third wave will depend on what proportion of the population got infected in the second wave. "If a large proportion is infected then in the next wave people can develop a common cold-like illness but may not develop a serious or fatal illness," Dr Arora said.Second, if the vaccination drive goes on with this speed, then a huge number of people will become immune by the time the third wave comes. "...the rapidity with which we vaccinate...even single dose is effective and the way we are planning, if we rapidly immunise then the possibility of a third wave becomes very less," Dr Arora said.Third, strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour, including wearing of the masks, maintaining physical distance, will protect from any variant, a point that experts have been emphasising.Delta and Delta PlusWhile Delta, the variant first reported in India, is highly transmissible, the same can not be said about Delta Plus as the variant has been present in India for the last two months. The presence of the variant is localised and experts have said there is not enough evidence to corroborate that the variant is spreading vast or is more dangerous than Delta, or is immune-escape.Delta, on the other hand, was one of the major factors behind the second wave of the pandemic in India, scientists have agreed and now it has spread across 174 districts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-3rd-wave-will-depend-on-govt-s-expert-panel-chief-nk-arora-lists-3-points-talks-about-delta-plus-101624784411136.html
27-06-2021||India||Surat businessman Mahesh Savani joins AAP ahead of Gujarat assembly elections||Mahesh Savani, a Surat-based businessman and a social worker, joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday, ahead of the state assembly elections as the ruling party in Delhi is aiming to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state and take its national ambition further."The AAP is like a vacant plot in Gujarat, where a house of new and modern politics of the state can be built. To lay the foundation of this, we welcome Mahesh ji to the Aam Aadmi Party," senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia said at a press conference in Surat. "In Gujarat, the AAP is growing day and night at quadruple speed," Sisodia, who is the deputy chief minister in Delhi, said.Sisodia also praised AAP councillors, who were elected through civic body elections in February. "Now it is not only the work of Delhi, but the work of Gujarat has also started speaking… the work of the councillors has started speaking," he said, adding, "Impressed by all that, Mahesh bhai decided to join the AAP family."Addressing Gujarat's residents, Sisodia also said that the state hopes that these people of the AAP "will realise the dream of new and successful politics," which the Congress and the BJP have been promising for over the years.Speaking on the next year's assembly elections, Sisodia said it "will be held between the party that is sitting in the middle of a power and a party that came out of the public." "Wherever you go on seeing Aam Aadmi Party, there you will go on forgetting the Congress and BJP, it is our claim," he also asserted.After making inroads in civic body elections by winning 27 out of 120 seats, the AAP is planning to out the BJP in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state. In June, AAP national convenor and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that the party will contest all seats in the Gujarat assembly elections to be held next year. The Delhi-based AAP is taking small steps to achieve its national ambition. It has already announced its plan to contest in assembly elections of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surat-businessman-mahesh-savani-joins-aap-ahead-of-gujarat-assembly-elections-101624783381249.html
27-06-2021||India||Fuel rates jump over ₹8 a litre in 55 days||The rally of petrol and diesel rates continued unabated on Sunday by 35 paise a litre and 25 paise respectively, the 31st hike in 55 days, which made petrol costlier by ₹8.06 per litre and diesel by ₹8.17 since May 4, a day after results of five assembly polls were declared. Petrol and diesel in Delhi are now sold at a record ₹98.46 per litre and ₹88.90 a litre, respectively. While fuel rates in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies. Both petrol and diesel rates have crossed the ₹100 mark in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar, where petrol is sold at ₹109.67 per litre and diesel at ₹102.12 a litre on Sunday.The financial capital has the highest fuel rates among five metros where petrol is currently sold at ₹104.56 per litre and diesel at ₹96.42 a litre. The latest hike leads to the highest jump in fuel rates in last two days as state-run oil marketing companies had raised pump prices of petrol and diesel by 35 paise a litre on Saturday that saw petrol breaching ₹100 mark in several cities of four more states – Punjab, Bihar, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The unidirectional upward movement Since May 4 saw petrol already crossing ₹100 mark in various cities across the country, particularly in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Manipur, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh.Some of the cities selling petrol for over ₹100 per litre are Mumbai, Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar, Banswara, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Guntur, Kakinada, Chikmagalur, Shivamogga, Hyderabad, Leh, Imphal, Kalahandi, Sopore, Baramulla, Patna, Salem, Thiruvananthapuram and Mohali.Surging international oil rates and exorbitant domestic tax structure are two key reasons for high rates of petrol and diesel in pumps.International oil prices soared on the last trading day (Friday), the highest since October 2018 on expectations of demand growth, continued oil squeeze by producers’ cartel and geopolitical reasons. Brent crude on Friday surged 0.82% to $76.18 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) jumped 1% to 74.05. Last week, both benchmarks closed at record levels since October 2018.Domestic fuel retailers align pump prices of petrol and diesel with respective international benchmarks of the previous day, which often move in tandem with crude oil rates. Pump prices of fuels are also high because of taxes. In Delhi, central levies account for 34.03% of petrol’s price and state taxes, 23.08%, according to official data of June 16. On diesel, central taxes are over 36.38% while state taxes are about 14.63%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on the fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit - with revenues hit on account of the pandemic. Even as international oil prices saw volatility since May 4, pump rates of auto fuels in India moved only in the upward direction. For instance, despite Brent crude had plunged to $65.11 on May 20, the lowest in these 46 days; petrol and diesel rates went up the next day by 19 paise per litre and 29 paise a litre, respectively. According to executives working in state-run oil marketing companies, pump prices are also high because companies were recovering their past revenue losses like the one suffered for 66 days since February 27 when rates were not raised because of assembly elections in four states and one Union territory. During the 66-day pause on the rate hike, state-run retailers had also reduced politically sensitive petrol and diesel rates by 77 paise and 74 paise a litre, respectively in four small steps. But, the entire gains to the consumers were quickly reversed in the first four consecutive rounds of rate hikes starting from May 4. The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010, and diesel on October 19, 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Public sector retailers — IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)— control almost 90% of the domestic fuel retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-rates-jump-over-rs-8-a-litre-in-55-days-101624783025414.html

27-06-2021||India||PM Narendra Modi addresses vaccine hesitancy in Mann Ki Baat||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged people to get vaccinated to protect themselves against the coronavirus and not fall for rumours. In his monthly radio address, Mann Ki Baat, the PM said India has achieved the distinction of vaccinating millions in a single day and it is imperative that vaccine hesitancy, based on rumours, is addressed.Talking to residents of Madhya Pradesh’s Betul, the PM said more than 310 million beneficiaries in the country have taken the vaccine so far. He cited his own example and said he’s taken both the doses of the vaccine and so has his mother who is nearly 100. The PM also cited the example of Bandipora in Kashmir where nearly all have been vaccinated in the village of Weyun. According to the union health ministry portal on Sunday afternoon, 321,760,077 or more than 321 million vaccine doses have been administered so far across the country.“Our fight against Corona continues and together in this battle we are creating newer milestones. Only a few days ago our country did something unprecedented; on June 21 as part of the next phase of vaccination, we inoculated 86 lakh people in a single day. The free vaccination drive was carried out in a single day,” he said, referring to the fact that no country other than China has managed to vaccinate more people in a day. The chairman of the working group on Covid-19 vaccines in India Dr NK Arora had then said that the target was to jab close to 10 million people in a single day by August.On Saturday the PM reviewed the government’s response to the pandemic and expressed satisfaction at the rate of vaccination. In the wake of an anticipated third wave, he instructed for the outreach to be widened with the help of NGOs, said his office.Referring to the mass vaccination campaign that covers those above 18 years of age, the PM said a year ago people wanted to know when the vaccines will come. “Today we are giving millions of shots in a single day. This is the strength of new India. To ensure safe vaccines for every citizen we are making constant efforts at many places to eradicate vaccine hesitancy,” he said.The PM also urged people not to let their guard down.“It is a disease in which the virus keeps changing its form. Do not believe anyone who says that the pandemic is over. And we have two ways to save ourselves, the first is to wear a mask and follow the corona protocol and the second is to take the vaccine,” he said.He said people should listen to scientists and doctors and not to those who spread rumours. “Stay away from rumours and ensure that [people in] villages take the vaccine as well; not only in your own village but also in villages around yours,” he told a resident of Betul during the radio broadcast.Referring to the steps taken in the villages to adhere to the Covid protocol, he said the wisdom and capability shown by the villagers and tribal communities during the pandemic will become case studies in future. “People in villages made quarantine centres keeping in mind the local needs and adhered to Covid protocols. They never let anyone go hungry, continued agricultural work... and did not allow supply chains to be affected…We have to do the same for the vaccination drive to ensure that every villager is vaccinated and to create awareness about this,” he said.The PM also urged people to take steps for conservation of rainwater and said it will not only address the current needs, but is also important for the future generations. Water conservation is a key programme of the government that is aiming to provide water connections to all households by 2024.“Ask yourself a question, everyone wants to be successful, but what is the mantra? The mantra is consistency. Monsoon season has arrived and when it rains, it is not only for us but for the future generations as well. Rainwater percolates and improves the groundwater level so it is important to conserve and harvest rainwater. It is a form of service to the nation,” he said.He also urged the countrymen to show their support for the athletes who are Tokyo-bound for the Olympics.“Being grounded also always helps us stay in touch with our roots. Success is especially sweet when it is preceded by days of struggle,” he said referring to the athletes, some of whom faced economic challenges and hardships.“We should support these people with an open mind. On social media you can wish them with the hashtag #cheer4India and encourage them... We should all support our players bound for Tokyo,” he said.In the wake of cases of violence against healthcare workers, the PM said July 1 is celebrated as doctors’ day and we are all grateful for the contribution of the doctors during the pandemic. “Without caring for their own lives they took care of people, therefore this year national doctors’ day becomes even more special…It becomes our responsibility that we express our gratitude and love to them and encourage them,” he said.“It is also Chartered accountants day on July 1. A few years ago I had requested chartered accountants to create a global level audit firm. Today I want to remind them, chartered accountants can play a very affirmative role in bringing transparency to the economy,” he said.He said as the country prepares to celebrate the 75th year of Independence the mantra should be India First. “All our decisions should be based on India First,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-addresses-vaccine-hesitancy-in-mann-ki-baat-101624780205017.html

Speaking on the show, which he hosts on the last Sunday of every month, PM Modi said monsoon has arrived and asked citizens to "once again focus on water conservation." "When clouds rain, they rain not only for us but also for generations to come," PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also said that water conservation must be considered as a service to the nation because rainwater collects in the ground, it also replenishes the groundwater level.

"Please get rid of fear. Sometimes people may get a fever but it is very mild and lasts only for a few hours. Avoiding vaccine can be very dangerous. You are not only putting yourself at risk but also your family and the entire village," he said. "Don't believe in rumours about the Covid vaccine. Trust science and our scientists," PM Modi added.Over the course of the last 77 episodes of Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi has used the platform to share his thoughts on various topics related to the nation.

27-06-2021||India||Explained: Delta Plus variant symptoms and how to protect yourself||The Delta Plus variant of coronavirus has been wreaking havoc across the world, with increased transmissibility and resistance to some drugs and therapies. India has already declared it as the variant of concern, with the strain found in 49 samples from 12 states. Maharashtra has reported the highest number of cases of the Delta Plus variant.Vaccination and safety measures such as wearing of face masks are essential when it comes to fighting the Delta Plus coronavirus variant, World Health Organization (WHO) representative to Russia Melita Vujnovic said."We need to make an effort over a short period of time, otherwise there would be a lockdown," Vujnovic said on the Soloviev Live YouTube show.The Delta Plus variant is the mutated form of the Delta variant, earlier found in India. The Delta variant has so far been found in 85 countries, according to health experts, and has been the driving force behind a surge in infection in South Africa.In fact, the infectious disease experts in South Africa believe that the country is already experiencing a third wave of the infection due to the Delta variant.Earlier this month, the WHO included Delta in its list of coronavirus variants of concern.Why is Delta Plus variant a cause of concern?This new variant of coronavirus, also known as AY.1, spreads almost 60 per cent faster than its predecessor, the Delta variant. It also binds more easily to the lung cells and shows higher resistance to some of the drugs being used against Covid-19.Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, former head scientist of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR, said there are two graded mutations which have occurred in the Delta variant, which was the dominant strain of coronavirus in the country till now. These graded mutations L452R and P871R."These particular mutations add to the higher transmission efficiency so that the variant can spread quickly from one person to another or can enter into the cells much more efficiently compared to other strains that exist," said Dr Gangakhedkar, terming Delta Plus as one of the most critical mutations of coronavirus.What are the symptoms?India's top virologists have said that the Delta Plus variant carries symptoms of the Delta as well as its partner the beta variant. Some of these symptoms include cough, diarrhoea, fever, headache, skin rash, discolouration of fingers and toes, chest pain, and shortness of breath.Other symptoms listed by the experts and attributed to the Delta Plus variant are: stomache ache, nausea and appetite loss.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-delta-plus-variant-symptoms-and-how-to-protect-yourself-101624778167878.html

The cabinet formation was delayed due to several reasons by more than 50 days after the AINRC-led NDA emerged victorious in the assembly elections, the results of which were declared on May 2.Chief minister N Rangasamy took the oath on May 7 after which he contracted Covid-19. While he was being treated at a private Chennai hospital, the Union government nominated three BJP members as nominated MLAs. These nominated MLAs, who have voting rights, were from BJP in the previous Congress regime too who were crucial in numbers to topple the previous government.Later, AINRC and BJP bargained hard over cabinet posts and finally, the saffron party settled with the post of one speaker and two ministers. This led to a tussle within the BJP as supporters of all six elected MLA lobbied for the two cabinet berths.The new cabinet received the President’s assent on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puducherrys-first-nda-ministry-to-be-sworn-in-today-101624776725991.html

The authorities have however said it will be too early to draw any conclusions. Jammu and Kashmir police said it was treating it as a terror case and had detained two persons for questioning.The first blast at the airport, which is used for VVIP movements and armed forces’ strategic operations, took place at 1:37 am, damaging the roof of a building and the second one, said to be weaker in intensity, exploded at 1:42 am in an open area, the IAF said. It added that the blasts are being thoroughly probed by a high-level IAF investigation team, which was joined by a team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The Western Command Air chief has also reached the site.Watch: 2 minor blasts hit Jammu air force station, bomb disposal squad rushesA news wire reported that the blasts were carried out by “drones” and the “possible target of the drones was the aircraft parked in the dispersal area.”Another news agency cited people familiar with the developments to say that “investigators are also examining the possible use of drones to drop the explosives at the airport that has various assets of the IAF.”However, a defence spokesman advised the media to exercise restraint before drawing any conclusions.“There is no injury to any personnel or any damage to any equipment. Investigation is on and further details are awaited,” an IAF spokesman said.A person aware of the developments said the first blast created a hole in the rooftop of the building indicating use of “adequate amount of explosives”.

27-06-2021||India||Covid-19: How will you be compensated if things go south after vaccination?||As India comes out of the deadly second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) with fresh cases seeing a downward trend in the previous month, it is making a push for maximum vaccination coverage.Serum Institute of India's (SII) Covishield, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Russia’s Sputnik V are the three vaccines that have been cleared by the government. They have been used to inoculate as many as 32,17,60,077 people so far, according to the Union health ministry dashboard on Sunday.Meanwhile, SII has started the production of the first batch of Novavax’s vaccine, which will be locally manufactured under the brand name Covovax, on Friday. “Excited to witness the first batch of Covovax (developed by @Novavax) being manufactured this week at our facility in Pune. The vaccine has great potential to protect our future generations below the age of 18. Trials are ongoing. Well done team @seruminstindia! (sic),” said SII CEO Adar Poonawalla in a Twitter post on Friday.As more and more people are getting vaccinated in anticipation of the third wave which is around the corner, according to experts, the question that arises is how do those people who face post-vaccination complications get compensated?None of the three approved vaccine manufacturers has been provided indemnity by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). If anyone suffers injuries or dies during trials, the firms carrying them out will be made to pay compensation, the rules state. This means that the companies would not be held responsible and cannot be made to pay compensation if cases of deaths or reactions, after taking their products, surface.According to the Webster dictionary, indemnity means "security, insurance or exemption from loss or damage, past or to come; immunity from penalty, or the punishment of past offenses; amnesty."However, after the vaccines are approved for commercial use, those seeking compensation can lodge a complaint with the consumer forum or appeal with the high courts. DCGI can also take action against the firms if they find that components of the vaccine's registration certificate have been violated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-how-will-you-be-compensated-if-things-go-south-after-vaccination-101624766190331.html

In a series of tweets, the BSP chief also stated that her party has only announced a political tie-up with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) for the Punjab assembly elections to be held next year."This news is being broadcast in news channels since yesterday that the AIMIM and BSP will fight the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh together. This news is completely false, misleading and baseless. There is not even an iota of truth in this and the BSP vehemently denies it," Mayawati tweeted in Hindi."It is again clarified, in this regard, that except Punjab, the BSP will not contest the UP and Uttarakhand state polls early next year in alliance with any party which means it will fight on its own," she said in another post.Mayawati’s clarification comes amid reports of BSP, the Suheldeo Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) led by former UP minister Om Prakash Rajbhar and AIMIM coming together under the umbrella of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha to contest the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections scheduled next year.The BSP and the SAD have joined hands after a gap of 25 years. In its alliance with the SAD, the BSP will contest eight out of its allotted 20 seats in Doaba or Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Nawanshahr and Kapurthala districts, which has 23 assembly seats.She earlier asserted that her party is getting only the right leaders to join the BSP. "The local level leaders of the BSP have been continuously making only the right people of other parties, including the SP, join after investigation, this is well known,” she said.The BSP has been facing a crisis situation months ahead of polls after the party expelled state legislature party leader Lalji Verma and former state party president Ramachal Rajbhar for anti-party activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsp-to-fight-up-uttarakhand-polls-alone-announces-mayawati-101624762978786.html
27-06-2021||India||Threat of Covid-19 resurgence in Odisha as residents throw caution to winds||Odisha reported 3,554 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, 600 more than Friday and the test positivity rate (TPR) stayed above 5% for the fourth straight day after going under on June 21 and 22, triggering concerns that the infection may be on the rise again following the easing of lockdown and resultant violation of Covid-19 protocols. While some experts think the resurgence could also be linked to a lesser number of RT-PCR tests being done off late, the government is mulling extending the lockdown in at least 8 districts and the capital city of Bhubaneswar.TPR is on the rise since June 23 and in many districts including Khurda, Puri, Mayurbhanj, Jagatsinghpur and Cuttack it is higher than the state average, with Khurda recording 10.64% TPR- the highest in the state. As per the state Covid dashboard, TPR in 24 districts has shown a rising trend. The government thinks the TPR is rising due to violations of Covid-containment norms.“People out to buy a packet of milk are often found gossiping instead of returning home after the purchase. Infection is not declining because of people not adhering to Covid appropriate behaviour. The virus is there in the environment so transmission will happen,” director of state health services Bijay Mohapatra said.In another worrying sign, the state reported 47 deaths, the highest daily toll so far, on Saturday. Mohapatra said the government was closely monitoring the situation on a daily basis. “We have to see whether the severity [of infection] has lessened or not and if there is another surge. As [the] current lockdown restriction will continue till July 1, the government will decide whether to further relax restrictions at a high-level meeting on June 30.”Noted microbiologist Dr TM Mohapatra said the TPR may be higher due to the percentage of RT-PCR tests, considered to be the gold-standard of Covid testing, not going up. “In the last 10 days, the percentage of RT-PCR tests to total tests conducted is around 30-32%, the rest are Rapid Antigen tests. The easing of lockdown also led to people throwing all Covid appropriate behaviours to winds, which is also fuelling fresh infections,” he said.He cited the instances of crowding at vaccination centres without adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour as a case in point. On Saturday, the state police failed to contain thousands of people flocking to vaccination centres in Balasore and Cuttack. In Balasore Zilla School, over 1000 people arrived to receive the vaccine against the stock of 600 vaccine doses, resulting in chaos, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/threat-of-covid-19-resurgence-in-odisha-as-residents-throw-caution-to-winds-101624764184028.html

27-06-2021||India||Can fully vaccinated people get Covid-19 again? Experts weigh in||People, who have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), if they do become infected have a milder illness than those who have not been inoculated, several studies in India and abroad have shown. Experts have said that vaccination is key to containing the spread of the pandemic and remains the best protection against severe illness from Covid-19.Several studies have shown that vaccines are slightly less effective against the Delta variant of coronavirus but they are still highly effective but only after the second dose. Recent data from the UK government shows that full immunisation can offer about 96 per cent protection against hospitalisation and 79 per cent protection against symptomatic infection by the Delta variant. Protection after only one dose, however, is much weaker at 35 per cent, according to the same data."One dose is not enough, full vaccination is needed to protect the most vulnerable,” a public health notice from the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) has also said.AFP reported citing local American media that Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease scientist, called the variant the "greatest threat" to efforts to control the virus and urged for an acceleration in vaccinations.Also read | About 50% infected adults in Covid-19 Delta variant outbreak in Israel fully vaccinated: ReportCDC studyA study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which looked at more than 3,900 essential workers, shows fully vaccinated people are more than 90 per cent protected against infection. According to the ongoing study, even partially vaccinated people are 81 per cent less likely to become infected than people who haven't had been inoculated.The CDC study finds the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines authorised by the Food and Drug Administration “reduce the risk of infection by 91 percent for fully vaccinated people”. “This adds to the growing body of real-world evidence of their effectiveness. Importantly, this study also is among the first to show that mRNA vaccination benefits people who get COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated (14 or more days after dose 2) or partially vaccinated (14 or more days after dose 1 to 13 days after dose 2),” CDC said in a statement earlier this month.Also read | Fast unlocking, lesser vaccination rates risk renewed Covid spike, says reportThe study of health care staff, first responders and other frontline essential workers who have been tested weekly since December showed that so far 5 per cent have tested positive for coronavirus. Only 16 of the 204 people who became infected had been vaccinated. Those who got "breakthrough" infections after one or two doses of vaccine had 40 per cent less virus in their bodies and were 58 per cent less likely to have a fever. They spent two fewer days in bed than unvaccinated Covid-19 patients."Findings from the extended timeframe of this study add to accumulating evidence that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are effective and should prevent most infections — but that fully vaccinated people who still get COVID-19 are likely to have milder, shorter illness and appear to be less likely to spread the virus to others. These benefits are another important reason to get vaccinated,” the statement said.ICMR studyA study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in Odisha among those fully vaccinated has found that around 10 per cent of those reporting a breakthrough infection that bypass vaccine protection required hospitalisation. The preliminary study conducted during March 1 and June 10, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, found that 9.9% required hospitalisation with no significant difference between Covaxin and Covishield recipients and around 83.2% were symptomatic.Also read | As Delta variant cases rise, WHO asks fully vaccinated to keep masks onOnly one healthcare worker died after being infected during the study period and the median duration of hospitalisation among the reported cases was 11 days with one person still in the hospital. The most common symptoms found was fever, followed by cough and sore throat. Co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and asthma were present in about 64 people.The authors of the study said there were two limitations of the study. The number of documented vaccination breakthrough cases may be significantly a small fraction of all such cases. They also said that the study might not be a complete representation of breakthrough cases.Fortis studyA study released by Fortis Healthcare on June 17 found that a majority of fully vaccinated healthcare workers developed only mild illness after contracting the coronavirus disease and largely recovered under home care despite a surge in serious infections during the second wave of the pandemic. Only 1 per cent of fully vaccinated healthcare workers, who were infected after getting the shots, needed ICU care or ventilator support, the study said.Also read | India's vaccination not fast enough to foil Covid-19 3rd wave: ReportThe study assessed around 16,000 healthcare workers, who got both doses of vaccine between January and May this year. This included the peak period of the second wave when India was recording 350,000 to 400,000 Covid-19 cases each day and healthcare workers were working round the clock. Only 6 per cent of staff got infected after receiving both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the Fortis study. Amongst those who got infected after getting fully vaccinated, 92 per cent were mildly infected cases, 7 per cent developed moderate illness requiring oxygen support and only 1 per cent developed severe illness requiring ICU care or ventilation.The study emphasised that the vaccines available in India against Covid-19 are effective and do offer protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-fully-vaccinated-people-get-covid-19-again-experts-weigh-in-101624759161283.html

The swearing-in ceremony for the ministers, including three AINRC members and two BJP leaders, will be held at 2.30pm on Sunday in front of the Lt Governor’s office and residence, Raj Nivas.President Ram Nath Kovind gave his approval to the list of cabinet members submitted by chief minister Rangasamy to Soundararajan earlier this week. A Puducherry Gazette notification, according to news agency PTI, said that "the President has been pleased to appoint" A Namassivayam, K Lakshminarayanan, C Djeacoumar, Chandira Priyanga and AK Sai J Saravana Kumar as ministers in the cabinet. Lakshminarayanan, Djeacoumar and Priyanga are from the All India NR Congress and Namassivayam, who left the Congress before the Puducherry assembly elections polls, and Saravana Kumar are from its ally the Bharatiya Janata Party. Rangasamy submitted the list of the members to be included in his cabinet to Soundararajan on Wednesday, more than two months after the AINRC-BJP alliance won the April 6 assembly elections. AINRC founder Rangasamy was sworn in as Puducherry’s chief minister on May 7 and BJP's 'Embalam' R Selvam was elected unopposed as the Speaker of the 33-member assembly on June 16. The AINRC-led alliance won the Puducherry assembly elections in the Union territory after the then Congress-led regime collapsed in February. Infighting in the BJP, with supporters of all the six elected MLAs lobbying for cabinet posts, were among the several reasons behind the delay in the cabinet formation. Then Rangaswamy contracted Covid-19, a day after he took oath on May 7, and the newly-elected MLAs were sworn in on May 26. Negotiations between the AINRC and BJP over the number of cabinet berths also lead to the delay.Also read | Internal rift delays cabinet formation in PuducherryAccording to PTI, Puducherry would get its first woman minister in over four decades with Priyanga taking the oath of office on Sunday afternoon.

Before (1996) elections, Narasimha Raoji promised us autonomy. He said ‘sky is the limit but not independence’. We said we have never asked for independence, we have asked for autonomy.

27-06-2021||India||AP govt dispenses with interviews in all job recruitments||Hyderabad: The Andhra Pradesh government on Saturday formally announced to dispense with interviews for all recruitments done through the state public service commission to fill up job vacancies in various government departments. In the order (GO No. 58), chief secretary Adityanath Das on Saturday said the government had taken the decision to dispense with interviews for the recruitments to be done by the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC) for all categories of jobs, including for Group-I Services. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led state government had recently announced filling up of 10,143 jobs in 2021-22. The decision was taken with a view to maintaining utmost transparency and ensuring complete trust of competing candidates in the entire selection process. “The order to dispense with interviews is applicable for all the recruitments notified on or after June 26,” the order said. The chief secretary directed the secretary of APPSC to take necessary action for the implementation of the order. In 2011, the erstwhile combined Andhra Pradesh government abolished interviews for filling up of various posts, except for Group-1 services (deputy collector and revenue divisional officer posts etc.) and for the posts of executive, where articulation skills and public interface was required. After the bifurcation, the government for the residuary Andhra Pradesh in 2016 and 2017 re-introduced interview system for filling up a few more top positions in the state government. “However, at a review meeting conducted to introduce reforms in the job recruitment in October 2019, it was proposed to abolish interviews for recruitment of any posts notified by the APPSC,” the chief secretary said, adding that the government, after careful examination of the proposal, decided to implement it from now. Andhra University professor S Prasanna Sree welcomed the decision of the state government to do away with the interviews. “It will help candidates from rural background, who, fail to get through interviews despite doing extremely well in the written tests,” she said, adding that communication skills do not matter much if they have administrative skills. Prasanna Sree also said abolition of interviews would also eradicate corruption in recruitments. “It will make the recruitments more transparent and merit-based,” she asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ap-govt-dispenses-with-interviews-in-all-job-recruitments-101624735140745.html
27-06-2021||India||Gold smuggling case: CPI(M) cracks whip as probe links leaders||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has tightened its grips on cadres in Kannur after the alleged liaison of some party workers with gold smuggling gangs came to light. The CPI (M) has also launched a campaign to weed out anti-party elements often guilty of violent clashes with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) workers in the district. The party youth wing, Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), will start a week-long march in the district from July 5 to uphold Communist values and check a possible deviation from ideology, said DYFI district unit in a statement. The party workers alleged involvement in gold-smuggling came to light when the Customs and Kerala police’s probe into the death of a five-member gang in Kozhikode, who were trying to loot 2.50kg of gold smuggled from Dubai to Kozhikode airport last Monday, led them to a CPI (M) worker Arjun Ayanki. Later, it was known that the vehicle used in the alleged attempt was owned by another leader of the DYFI, police said. In Kannur, political parties usually hire criminal gangs for violent political activities and groom them. Since peace is prevailing in the district these gangs are turning a liability to parties. Now many are into contract criminal activities and smuggling, a senior police officer of the district said. After the incident, a series of audio tapes and phone conversations surfaced on social and electronic media, which clearly showed that some of the youth leaders were allegedly involved in smuggling and counter-smuggling activities. Counter-smuggling is looting of the smuggled gold. Since both activities are illegal, nobody filed cases in such incidents. Absconding after the accident, Ayanki was summoned by the Customs on Monday. “Many self-made warriors are appearing frequently on social media. The party has nothing to do with them. They are doing more damage to the ideology than helping it. We will weed out such forces,” said DFYI state secretary A A Rahim on Saturday. CPI (M) Kannur district secretary M V Jayarajan and excise minister M V Govindan also said such elements will have no place in the party. “We have not assigned anyone to campaign on social media. Some self-made warriors are doing it for publicity and acceptance. We will expose them,” said Jayarajan. Opposition BJP has sought a high-level inquiry into politician-smuggling nexus. “The CPI(M) is now disowning smugglers after they turn a liability to the party. It is an open secret many smuggling gangs thrived under the present regime,” said party state president K Surendran. The gold smuggling issue came to light after last Monday’s accident. Police said five deceased were part of a looting team from Palakkad and they reportedly came to Kozhikode airport after they got information about the smuggled gold. But the customs authorities seized gold, concealed in a coffee-making machine, and arrested the carrier Mohammad Shafeek. Another gang from Kannur, who were planning to receive the smuggled gold, was chased by the Palakkad team under the impression that they were carrying the yellow metal. Both these gangs were unaware that the carrier was arrested and a chase ensued and which resulted in the accident. Police said clashes between gangs are regular and they never file complaints. Among four international airports in the state, Kozhikode is the hub for gold smuggling – on average 10 seizures take place in a month. Among south Indian states, Kerala topped in gold smuggling cases with 600 kgs of precious metal seized last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gold-smuggling-case-cpi-m-cracks-whip-as-probe-links-leaders-101624735080652.html
27-06-2021||India||Looking back: Fierce women who mastered the art of war||A virakallu or a hero-stone, dating back to 950 AD talks about a woman warrior – Saviyabbe. The sculpture at the top depicts her as an amazon riding a horse, flourishing a sword against a man on an elephant. The story is not fiction.As per records, she was the daughter of the chief Bayika and since some Ganga kings had titles with the suffix Vidyadhara, historians believe that Saviyabbe’s husband was a Ganga prince. Saviyabbe fought along with her husband and many other soldiers, finally losing her life during the battle of Bagiyur.In February 2020, the Supreme Court ordered the union government to ensure that women officers are given a permanent commission in the Army while adding that the officers will be now eligible for command posting. The decisions stood in stark contrast to the Centre’s opinion, which belonged to the school of thought that women were not suitable for commanding posts in the army because male troops were not yet ready to accept their orders.While the debates over women in combat roles continue, history tells a different story. In the history of Karnataka itself, there are several women like Saviyabbe, who fought or commanded armies in battle.In history books, the story of Rani Abbakka, as a ruler and a military commander, stands out. In the battles against the Portuguese, she not only commanded an army but a navy as well. The Karnataka state gazette, which details the history of ‘Queen of Ullala’ described her as a persistent opposition to the Portuguese expansion.“She worked in close alliance with the several chiefs of Malabar and against her husband who was an ally of the Portuguese” read the gazette notes on her.Dr Tukaram Poojary, a retired history professor, who researched Abbakka said that her husband Lakshmanappa wanted to join hands with the Portuguese, so she left him. “She then took over as the ruler of Ullal, which she got as the matriarchal system was practised at that time. She took on the Portuguese in three battles,” he said.As per records, she took on the Portuguese when she decided to stop paying tributes to them when they attacked the chief of Cannanore (today’s Kerala), her erstwhile ally in 1555. Three years later, the queen took on the Portuguese by assisting naval attack led by the Raja of Cannanore against the Portuguese. “The Portuguese was so incensed at this that he reduced Mangalore to ashes. The queen again ceased to pay tributes to the Portuguese, when they declared war on her ally, the Raja of Cannanore in 1566.”In 1567, a punitive expedition was sent against her by the Portuguese governor under Joao Peixote, according to the Gazette. The Portuguese army attacked Ullal under General Joao Peixoto. He captured the city and occupied the palace. However, the Queen managed to escape and hide in a mosque. In the dead of night, with 200 soldiers, she raided the Portuguese and managed to kill General Peixoto and 70 soldiers. The invaders fled to their ships. She followed and killed the admiral of the fleet.In 1588, however, Goa Viceroy Anthony D’ Noronha led another attack against Ullal with a grand Armada. Ullal fell and was destroyed in this attack. The queen also died, as per the legend, leading her men from the front.But this was not the end. There rose from the ashes like a phoenix, another Abbakka.“It was under her rule, the Portuguese suffered one of the biggest naval battles in the subcontinent. Abbakka, the second, took over in 1594. She gained great fame throughout the Indian Ocean by attacking and burning the Portuguese fleet in 1618. This ensured that invasions by the Portuguese stopped in the coastal regions of Karnataka,” said Poojary.The Indian Navy finally acknowledged India’s rare woman naval hero and named a patrol vessel Rani Abbakka after her in 2012.Another female military commander from Karnataka’s history was Belawadi Mallamma, ruler of today’s Belgavi. She took on Shivaji after his armies began raiding the livestock in her territory. Mallamma led her force of two thousand women soldiers to attack the Maratha garrison. With two hundred men wounded and ten to twelve men dead, the Maratha commander agreed to surrender the livestock.Shivaji when he heard the news was exasperated and ordered his cavalry to attack Belawadi till it surrendered. The battle between the two rulers raged for fifteen days. During the battle, Mallamma raided Shivaji while he was offering prayers at a temple and following this battle Shivaji came to a truce with the Mallamma.While Mallamma proved her worth on the battlefield against Shivaji, another commander from Karnataka, Chennamma of Keladi ruled took on the Mughals by sheltering Shivaji’s son Rajaram. Chennamma was the ruler of Keladi on the coast of Karnataka from 1671 to 1696.As per records, Rajaram approached Chennamma dressed as a monk and sought protection. Soon she received a letter from Aurangzeb demanding that she hand over Rajaram to him. She refused. ”Aurangzeb, the big Moghul force was near Keladi. The soldiers of Keladi prepared and ambushes through a thick jungle and the Moghul soldiers who were accustomed to the dry climate of the North were caught in the heavy monsoon of the Malnad area. Some battles were led by Chennamma,” said Rajesh HG, editor of Itihasa Darapana.The forces of Keladi had captured several of the Moghul captains, a large number of horses and considerable war material. By then Rajaram had reached Jinji fort and Mughals withdrew from the battle.In the 1800s the tradition of women leading battles continued with Kittur Chennamma, who took on the British, who wanted to take over her kingdom citing ‘Doctrine of Lapse’. British launched multiple attacks against an army commanded by Chennamma.British army attacked Kittur on 21 October 1824, with 20,000 men and 400 guns. Despite having a numerically inferior force, Chennamma put up a tough fight and won the first round of battle. The British army faced massive losses and two British officer Walter Elliot was taken as hostages.However, the British troops launched a second attack. This time, because of the humiliation of losing to a woman in the first battle, they roped in armies from Mysore, and Sholapur for the attack. They also convinced two of her soldiers to betray her by mixing cow dung and mud with the gunpowder used for canons. This time, she was captured and imprisoned for life at Bailhongal Fort. She passed away on 21 February 1829, while in prison.These were some of the women from Karnataka who led their armies to victory.In her book “Women medieval Karnataka”, Dr MB Padma wrote that the records talk about many more women like Kanskarve, Chigaladevi, Chola Mahidevi, Dappali Devi and others who organized expeditions fought boldly on the battlefields and spoke courageously for justice. “Even an ordinary woman like Lakshamma Gauvndi, fought robbers to save the cows and had the honour of death on the battlefield itself. Thus, they keep up the martial spirit and the flame of patriotism successfully,” she wrote in her book.The note perhaps is valuable in the argument for women in combat roles today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/looking-back-fierce-women-who-mastered-the-art-of-war-101624735020658.html

Mahabubabad district superintendent of police N Koti Reddy, quoting the deceased’s relatives in Gangaram village, told Hindustan Times that Saradakka died sometime during the night of June 24 due to Covid-19 in the forests of Chhattisgarh. Her relatives were informed about her death on Saturday and her last rites were performed by the cadre on Friday evening. “However, there has been no statement issued by the Maoist party about the death of Saradakka till now,” he said. Haribhushan, who had been underground for over three decades and led several teams against the security forces, succumbed to Covid-19 on June 21. The Maoist party issued a statement on Thursday confirming his death along with that of another senior Maoist leader Bharatakka, a day after the Telangana police announced their demise. Hailing from the Gothi Koya tribal group from Madagudem village of Mahabubabad district, Haribhushan married Saradakka from Gangaram, close to his village during the movement, which she joined in 1995. Saradakka was the commander of the Maoist party in Charla-Shabari area bordering the Bhadradri Kothagudem district. Haribhushan’s family found fault with the Maoist party for not handing over his body to them for the last rites and instead choosing to cremate their leader in the forests. His younger brother Ashok told local reporters in Madagudem village on Friday that it was not fair on the part of the Maoists to cremate Haribhushan’s body in the forests without informing his family members. He wondered why the Maoists had announced Haribhushan’s death only after the police disclosed it to the media. “The Maoists should have conveyed the news to us first before conducting the last rites. They should have handed over the body to us through civil rights organisations,” Ashok said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-maoist-leader-haribhushan-s-wife-also-succumbs-to-covid-19-in-chhattisgarh-forests-101624734841411.html

The next set of elections in six of the seven states--Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Manipur, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat-- are crucial for the BJP as the party will contest to retain power with a comfortable majority. In Punjab, the party is already facing a huge challenge amid protests against the passage of controversial farm laws.Later in the day, Nadda chaired another meeting with BJP’s national general secretaries.Saturday’s meetings come close on the heels of a series of review meetings chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the work done by various central ministries.Meanwhile, the party is also working on tackling criticism over management of the Covid-19 pandemic. “There has been an impact of the second wave on the party’s overall popularity; so all efforts will be made to reach out to the people with the details of what has been done by the government as well as what is in the pipeline,” said a functionary who did not want to be named.In UP, Uttarakhand and Gujarat particularly, the BJP governments have been facing a lot of criticism regarding Covid-19 management. Severe shortfall of oxygen, medicines and other gaps in health care were reported from these states, triggering sharp attacks from the Opposition. In Goa, too, several fatalities due to severe gaps in oxygen supply have set off public anger against the government.The party has decided to pull out all the stops to placate the masses as well as make up for the administrative lapses. Additionally, the party and the government have to also address the problems of economic slowdown and subsequent jobs cuts exacerbated by the pandemic.A second functionary said the importance of reaching out to the workers and strengthening the organisation as also discussed at the meeting. “In many states the workers too faced difficulties and there is a feeling of alienation among them. It is important to reach out to them as they are the ones who will build a bridge between the masses and the government,” the second functionary said.Nadda has already set out a blueprint for the party cadre to step up their outreach programme Seva Hi Sangathan (organisation is service) campaign to aid the government’s efforts of encouraging Covid appropriate behaviour.Saturday’s meeting was attended by the Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, home minister Amit Shah, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, railways minister Piyush Goyal, textile minister Smriti Irani, sports minister Kiren Rijiju and petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-meets-ministers-general-secretaries-reviews-preparations-for-2022-polls-101624734061962.html

Her family also alleged that they requested the policemen to allow their car to pass through, but they did not relent.“Our family is shattered. Doctors told us had she reached in time, she could have been saved,” Mishra’s husband said after performing the cremation rituals at Bhairon Ghat in Kanpur on Saturday afternoon.On learning about the woman’s death, the President called Kanpur police commissioner Asim Arun and district magistrate Alok Tiwari to the circuit house. The police chief and the district magistrate visited the ghat on Saturday and condoled the family members of the deceased on behalf of the President.Arun also apologised on behalf of the Kanpur police. “We pledge that our route system in future will be such that citizens are stopped for the minimum time so that such incidents are not repeated,” he tweeted.In the evening, the Kanpur police issued a statement saying that sub-inspector Sunil Kumar and three constables have been suspended for holding the traffic for a prolonged period. Additional DCP (South) Basant Lal has been asked to conduct the inquiry into the incident, said the statement.The traffic was stopped near the Govindpuri railway overbridge as the presidential train, in which the president was travelling with his family, was about to pass.

This week has seen the highest number of daily jabs, an average of 6.97 million per day, in over six months of India’s vaccination drive. The spike in daily vaccinations began from June 21, when the central government’s revised immunisation policy came into effect.“The PM was informed that 3.77 crore doses have been administered in the last 6 days, which is more than the entire population of countries like Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Canada. It was also discussed that 128 districts in the country have vaccinated more than 50% of the 45+ population and 16 districts have vaccinated more than 90% of the 45+ population,” a government statement said on Saturday.It added that the Prime Minister “expressed satisfaction at the rising speed of vaccinations in this week and stressed that it is important to carry this momentum forward”.India has given at least one dose of the vaccines to 19% of its total population so far. Opposition parties have repeatedly asked the government to scale up India’s vaccination drive to avert a potential third wave of the pandemic.At this week’s rate of vaccinations, India will take 239 days, till February 20, 2022, to inoculate all of its adult population.The statement on Saturday noted that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) can be roped in to encourage people to take the jab and fight vaccine hesitancy in parts of the country.“Modi was also briefed that the Union government’s Covid-19 management teams are in touch with state governments to explore and implement innovative methods to reach people for vaccination,” it said.“As NGOs or social organisations working in the grassroots have good access to the local population, their involvement can help in vaccination drive,” said an official aware of the development.At the meeting, the Prime Minister directed officials to lend New Delhi’s technological expertise after it was pointed out that many countries have shown growing interest in Co-Win — the India-made app that is the backbone for user registrations and appointments to facilitate the country’s vaccination drive.A presentation on the progress of the vaccination drive apprised PM Modi about the vaccine supply in the upcoming months and efforts being made to increase production, the government statement said.Saturday’s meeting was attended by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria among other officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-momentum-of-vaccine-drive-modi-at-review-meet-101624733820543.html
27-06-2021||India||Delimitation panel to meet over J&K polls||The delimitation commission is set to meet on Wednesday to decide when to hold an all-party meeting with national and local political units with nearly nine months left to complete the exercise, as Jammu and Kashmir gears up for its first assembly election since it became a Union territory, people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.“The commission will meet on Wednesday to decide a time to have an all-party meeting, including the local parties in Jammu and Kashmir,” a person familiar with the matter said. “The meeting will be held within in the month of July.”The commission will also carve constituencies for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes for the first time in the erstwhile state. The primary aim will be to create constituencies on the basis of “physical features, existing boundaries of administrative units, facilities of communication and public convenience”. The commission was granted a yearlong extension in March this year to complete the exercise.Former Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai heads the commission which was constituted in March 2020 to redraw the Lok Sabha and assembly constituencies of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the northeastern states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland. Election commissioner Sushil Chandra and state election commissioners of Jammu and Kashmir and the four states are ex-officio members of the commission.The commission has since decided to not conduct an exercise in the north-east after concerns were raised about whether that fell within its purview.The commission is set to discuss how to allocate the seven new constituencies it will be adding to the union territory of J&K. The number of constituencies will go up from 107 to 114, with the commission focusing on allocating areas for 90 constituencies in the Union territory, as the other 24 are part of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.The last redrawing of J&K’s assembly boundaries was in 1995 and based on the 1981 census. The erstwhile state was governed under the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution and Jammu and Kashmir Representation of the People Act, 1957, until its special status was revoked. After the 2001 census, the J&K assembly passed a law putting delimitation on hold until 2026.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah held discussions with representatives from several political outfits of Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday. Fourteen prominent leaders, including National Conference chief Omar Abdullah and PDP head Mehbooba Mufti, from Jammu and Kashmir took part in the meeting where issues of delimitation and statehood were discussed.This was the first meeting of its kind since the abrogation of Article 370 and the bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two Union territories in August 2019. Political parties from the state have expressed concerns regarding the delimitation exercise, with Abdullah saying that the exercise should be undertaken with the rest of the country in an interview with the Indian Express. A national delimitation will now be due only after 2026 as an amendment was passed by Parliament to freeze the constituencies demarcated in 2002 until then.The delimitation commission has already collated census and geographical data to factor in the existing difficulties and communication needs of the newly formed Union territory. “There are considerations of a geographical nature, such as access in hilly districts, the Commission will have to ensure that the most basic administrative block, whether it is the tehsil or the district, is not broken down in the process. This way there can be seamless elections and effective implementation of government schemes,” said one of the people cited above.The delimitation of new assembly constituencies will be based on the 2011 census data. The commission is also perusing representations from various parties as it undertakes the process, including one from the Vistapit Kashmiri Pandits, an organisation from the Valley seeking consideration for displaced Kashmiri pandits.“There has been no fresh approach to the National Conference from the Delimitation Commission but as & when that happens The central working committee of the party has authorised the party president Dr Farooq Abdullah to take a view at the appropriate time on this,” said National Conference spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delimitation-panel-to-meet-over-j-k-polls-101624733760544.html
27-06-2021||India||Took back charge of vaccine drive on states’ request: Centre||The Union government took back charge of sourcing and supplying vaccines to states after as many as 13 chief ministers wrote to it with a request for a reset of the policy, the Centre informed the Supreme Court on Saturday.“The said decision to review the strategy was taken after receipt of letters from 13 Hon’ble chief ministers as well as health ministers of various states and after debating and deliberating the pros and cons of such decision,” said the affidavit filed by the Centre in the case registered suo motu (on its own) by the apex court to scrutinise the vaccination policy and supply of essential drugs and services during the Covid-19 pandemic.The affidavit said that the letters were received from the CMs and other ministers between May 15 and June 2, asking for a review of the liberalised vaccination policy which was brought into effect from May and brought significant changes to the Covid-19 vaccination protocol. This change paved for people in the 18-44 age group to get doses, so long as these shots were acquired directly by the states or private hospitals from the manufacturers.“The Government of India, therefore, decided to review the strategy to factor in the problems highlighted by the state governments and keeping in mind the main objective of maximising vaccination in the minimum possible time under the most extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances which is being faced by the humanity in general and by India in particular,” added the affidavit.Following the representations from the state government and upon assessing the experience on the ground, the Centre started reviewing the policy “so that the problems faced by the state governments may not hamper the vaccination drive and citizens also do not suffer in any manner.”It stated that as part of a review, two meetings were conducted “at the level of highest political executive of the country” on May 15 and May 21 before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on June 7 that the Centre was taking over the task of vaccination from state governments and will provide Covid-19 vaccines free of cost to all adults from later this month.The affidavit has not identified either the CMs or the states that asked for a revision of the policy while pointing out that the previous policy of May 1 was also brought in “only with a view to accommodate the requests of state governments, so that they continue to be completely focused and committed as equal stakeholders to the mission of national vaccination”.The Union government, defending the May 1 policy, emphasised that the states’ requests for autonomy in vaccine procurement and administration of dosage were accommodated “for ensuring overall success of the National Vaccination Policy, in the face of constraints of vaccine awareness and hesitancy”.The Supreme Court in its order on June 2 had said that the Centre’s May 1 policy, which had put the onus of giving doses to adults in the below-45 years age group entirely on states and private hospitals, was “prima facie arbitrary and irrational”. The bench, headed by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, held that this policy “conflicts with the constitutional balance of responsibilities between the Centre and states” while seeking justification also on differential pricing of vaccines between the Centre and states.The Centre’s affidavit has maintained that the option was made available to states and Union Territories to expand their vaccination drives to 18-44 age group on the states’ own requests even as the Union government kept providing free vaccines to the states for those above 45. It has, however, not addressed the issue of differential pricing stating that the old policy now stood replaced with a new one.About the involvement of private hospitals, which will continue procuring 25% vaccines under the new policy as well, the Centre said that their engagement in any public health programme was always “desirable” so as to give wider reach to vaccination and lessen the stress on government facilities.It added that vaccine manufacturers were permitted to sell vaccines to private hospitals at higher rates because “unless the vaccine manufacturers have an incentive or financial ability, they may either not have the capacity to augment their potential or may not sense the viability to do so”. Additionally, this would cross-subsidise the price at which they were supplying 75% of their manufactured vaccines to the central government, said the affidavit.“With a view to ensure that there is no exploitation by private hospitals, it has also been mandated that no private hospital could charge more than ₹150 per dose from the individuals choosing to get vaccinated in a private facility over and above the price paid by private hospitals to the manufacturers,” added the affidavit.The Union government maintained that under the new policy, all persons above 18 years of age throughout the country are entitled to get free vaccination irrespective of their financial position.“To put the same position differently, a person below poverty line and a multi-millionaire are equally entitled for the very same vaccine in the age group of 18 years and above free of cost,” the 380-page document said.It further said that digital divide, if any, will not be an impediment in the vaccination since after May 23, on-site registration and digital registration on CoWIN platform had been allowed for 18 years and above, besides putting in place mechanism also for ‘Near to Home Covid Vaccination Centres’.The Centre’s affidavit will be examined by the SC bench, which also includes justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, on Monday when the matter is heard next.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/took-back-charge-of-vaccine-drive-on-states-request-govt-101624733700543.html

27-06-2021||India||Covid-19: Projected vaccine dose availability cut, but will suffice||About 1.86 billion vaccine doses will be available for the national Covid-19 immunisation programme through the year -- 516 million of those till the end of July -- the Centre has submitted in an affidavit to the Supreme Court.The number, though lower than the estimated 2.16 billion vaccine doses expected by December as publicly stated by the government earlier, should still be enough to inoculate all adults in the country by the end of the year.The revised government estimates have reduced vaccine availability between August and December by 37.5% or 810 million doses, removing three vaccines from the initially projected list of eight coronavirus vaccines.An estimated 500 million doses of Covishield, 400 million of Covaxin, 300 million of Biological E’s protein sub-unit vaccine, 50 million of Zydus Cadila’s DNA vaccine and 100 million of the Russia-made Sputnik V have been projected to be available for the government programme from August onwards.According to the earlier projection that VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, released on May 13 during a health ministry media briefing, production and availability of 2.16 billion doses between August and December included 750 million Covishield, 550 million Covaxin, 300 million Biological E, 50 million Zydus Cadila, 200 million Novavax (which Serum Institute of India is manufacturing locally as Covovax), 100 million Bharat Biotech’s nasal vaccine, 60 million Gennova’s mRNA vaccine, and 156 million Sputnik V doses.The country has an estimated 930-940 million people in the category of 18 years and above who are eligible for vaccination under current norms. On June 7, the government revised its vaccination policy to include all adults for immunisation under the government programme.“As such, administering two doses to these beneficiaries would require an estimated 186 to 188 crore vaccine doses… out of this requirement, 51.6 crore doses will be made available for administration by 31.07.2021 leaving a requirement of approximately 135 crore vaccine doses for complete vaccination to the eligible population,” said the affidavit.“It is submitted that the Central Government has procured a total of 34.6 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine (Covishield: 26.6 crore doses, Covaxin: 8 crore doses) and - additional 1 crore doses as commodity assistance under COVAX facility… taking the total availability of vaccine doses to 35.6 crore doses as on date of filing this affidavit. Apart from these supplies, it is expected that around 16 crore doses will also be available during the period of May 2021 & July 2021 across the country,” the affidavit said.Two vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — are currently part of the government’s vaccination programme since January 16, 2021. While Serum Institute of India locally manufactures the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine under the brand name Covishield, Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research co-developed Covaxin.Another Covid-19 vaccine, the Russian-made Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya Institute, also received the national drug regulator’s emergency use authorisation on April 13 and is now being administered at select private vaccination centres in the country.The government is also expecting Covid vaccine doses soon from Biological E and Zydus Cadila that are in late stages of clinical trials.Experts, however, said that the government should have pre-ordered doses.“The government should have put in advanced purchase orders; what they did instead is purchase what the manufacturers had on their shelves. So the companies produced the doses at their own pace instead of the government dictating how many doses they need and by when,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology, Christian Medical College-Vellore.“My guess is after the second wave, herd immunity has been reached; whether we vaccinate or not, the number of cases will come down. Now, the vaccination drive needs to focus on people who are likely to die if they get the infection, something which we were doing in January and February when we should have been carrying out a large-scale vaccination campaign to prevent the second wave,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/projected-dose-availability-cut-but-will-suffice-101624730520433.html
27-06-2021||India||No insurance provision for Covid-19 cover: Centre||The Union government has told the Supreme Court there is no policy or scheme that provides for national insurance coverage for deaths due to Covid-19, and that there has been no deliberation to include the pandemic for risk insurance coverage against natural disasters in the country.In a written submission before the apex court, filed on Saturday in response to a public interest litigation by advocate Gaurav Bansal for payment of ex-gratia amount of ₹4 lakh for every Covid-19 death, the Centre reiterated that the finance commission, in October 2020, recommended against including the pandemic as a disaster for providing monetary relief.The submission was filed by the Centre in justification of the Union government’s affidavit stating that the ex-gratia amount of ₹4 lakh cannot be paid to the families of those who have died of Covid-19 as it is beyond fiscal affordability, and the finances of central and state governments are under severe strain.Also Read| Centre rules out ₹4 lakh ex-gratia for deaths due to Covid-19On June 21, a bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah sought to know from the Centre if the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), led by the Prime Minister, considered the issue of ex-gratia before deciding against it and also asked whether uniform guidelines could be framed on the payment of ex-gratia.In its submission, the government did not respond on whether there was a conscious decision by the national authority against framing of a scheme for payment of ex-gratia to the families of those who have died of Covid-19.It, however, maintained that the ex-gratia payments were confined only to 12 identified and notified disasters – cyclone, drought, earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, hailstorm, landslide, avalanche, cloudburst, pest-attack, frost and cold wave.“However, Covid-19 has not been recommended by the XV Finance Commission for financing of relief measures from SDRMF/ NDRMF (state and national disaster relief management funds), which includes ex-gratia payment,” said the submission. The Centre said that ad hoc ex-gratia payments being made by state governments were from chief ministers’ and state relief funds, and not from the state disaster funds.It added that the Union government devised its strategy to rationally and judiciously use resources of the country to deal with Covid-19 “rather than formulating the response in the straitjacket formula of minimum standards of relief, as contemplated under the NDMA, 2005”.“The issue is not of fiscal affordability, but rather of the most rational, judicious and optimum usage of fiscal and all other resources of the nation,” said the submission, even as it did not specify whether the finance commission’s recommendations to grant no ex-gratia payments for Covid-19 deaths were placed before NDMA for consideration.It said that Covid-19 was notified as a disaster in March 2020 “for the purpose of limited assistance towards containment measures” and for “one-time temporary arrangement” but the aspect of ex-gratia was kept confined only to 12 identified disasters.About the finance commission’s recommendation on the national insurance scheme, the Union government said that the insurance intervention scheme on disaster-related deaths also did not cover deaths due to Covid-19.“Presently there is no guideline/policy/scheme in NDMA which relates to National Insurance mechanism that may be used to pay for disaster related deaths due to Covid-19,” said the submission.Also Read| Covid in India: Deaths near grim milestone of 400,000, fresh cases fall furtherIt noted that talks have been held between NDMA and various other functionaries of the Centre and states in 2020-21 on risk insurance coverage against natural disasters in India and the final report was also submitted in April by the working group but “the insurance coverage being deliberated does not cover risk insurance from pandemics or epidemics like the Covid-19”.In the last hearing, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, read from the report of the Finance Commission for 2021-26, which allocated funds under Disaster Risk Management, to make the point that ex-gratia of ₹4 lakh for every death due to Covid-19 will alone mop up the entire allocations under state disaster relief funds.The bench, however, observed that it was mandatory under Section 12 of NDMA to frame guidelines prescribing ex-gratia as part of “Minimum Standards of Relief” as it commented that the recommendations by finance commission could not override statutory requirement under NDMA.On June 21, the court reserved orders on the petitions while giving the Centre time to file written submissions on the questions raised in Bansal’s PIL, including whether a countrywide uniform compensation scheme for Covid-19 deaths could be fixed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-provide-insurance-cover-for-covid-centre-101624730160345.html

27-06-2021||Today's||Engaging with the Taliban is necessary||India’s “quiet visit” to meet with the Taliban in Doha, confirmed by Mutlaq bin Majed al-Qahtani, Qatar’s special envoy for counterterrorism and conflict resolution, marks a significant shift in India’s approach towards Afghanistan. For decades, New Delhi refused to engage with the Taliban. The group’s dependence on Pakistan, its religious extremism, and support for transnational jihadists, including Kashmir-centric outfits, are the core reasons for India remaining distant. But the decision of the United States (US) to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan triggered a shift.Before unpacking the costs and benefits of engaging with the Taliban, it is worth reiterating the central driver of India’s Afghanistan policy i.e., to ensure a strategic balance between Kabul and Islamabad. The asymmetry of power between these countries notwithstanding, India wants to ensure that nationalist Afghan opinion — critical of Pakistan’s interventionism — remains alive and assertive. This is why New Delhi persisted with its advocacy of an “Afghan-owned, Afghan-led” reconciliation process. Talking to the Taliban, then, is as much an exercise in preventing harm to India’s interests, as to gauge the depth and breadth of the group’s nationalism.The benefits of this successful outreach are apparent. The Taliban acknowledges India’s constructive role in Afghanistan, and would not want a reduction in its diplomatic presence. There is no guarantee that it will prevent the use of Afghan soil by anti-India militants, but it has certainly expressed unwillingness to support such elements. Careful about not being caught between an India-Pakistan crossfire, the Taliban wants to distance itself from the Kashmir imbroglio. The outreach in Doha, then, has instilled cautious optimism among Indian officials that the Taliban may not openly hostile, and may even seek stronger ties in the medium-term.But the outreach is not risk-free.One, the Taliban could go back on its promises and, with a nudge from Pakistan, target Indian interests. If not this, then the Taliban interlocutors India is engaging with (the same figures the US is talking to, such as Mullah Baradar) could be sidelined, or worse, replaced by pro-Pakistan hardliners such as the Haqqanis. This is a considerable risk. After all, families of Taliban leaders reside in Pakistan. This offers the host valuable leverage, and Islamabad’s desire to reduce India’s presence in Afghanistan is well known.India still feels the humiliation of the 1999 IC-814 hijacking, when India’s northern allies were busy with infighting as the Taliban harassed India in Kandahar at Pakistan’s behest. Taliban factions on the ground have not broken ties with the al-Qaeda and the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Notably, they are also sheltering anti-Pakistan Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan elements as an insurance. In this context, the closure of India’s Jalalabad and Herat consulates due to persistent threats offers good reason for scepticism.Two, outreach to the Taliban could expedite Kabul’s fall, and complicate India’s relations with existing allies. This argument has been potent enough to prevent an India-Taliban channel to develop at various moments since 2010, when the idea of talking to the Taliban became internationally acceptable. In 2012-13, the then president Hamid Karzai’s pushback against the US’s engagement with the Taliban put an end to India’s own outreach. Silent in nature, the idea of talking to the Taliban then was the same as now i.e., to assess their desire for autonomy from Pakistan and attitude towards India as the US announced its departure in 2014.Despite these risks, there are compelling reasons for India to talk to the Taliban. For one, these concerns would remain valid regardless of India’s outreach. If nothing else, India’s absence in the Taliban’s calculus would make it even more expendable if the Islamic republic collapses.India’s support for Kabul and consolidation of relations with powerbrokers such as Marshall Dostum, Muhammad Mohaqiq, Ustad Atta, Ahmad Massoud, Ismail Khan, Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, Hamid Karzai and others, reduces the risk of dislocating its relationship with existing allies. These figures, barring an isolated president Ashraf Ghani, have been encouraging India to open channels with the Taliban. Aimed at supporting an inclusive setup in Kabul, India’s outreach to the Taliban is not at the expense of its allies, and they know it.There is an argument that the outreach should have been kept secret.Often unaccounted for, and prone to manipulation, covert contacts don’t build enduring alliances. If India seeks a politically inclusive Afghanistan and builds relations with all ethnic communities, then its outreach to the Taliban requires openness. India’s calibrated leaks have demonstrated the existence of this channel, which the Taliban has not denied, without outing specifics. This is loaded signalling for multiple audiences.For India’s strategic community, this suggests that New Delhi will not forget IC-814, but it cannot keep its Afghanistan policy hostage to that episode. For the Taliban, this is a signal of intent i.e., India is willing to accept the Taliban’s rise, but only as long as the Taliban respects Indian interests. Once in power, targeting India will not be cost-free for the Taliban (if New Delhi augments support for its allies), and over-dependence on Pakistan won’t take them far as administrators.The critical signal is for Pakistan i.e., India can absorb temporary setbacks, but will stay the course in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s notional strategic depth in Afghanistan will not help achieve its objectives vis-à-vis Kashmir. If anything, India’s outreach to the Taliban might complicate Pakistan’s relations with the Taliban once the latter comes to power and faces the pressures of governance and administration.Avinash Paliwal teaches at SOAS University of London and is the author of My Enemy’s Enemy: India in Afghanistan from the Soviet Invasion to the US Withdrawal The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/engaging-with-the-taliban-is-necessary-101624803847518.html
27-06-2021||Today's||A roadmap from the Congress: Four pillars to fight the coronavirus||On May 28, the Union government announced that it will vaccinate all Indians by December 31, 2021. Nearly 10 million doses must be administered every day to achieve this target. Last Monday saw over 8.6 million vaccinations. The daily rate has since fallen to the five to six million range.A cumulative vaccination deficit is ballooning as there are massive vaccine shortages. The government did not place timely and adequate orders, perhaps because of its “smart vaccination strategy” that did not entail universal vaccination as it announced to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health in October 2020. It was later dropped, heeding the advice of scientists to adopt universal vaccination.Cynical headline management and announcements without a detailed roadmap distract from crucial measures that the government needs to implement immediately to prevent devastation on the scale seen during the first two waves.The Congress, in contrast, continuously provided concrete policy suggestions, and party workers provided crucial relief throughout the pandemic. Recently, Rahul Gandhi released a comprehensive “White Paper on the Management of COVID-19 by the Government of India”, and suggested four pillars to undergird the government’s pandemic response going forward.The first pillar is to identify mistakes and correct course, which the white paper does by holding a mirror to the government about its management of the pandemic.The second pillar is to prepare for third and future waves by focusing on ramping up vaccination, health care infrastructure and genome sequencing. Free, universal vaccination must be implemented in mission mode, not used as opportunities for self-promotion. We need systematic processes that ensure that procurement and distribution happen transparently, efficiently and equitably. Critical errors such as announcing victory before containing the pandemic cannot be repeated.This also requires setting up oxygen beds, increasing testing capacity and availability of doctors and paramedics, especially in rural areas. We need extensive genome sequencing to keep track of emerging variants of concern, to provide early warnings and ensure rapid responses. Effective risk communication must convince people to observe safety measures continuously and overcome vaccine hesitancy.The third pillar recognises that Covid-19 is both a public health and an economic crisis. While the economy was on a downward spiral before Covid-19, the pandemic led to a severe contraction in FY 2020-21. Estimates suggest a sharp rise in poverty and unemployment, and a shrinking middle class. Loss of incomes will impact demand thus slowing down recovery. Economic assistance through cash transfers for the vulnerable is a moral imperative and makes economic sense. A minimum income guarantee scheme will provide succour to those hurt and boost demand. Such interventions, along with wage subsidies for micro, small and medium enterprises, will revive businesses and regenerate employment. The fourth pillar involves a Covid-19 compensation fund to assist families of those who succumbed. In March 2020, the Union government centralised the fight against the pandemic by invoking the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. It also notified ex-gratia relief but inexplicably reversed it within hours. The government must reinstitute relief of ₹4 lakh for bereaved families. India has the economic strength to do this. It will also help our country arrive at accurate assessments of the Covid-19 death toll, which has been tragically, perhaps deliberately, undercounted.A vibrant democracy requires the Opposition to hold the government accountable through constructive criticism of its policies. It also requires the government to be open to sound advice, whether it comes from experts or the Opposition. We are all together in this national mission to combat the pandemic. That is the essence of the white paper and the Congress’s constructive approach.MV Rajeev Gowda is chairman, AICC research department and a former Member of Parliament The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/a-roadmap-from-the-congress-four-pillars-to-fight-the-coronavirus-101624801758009.html
27-06-2021||Today's||For a fresh beginning in Jammu and Kashmir||They invited us... He is our prime minister, we have to trust him. We the people of Kashmir know it better than anybody else that dialogue is the best way... If you lose faith in the institution of dialogue, in a place like Kashmir, an alternative to it will be violence.” These are the words of Sajjad Lone, chairman of the Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference, after Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s all-party meet with leaders from Jammu and Kashmir on June 25. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader, Mehbooba Mufti, and the National Conference (NC) leader, Omar Abdullah, both former chief ministers (CMs), too found the talks positive and meaningful.It would seem that there was no other option for the 14 leaders of state’s political parties. Jammu and Kashmir’s residents may not have completely accepted of the loss of full statehood along with Article 370, but they too know that changing times call for changing resolutions.I say this based on my visit to the Kashmir Valley in March where I found that people are fed up with violence, and the young felt that this was crippling their chances at a normal life. At Tungmurg, Baramulla, a young man told me: “We know that nobody from another part of the country will come to purchase land in the Valley, but we need our statehood back and more job opportunities for local residents”. The Modi government had done a lot of preparatory work to implement its long-standing agenda. Let us go back two years. Mehbooba Mufti had lost her political heft when she formed a government with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). New parties in the Valley were waiting in the wings. Farooq Abdullah’s NC was arguably the strongest party on August 5, 2019, but the people of Jammu and Kashmir wanted something beyond these two families. This opened the doors for New Delhi to step in.New Delhi had also done its homework on the administrative front, and kept a sharp eye on the cultural plurality of the state. Barring the Hindu-majority areas of Jammu, the Gujjars in the border areas of Poonch and Rajouri had no sympathy for the conflict in the Valley. The minority Hindus in both these districts were also expressing their opinions in full force. In Kargil and the other scattered Shia settlements in the Valley, there never was any affinity with the Wahhabi-dominated separatists. The signal was clear that the situation could change for the better.The biggest challenge before the administration at that time were crowds gathering at the funerals of terrorists, a negative signal to the younger lot. The late Dineshwar Sharma, then the Centre’s interlocutor in Jammu and Kashmir, once asked a Kashmiri officer how to deal with this. The officer told Sharma that, often, even family members did not want funeral processions of their relatives killed in encounters. For this, graves could be prepared in relatively quiet places. If security forces were to kill a terrorist, he could be buried there with religious rituals in the presence of his family. This would both combine respect for religious sensitivities and family sentiments. This was done. And the result was palpable. Similarly, stone-pelting was also brought under control. The state police were given the freedom to deal with it, with a directive to find a long-term solution. Young pelters, they found, were being paid for this act. So, those who were paying this money were identified and picked up. A list of stone-pelters was made with the help of these people. Lookout posters of some of the hardcore pelters were pasted on the streets. As a result, most of them, who were not fundamentally extremist by nature, fled the Valley.About a year ago, Manoj Sinha was appointed to streamline the administration. He made his presence felt across the state, whether it was the replacement of power transformers during inclement weather in the Valley or other issues of public interest. Every week, he made an effort to boost public confidence by holding janata darbars (public courts) to convey that the government is there for the people’s service. This also helped overcome vaccine hesitancy.At the same time, there were other societal changes taking place. Many young people in Jammu and Kashmir were doing well in administrative examinations. This also made them feel that they could serve their people by becoming part of the power structure. That is why when the zilla parishad elections were announced, all the political parties participated, and the 51% voter turnout proved that Kashmiriyat believes in jamhooriyat (democracy). However, it is also a fact that fewer votes were cast in the Valley than in the Jammu region. Was this because of resistance or fear? Of course, it is too early to say that the situation is under control. In the early hours of Sunday, two explosions took place at an airport run by the Indian Air Force in Jammu, a high-security area. This shows how separatists are now banking on desperate measures to disturb normalcy. They are clearly agitated at the beginning of the political process after a significant reduction in terrorism-related incidents. They also have financed sporadic terror attacks on security forces and political activists to show their strength. Such elements are still employing the use of rumours to spread dissonance. Despite the ceasefire at the border, the role of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence can’t be ignored in nursing such outfits and individuals as we have seen Jammu-like incidents after almost every peace effort.The only way to deal with this is forming an elected government at the earliest and restoring full statehood. Hopefully, the dialogue in New Delhi will prove to be the change from Dilli ki doori (distance from Delhi) and dil ki doori (The distance from the heart) to something much closer. Kashmir has been waiting for a new dawn for a long time.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, Hindustan The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/for-a-fresh-beginning-in-jammu-and-kashmir-101624801750901.html
